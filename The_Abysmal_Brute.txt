the abysmal brute stubener was puzzled it seemed on the face of it a joke the men in the fighting game were notorious jokers and he tried to discern the fine hand of corbett or the big friendly paw of fitzsimmons in the screed before him but if it were genuine he knew it was worth looking into pat glendon was before his time though as a cub he had once seen old pat spar at the benefit for jack dempsey even then he was called old pat and had been out of the ring for years he had antedated sullivan in the old london prize ring rules though his last fading battles had been put up under the incoming marquis of queensbury rules what ringfollower did not know of pat glendon though few were alive who had seen him in his prime and there were not many more who had seen him at all yet his name had come down in the history of the ring and no sporting writers lexicon was complete without it his fame was paradoxical no man was honored higher and yet he had never attained championship honors he had been unfortunate and had been known as the unlucky fighter four times he all but won the heavyweight championship and each time he had deserved to win it there was the time on the barge in san francisco bay when at the moment he had the champion going he snapped his own forearm and on the island in the thames sloshing about in six inches of rising tide he broke a leg at a similar stage in a winning fight in texas too there was the nevertobeforgotten day when the police broke in just as he had his man going in all certainty and finally there was the fight in the mechanics pavilion in san francisco when he was secretly jobbed from the first by a gunfighting bad man of a referee backed by a small syndicate of bettors pat glendon had had no accidents in that fight but when he had knocked his man cold with a right to the jaw and a left to the solar plexus the referee calmly disqualified him for fouling every ringside witness every sporting expert and the whole sporting world knew there had been no foul yet like all fighters pat glendon had agreed to abide by the decision of the referee pat abided and accepted it as in keeping with the rest of his bad luck this was pat glendon what bothered stubener was whether or not pat had written the letter he carried it down town with him whats become of pat glendon such was his greeting to all the sports that morning nobody seemed to know some thought he must be dead but none knew positively the fight editor of a morning daily looked up the records and was able to state that his death had not been noted it was from tim donovan that he got a clue sure an he aint dead said donovan how could that be a man of his make that never boozed or blew himself he made money and whats more he saved it and invested it did nt he have three saloons at the time an wasnt he makin slathers of money with them when he sold out now that im thinkin that was the last time i laid eyes on him when he sold them out t was all of twenty years and more ago his wife had just died i met him headin for the ferry where away old sport says i its me for the woods says he ive quit goodby tim me boy and ive never seen him from that day to this of course he aint dead you say when his wife died did he have any children stubener queried one a little baby he was luggin it in his arms that very day was it a boy how should i be knowin it was then that sam stubener reached a decision and that night found him in a pullman speeding toward the wilds of northern california chapter ii stubener was dropped off the overland at deer lick in the early morning and he kicked his heels for an hour before the one saloon opened its doors no the saloonkeeper didnt know anything about pat glendon had never heard of him and if he was in that part of the country he must be out beyond somewhere neither had the one hangeron ever heard of pat glendon at the hotel the same ignorance obtained and it was not until the storekeeper and postmaster opened up that stubener struck the trail oh yes pat glendon lived out beyond you took the stage at alpine which was forty miles and which was a logging camp from alpine on horseback you rode up antelope valley and crossed the divide to bear creek pat glendon lived somewhere beyond that the people of alpine would know yes there was a young pat the storekeeper had seen him he had been in to deer lick two years back old pat had not put in an appearance for five years he bought his supplies at the store and always paid by check and he was a whitehaired strange old man that was all the storekeeper knew but the folks at alpine could give him final directions it looked good to stubener beyond doubt there was a young pat glendon as well as an old living out beyond that night the manager spent at the logging camp of alpine and early the following morning he rode a mountain cayuse up antelope valley he rode over the divide and down bear creek he rode all day through the wildest roughest country he had ever seen and at sunset turned up pinto valley on a trail so stiff and narrow that more than once he elected to get off and walk it was eleven oclock when he dismounted before a log cabin and was greeted by the baying of two huge deerhounds then pat glendon opened the door fell on his neck and took him in i knew yed come sam me boy said pat the while he limped about building a fire boiling coffee and frying a big bearsteak the young un aint home the night we was gettin short of meat and he went out about sundown to pick up a deer but ill say no more wait till ye see him hell be home in the morn and then you can try him out theres the gloves but wait till ye see him as for me im finished eightyone come next january an pretty good for an exbruiser but i never wasted meself sam nor kept late hours an burned the candle at all ends i had a damned good candle an made the most of it as youll grant at lookin at me and ive taught the same to the young un what do you think of a lad of twentytwo thats never had a drink in his life nor tasted tobacco thats him hes a giant and hes lived natural all his days wait till he takes you out after deer hell break your travelin light him a carryin the outfit and a big buck deer belike hes a child of the open air an winter nor summer has he slept under a roof the open for him as i taught him the one thing that worries me is how hell take to sleepin in houses an how hell stand the tobacco smoke in the ring tis a terrible thing that smoke when youre fighting hard an gaspin for air but no more sam me boy you re tired an sure should be sleepin wait till you see him thats all wait till you see him but the garrulousness of age was on old pat and it was long before he permitted stubeners eyes to close he can run a deer down with his own legs that young un he broke out again tis the dandy trainin for the lungs the hunters life he dont know much of else though hes read a few books at times an poetry stuff hes just plain pure natural as youll see when you clap eyes on him hes got the old irish strong in him sometimes the way he moons about its thinkin strong i am that he believes in the fairies and suchlike hes a nature lover if ever there was one an hes afeard of cities hes read about them but the biggest he was ever in was deer lick he misliked the many people and his report was that theyd stand weedin out that was two years agone the first and the last time hes seen a locomotive and a train of cars sometimes its wrong im thinkin i am bringin him up a natural its given him wind and stamina and the strength o wild bulls no citygrown man can have a lookin against him im willin to grant that jeffries at his best could a worried the young un a bit but only a bit the young un could a broke him like a straw an he dont look it thats the everlasting wonder of it hes only a fineseeming young husky but its the quality of his muscle thats different but wait till ye see him thats all a strange liking the boy has for posies an little meadows a bit of pine with the moon beyond windy sunsets or the sun o morns from the top of old baldy an he has a hankerin for the drawin o pitchers of things an of spouting about lucifer or night from the poetry books he got from the redheaded school teacher but tis only his youngness hell settle down to the game once we get him started but watch out for grouches when it first comes to livin in a city for him a good thing hes womanshy theyll not bother him for years he cant bring himself to understand the creatures an damn few of them has he seen at that twas the school teacher over at samsons flat that put the poetry stuff in his head she was clean daffy over the young un an he never aknowin a warmhaired girl she was not a mountain girl but from down in the flatlands an as time went by she was fair desperate an the way she went after him was shameless an what dye think the boy did when he tumbled to it he was scared as a jackrabbit he took blankets an ammunition an hiked for tall timber not for a month did i lay eyes on him an then he sneaked in after dark and was gone in the morn nor would he as much as peep at her letters burn em he said an burn em i did twice she rode over on a cayuse all the way from samsons flat an i was sorry for the young creature she was fair hungry for the boy and she looked it in her face an at the end of three months she gave up school an went back to her own country an then it was that the boy came home to the shack to live again women ha ben the ruination of many a good fighter but they wont be of him he blushes like a girl if anything young in skirts looks at him a second time or too long the first one an they all look at him but when he fights when he fights god its the old savage irish that flares in him an drives the fists of him not that he goes off his base dont walk away with that at my best i was never as cool as he i misdoubt twas the wrath of me that brought the accidents but hes an iceberg hes hot an cold at the one time a live wire in an icechest stubener was dozing when the old mans mumble aroused him he listened drowsily i made a man o him by god i made a man o him with the two fists of him an the upstanding legs of him an the straightseein eyes and i know the game in my head an ive kept up with the times and the modern changes the crouch sure he knows all the styles an economies he never moves two inches when an inch and a half will do the turn and when he wants he can spring like a buck kangaroo infightin wait till you see better than his outfightin and he could sure a sparred with peter jackson an outfooted corbett in his best i tell you ive taught m it all to the last trick and hes improved on the teachin hes a fair genius at the game an hes had plenty of husky mountain men to try out on i gave him the fancy work and they gave him the sloggin nothing shy or delicate about them roarin bulls an big grizzly bears thats what they are when it comes to huggin in a clinch or swingin roughlike in the rushes an he plays with em man dye hear me he plays with them like you an me would play with little puppydogs another time stubener awoke to hear the old man mumbling tis the funny think he dont take fightin seriously its that easy to him he thinks it play but wait till hes tapped a swift one thats all wait an youll seem throw on the juice in that cold storage plant of his an turn loose the prettiest scientific wallopin that ever you laid eyes on in the shivery gray of mountain dawn stubener was routed from his blankets by old pat hes comin up the trail now was the hoarse whisper out with ye an take your first peep at the biggest fightin man the ring has ever seen or will ever see in a thousand years again the manager peered through the open door rubbing the sleep from his heavy eyes and saw a young giant walk into the clearing in one hand was a rifle across his shoulders a heavy deer under which he moved as if it were weightless he was dressed roughly in blue overalls and woolen shirt open at the throat coat he had none and on his feet instead of brogans were moccasins stubener noted that his walk was smooth and catlike without suggestion of his two hundred and twenty pounds of weight to which that of the deer was added the fight manager was impressed from the first glimpse formidable the young fellow certainly was but the manager sensed the strangeness and unusualness of him he was a new type something different from the run fighters he seemed a creature of the wild more a nightroaming figure from some old fairy story or folk tale than a twentiethcentury youth a thing stubener quickly discovered was that young pat was not much of a talker he acknowledged old pats introduction with a grip of the hand but without speech and silently set to work at building the fire and getting breakfast to his fathers direct questions he answered in monosyllables as for instance when asked where he had picked up the deer south fork was all he vouchsafed eleven miles across the mountains the old man exposited pridefully to stubener an a trail thatd break your heart breakfast consisted of black coffee sourdough bread and an immense quantity of bearmeat broiled over the coals of this the young fellow ate ravenously and stubener divined that both the glendons were accustomed to an almost straight meat diet old pat did all the talking though it was not till the meal was ended that he broached the subject he had at heart pat boy he began you know who the gentleman is young pat nodded and cast a quick comprehensive glance at the manager well hell be takin you away with him and down to san francisco id sooner stay here dad was the answer stubener felt a prick of disappointment it was a wild goose chase after all this was no fighter eager and fretting to be at it his huge brawn counted for nothing it was nothing new it was the big fellows that usually had the streak of fat but old pats celtic wrath flared up and his voice was harsh with command youll go down to the cities an fight me boy thats what ive trained you for an youll do it all right was the unexpected response rumbled apathetically from the deep chest and fight like hell the old man added again stubener felt disappointment at the absence of flash and fire in the young mans eyes as he answered all right when do we start oh sam here hell be wantin a little huntin and to fish a bit as well as to try you out with the gloves he looked at sam who nodded suppose you strip and givem a taste of your quality an hour later sam stubener had his eyes opened an exfighter himself a heavyweight at that he was even a better judge of fighters and never had he seen one strip to like advantage see the softness of him old pat chanted tis the true stuff look at the slope of the shoulders an the lungs of him clean all clean to the last drop an ounce of him youre lookin at a man sam the like of which was never seen before not a muscle of him bound no weightlifter or sandow exercise artist there see the fat snakes of muscle acrawlin soft an lazylike wait till you see them flashin like a strikin rattler hes good for forty rounds this blessed instant or a hundred go to it time they went to it for threeminute rounds with a minute rests and sam stubener was immediately undeceived here was no streak of fat no apathy only a lazy goodnatured play of gloves and tricks with a brusk stiffness and harsh sharpness in the contacts that he knew belonged only to the trained and instinctive fighting man easy now easy old pat warned sams not the man he used to be this nettled sam as it was intended to do and he played his most famous trick and favorite punch a feint for a clinch and a right rip to the stomach but quickly as it was delivered young pat saw it and though it landed his body was going away the next time his body did not go away as the rip started he moved forward and twisted his left hip to meet it it was only a matter of several inches yet it blocked the blow and thereafter try as he would stubeners glove got no farther than that hip stubener had roughed it with big men in his time and in exhibition bouts had creditably held his own but there was no holding his own here young pat played with him and in the clinches made him feel as powerful as a baby landing on him seemingly at will locking and blocking masterful accuracy and scarcely noticing or acknowledging his existence half the time young pat seemed to spend in gazing off and out at the landscape in a dreamy sort of way and right here stubener made another mistake he took it for a trick of old pats training tried to sneak in a shortarm jolt found his arm in a lightning lock and had both his ears cuffed for his pains the instinct for a blow the old man chortled tis not put on im tellin you he is a wiz he knows a blow without the lookin when it starts an where the speed an space an niceness of it an tis nothing i ever showed him tis inspiration he was so born once in a clinch the fight manager heeled his glove on young pats mouth and there was just a hint of viciousness in the manner of doing it a moment later in the next clinch sam received the heel of the others glove on his own mouth there was nothing snappy about it but the pressure stolidly lazy as it was put his head back till the joints cracked and for a moment he thought his neck was broken he slacked his body and dropped his arms in token that the bout was over felt the instant release and staggered clear hell hell do he gasped looking the admiration he lacked the breath to utter old pats eyes were brightly moist with pride and triumph an what will you be thinkin to happen when some of the gay an ugly ones tries to rough it on him he asked hell kill them sure was stubeners verdict no hes too cool for that but hell just hurt them some for their dirtiness lets draw up the contract said the manager wait till you know the whole worth of him old pat answered tis strong terms ill be makin you come to go for a deerhunt with the boy over the hills an learn the lungs and the legs of him then well sign up ironclad and regular stubener was gone two days on that hunt and he learned all and more than old pat had promised and came back a weary and very humble man the young fellows innicence of the world had been startling to the casehardened manager but he had found him nobodys fool virgin though his mind was untouched by all save a narrow mountain experience nevertheless he had proved possession of a natural keeness and shrewdness far beyond the average in a way he was a mystery to sam who could not understand terrible equanimity of temper nothing ruffled him or worried him and his patience was of an enduring primitiveness he never swore not even the futile and emasculated cussing words of sissyboys id swear all right if i wanted to he had explained when challenged by his companion but i guess ive never come to needing it when i do ill swear i suppose old pat resolutely adhering to his decision said goodby at the cabin it wont be long pat boy when ill be readin about you in the papers id like to go along but im afeard its me for the mountains till the end and then drawing the manager aside the old man turned loose on him almost savagely remember what ive ben tellin ye over an over the boys clean an hes honest he knows nothing of the rottenness of the game i kept it all away from him i tell you he dont know the meanin of fake he knows only the bravery an romance an glory of fightin and ive filled him up with tales of the old ring heroes though little enough god knows its set him afire man man im tellin you that i clipped the fight columns from the newspapers to keep it way from him him athinkin i was wantin them for me scrap book he dont know a man ever lay down or threw a fight so dont turn the boys stomach thats why i put in the null and void clause the first rottenness and the contracts broke of itself no snide division of stakemoney no secret arrangements with the movin pitcher men for guaranteed distance theres slathers o money for the both of you but play it square or you lose understand and whatever youll be doin watch out for the women was old pats parting admonishment young pat astride his horse and reining in dutifully to hear women is death an damnation remember that but when you do find the one the only one hang on to her shell be worth more than glory an money but first be sure an when youre sure dont let her slip through your fingers grab her with the two hands of you and hang on hang on if all the world goes to smash an smithereens pat boy a good woman is a good woman tis the first word and last chapter iii once in san francisco sam stubeners troubles began not that young pat had a nasty temper or was grouchy as his father had feared on the contrary he was phenomenally sweet and mild but he was homesick for his beloved mountains also he was secretly appalled by the city though he trod its roaring streets imperturbable as a red indian i came down here to fight he announced at the end of the first week wheres jim hanford stubener whistled a big champion like him wouldnt look at you was his answer go and get a reputation is what hed say i can lick him but the public doesnt know that if you licked him youd be champion of the world and no champion ever became so with his first fight i can but the public doesnt know it pat it wouldnt come to see you fight and its the crowd that brings the money and the big purses thats why jim hanford wouldnt consider you for a second thered be nothing in it for him besides hes getting three thousand a week right now in vaudeville with a contract for twentyfive weeks do you think hed chuck that for a go with a man no one ever heard of youve got to do something first make a record youve got to begin on the little local dubs that nobody ever heard of guys like chub collins roughhouse kelly and the flying dutchman when youve put them away youre only started on the first round of the ladder but after that youll go up like a balloon ill meet those three named in the same ring one after the other was pats decision make the arrangements accordingly stubener laughed whats wrong dont you think i can put them away i know you can stubener assured him but it cant be arranged that way youve got to take them one at a time besides remember i know the game and im managing you this proposition has to be worked up and im the boy that knows how if were lucky you may get to the top in a couple of years and be the champion with a mint of money pat sighed at the prospect then brightened up and after that i can retire and go back home to the old man he said stubener was about to reply but checked himself strange as was this championship material he felt confident that when the top was reached it would prove very similar to that of all the others who had gone before besides two years was a long way off and there was much to be done in the meantime when pat fell to moping around his quarters reading endless poetry books and novels drawn from the public library stubener sent him off to live on a contra costa ranch across the bay under the watchful eye of spider walsh at the end of a week spider whispered that the job was a cinch his charge was away and over the hills from dawn till dark whipping the streams for trout shooting quail and rabbits and pursuing the one lone and crafty buck famous for having survived a decade of hunters it was the spider who waxed lazy and fat while his charge kept himself in condition as stubener expected his unknown was laughed at by the fight club managers were not the woods full of unknowns who were always breaking out with championship rashes a preliminary say of four rounds yes they would grant him that but the main event never stubener was resolved that young pat should make his dр в рв р вђрв р в р вђ р рр вђљрўвђєр рр вђљрірсљbut in nothing less than a main event and by the prestige of his own name he at last managed it with much misgiving the mission club agreed that pat glendon could go fifteen rounds with roughhouse kelly for a purse of one hundred dollars it was the custom of young fighters to assume the names of old ring heroes so no one suspected that he was the son of the great pat glendon while stubener held his peace it was a good press surprise package to spring later came the night of the fight after a month of waiting stubeners anxiety was keen his professional reputation was staked that his man would make a showing and he was astounded to see pat seated in his corner a bare five minutes lose the healthy color from his cheeks which turned a sickly yellow cheer up boy stubener said slapping him on the shoulder the first time in the ring is always strange and kelly has a way of letting his opponent wait for him on the chance of getting stagefright it isnt that pat answered its the tobacco smoke im not used to it and its making me fair sick his manager experienced the quick shock of relief a man who turned sick from mental causes even if he were a samson could never win to place in the prize ring as for tobacco smoke the youngster would have to get used to it that was all young pats entrance into the ring had been met with silence but when roughhouse kelly crawled through the ropes his greeting was uproarious he did not belie his name he was a ferociouslooking man black and hairy with huge knotty muscles weighing a full two hundred pounds pat looked across at him curiously and received a savage scowl after both had been introduced to the audience they shook hands and even as their gloves gripped kelly ground his teeth convulsed his face with an expression of rage and muttered youve got yer nerve wid yeh he flung pats hand roughly from his and hissed ill eat yeh up ye pup the audience laughed at the action and it guessed hilariously at what kelly must have said back in his corner and waiting the gong pat turned to stubener why is he angry with me he asked he aint stubener answered thats his way trying to scare you its just mouthfighting it isnt boxing was pats comment and stubener with a quick glance noted that his eyes were as mildly blue as ever be careful the manager warned as the gong for the first round sounded and pat stood up hes liable to come at you like a maneater and like a maneater kelly did come at him rushing across the ring in wild fury pat who in his easy way had advanced only a couple of paces gauged the others momentum sidestepped and brought his stiffarched right across to the jaw then he stood and looked on with a great curiosity the fight was over kelly had fallen like a stricken bullock to the floor and there he lay without movement while the referee bending over him shouted the ten seconds in his unheeding ear when kellys seconds came to lift him pat was before them gathering the huge inert bulk of the man in his arms he carried him to his corner and deposited him on the stool and in the arms of his seconds half a minute later kellys head lifted and his eyes wavered open he looked about him stupidly and then to one of his seconds what happened he queried hoarsely did the roof fall on me chapter iv as a result of his fight with kelly though the general opinion was that he had won by a fluke pat was matched with rufe mason this took place three weeks later and the sierra club audience at dreamland rink failed to see what happened rufe mason was a heavyweight noted locally for his cleverness when the gong for the first round sounded both men met in the center of the ring neither rushed nor did they strike a blow they felt around each other their arms bent their gloves so close together that they almost touched this lasted for perhaps five seconds then it happened and so quickly that not one in a hundred of the audience saw rufe mason made a feint with his right it was obviously not a real feint but a feeler a mere tenative threatening of a possible blow it was at this instant that pat losed his punch so close together were they that the distance the blow traveled was a scant eight inches it was a shortarm left jolt and it was acccomplished by a twist of the left forearm and a thrust of the shoulder it landed flush on the point of the chin and the astounded audience saw rufe masons legs crumple under him as his body sank to the floor but the referee had seen and he promptly proceeded to count him out again pat carried his opponent to his corner and it was ten minutes before rufe mason supported by his seconds with sagging knees and rolling glassy eyes was able to move down the aisle through the stupified and incredulous audience on the way to his dressing room no wonder he told a reporter that roughhouse kelly thought the roof hit him after chub collins had been put out in the twelfth second of the first round of a fifteenround contest stubener felt compelled to speak to pat do you know what theyre calling you now he asked pat shook his head one punch glendon pat smiled politely he was little interested in what he was called he had certain work cut out which he must do ere he could win back his mountains and he was phlegmatically doing it that was all it wont do his manager continued with an ominous shake of the head you cant go on putting your men out so quickly you must give them more time im here to fight aint i pat demanded in surprise again stubener shook his head its this way pat youve got to be big and generous in the fighting game dont get all the other fighters sore and its not fair to the audience they want a run for their money besides no one will fight you theyll all be scared out and you cant draw crowds with tensecond fights i leave it to you would you pay a dollar or five to see a tensecond fight pat was convinced and he promised to give the audiences the requisite run for their money though he stated that personally he preferred going fishing to witnessing a hundred rounds of fighting and still pat had got practically nowhere in the game the local sports laughed when his name was mentioned it called to mind funny fights and roughhouse kellys remark about the roof nobody knew how pat could fight they had never seen him where was his wind his stamina his ability to mix it with rough customers through long grueling contests he had demonstrated nothing but the posession of a lucky punch and a depressing proclivity for flukes so it was that his fourth match was arranged with pete sosso a portuguese fighter from butchertown known only for the amazing tricks he played in the ring pat did not train for the fight instead he made a flying and sorrowful trip to the mountains to bury his father old pat had known well the condition of his heart and it had stopped suddenly on him young pat arrived back in san francisco with so close a margin of time that he changed into his fighting togs directly from his traveling suit and even then the audience was kept waiting ten minutes remember give him a chance stubener cautioned him as he climbed through the ropes play with him but do it seriously let him go ten or twelve rounds then get him pat obeyed instructions and thought it would have been easy enough to put sosso out so tricky was he that to stand up to him and not put him out kept his hands full it was a pretty exhibition and the audience was delighted sossos whirlwind attacks wild feints retreats and rushes required all pats science to protect himself and even then he did not escape unscathed stubener praised him in the minuterests and all would have been well had not sosso in the fourth round played one of his most spectacular tricks pat in a mixup had landed a hook to sossos jaw when to his amazement the latter dropped his hands and reeled backward eyes rolling legs bending and giving in a high state of grogginess pat could not understand it had not been a knockout blow and yet there was his man all ready to fall to the mat pat dropped his own hands and wonderingly watched his reeling opponent sosso staggered away almost fell recovered and staggered obliquely and blindly forward again for the first and the last time in his fighting career pat was caught off his guard he actually stepped aside to let the reeling man go by still reeling sosso suddenly loosed his right pat received it full on his jaw with an impact that rattled his teeth a great roar of delight went up from the audience but pat did not hear he saw only sosso before him grinning and defiant and not the least bit groggy pat was hurt by the blow but vastly more outraged by the trick all the wrath that his father ever had surged up in him he shook his head as if to get rid of the shock of the blow and steadied himself before his man it all occurred in the next second with a feint that drew his opponent pat fetched his left to the solar plexus almost at the same instant whipping his right across to the jaw the latter blow landed on sossos mouth ere his falling body struck the floor the club doctors worked half an hour to bring him to after that they put eleven stitches in his mouth and packed him off in an ambulance im sorry pat told his manager im afraid i lost my temper ill never do it again in the ring dad always cautioned me about it he said it had made him lose more than one battle i didnt know i could lose my temper that way but now that i know ill keep it in control and stubener believed him he was coming to the stage where he could believe anything about his young charge you dont need to get angry he said youre so thoroughly the master of your man at any stage at any inch or second of the fight pat affirmed and you can put them out any time you want sure i can i dont want to boast but i just seem to possess the ability my eyes show me the opening that my skill knows how to make and time and distance are second nature to me dad called it a gift but i thought he was blarneying me now that ive been up against these men i guess he was right he said i had the mind and muscle correlation at any inch or second of the fight stubener repeated musingly pat nodded and stubener absolutely believing him caught a vision of a golden future that should have fetched old pat out of his grave well dont forget weve got to give the crowd a run for its money he said well fix it up between us how many rounds a fight should go now your next bout will be with the flying dutchman suppose you let it run the full fifteen and put him out in the last round that will give you a chance to make a showing as well all right sam was the answer it will be a test for you stubener warned you may fail to put him out in that last round watch me pat paused to put weight to his promise and picked up a volume of longfellow if i dont ill never read poetry again and thats going some you bet it is his manager proclaimed jubilantly though what you see in such stuff is beyond me pat sighed but did not reply in all his life he had found but one person who cared for poetry and that had been the redhaired school teacher who scared him off into the woods chapter v where are you going stubener demanded in surprise looking at his watch pat with his hand on the doorknob paused and turned around to the academy of sciences he said theres a professor whos going to give a lecture there on browning tonight and browning is the sort of writer you need assistance with sometimes i think i ought to go to night school but great scott man exclaimed the horrified manager youre on with the flying dutchman tonight i know it but i wont enter the ring a moment before half past nine or quarter to ten the lecture will be over at nine fifteen if you want to make sure come around and pick me up in your machine stubener shrugged his shoulders helplessly youve got no kick coming pat assured him dad used to tell me a mans worst time was in the hours just before a fight and that many a fight was lost by a mans breaking down right there with nothing to do but think and be anxious well youll never need to worry about me that way you ought to be glad i can go off to a lecture and later that night in the course of watching fifteen splendid rounds stubener chuckled to himself more than once at the idea of what that audience of sports would think did it know that this magnificent young prizefighter had come to the ring directly from a browning lecture the flying dutchman was a young swede who possessed an unwonted willingness to fight and who was blessed with phenomenal endurance he never rested was always on the offensive and rushed and fought from gong to gong in the outfighting his arms whirled about like flails in the infighting he was forever shouldering or halfwrestling and starting blows whenever he could get a hand free from start to finish he was a whirlwind hence his name his flailing was lack of judgement in time and distance nevertheless he had won many fights by virtue of landing one in each dozen or so of the unending fusillades of punches he delivered pat with strong upon him the caution that he must not put his opponent out was kept busy nor though he escaped vital damage could he avoid entirely those eternal flying gloves but it was good training and in a mild way he enjoyed the contest could you get him now stubener whispered in his ear during the minute rest at the end of the fifth round sure was pats answer you know hes never yet been knocked out by any one stubener warned a couple seconds later then im afraid ill have to break my knuckles pat smiled i know the punch ive got in me and when i land it somethings got to go if he wont my knuckles will do you think you could get him now stubener asked at the end of the thirteenth round any time i tell you well then pat let him run to the fifteenth in the fourteenth round the flying dutchman exceeded himself at the stroke of the gong he rushed clear across the ring to the opposite corner where pat was leisurely getting to his feet the house cheered for it knew the flying dutchman had cut loose pat catching the fun of it whimsically decided to meet the terrific onslaught with a wholly passive defense and not to strike a blow nor did he strike a blow nor feint a blow during the three minutes of whirlwind that followed he gave a rare exhibition of stalling sometimes hugging his bowed face with his left arm his abdomen with his right at other times changing as the point of attack changed so that both gloves were held on either side his face or both elbows and forearms guarded his midsection and all the time moving about clumsily shouldering or halffalling forward against his opponent and clogging his efforts himself never striking nor threatening to strike the while rocking with the impacts of the storming blows that beat upon his various guards the devils own tattoo those close at the ringside saw and appreciated but the rest of the audience fooled arose to its feet and roared its applause in the mistaken notion that pat helpless was receiving a terrible beating with the end of the round the audience dumbfounded sank back into its seats as pat walked steadily to his corner it was not understandable he should have been beaten to a pulp and yet nothing happened to him now are you going to get him stubener queried anxiously inside ten seconds was pats confident assertion watch me there was no trick about it when the gong struck and pat bounded to his feet he advertised it unmistakenly that for the first time in the fight he was starting after his man not one onlooker misunderstood the flying dutchman read the advertisement too and for the first time in his career as they met in the center of the ring visibly hesitated for the fraction of a second they faced each other in position then the flying dutchman leaped forward upon his man and pat with a timed rightcross dropped him cold as he leaped it was after this battle that pat glendon started on his upward rush to fame the sports and the sporting writers took him up for the first time the flying dutchman had been knocked out his conqueror had proved a wizard of defense his previous victories had not been flukes he had a kick in both his hands giant that he was he would go far the time was already past the writers asserted for him to waste himself on the thirdraters and chopping blocks where were ben menzies rege rede bill tarwater and ernest lawson it was time for them to meet this young cub that had suddenly shown himself a fighter of quality where was his manager anyway that he was not issuing the challenges and then fame came in a day for stubener divulged the secret that his man was none other than the son of pat glendon old pat the oldtime ring hero young pat glendon he was promptly christened and sports and writers flocked about him to admire him and back him and write him up beginning with ben menzies and finishing with bill tarwater he challenged fought and knocked out the four secondraters to do this he was compelled to travel the battles taking place in goldfield denver texas and new york to accomplish it required months for the bigger fights were not easily arranged and the men themselves demanded more time for training the second year saw him running to cover and disposing of the halfdozen big fighters that clustered just beneath the top of the heavyweight ladder on this top firmly planted stood big jim hanford the undefeated world champion here on the top rungs progress was slower though stubener was indefatigable in issuing challenges and in promoting sporting opinion to force the man to fight will king was disposed of in england and glendon pursued tom harrison half way around the world to defeat him on boxing day in australia but the purses grew larger and larger in place of a hundred dollars such as his first battles had earned him he was now receiving from twenty to thirty thousand dollars a fight as well as equally large sums from the moving picture men stubener took his managers percentage of all this according to the terms of the contract old pat had drawn up and both he and glendon despite their heavy expenses were waxing rich this was due more than anything else to the clean lives they lived they were not wasters stubener was attracted to real estate and his holdings in san francisco consisting of building flats and apartment houses were bigger than glendon ever dreamed there was a secret syndicate of bettors however which could have made an accurate guess at the size of stubeners holdings while heavy bonus after heavy bonus of which glendon never heard was paid over to his manager by the moving picture men stubeners most serious task was in maintaining the innocence of his young gladiator nor did he find it difficult glendon who had nothing to do with the business end was little interested besides wherever his travels took him he spent his spare time in hunting and fishing he rarely mingled with those of the sporting world was notoriously shy and secluded and preferred art galleries and books of verse to sporting gossip also his trainers and sparring partners were rigorously instructed by the manager to keep their tongues away from the slightest hints of ring rottenness in every way stubener intervened between glendon and the world he was never even interviewed save in stubeners presence only once was glendon approached it was just prior to his battle with henderson and an offer of a hundred thousand was made to him to throw the fight it was made hurriedly in swift whispers in a hotel corridor and it was fortunate for the man that pat controlled his temper and shouldered past him without reply he brought the tale of it to stubener who said its only con pat they were trying to josh you he noted the blue eyes blaze and maybe worse than that if they could have got you to fall for it there might have been a big sensation in the papers that would have finished you but i doubt it such things dont happen any more its a myth thats what it is that has come down from the middle history of the ring there has been rottenness in the past but no fighter or manager of reputation would dare anything of the sort today why pat the men in the game are as clean and straight as those in professional baseball than which there is nothing cleaner or straighter and all the while he talked stubener knew in his heart that the forthcoming fight with henderson was not to be shorter than twelve rounds this for the moving pictures and not longer than the fourteenth round and he knew furthermore so big were the stakes involved that henderson himself was pledged not to last beyond the fourteenth and glendon never approached again dismissed the matter from his mind and went out to spend the afternoon in taking color photographs the camera had become his latest hobby loving pictures yet unable to paint he had compromised by taking up photography in his hand baggage was one grip packed with books on the subject and he spent long hours in the dark room realizing for himself the various processes never had there been a great fighter who was as aloof from the fighting world as he because he had little to say with those he encountered he was called sullen and unsocial and out of this a newspaper reputation took form that was not an exaggeration so much as it was an entire misconception boiled down his character in print was that of an oxmuscled and dumbly stupid brute and one callow sporting writer dubbed him the abysmal brute the name stuck the rest of the fraternity hailed it with delight and thereafter glendons name never appeared in print unconnected with it often in a headline or under a photograph the abysmal brute capitalized and without quotation marks appeared alone all the world knew who was this brute this made him draw into himself closer than ever while it developed a bitter prejudice against newspaper folk regarding fighting itself his earlier mild interest grew stronger the men he now fought were anything but dubs and victory did not come so easily they were picked men experienced ring generals and each battle was a problem there were occasions when he found it impossible to put them out in any designated later round of a fight thus with sulzberger the gigantic german try as he would in the eighteenth round he failed to get him in the nineteenth it was the same story and not till the twentieth did he manage to break through the baffling guard and drop him glendons increasing enjoyment of the game was accompanied by severer and prolonged training never dissipating spending much of his time on hunting trips in the hills he was practically always in the pink of condition and unlike his father no unfortunate accidents marred his career he never broke a bone nor injured so much as a knuckle one thing that stubener noted with secret glee was that his young fighter no longer talked of going permanently back to his mountains when he had won the championship away from jim hanford chapter vi the consummation of his career was rapidly approaching the great champion had even publicly intimated his readiness to take on glendon as soon as the latter had disposed of the three or four aspirants for the championship who intervened in six months pat managed to put away kid mcgrath and philadelphia jack mcbride and there remained only nat powers and tom cannam and all would have been well had not a certain society girl gone adventuring into journalism and had not stubener agreed to an interview with the woman reporter of the san francisco courierjournal her work was always published over the name of maud sangster which by the way was her own name the sangsters were a notoriously wealthy family the founder old jacob sangster had packed his blankets and worked as a farmhand in the west he had discovered an inexhaustible borax deposit in nevada and from hauling it out by muleteams had built a railroad to do the freighting following that he had poured the profits of borax into the purchase of hundreds and thousands of square miles of timber lands in california oregon and washington still later he had combined politics with business bought statesmen judges and machines and become a captain of complicated industry and after that he died full of honor and pessimism leaving his name a muddy blot for future historians to smudge and also leaving a matter of a couple of hundreds of millions for his four sons to squabble over the legal industrial and political battles that followed vexed and amused california for a generation and culminated in deadly hatred and unspeaking terms between the four sons the youngest theodore in middle life experienced a change of heart sold out his stock farms and racing stables and plunged into a fight with all the corrupt powers of his native state including most of its millionaires in a quixotic attempt to purge it of the infamy which had been implanted by old jacob sangster maud sangster was theodores oldest daughter the sangster stock uniformly bred fighters among the men and beauties among the women nor was maud an exception also she must have inherited some of the virus of adventure from the sangster breed for she had come to womanhood and done a multitude of things of which no woman in her position should have been guilty a match in ten thousand she remained unmarried she had sojourned in europe without bringing home a nobleman for spouse and had declined a goodly portion of her own set at home she had gone in for outdoor sports won the tennis championship of the state kept the society weeklies agog with her unconventionalities walked from san mateo to santa cruz against time on a wager and once caused a sensation by playing polo in a mens team at a private burlingame practice game incidentally she had gone in for art and maintained a studio in san franciscos latin quarter all this had been of little moment until her fathers reform attack became acute passionately independent never yet having met the man to whom she could gladly submit and bored by those who had aspired she resented her fathers interference with her way of life and put the climax on all her social misdeeds by leaving home and going to work on the courierjournal beginning at twenty dollars a week her salary had swiftly risen to fifty her work was principally musical dramatic and art criticism though she was not above mere journalistic stunts if they promised to be suffciently interesting thus she scooped the big interview with morgan at a time when he was being futilely trailed by a dozen new york star journalists went down to the bottom of the golden gate in a divers suit and flew with rood the bird man when he broke all records of continuous flight by reaching as far as riverside now it must not be imagined that maud sangster was a hardbitten amazon on the contrary she was grayeyed slender young woman of three or four and twenty of medium stature and possessing uncommonly small hands and feet for an outdoor woman or any other kind of women she knew how to be daintly feminine it was on her own suggestion that she received the editors commission to interview pat glendon with the exception of having caught a glimpse once of bob fitzsimmons in evening dress at the palace grill she had never seen a prizefighter in her life nor was she curious to see one at least she had not been curious until young pat glendon came to san francisco to train for his fight with nat powers then his newspaper reputation had aroused her the abysmal brute it certainly must be worth seeing from what she read of him she gleaned that he was a manmonster profoundly stupid and with the sullenness and ferocity of a jungle beast true his published photographs did not show all that but they did show the hugeness of brawn that might be expected to go with it and so accompanied by a staff photographer she went out to the training quarters at the cliff house at the hour appointed by stubener that real estate owner was having trouble pat was rebellious he sat one big leg dangling over the side of the arm chair and shakespeares sonnets face downward on his knee orating against the new woman what do they want to come butting into the game for he demanded its not their place what do they know about it anyway the men are bad enough as it is im not a holy show this womans coming here to make me one i never have stood for women around the training quarters and i dont care if she is a reporter but shes not an ordinary reporter stubener interposed youve heard of the sangsters the millionaires pat nodded well shes one of them shes high society and all that stuff she could be running with the blingum crowd now if she wanted to instead of working for wages her old mans worth fifty millions if hes worth a cent then whats she working on a paper for keeping some poor devil out of a job she and the old man fell out had a tiff or something about the time he started to clean up san francisco she quit thats all left home and got a job and let me tell you one thing pat she can everlastingly sling english there isnt a penpusher on the coast can touch her when she gets going pat began to show interest and stubener hurried on she writes poetry too the regular ladedah stuff just like you only i guess hers is better because she published a whole book of it once and she writes up the shows she interviews every big actor that hits this burg ive seen her name in the papers pat commented sure you have and youre honored pat by her coming to interview you it wont bother you any ill stick right by and give her most of the dope myself you know ive always done that pat looked his gratitude and another thing pat dont forget youve got to put up with this interviewing its part of your business its big advertising and it comes free we cant buy it it interests people draws the crowds and its crowds that pile up the gate receipts he stopped and listened then looked at his watch i think thats her now ill go and get her and bring her in ill tip it off to her to cut it short you know and it wont take long he turned in the doorway and be decent pat dont shut up like a clam talk a bit to her when she asks you questions pat put the sonnets on the table took up a newspaper and was apparently deep in its contents when the two entered the room and he stood up the meeting was a mutual shock when blue eyes met gray it was almost as if the man and the woman shouted triumphantly to each other as if each had found something sought and unexpected but this was for the instant only each had anticipated in the other something so totally different that the next moment the clear cry of recognition gave way to confusion as is the way of women she was the first to achieve control and she did it without having given any outward sign that she had ever lost it she advanced most of the distance across the floor to meet glendon as for him he scarcely knew how he stumbled through the introduction here was a woman a woman he had not known that such a creature could exist the few women he had noticed had never prefigured this he wondered what old pats judgment would have been of her if she was the sort he had recommended to hang on to with both his hands he discovered that in some way he was holding her hand he looked at it curious and fascinated marveling at its fragility she on the other hand had proceeded to obliterate the echoes of that first clear call it had been a peculiar experience that was all this sudden outrush of her toward this strange man for was not he the abysmal brute of the prizering the great fighting stupid bulk of a male animal who hammered up his fellow males of the same stupid order she smiled at the way he continued to hold her hand ill have it back please mr glendon she said i i really need it you know he looked at her blankly followed her gaze to her imprisoned hand and dropped it in a rush of awkwardness that sent the blood in a manifest blush to his face she noted the blush and the thought came to her that he did not seem quite the uncouth brute she had pictured she could not conceive of a brute blushing anything and also she found herself pleased with the fact that he lacked the easy glibness to murmur an apology but the way he devoured her with his eyes was disconcerting he stared at her as if in a trance while his cheeks flushed even more redly stubener by this time had fetched a chair for her and glendon automatically sank down into his hes in fine shape miss sangster in fine shape the manager was saying thats right isnt it pat never felt better in your life glendon was bothered by this his brows contracted in a troubled way and he made no reply ive wanted to meet you for a long time mr glendon miss sangster said i never interviewed a pugilist before so if i dont go about it expertly youll forgive me i am sure maybe youd better start in by seeing him in action was the managers suggestion while hes getting into his fighting togs i can tell you a lot about him fresh stuff too well call in walsh pat and go a couple of rounds well do nothing of the sort glendon growled roughly in just the way an abysmal brute should go ahead with the interview the business went ahead unsatisfactorily stubener did most of the talking and suggesting which was sufficient to irritate maud sangster while pat volunteered nothing she studied his fine countenance the eyes clear blue and wide apart the wellmodeled almost aquiline nose the firm chaste lips that were sweet in a masculine way in their curl at the corners and that gave no hint of any sullenness it was a baffling personality she concluded if what the papers said of him was so in vain she sought for earmarks of the brute and in vain she attempted to establish contacts for one thing she knew too little about prizefighters and the ring and whenever she opened up a lead it was promptly snatched away by the informationoozing stubener it must be most interesting this life of a pugilist she said once adding with a sigh i wish i knew more about it tell me why do you fight oh aside for money reasons this latter to forestall stubener do you enjoy fighting are you stirred by it by pitting yourself against other men i hardly know how to express what i mean so you must be patient with me pat and stubener began speaking together but for once pat bore his manager down i didnt care for it at first you see it was to dead easy for him stubener interrupted but later pat went on when i encountered the better fighters the real big clever ones where i was more on the mettle she suggested yes thats it more on my mettle i found i did care for it a great deal in fact but still its not so absorbing to me as it might be you see while each battle is a sort of problem which i must work out with my wits and muscle yet to me the issue is never in doubt hes never had a fight go to a decision stubener proclaimed hes won every battle by the knockout route and it s this certainty of the outcome that robs it of what i imagine must be its finest thrills pat concluded maybe youll get some of them thrills when you go against jim hanford said the manager pat smiled but did not speak tell me some more she urged more about the way you feel when you are fighting and then pat amazed his manager miss sangster and himself by blurting out it seems to me i dont want to talk with you on such things it s as if there are things more important for you and me to talk about i he stopped abruptly aware of what he was saying but unaware of why he was saying it yes she cried eagerly that s it that is what makes a good interview the real personality you know but pat remained tonguetied and stubener wandered away on a statistical comparison of his champions weights measurments and expansions with those of sandow the terrible turk jeffries and the other modern strong men this was of little interest to maud sangster and she showed that she was bored her eyes chanced to rest on the sonnets she picked the book up and glanced inquiringly at stubener thats pats he said he goes in for that kind of stuff and color photography and art exhibits and such things but for heavens sake dont publish anything about it it would ruin his reputation she looked accusingly at glendon who immediately became awkward to her it was delicious a shy young man with the body of a giant who was one of the kings of bruisers and who read poetry and went to art exhibits and experimented with color photography of a surety there was no abysmal brute here his very shyness she divined now was due to sensitiveness and not stupidity shakespeares sonnets this was a phrase that would bear investigation but stubener stole the opportunity away and was back chanting his everlasting statistics a few minutes later and most unwittingly she opened up the biggest lead of all that first sharp attraction toward him had begun to stir again after the discovery of the sonnets the magnificent frame of his the handsome face the chaste lips the clearlooking eyes the fine forehead which the short crop of blond hair did not hide the aura of physical wellbeing and cleanness which he seemed to emanate all this and more that she sensed drew her as she had never been drawn by any man and yet through her mind kept running the nasty rumors that she had heard only the day before at the courierjournal office you were right she said there is something more important to talk about there is something in my mind i want you to reconcile for me do you mind pat shook his head if i may be frank abominably frank ive heard the men sometimes talking of particular fights and of the betting odds and while i gave no heed to it at the time it seemed to me it was firmly agreed that there was a great deal of trickery and cheating connected with the sport now when i look at you for instance i find it hard to understand how you can be a party to such cheating i can understand your liking the sport for a sport as well as for the money it brings you but i cant understand theres nothing to understand stubener broke in while pats lips were wreathed in a gentle tolerant smile its all fairy tales this talk about faking about fixed fights and all that rot theres nothing to it miss sangster i assure you and now let me tell you about how i discovered mr glendon it was a letter i got from his father but maud sangster refused to be sidetracked and addressed herself to pat listen i remember one case particularly it was some fight that took place several months ago i forget the contestants one of the editors of the courierjournal told me he intended to make a good winning he said he was on the inside and was betting on the number of rounds he told me the fight would end in the nineteenth this was the night before and the next day he triumphantly called my attention to the fact that it had ended in that very round i didnt think anything of it one way or the other i was not interested in prizefighting then but i am now at the time it seemed quite in accord with the vague conception i had about fighting so you see it isnt all fairy tales is it i know that fight glendon said it was owen and murgweather and it did end in the nineteenth round sam and she said she heard that round named the day before how do you account for it sam how do you account for a man picking a lucky lottery ticket the manager evaded while getting his wits together to answer thats the very point men who study form and condition and seconds and rules and such things often pick the number of rounds just as men have been known to pick hundredtoone shots in the races and dont forget one thing for every man that wins theres another that loses theres another that didnt pick right miss sangster i assure you on my honor that faking and fixing in the fight game is is nonexistent what is your opinion mr glendon she asked the same as mine stubener snatched the answer he knows what i say is true every word of it hes never fought anything but a straight fight in his life isnt that right pat yes its right pat affirmed and the peculiar thing to maud sangster was that she was convinced he spoke the truth she brushed her forehead with her hand as if to rid herself of the bepuzzlement that clouded her brain listen she said last night the same editor told me that your forthcoming fight was arranged to the very round which it would end stubener was verging on a panic but pats speech saved him from replying then the editor lies pats voice boomed now for the first time he did not lie before about that other fight she challenged what round did he say my fight with nat powers would end in before she could answer the manager was into the thick of it oh rats pat he cried shut up its only the regular run of ring rumors lets get on with this interview he was ignored by glendon whose eyes bent on hers were no longer mildly blue but harsh and imparative she was sure now that she had stumbled on something tremendous something that would explain all that had baffled her at the same time she thrilled to the mastery of his voice and gaze here was a male man who would take hold of life and shake out of it what he wanted what round did the editor say glendon reiterated his demand for the love of mike pat stop this foolishness stubener broke in i wish you would give me a chance to answer maud sangster said i guess im able to talk with miss sangster glendon added you get out sam go off and take care of that photographer they looked at each other for a tense silent moment then the manager moved slowly to the door opened it and turned his head to listen and now what round did he say i hope i havent made a mistake she said tremulously but i am very sure that he said the sixteenth round she saw surprise and anger leap into glendons face and the anger and accusation in the glance he cast at his manager and she knew the blow had driven home and there was reason for his anger he knew he had talked it over with stubener and they had reached a decision to give the audience a good run for its money without unnecessarily prolonging the fight and to end it in the sixteenth and here was a woman from a newspaper office naming the very round stubener in the doorway looked limp and pale and it was evident he was holding together by an effort ill see you later pat told him shut the door behind you the door closed and the two were left alone glendon did not speak the expression on his face was frankly one of trouble and perplexity well she asked he got up and towered above her then sat down again moistening his lips with his tongue ill tell you one thing he finally said the fight wont end in the sixteenth round she did not speak but her unconvinced and quizzical smile hurt him you wait and see miss sangster and youll see the editor man is mistaken you mean the program is to be changed she queried audaciously he quivered to the cut of her words i am not accustomed to lying he said stiffly even to women neither have you to me nor have you denied the program is to be changed perhaps mr glendon i am stupid but i fail to see the difference in what number the final round occurs so long as it is predetermined and known ill tell you that round and not another soul shall know she shrugged her shoulders and smiled it sounds to me very much like a racing tip they are always given that way you know furthermore i am not quite stupid and i know there is something wrong here why were you made angry by my naming the round why were you angry with your manager why did you send him from the room for reply glendon walked over to the window as if to look out where he changed his mind and partly turned and she knew without seeing that he was studying her face he came back and sat down youve said i havent lied to you miss sangster and you were right i have nt he paused groping painfully for a correct statement of the situation now do you think you can believe what i am going to tell you will you take the word of a prizefighter she nodded gravely looking him straight in the eyes and certain that what he was about to tell was the truth ive always fought straight and square ive never touched a piece of dirty money in my life nor attempted a dirty trick now i can go on from that youve shaken me up pretty badly by what you told me i dont know what to make of it i cant pass a snap judgment on it i dont know but it looks bad thats what troubles me for see you stubener and i have talked this fight over and it was understood between us that i would end the fight in the sixteenth round now you bring the same word how did that editor know not from me stubener must have let it out unless he stopped to debate the problem unless the editor is a lucky guesser i cant make up my mind about it ill have to keep my eyes open and wait and learn every word ive given you is straight and theres my hand on it again he towered out of his chair and over to her her small hand was gripped in his big one as she arose to meet him and after a fair straight look into the eyes between them both glanced unconsciously at the clasped hands she felt that she had never been more aware that she was a woman the sex emphasis of those two hands the soft and fragile feminine and the heavy muscular masculine was startling glendon was the first to speak you could be hurt so easily he said and at the same time she felt the firmness of his grip almost caressingly relax she remembered the old prussian kings love for giants and laughed at the incongruity of the thoughtassociation as she withdrew her hand i am glad you came here today he said then hurried on awkwardly to make an explanation which the warm light of admiration in his eyes belied i mean because maybe you have opened my eyes to the crooked dealing that has been going on you have surprised me she urged it seemed to me that it is so generally understood that prizefighting is full of crookedness that i cannot understand how you one of its chief exponents could be ignorant of it i thought as a matter of course that you would know all about it and now you have convinced me that you never dreamed of it you must be different from other fighters he nodded his head that explains it i guess and thats what comes of keeping away from it from the other fighters and promoters and sports it was easy to pull the wool over my eyes yet it remains to be seen whether it has really been pulled over or not you see i am going to find out for myself and change it she queried rather breathlessly convinced somehow that he could do anything he set out to accomplish no quit it was his answer if it isnt straight i wont have anything more to do with it and one thing is certain this coming fight with nat powers wont end in the sixteenth round if there is any truth in that editors tip theyll all be fooled instead of putting him out in the sixteenth ill let the fight run on into the twenties you wait and see and im not to tell the editor she was on her feet now preparing to go certainly not if he is only guessing let him take his chances and if theres anything rotten about it he deserves to lose all he bets this is to be a little secret between you and me ill tell you what ill do ill name the round to you i wont run it into the twenties ill stop nat powers in the eighteenth and ill not whisper it she assured him id like to ask you a favor he said tentatively maybe its a big favor she showed her acquiescence in her face as if it were already granted and he went on of course i know you wont use this faking in the interview but i want more than that i dont want you to publish anything at all she gave him a quick look with her searching gray eyes then surprised herself by her answer certainly she said it will not be published i wont write a line of it i knew it he said simply for the moment she was disappointed by the lack of thanks and the next moment she was glad that he had not thanked her she sensed the different foundation he was building under this meeting of an hour with her and she became daringly explorative how did you know it she asked i dont know he shook his head i cant explain it i knew it as a matter of course somehow it seems to me i know a lot about you and me but why not publish the interview as your manager says it is good advertising i know it he answered slowly but i dont want to know you that way i think it would hurt if you should publish it i dont want to think that i knew you professionally id like to remember our talk here as a talk between a man and a woman as he spoke in his eyes was all the expression with which a man looks at a woman she felt the force and beat of him and she felt strangely tonguetied and awkward before this man who had been reputed tonguetied and awkward he could certainly talk straighter to the point and more convincingly than most men and what struck her most forcibly was her own inborn certainty that it was mere naр в рв р вђрв р в р рр рр вђљрірсњve and simple frankness on his part and not a practised artfulness he saw her in to her machine and gave her another thrill when he said goodby once again their hands were clasped as he said some day ill see you again i want to see you again somehow i have a feeling that the last word has not been said between us and as the machine rolled away she was aware of a similar feeling she had not seen the last of this very disquieting pat glendon king of the bruisers and abysmal brute back in the training quarters glendon encountered his perturbed manager what did you fire me out for stubener demanded were finished a hell of a mess youve made youve never stood for meeting a reporter alone before and now youll see when that interview comes out glendon who had been regarding him with cool amusement made as if to turn and pass on and then changed his mind it wont come out he said stubener looked up sharply i asked her not to glendon explained then stubener exploded as if shed kill a juicy thing like that glendon become very cold and his voice was harsh and grating it wont be published she told me so and to doubt it is to call her a liar the irish flame was in his eyes and by that and by the unconscious clenching of his passionwrought hands stubener who knew the strength of them and of the man he faced no longer dared to doubt chapter vii it did not take stubener long to find out that glendon intended extending the distance of the fight though try as he would he could get no hint of the number of the round he wasted no time however and privily clinched certain arrangements with nat powers and nat powers manager powers had a faithful following of bettors and the betting syndicate was not to be denied its harvest on the night of the fight maud sangster was guilty of a more daring unconventionality than any she had yet committed though no whisper of it leaked out to shock society under the protection of the editor she occupied a ringside seat her hair and most of her face were hidden under a slouch hat while she wore a mans long overcoat that fell to her heels entering in the thick of the crowd she was not noticed nor did the newspaper men in the press seats against the ring directly in front of her recognize her as was the growing custom there were no preliminary bouts and she had barely gained her seat when roars of applause announced the arrival of nat powers he came down the aisle in the midst of his seconds and she was almost frightened by the formidable bulk of him yet he leaped the ropes as lightly as a man half his weight and grinned acknowledgement to the tumultuous greeting that arose from all the house he was not pretty two cauliflower ears attested his profession and its attendant brutality while his broken nose had been so often spread over his face as to defy the surgeons art to reconstruct it another uproar heralded the arrival of glendon and she watched him eagerly as he went through the ropes to his corner but it was not until the tedious time of announcements introductions and challenges was over that the two men threw off their wraps and faced each other in ring costume concentrated upon them from overhead was the white glare of many electric lights this for the benefit of the moving picture cameras and she felt as she looked at the two sharply contrasted men that it was in glendon that she saw the thoroughbred and in powers the abysmal brute both looked their parts glendon clean cut in face and form softly and massively beautiful powers almost asymmetrically rugged and heavily matted with hair as they made their preliminary pose for the cameras confronting each other in fighting attitudes it chanced that glendons gaze dropped down through the ropes and rested on her face though he gave no sign she knew with a swift leap of the heart that he had recognized her the next moment the gong sounded the announcer cried let her go and the battle was on it was a good fight there was no blood no marring and both were clever half of the first round was spent in feeling each other out but maud sangster found the play and feint and tap of the gloves sufficiently exciting during some of the fiercer rallies in later stages of the fight the editor was compelled to touch her arm to remind her who she was and where she was powers fought easily and cleanly as became the hero of half a hundred ring battles and an admiring claque applauded his every cleverness yet he did not unduly exert himself save in occasional strenous rallies that brought the audience yelling to its feet in the mistaken notion that he was getting his man it was at such a moment when her unpractised eye could not inform her that glendon was escaping serious damage that the editor leaned to her and said young pat will win all right hes a comer and they cant stop him but hell win in the sixteenth and not before or after she asked she almost laughed at the certitude of her companions negative she knew better powers was noted for hunting his man from moment to moment and round to round and glendon was content to accede to this program his defense was admirable and he threw in just enough of offense to whet the edge of the audiences interest though he knew he was scheduled to lose powers had had too long a ring experience to hesitate from knocking his man out if the opportunity offered he had had the double cross worked too often on him to be chary in working it on others if he got his chance he was prepared to knock his man out and let the syndicate go hang thanks to clever press publicity the idea was prevalent that at last young glendon had met his master in his heart powers however knew that it was himself who had encountered the better man more than once in the faster infighting he received the weight of punches that he knew had been deliberately made no heavier on glendons part there were times and times when a slip or error of judgement could have exposed him to one of his antagonists sledgehammer blows and lost the fight yet his was that almost miraculous power of accurate timing and distancing and confidence was not shaken by several close shaves he experienced he had never lost a fight never been knocked down and he had always been thoroughly the master of the man he faced that such a possibility was unthinkable at the end of the fifteenth round both men were in good condition though powers was breathing a trifle heavily and there were men in the ringside seats offering odds that he would blow up it was just before the gong for the sixteenth round struck that stubener leaning over glendon from behind in his corner whispered are you going to get him now glendon with a back toss of his head shook it and laughed mockingly up into his managers anxious face with the stroke of the gong for the sixteenth round glendon was surprised to see powers cut loose from the first second it was a tornado of fighting and glendon was hard put to escape serious damage he blocked clinched ducked sidestepped was rushed backward against the ropes and was met by fresh rushes when he surged out to center several times powers left inviting openings but glendon refused to loose the lightingbolt of a blow that would drop his man he was reserving that blow for two rounds later not in the whole fight had he ever exerted his full strength nor struck with the force that was in him for two minutes without the slightest letup powers went at him hammer and tongs in another minute the round would be over and the betting snydicate hard hit but that minute was not to be they had just come together in the center of the ring it was as ordinary a clinch as any in the fight save that powers was struggling and roughing it every instant glendon whipped his left over in a crisp but easy jolt to the side of the face it was like any of a score of similar jolts he had already delivered in the course of the fight to his amazement he felt powers go limp in his arms and begin sinking to the floor on sagging spraddling legs that refused to bear his weight he struck the floor with a thump rolled half over on his side and lay with closed eyes and motionless the referee bending above him was shouting the count at the cry of nine powers quivered as if making a vain effort to rise ten and out cried the referee he caught glendons hand and raised it aloft to the roaring audience in token that he was the winner for the first time in the ring glendon was dazed it had not been a knockout blow he could stake his life on that it had not been to the jaw but to the side of the face and he knew it had gone there and nowhere else yet the man was out had been counted out and he had faked it beautifully that final thump on the floor had been a convincing masterpiece to the audience it was indubitably a knockout and the moving picture machines would perpetuate the lie the editor had called the turn after all and a crooked turn it was glendon shot a swift glance through the ropes to the face of maud sangster she was looking straight at him but her eyes were bleak and hard and there was neither recognition nor expression in them even as he looked she turned away unconcernedly and said something to the man beside her powers seconds were carrying him to his corner a seeming limp wreck of a man glendons seconds were advancing upon him to congratulate him and to remove his gloves but stubener was ahead of them his face was beaming as he caught glendons right glove in both his hands and cried good boy pat i knew youd do it glendon pulled his glove away and for the first time in the years they had been together his manager heard him swear you go to hell he said and turned to hold out his hands for his seconds to pull off the gloves chapter viii that night after receiving the editors final dictum that there was not a square fighter in the game maud sangster cried quietly for a moment on the edge of her bed grew angry and went to sleep hugely disgusted with herself prizefighters and the world in general the next afternoon she began work on an interview with henry addison that was destined never to be finished it was in the private room that was accorded her at the courierjournal office that the thing happened she had paused in her writing to glance at a headline in the afternoon paper announcing that glendon was matched with tom cannam when one of the doorboys brought in a card it was glendons tell him i cant be seen she told the boy in a minute he was back he says hes coming in anyway but hed rather have permission did you tell him i was busy she asked yesm but he said he was coming just the same she made no answer and the boy his eyes shining with admiration for the importunate visitor rattled on i knowm hes a awful big guy if he started roughhousing he could clean the whole office out hes young glendon who won the fight last night very well then bring him in we dont want the office cleaned out you know no greetings were exchanged when glendon entered she was as cold and inhospitable as a gray day and neither invited him to a chair nor recognized him with her eyes sitting half turned away from him at her desk and waiting for him to state his business he gave no sign of how this cavalier treatment affected him but plunged directly into his subject i want to talk to you he said shortly that fight it did not end in that round she shrugged her shoulders i knew it would you did nt he retorted you did nt i did nt she turned and looked at him with quiet affection of boredom what is the use she asked prizefighting is prizefighting and we all know what it means the fight did end in the round i told you it would it did he agreed but you didnt know it would in all the world you and i were at least two that knew powers wouldnt be knocked out in the sixteenth she remained silent i say you knew he would nt he spoke peremptorily and when she still declined to speak stepped nearer to her answer me he commanded she nodded her head but he was she insisted he was nt he wasnt knocked out at all do you get that i am going to tell you about it and you are going to listen i didnt lie to you do you get that i didnt lie to you i was a fool and they fooled me and you along with me you thought you saw him knocked out yet the blow i struck was not heavy enough it didnt hit him in the right place either he made believe it did he faked that knockout he paused and looked at her expectantly and somehow with a leap and thrill she knew that she believed him and she felt pervaded by a warm happiness at the reinstatement of this man who meant nothing to her and whom she had seen but twice in her life well he demanded and she thrilled anew at the compellingness of him she stood up and her hand went out to his i believe you she said and i am glad most glad it was a longer grip than she had anticipated he looked at her with eyes that burned and to which her own unconsciously answered back never was there such a man was her thought her eyes dropped first and his followed so that as before both gazed at the clasped hands he made a movement of his whole body toward her impulsive and involuntary as if to gather her to him then checked himself abruptly with an unmistakable effort she saw it and felt the pull of his hand as it started to draw her to him and to her amazement she felt the desire to yield the desire almost overwhelmingly to be drawn into the strong circle of those arms and had he compelled she knew that she would not have refrained she was almost dizzy when he checked himself and with a closing of his fingers that half crushed hers dropped her hand almost flung it from him god he breathed you were made for me he turned partly away from her sweeping his hand to his forehead she knew she would hate him forever if he dared one stammered word of apology or explanation but he seemed to have the way always of doing the right thing where she was concerned she sank into her chair and he into another first drawing it around so as to face her across the corner of the desk i spent last night in a turkish bath he said i sent for an old brokendown bruiser he was a friend of my father an the old days i knew there couldnt be a thing about the ring he didnt know and i made him talk the funny thing was that it was all i could do to convince him that i didnt know the things i asked him about he called me the babe in the woods i guess he was right i was raised in the woods and woods is about all i know well i received an education from that old man last night the ring is rottener than you told me it seems everybody connected with it is crooked the very supervisors that grant the fight permits graft off of the promoters and the promoters managers and fighters graft off each other and off the public its down to a system in one way and on the other hand they re always do you know what the double cross is she nodded well they dont seem to miss a chance to give each other the double cross the stuff that old man told me took my breath away and here ive been in the thick of it for several years and knew nothing of it i was a real babe in the woods and yet i can see how ive been fooled i was so made that nobody could stop me i was bound to win and thanks to stubener everything crooked was kept away from me this morning i cornered spider walsh and made him talk he was my first trainer you know and he followed stubeners instructions they kept me in ignorance besides i didnt herd with the sporting crowd i spent my time hunting and fishing and monkeying with cameras and such things do you know what walsh and stubener called me between themselves the virgin i only learned it this morning from walsh and it was like pulling teeth and they were right i was a little innocent lamb and stubener was using me for crookedness too only i didnt know it i can look back now and see how it was worked but you see i wasnt interested enough in the game to be suspicious i was born with a good body and a cool head i was raised in the open and i was taught by my father who knew more about fighting than any man living or dead it was too easy the ring didnt absorb me there was never any doubt of the outcome but im done with it now she pointed to the headline announcing his match with tom cannam thats stubeners work he explained it was programmed months ago but i dont care im heading for the mountains ive quit she glanced at the unfinished interview on the desk and sighed how lordly men are she said masters of destiny they do as they please from what ive heard he interrupted youve done pretty much as you please its one of those things i like about you and what struck me hard from the first was the way you and i understand each other he broke off and looked at her with burning eyes well the ring did one thing for me he went on it made me acquainted with you and when you find the one woman theres just one thing to do take her in your two hands and dont let go come on let us start for the mountains it had come with the suddeness of a thunderclap and yet she felt that she had been expecting it her heart was beating up and almost choking her in a strangely delicious way here at last was the primitive and the simple with a vengeance then too it seemed a dream such things did not take place in modern nespaper offices love could not be made in such fashion it only occurred on the stage and in novels he had risen and was holding out both hands to her i dont dare she said in a whisper half to herself i dont dare and thereat she was stung by the quick contempt that flashed in his eyes but that swiftly changed to open incredulity youd dare anything you wanted he was saying i know that its not a case of dare but of want do you want she had arisen and was now swaying as if in a dream it flashed into her mind to wonder if it were hypnotism she wanted to glance about her at the familiar objects of the room in order to identify herself with reality but she could not take her eys from his nor did she speak he had stepped beside her his hand was on her arm and she leaned toward him involuntarily it was all part of the dream and it was no longer hers to question anything it was the great dare he was right she could dare what she wanted and she did want he was helping her into her jacket she was thrusting the hatpins through her hair and even as she realized it she found herself walking beside him through the opened door the flight of the duchess and the statue and the bust darted through her mind then she remembered waring whats become of waring she murmured land travel or seafaring he murmured back and to her this kindred sufficient note was a vindication of her madness at the entrance of the building he raised his hand to call a taxi but was stopped by her touch on his arm where are we going she breathed to the ferry weve just time to catch that sacramento train but i cant go this way she protested i i havent even a change of handkerchiefs he held up his hand again before replying you can shop in sacramento well get married there and catch the night overland north ill arrange everything by telegraph from the train as the cab drew to the curb she looked quickly about her at the familiar street and the familiar throng then with almost a flurry of alarm into glendons face i dont know a thing about you she said we know everything about each other was his answer she felt the support and urge of his arms and lifted her foot to the step the next moment the door had closed he was beside her and the cab was heading down market street he passed his arm around her drew her close and kissed her when next she glimpsed his face she was certain that it was dyed with a faint blush i ive heard there was an art in kissing he stammered i dont know anything about it myself but ill learn you see youre the first woman i ever kissed chapter ix where a jagged peak of rock thrust above the vast virgin forest reclined a man and a woman beneath them on the edge of the trees were tethered two horses behind each saddle were a pair of small saddlebags the trees were monotonously huge towering hundreds of feet into the air they ran from eight to ten and twelve feet in diameter many were much larger all morning they had toiled up the divide through this unbroken forest and this peak of rock had been the first spot where they could get out of the forest in order to see the forest beneath them and away far as they could see lay range upon range of haze empurpled mountains there was no end to these ranges they rose only behind another to the dim distant skyline where they faded away with a vague promise of unending extension beyond there were no clearings in the forest north south east and west untouched unbroken it covered the land with its mighty growth they lay feasting their eyes on the sight her hand clasped in one of his for this was their honeymoon and these were the redwoods of mendocino across from shasta they had come with horses and saddlebags and down through the wilds of the coast counties and they had no plan except to continue until some other plan entered their heads they were roughly dressed she in travelstained khaki he in overalls and woolen shirt the latter was open at the sunburned neck and in his hugeness he seemed a fit dweller among the forest giants while for her as a dweller with him there were no signs of aught else but happiness well big man she said propping herself up on an elbow to gaze at him it is more wonderful than you promised and we are going through it together and there s a lot of the rest of the world well go through together he answered shifting his position so as to get her hand in both of his but not till weve finished with this she urged i seem never to grow tired of the big woods and of you he slid effortlessly into a sitting posture and gathered her into his arms oh you lover she whispered and i had given up hope of finding such a one and i never hoped at all i must just have known all the time that i was going to find you glad her answer was a soft pressure where her hand rested on his neck and for long minutes they looked out over the great woods and dreamed you remember i told you how i ran away from the redhaired school teacher that was the first time i saw this country i was on foot but forty or fifty miles a day was play for me i was a regular indian i wasnt thinking about you then game was pretty scarce in the redwoods but there was plenty of fine trout that was when i camped on these rocks i didnt dream that some day id be back with you you and be champion of the ring too he suggested no i didnt think about that at all dad had always told me i was going to be and i took it for granted you see he was very wise he was a great man but he didnt see you leaving the ring i dont know he was so careful in hiding its crookedness from me that i think he feared it ive told you about the contract with stubener dad put in that clause about crookedness the first crooked thing my manager did was to break the contract and yet you are going to fight this tom cannam is it worth while he looked at her quickly dont you want me to dear lover i want you to do whatever you want so she said and to herself her words still ringing in her ears she marveled that she not least among the stubbonly independent of the breed of sangster should utter them yet she knew they were true and she was glad it will be fun he said but i dont understand all the gleeful details i havent worked them out yet you might help me in the first place im going to doublecross stubener and the betting syndicate it will be part of the joke i am going to put cannam out in the first round for the first time i shall be really angry when i fight poor tom cannam whos as crooked as the rest will be the chief sacrifice you see i intend to make a speech in the ring its unusual but it will be a success for i am going to tell the audience all the inside workings of the game its a good game too but theyre running it on business principles and thats what spoils it but there im giving the speech to you instead of at the ring i wish i could be there to hear she said he looked at her and debated id like to have you but its sure to be a rough time there is no telling what may happen when i start my program but ill come straight to you as soon as its over and it will be the last appearnce of young glendon in the ring in any ring but dear youve never made a speech in your life she objected you might fail he shook his head positively im irish he announced and what irishman was there who couldnt speak he paused to laugh merrily stubener thinks im crazy says a man cant train on matrimony a lot he knows about matrimony or me or you or anything except real estate and fixed fights but ill show him that night and poor tom too i really feel sorry for tom my dear abysmal brute is going to behave most abysmally and brutally i fear she murmured he laughed im going to make a noble attempt at it positively my last appearance you know and then it will be you you but if you dont want that last appearance say the word of course i want it big man i want my big man for himself and to be himself he must be himself if you want this i want it for you and for myself too suppose i said i wanted to go on the stage or to the south seas or the north pole he answered slowly almost solemnly then id say go ahead because you are you and must be yourself and do whatever you want i love you because you are you and were both a silly pair of lovers she said when his embrace had relaxed isnt it great he cried he stood up measured the sun with his eye and extended his hand out over the big woods that covered the serried purple ranges weve got to sleep out there somewhere its thirty miles to the nearest camp chapter x who of all the sports present will ever forget the memorable night at the golden gate arena when young glendon put tom cannam to sleep and an even greater one than tom cannam kept the great audience on the ragged edge of riot for an hour caused the subsequent graft investigation of the supervisors and the indictments of the contractors and the building commisioners and pretty generally disrupted the whole fight game it was a complete surprise nor even stubener had the slightest apprehension of what was coming it was true that his man had been insubordinate after the nat powers affair and had run off and got married but all that was over young pat had done the expected swallowed the inevitable crookedness of the ring and come back into it again the golden gate arena was new this was its first fight and it was the biggest building of the kind san francisco had ever erected it seated twentyfive thousand and every seat was occupied sports had traveled from all the world to be present and they had paid fifty dollars for their ringside seats the cheapest seat in the house had sold for five dollars the old familiar roar of applause went up when billy morgan the veteran announcer climbed through the ropes and bared his gray head as he opened his mouth to speak a heavy crash came from a near section where several tiers of low seats had collapsed the crowd broke into loud laughter and shouted jocular regrets and advice to the victims none of whom had been hurt the crash of the seats and the hilarious uproar caused the captain of police in charge to look at one of his lieutenants and lift his eyebrows in token that they would have their hands full and a lively night one by one welcomed by uproarious applause seven doughty old ring heroes climbed through the ropes to be introduced they were all exheavyweight champions of the world billy morgan accompanied each presentation to the audience with an appropriate phrase one was hailed as honest john and old reliable another was the squarest twofisted fighter the ring ever saw and others the hero of a hundred battles and never threw one and never lay down the gamest of the old guard the only one who ever came back the greatest warrior of them all and the hardest nut in the ring to crack all this took time a speech was insisted from each one of them and they mumbled and muttered in reply with proud blushes and awkward shamblings the longest speech was from old reliable and lasted nearly a minute then they had to be photographed the ring filled up with celebrities with champion wrestlers famous conditioners and veteran timekeepers and referees lightweights and middleweights swarmed everybody seemed to be challenging everybody nat powers was there demanding a return match from young glendon and so were all the other shining lights whom glendon had snuffed out also they all challenged jim hanford who in turn had to make his statement which was to the effect that he would accord the next fighter to the winner of the one that was about to take place the audience immediately proceeded to name the winner half of it wildly crying glendon and the other half powers in the midst of the pandemonium another tier of seats went down and half a dozen rows were on between cheated ticket holders and the stewards who had been reaping a fat harvest the captain despatched a message to headquarters for additional police details the crowd was feeling good when cannam and glendon made their ring entrances the arena resembled a national political convention each was cheered for a solid five minutes the ring was now cleared glendon sat in his corner surrounded by his seconds as usual stubener was at his back cannam was introduced first and after he had scraped and ducked his head he was compelled to respond to the cries for a speech he stammered and halted but managed to grind out several ideas im proud to be here tonight he said and found space to capture another thought while the applause was thundering ive fought square ive fought square all my life nobody can deny that and im going to do my best tonight there were loud cries of thats right tom we know that good boy tom youre the boy to fetch the bacon home then came glendons turn from him likewise a speech was demanded though for principals to give speeches was an unprecedented thing in the prizering billy morgan held up his hand for silence and in a clear powerful voice glendon began everybody has told you they were proud to be here tonight he said i am not the audience was startled and he paused long enough to let it sink home i am not proud of my company you wanted a speech ill give you a real one this is my last fight after tonight i leave the ring for good why i have already told you i dont like my company the prizering is so crooked that no man engaged in it can hide behind a corkscrew it is rotten to the core from the little professional clubs right up to this affair tonight the low rumble of astonishment that had been rising at this point burst into a roar there were loud boos and hisses and many began crying go on with the fight we want the fight why dont you fight glendon waiting noted that the principal disturbers near the ring were promoters and managers and fighters in vain did he strive to make himself heard the audience was divided half crying out fight and the other half speech speech ten minutes of hopeless madness prevailed stubener the referee the owner of the arena and the promoter of the fight pleaded with glendon to go on with the fight when he refused the referee declared that he would award the fight in forfeit to cannam if glendon did not fight you cant do it the latter retorted ill sue you in all the courts if you try that on and ill not promise you that youll survive this crowd if you cheat it out of the fight besides im going to fight but before i do im going to finish my speech but its against the rules protested the referee its nothing of the sort theres not a word in the rules against ringside speeches every big fighter here tonight has made a speech only a few words shouted the promoter in glendons ear but youre giving a lecture theres nothing in the rules against lectures glendon answered and now you fellows get out of the ring or ill throw you out the promoter apoplectic and struggling was dropped over the ropes by his coatcollar he was a large man but so easily had glendon done it with one hand that the audience went wild with delight the cries for a speech increased in volume stubener and the owner beat a wise retreat glendon held up his hands to be heard whereupon those that shouted for the fight redoubled their efforts two or three tiers of seats crashed down and numbers who had thus lost their places added to the turmoil by making a concerted rush to squeeze in on the still intact seats while those behind blocked from sight of the ring yelled and raved for them to sit down glendon walked to the ropes and spoke to the police captain he was compelled to bend over and shout in his ear if i dont give this speech he said this crowd will wreck the place if they break lose you can never hold them you know that now youve got to help you keep the ring clear and ill silence the crowd he went back to the center of the ring and again held up his hands you want that speech he shouted in a tremendous voice hundreds near the ring heard him and cried yes then let every man who wants to hear shut up the noisemaker next to him the advice was taken so that when he repeated it his voice penetrated farther again and again he shouted it and slowly zone by zone the silence pressed outward from the ring accompanied by a muffled undertone of smacks and thuds and scuffles as the obstreperous were subdued by their neighbors almost had all confusion been smothered when a tier of seats near the ring went down this was greeted with fresh roars of laughter which of itself died away so that a lone voice far back was heard distinctly as it piped go on glendon were with you glendon had the celts intuitive knowledge of the psychology of the crowd he knew that what had been a vast disorderly mob five minutes before was now tightly in hand and for added effect he deliberately delayed yet the delay was just long enough and not a second too long for thirty seconds the silence was complete and the effect produced was one of awe then just as the first faint hints of restlessness came to his ears he began to speak when i finish this speech he said i am going to fight i promise you it will be a real fight one of the few real fights you have ever seen i am going to get my man in the shortest possible time billy morgan in making his final announcement will tell you that it is to be a fortyfiveround contest let me tell you that it will be nearer fortyfive seconds when i was interrupted i was telling you that the ring was rotten it is from top to bottom it is run on business principles and you all know what business principles are enough said you are the suckers every last one of you that is not making anything out of it why are the seats falling down tonight graft like the fight game they were built on business principles he now held the audience stronger than ever and knew it there are three men squeezed on two seats i can see that everywhere what does it mean graft the stewards dont get any wages they are supposed to graft business principles again you pay of course you pay how are the fight permits obtained graft and now let me ask you if the men who build the seats graft if the stewards graft if the authorities graft why shouldnt those higher up in the fight game graft they do and you pay and let me tell you it is not the fault of the fighters they dont run it theyre the business men the fighters are only fighters they begin honestly enough but the managers and promoters make them give in or kick them out there have been straight fighters and there are now a few but they dont earn much as a rule i guess there have been straight managers mine is about the best of the boiling but just ask him how much hes got salted down in real estate and apartment houses here the uproar began to drown his voice let every man who wants to hear shut up the man alongside of him glendon instructed again like the murmur of a surf there was a rustling of smacks and thuds and scuffles and the house quieted down why does every fighter work overtime insisting that hes always fought square why are they called honest johns and honest bills and honest blacksmiths and all the rest doesnt it ever strike you that they seem to be afraid of something when a man comes to you shouting he is honest you get suspicious but when a prizefighter passes the same dope out to you you swallow it down may the best man win how often have you heard billy morgan say that let me tell you that the best man doesnt win so often and when he does its usually arranged for him most of the grudge fights youve heard or seen were arranged too its a program the whole thing is programmed do you think the promoters and managers are in it for their health theyre not theyre business men tom dick and harry are three fighters dick is the best man in two fights he could prove it but what happens tom licks harry dick licks tom harry licks dick nothing proved then come the return matches harry licks tom tom licks dick dick licks harry nothing proved then they try again dick is kicking says he wants to get along in the game so dick licks tom and dick licks harry eight fights to prove dick the best man when two could have done it all arranged a regular program and you pay for it and when your seats dont break down you get robbed of them by the stewards its a good game too if it were only square the fighters would be square if they had a chance but the graft is too big when a handful of men can divide up threequarters of a million dollars on three fights a wild outburst compelled him to stop out of the medley of cries from all over the house he could distinguish such as what million dollars what three fights tell us go on likewise there were boos and hisses and cries of muckraker muckraker do you want to hear glendon shouted then keep order once more he compelled the impressive half minute of silence what is jim hanford planning what is the program his crowd and mine are framing up they know ive got him he knows ive got him i can whip him in one fight but hes the champion of the world if i dont give in to the program theyll never give me a chance to fight him the program calls for three fights i am to win the first fight it will be pulled off in nevada if san francisco wont stand for it we are to make it a good fight to make it good each of us will put up a side bet of twenty thousand it will be real money but it wont be a real bet each gets his own slipped back to him the same way with the purse well divide it evenly though the public division will be thirtyfive and sixtyfive the purse the moving picture royalities the advertisements and all the rest of the drags wont be a cent less than two hundred and fifty thousand well divide it and go to work on the return match hanford will win that and we divide again then comes the third fight i win as i have every right to and we have taken threequarters of a million out of the pockets of the fighting public thats the program but the money is dirty and thats why i am quitting the ring tonight it was at this moment that jim hanford kicking a clinging policeman back among the seatholders heaved his huge frame through the ropes bellowing its a lie he rushed like an infuriated bull at glendon who sprang back and then instead of meeting the rush ducked cleanly away unable to check himself the big man fetched up against the ropes flung back by the spring of them he was turning to make another rush when glendon landed him glendon cool clearseeing distanced his man perfectly to the jaw and struck the first fullstrength blow of his career all his strength and his reserve of strength went into that one smashing muscular explosion hanford was dead in the air in so far as unconsciousness may resemble death so far as he was concerned he ceased at the moment of contact with glendons fist his feet left the floor and he was in the air until he struck the topmost rope his inert body sprawled across it sagged at the middle and fell through the ropes and down out of the ring upon the heads of the men in the press seats the audience broke loose it had already seen more than it had paid to see for the great jim hanford the world champion had been knocked out it was unofficial but it had been with a single punch never had there been such a night in fistiana glendon looked ruefully at his damaged knuckles cast a glance through the ropes to where hanford was groggily coming to and held up his hands he had clinched his right to be heard and the audience grew still when i began to fight he said they called me onepunch glendon you saw that punch a moment ago i always had that punch i went after my men and got them on the jump though i was careful not to hit with all my might then i was educated my manager told me it wasnt fair to the crowd he advised me to make long fights so that the crowd could get a run for its money i was a fool a mutt i was a green lad from the mountains so help me god i swallowed it as truth my manager used to talk over with me what round i would put my man out in then he tipped it off to the betting syndicate and the betting syndicate went to it of course you paid but i am glad for one thing i never touched a cent of the money they didnt dare offer it to me because they knew it would give the game away you remember my fight with nat powers i never knocked him out i had got suspicious so the gang framed it up with him i didnt know i intended to let him go a couple of rounds over the sixteenth that last punch in the sixteenth didnt shake him but he faked the knockout just the same and fooled all of you how about tonight a voice called out is it a frameup it is was glendons answer hows the syndicate betting that cannam will last to the fourteenth howls and hoots went up for the last time glendon held up his hand for silence im almost done now but i want to tell you one thing the syndicate gets landed tonight this is to be a square fight tom cannam wont last till the fourteenth round he wont last the first round cannam sprang to his feet in his corner and cried out in a fury you cant do it the man dont live who can get me in one round glendon ignored him and went on once now in my life i have struck with all my strength you saw that a moment ago when i caught hanford tonight for the second time i am going to hit with all my strength that is if cannam doesnt jump through the ropes right now and get away and now im ready he went to his corner and held out his hands for his gloves in the opposite corner cannam raged while his seconds tried vainly to calm him at last billy morgan managed to make the final announcement this will be a fortyfive round contest he shouted marquis of queensbury rules and may the best man win let her go the gong struck the two men advanced glendons right hand was extended for the customary shake but cannam with an angry toss of the head refused to take it to the general surprise he did not rush angry though he was he fought carefully his touched pride impelling him to bend every effort to last out the round several times he struck but he struck cautiously never relaxing his defense glendon hunted him about the ring ever advancing with the remorseless taptap of his left foot yet he struck no blows nor attempted to strike he even dropped his hands to his sides and hunted the other defenselessly in an effort to draw him out cannam grinned defiantly but declined to take advantage of the proffered opening two minutes passed and then a change came over glendon by every muscle by every line of his face he advertised that the moment had come for him to get his man acting it was and it was well acted he seemed to have become a thing of steel as hard and pitiless as steel the effect was apparent on cannam who redoubled his caution glendon quickly worked him into a corner and herded and held him there still he struck no blow nor attempted to strike and the suspense on cannams part grew painful in vain he tried to work out of the corner while he could not summon resolution to rush upon his opponent in an attempt to gain the respite of a clinch then it came a swift series of simple feints that were muscle flashes cannam was dazzled so was the audience no two onlookers could agree afterwards as to what took place cannam ducked one feint and at the same time threw up his face guard to meet another feint for his jaw he also attempted to change position with his legs ringside witnesses swore that they saw glendon start the blow from his right hip and leap forward like a tiger to add the weight of his body to it be that as it may the blow caught cannam on the point of the chin at the moment of his shift of position and like hanford he was unconscious in the air before he struck the ropes and fell through on the heads of the reporters of what happened afterward that night in the golden gate arena columns in the newspapers were unable adequately to describe the police kept the ring clear but they could not save the arena it was not a riot it was an orgy not a seat was left standing all over the great hall by main strength crowding and jostling to lay hands on beams and boards the crowd uprooted and overturned prizefighters sought protection of the police but there were not enough police to escort them out and fighters managers and promoters were beaten and battered jim hanford alone was spared his jaw prodigiously swollen earned him this mercy outside when finally driven from the building the crowd fell upon a new seventhousanddollar motor car belonging to a wellknown fight promoter and reduced it to scrapiron and kindling wood glendon unable to dress amid the wreckage of dressing rooms gained his automobile still in his ring costume and wrapped in a bath robe but failed to escape by weight of numbers the crowd caught and held his machine the police were too busy to rescue him and in the end a compromise was effected whereby the car was permitted to proceed at a walk escorted by five thousand cheering madmen it was midnight when this storm swept past union square and down upon the st francis cries for a speech went up and though at the hotel entrance glendon was goodnaturedly restrained from escaping he even tried leaping out upon the heads of the enthusiasts but his feet never touched the pavement on heads and shoulders clutched at and uplifted by every hand that could touch his body he went back through the air to the machine then he gave a speech and maud glendon looking down from an upper window at her young hercules towering on the seat of the automobile knew as she always knew that he meant it when he repeated that he had fought his last fight and retired from the ring forever the end
