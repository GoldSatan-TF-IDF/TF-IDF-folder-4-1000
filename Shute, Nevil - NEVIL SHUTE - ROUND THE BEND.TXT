round the bend nevil shute acknowledgment thanks are due to mrs flecker for permission to reprint lines from the collected poems of james elroy flecker the golden journey to samarkand and hassan also to dr john masefield om and the society of authors for similar permission in respect of quotations from his works some men of noble stock were made some glory in the murder blade some praise a science or an art but i like honourable trade james elroy flecker i came into aviation the hard way i was never in the raf and my parents hadnt got fifteen hundred pounds to spend on pilot training for me at a flying school my father was and is a crane driver at southampton docks and i am one of seven children five boys and two girls i went to the council school like all the other kids in our street and then when i left school dad got me a job in a garage out on the portsmouth road that was in i stayed there for about three years and got to know a bit about cars then early in the summer sir alan cobham came to southampton with his flying circus national aviation day he called it he operated in a big way because he had about fifteen aeroplanes avros and moths and a glider and an autogiro and a lincock for stunting displays and a big old handley page airliner for mass joyriding and a new thing called an airspeed ferry my that was a grand turnout to watch i knew from the first day that to be with that circus was the job for me he was at hamble for three days and i was out at the field each day from early in the morning till dark the chaps fuelling and cleaning down the aircraft let me help them coiling down a hose or fetching an oil drum for them to stand on when there was nothing else that wanted doing i went round the enclosures picking up the waste paper that the crowd had left behind and taking it away to burn in a corner of the field it was fun just doing that because of the aeroplanes i got the sack from the garage on the second day on the evening of their last day i went to the foreman of the ground crew and asked him for a job he said i was too young and they were full up anyway he said that he was sorry i went home all down in the dumps that night i must say dad and mum were good they didnt lay in to me for getting the sack from the garage although they might well have done id told them airily that i was going to get a job with the circus and when i went home i suppose they saw by my face i hadnt got it they were ever so nice ma opened a small tin of salmon for tea to make a bit of a treat for me the show was going on to portsmouth twenty miles away and when i told them i was going over there next day all dad said was thats right keep trying i went to portsmouth on an early bus and i was out at the airport long before the first machines flew in helping the ground crew to put up the first enclosures round the edges of the aerodrome the foreman scratched his head when he saw me but they were always shorthanded so they didnt turn me off he must have said something to sir alan though because while i was holding a post straight for another chap to hammer into the ground sir alan himself came up behind me who are you he asked i thought wed left you behind at hamble my names tom cutter i said well what are you doing here tom helping to get this post in sir i said i was a bit shy at being talked to by a knight havent you got a job got the sack day before yesterday i said it sounded bad but i didnt know what else to say is that because you spent so much time out here with us i suppose so i said reluctantly he snorted well dont be such a young fool go back and ask to be taken on again theres no work for you here what was the job i was in a garage sir i cant go back they took on another boy well we cant take you on here were full up ive got hundreds of boys writing to me for jobs every day hundreds and hundreds ive got no jobs to give mr dixon told me that there wasnt any job i said i just thought that if i came over while im doing nothing i could help picking up the paper and that he stared at me so long in silence that i felt quite awkward i know now what a good answer that was im blowed if i know he said at last and turned away i couldnt make head or tail of that i went on all that morning helping put up the enclosures and when dinner time came round the foreman said id better go and get my dinner in the mess tent with the rest of the men it was good of him because being out of work i hadnt got any money to chuck around i went and helped park the cars in the car park when they started to come in for the afternoon show and then i watched the show again they had stunt displays and wing walking and a parachute descent and a pretty girl flying a glider they had a public address loudspeaker system rigged up and the announcer stood up once and said that sir alan cobham had offered to let any pilot of the last war try his hand at flying again a pilot dressed up as an old tramp came out of the crowd and did a bit of clowning with the announcer and tripped over his umbrella and fell flat and got into an avro back to front and took it off the ground facing the tail holding his hat on waving his umbrella and shouting blue murder and went into the best bit of crazy flying ever seen in england bellowing all the time to be told how to land it as he went crabbing down the enclosures three feet up and the announcer bellowing back to him my that was fun they finished up with a gretna green elopement of a couple in a terrible old model t ford with father chasing after them all over the aerodrome in a moth and bombing them with little paper bags of flour and rolls of toilet paper id seen it all before but i could have watched that show for ever id go and see it again even now i went and helped unpark the cars and get them away after the show sir alan had been flying the handley page himself most of the afternoon joyriding taking up twentyfive passengers at a time he handed over to another pilot at about five oclock and came through the car park to his caravan for his tea he was always in a hurry but never in too much of a hurry to notice the humblest detail of his big concern and he checked when he saw me you still here he asked i been helping park the cars and that i said oh get any tips three and six i said fair enough want to earn five bob i grinned and nodded ill give you five bob if youd like to do the girl in gretna green this evening think you can do it oh aye i said i can do that all right thank you sir i was young of course and id got a fresh pink and white face in those days so i could make up as a girl quite well all i had to do was to dress up in the most terrible womens clothes and drive about on the aerodrome in the old ford trying to get out of the way of the moth the ford was driven by a boy about my own age connie shaklin connie was short for constantine he was a cheerful yellowskinned young chap with straight black hair who put me in the way of things he was dressed up as a young farmer in a sort of smock and we did the turn together we never turned that ford over but we came bloody near it sometimes it was good fun we wheeled and skidded the thing all over the aerodrome shrieking and hugging and kissing while the moth dived on us and bombed us the show ended of course with my skirt getting pulled off and me running off the field in a pair of red flannel knickers covered in flour and with streamers of toilet paper all over me while the crowd laughed fit to burst i got the five bob and sir alan himself said id done very well that was the first money that i ever made in aviation i made eight and six that day in all and when i got home id got four and twopence left clear profit after paying for my bus fares and my tea i showed it to dad and mum and told them i was going over to the show again next day they let me do the gretna green girl in both performances and gave me ten bob for the two for the rest of the day i picked up paper and carried things about for the ground engineers there was always something to work at then i helped in the car park again and got some more tips and when i went back home that night dad said i was getting my nose in the show moved on to winchester and i followed it there but after that it was going to newbury and that was too far for me to go over every day i asked the foreman about a job again then and he said hed speak to sir alan for me next day was a saturday and dad was off in the afternoon so i got him to come over in case they said i was too young again sir alan saw dad for a minute and said i was a smart boy but if i came id have to be laid off in the winter dad said he thought it was best for me to do what i was keen on and wed take our chance about the winter when we got on to the bus that night to go back home id got my job in the air circus four quid a week which was more than id been getting in the garage thinking back over my life i know of two or three times when ive been just perfectly radiantly happy that was one of them i went all over england scotland and wales with the show that summer from falmouth to inverness from kings lynn to swansea i did labouring work and gretna green and helped with the aeroplanes whenever i got a chance that was mostly when some passenger had been sick on the floor from that i got to washing off the dirty oil with a bucket of paraffin and cleaning down generally and by the time the season ended id picked up quite a bit of knowledge about those particular aeroplanes just by keeping my ears open and working on them whenever i got the chance i got laid off when the show packed up for the winter but mr dixon said that i could come along next year if i wanted and if i turned up or wrote in the first week of april thered be a job for me sir alan himself came round on the last evening and shook hands with us all and thanked us and when he came to me he asked what i was going to do i said ill get a job of some sort for the winter and come back again next year if thats all right mr dixon tells me that you want to be a ground engineer he said thats right sir i replied i was going to go to evening classes in the winter fine he said if you do that bring along some kind of a report with you next spring if its a good one ill see you get a bit more to do with the aeroplanes i went back home and i got a job with a coal merchant going round with the driver of one of those chariot coal carts drawn by a horse delivering coal at the houses it was all right as a job because it didnt tire your mind and i got off sharp at five every evening with plenty of time to dean up and have tea and go out to my classes at the southampton polytechnic i did mathematics and mechanics and engineering workshop that winter and it kept me pretty busy on top of that i read two technical books about aeroplanes that i got out of the library and understood about a quarter of them when the spring came round i got a good report and i took it along with me in april when i went to littlehampton to join up with the circus again i showed it to mr dixon and he showed it to sir alan and he sent for me and asked me if id like to be an apprentice with the ground engineers that meant id be working on the aeroplanes all the time my i was pleased and so were dad and mum when i wrote home i liked humping the coal all right but it wasnt half as much fun as working on an aeroplane being an apprentice didnt mean that i did anything very difficult upon the aeroplanes i still had the job of cleaning out the cabins and washing off the oil from fuselages and wings but there were also sparking plugs to be cleaned and filters to be checked and as time went on i got to working with the ground engineers more and more i still did the gretna green girl with connie twice each day although i had begun to shave and this brings me to connie when i joined the show the first year it never struck me that there was anything unusual about connie after all the whole show was a bit unusual from start to finish and connie was a part of it the fact that he looked strange was just another one among a mass of new strange things he looked a bit foreign he was about my age but taller and rather thin he had straight black hair and a yellowish tinge to his skin in spite of that he had firm wellcut features he was a goodlooking striking chap he was a darned good friend to me right from the first once one of the pilots irritated over something that connie had or hadnt done said wheres that bloody chink it was a surprise to me at the time but when he said that i thought of the chinese laundry at the corner of our street at home and i could see what he meant connie was much taller than either of the two men in the laundry and hed got a leaner look about his face but he did look a bit chinese when you came to think of it still that didnt mean a thing to me connie was just like any other boy except that he knew a good bit more than most of my other friends he was an apprentice like me but hed started a bit higher on the ladder hed been to a good school sir alan had had some trouble at penang on his first pioneering flight out to australia and connies father had helped him i think thats how connie came to be an apprentice in the air circus connie and i became very close friends perhaps because our backgrounds were so different our gretna green turn brought us very dose together in more senses than one we were always thinking up new gags for it most of which sir alan stopped us doing after the first time because he said they were too rude again that second summer we went all over the british isles staying a day in each place and giving two shows each day there was never a whole day off in an air circus like that you take your weekends in the winter we were improvising all the time to keep the aircraft in the air we had plenty of tools and good materials to work with but all the work had to be done out in the open field it was a grand training for an engineer because in each emergency you had to work out quick what was the best way to tackle it with the facilities at your disposal ive changed an engine many a time in the lee of a haystack by lashing up a sheerlegs of scaffold poles over the nose of the machine and borrowing the farmers tractor to pull the wire rope like a crane its not quite true to say that we had no time off however we often stayed at the same place over the weekend we had the afternoon and evening shows on sunday as usual but there was never very much to do on sunday morning connie sometimes used to go to church but connie was unusual i cant remember that anybody else did i knew more about church than most boys in our street because until my voice broke i was a choir boy at st johns i never talked about it on the circus because it sounds a bit sissy to say youve been a choir boy but i was i wouldnt have been but for mum she said that if id got a good voice it was my duty to use it and she made me go i never got anything for it but the outing to the isle of wight each summer and when my voice broke i got out of it if id been working in southampton mum would have made me join up as a tenor when my voice steadied down but the air circus got me out of that of course it wasnt worth doing just for the winter months the thing that interested me in connies churchgoing was that he just went to any old church there was he went to the nearest whether it was anglican or methodist or presbyterian or roman catholic he went to a synagogue one time at wolverhampton if it was raining or if wed had too much beer on saturday night he wouldnt go at all but if it was a nice fine morning and nothing particular to do hed ask somebody where the nearest church was and go to it i asked him once if it was all right just going into any church like that he grinned and said blowed if i know ive never been chucked out id be scared of doing the wrong thing i remarked however do you know what to do in a synagogue just sit at the back and watch what other people do he said if they start doing anything comic like going up to the altar or anything like that i just sit still and watch dont they mind you doing that i dont think so a roman catholic priest came up one time as i was going out and asked me who i was i told him i was just looking like in a shop he didnt mind a bit he collected churches like another boy might collect cigarette cards or matchbox covers the gem of his collection was at woking where he found a mosque to go to he had a bit of a job getting to that one because the big day at a mosque is on a friday but he was a very good apprentice and a hard worker so the foreman let him go once i remember i asked connie what he really was church of england or presbyterian or what blowed if i know he said i was born in penang and my father was a buddhist but he died four years ago and then we came to england i was church of england at school i stared at him wheres penang just by malaya he told me but we dont live there now mother brought us to england when my father died she was born in irkutsk so shes greek orthodox connie knew an awful lot more than me of course and i didnt want to go on looking stupid so i let irkutsk go the greek part stayed in my mind and i remember months afterwards looking at a map of greece in the public library trying to find irkutsk where connies mother had been born but all that came later at the time i only asked him is your mum in england now he shook his head shes in california at a place called san diego with my sister mother got married again it was quite outside my range of course california was somewhere abroad where they made syrup of figs oh i said vaguely i was young of course and i was loaded down with new experiences until i joined the circus id never been more than five miles from my own street in southampton and id got an awful lot to learn i must have seemed slow at times because it wasnt till that second season was half over that i realized what being an apprentice meant it meant that id got a regular job that i wasnt going to be laid off in the winter like i had before connie and i were going to spend the winter at littlehampton working on the aeroplanes overhauling them for their certificates of airworthiness so theyd be all ready for the spring the circus ran for four years and that was the end the last season wasnt so good as the first three had been and it looked as if the public were getting a bit tired of it sir alan packed it up and went on with his development work on refuelling aeroplanes in flight he was very good with us apprentices he went to a great deal of trouble to find us jobs in other places in the aircraft industry he got me a fine apprenticeship with airservice ltd at morden aerodrome just south of london overhauling and repairing aeroplanes in a big way in a grand modern shop i owe a great deal to sir alan over that i had to say goodbye to connie then like me he wanted to go on and take his ground engineers tickets but neither of us could do that till we were twentyone years old he was going out to california to his mother he told me that there were aircraft factories out there in san diego and he wanted to get into one of those i was very sorry to part from connie because wed been together for three and a half years and had a lot of fun although he knew such a lot more than i did he was never stuck up about it being with him in those early years was very good for me we said wed keep in touch by writing and of course we never did i went to airservice in the autumn of and i stayed with them for ten years it was a good firm to work for and i got on well i got my a and c certificates for the maintenance of engines and airframes as soon as i was old enough in and i got the b and d certificates for complete overhauls in by that time i was earning over ten pounds a week including overtime i didnt spend it on girls and i didnt spend much of it on beer i spent it mostly on flying the firm had a scheme that gave cheap flying instruction to its staff and i took my first private pilots a licence in by the middle of the war when pilots were short and regulations lax i was test flying the tiger moths we had rebuilt after a crash as a regular thing i used to finish the inspection in the shop and then just take it out and fly it it saved such a lot of time and bother looking for a test pilot i stayed a civilian all the war working at my normal job of repairing crashed aircraft i was put in charge of a repair section in and got to foremans rank in the firm had to strengthen the repair side of their branch in egypt and they asked me if id go out there for a bit i was twentyeight years old and up till then id never been out of england of course i said id go it was on account of that i married beryl cousins ive not said much about girls up till now because to tell the truth i never had a lot to do with them till then i was so stuck into my job and so keen on aeroplanes and flying that girls passed me by or i passed them by whichever way you look at it till i got my b and d tickets i was working at classes three or four evenings every week then when id got them and might have had time to look around a bit and have a bit of fun the war came that meant that i was working overtime every night till eight oclock and sometimes later than that which sort of limits the time that a chap has to look around and pick himself a girl maybe when its like that hes apt to pick the first that comes along i lodged in a suburban road at morden and beryl lived two doors up the road from me and worked in the stores at airservice ltd she was a sort of clerk there working on the inwards and the outwards files she was a slight pale girl with ashblond hair we used to walk to work together in the mornings we got to having lunch together and tea if she was working late all in the works canteen and saturdays id take her to the pictures or wed go dancing at a palais after six months of that we came to the conclusion that we were in love and wed get married when the work let up a bit we didnt realize we both loved something better than each other i was in love with aeroplanes and she was in love with love i heard about this job one morning and when they said they wanted me to go out to egypt they said it would be for two years and id have to go in about three weeks time i met beryl at our usual table for lunch with other people all round us in the works canteen so i said to her eat up quick ive got something to tell you but not here we walked out on the grass up the aerodrome hedge when wed finished it was september and a lovely sunny day i told her all about it as we walked along by the scrap dump of wrecked airframes and engines and she said oh tom have you really got to go i hadnt got to but i wasnt going to miss that chance they put it to me pretty firm i said you dont get much choice these days she turned to me and her eyes were full of tears i thought we were going to get married about christmas thats what we said i was a bloody fool of course but one does these things i couldnt bear to see her cry i took both her hands in mine i know i said what say if we get married now before i go she said softly oh tom do you want us to be married i wasnt really sure i did but i was twentyeight and id never got that far with any girl before i said do i want to and took her in my arms and kissed her after a bit we got to thinking about ways and means there wasnt time for doing it the regular way with banns called in church and all that we should have to do it with a special licence and i found out pretty soon that beryl knew all about those girls study things of that sort more than men i wouldnt be able to set her up in a house in the time wed got and she didnt want to leave her job at airservice because if she did and didnt have a baby shed only have got directed into something else since it was wartime so we fixed that wed get married as soon as we could and shed go on working just the same and living with her people we went and saw her dad and mum that evening and tpld them all about it they were pleased all right because i was making good money and i think they felt that i was likely to get on next day was friday and i asked for the day off and took beryl down to southampton and introduced her to my folks and ten days after that we got married at a registrars office we got a week at southsea for our honeymoon it was a fine september that year so that although there wasnt much to do we could sit on the front and look at the ships going in and out of portsmouth harbour and the bostons and the spitfires going out on strikes i think beryl was happy and if i was thinking of the work more than a man ought to do upon his honeymoon well it was wartime and the flying schools were waiting for the tiger moths i mended to train pilots beryl understoodat least i think she did looking back upon it now it must have been a poor sort of a honeymoon it was wartime in england and everything was short there was complete darkness at night of course there on the coast and the cafјs and the dance halls and the picture houses were full of men and girls in uniform a civilian didnt get much priority you couldnt get down to the beach to bathe except in one little place because of the antiinvasion barbed wire and tank obstacles and land mines and there werent any motor coach tours or steamer trips or concert parties on the beach or anything like that this was all normal to us because thats the way things were in england then and we didnt grieve over what we couldnt have but when i think about the sort of honeymoon i could have given her if it had been in peacetime i feel a bit sore it might have made a difference it was better for me than for beryl i had egypt ahead of me i was going out to an important job in a warm spacious country into all the glamour of a successful war in north africa there would be luxury in cairo and sunshine on the desert and the pyramids and the nile and travel to our various outstations in africa and persia and iraq for me this week in southsea was the last of the drab misery of war in england ahead of beryl was a long indefinite vista of it cold and monotonous in the same job and lonely with me away we neither of us thought about it like thator if i thought of it i didnt talk about it but thats the way it was we didnt look ahead i cant remember that we ever discussed where we were going to live after the war or anything like that it didnt seem to be much good with things as they were the war had been going on for four years for four years we had been directed where to work and we were getting out of the way of thinking about our future for ourselves this job in egypt was to be for two years and after that i should come back to wartime england so we thought and it would be the same except that everything would be scarcer and more difficult than ever we never looked ahead to think about the peace that i remember i was flown to egypt by boac it wasnt possible for beryl to come and see me off because the time and place of departure were secret the best that she could do was to come down with me to morden underground station late one afternoon as i carried my suitcase down from the digs we walked silent together down the suburban streets on that last walk we didnt seem to have anything left to say to each other maybe she was only realizing then what the separation was going to mean she hadnt got a lot of imagination by the entrance to the station we stopped and looked at each other it was raining a bit and the red buses starting and stopping at the halt just by us made a great clatter with their diesels i put down my suitcase and took her hands well girl i said this is it she was pretty down in the mouth write to me a lot tom she said ill be ever so lost without you cheer up i said ill write as soon as ever i get there but dont get worried if you dont hear for a while if theyre sending letters round the cape it might take anything up to six weeks i wont be able to sleep till i hear i grinned bet you do tuck a bolster in beside you and make believe im there and youll sleep all right she smiled though she was very near to tears now stop it i took her in my arms it didnt matter that there were people all around at the bus stop you saw this every hour of every day with people going off on draft its only for two years girl i said softly itll soon be gone it sounds like as if it was for ever she said miserably there was no sense in prolonging the agony it was only making things more difficult for her and wed said all that there was to say we kissed and kissed again and then i said ill have to go now girl look after yourself she released me you look after yourself cheeroh tom she was crying now in earnest i squeezed her hand clumsily cheer up girl its not for so long and with that i turned and picked the suitcase up and left her and went and got my ticket i looked back over the turnstile and she was there waving goodbye to me with tears running down her face and i waved back to her and then i had to turn round and go down to the train i went in a liberator squashed in with about twenty others in the rear fuselage we took off at about ten oclock that night from an aerodrome somewhere in the south we didnt know what aerodrome it was nor where we were going to we flew on for about eight hours and then in the dawn we landed we couldnt see anything out of the aeroplane and when we got out on to the tarmac we found that we were in a sandy sort of place with palm trees and white houses they told us it was tripoli we werent allowed outside the aerodrome they gave us breakfast in a tent while the liberator was refuelled and we took off again for cairo we landed at almaza in the middle of the day and it was good and hot i had english clothes on and i envied the chaps working on the aircraft in just a pair of shorts and no shirt i got passed through the various formalities and then i went and reported to the manager of airservice ltd on the aerodrome that two years was a fine experience for me i was in charge of airframe repairs and general maintenance i lived in a small hotel about a mile from the airport and i had my office at the back of the hangar we operated a large number of aircraft all over the near east and northeast africa and i was responsible for keeping them in the air all except engine overhauls which were the business of another chap if a rapide ran off the runway and bent its undercarriage at luxor or at lydda the responsibility for getting it into the air again was mine if it was a simple and straightforward repair i would send one of my ground engineers to it by air or truck but if it was a difficult or complicated job i would go myself and see the work put in hand the way i wanted it we had an old hornet twoseater that i used to go in if the journey was anything less than five hundred miles but there was always a difficulty about finding a pilot who could spare the time and after a while the firm agreed that i should fly myself about in this thing it wasnt worth much if i crashed it and i didnt want any flying pay or insurance on these repair jobs flying myself or being flown by a pilot i travelled very widely in the last two years of the war i went to beirut and baghdad and aleppo and nicosia and down south as far as khartoum and addis ababa i got to know about syrian and iraqi and egyptian aircraft hands what they could do and what they couldnt what days they had to take off for their religion or their festivals and why i tried to learn about all that its no good going around and saying that those boys are just a lot of monkeys that they arent reliable and you cant use them you can use them all right if you take the trouble to learn about them and if you do that youll find the work is liable to come out a good deal cheaper because their wages are much less i got some experience of negotiating with officials too that was a type of job id never done before whenever parts for a repair had to be taken into syria or lebanon or iraq there were customs duties to be paid or talked out of in the usual way id get to aleppo or some place like that and find that the repair parts id sent up had got stuck in a bonded warehouse the government were asking for a hundred and fifty pounds before they would release them and the ground engineer had got angry and had insulted the minister for air there was nobody to straighten all that out but me and i got into the way of taking it easy going to drink a cup of coffee with the minister saying what a happy little town it was and how my wife would like it if we came to live there and sending over a big bouquet of flowers for the ministers wife id usually get the parts next day without any trouble at all and nothing to pay the most i ever had to do was to fix up a joyride for the ministers children when the aircraft was flying again i used to write to beryl regularly once a week wherever i was telling her as much about what id been doing as i thought would pass the censor she used to write to me but not so often it was once a week at first but then it got a bit irregular and sometimes i wouldnt hear anything for three weeks and then two letters would come together written within a couple of days of each other she never seemed to have much to say but that was natural because life in england was all just the same olten most of a letter was about some film shed seen there was one of those long gaps in her letters nearly a month about october when id been out in egypt just a year air mail was coming through all right i got a bit angry because id written regularly myself and i didnt see why she couldnt find time to write to me so i sent her a sharp one nothing happened for a bit and then about ten days later i got a letter from her dad it read dear tom weve been having trouble here im sorry to say and beryl wants me to write and tell you before she writes herself and her ma and i think thats best too its been very dull for her since you went away and she went up to the west end some time ago and got in with some polish officers very nice and well behaved she says she took to going about with one of them a captain wysock and the long and the short of it is tom shes going to have a baby in january i know this will be a great blow to you and i cant tell you how sorry we all are captain wysock has been down to see us and we had a long talk he was heartbroken about you but we talked it all out and we thought that it would be best if there was a divorce and he was to marry beryl they are very much in love and that is what they want beryl will be writing to you in a day or so but we thought i had better write and tell you first captain wysock comes of a very highborn family his father is a count and has big estates near a place called jabinka and a town house in warsaw he has been very generous to beryl and we feel that as things have turned out a divorce would be the fairest thing all round and i hope you will think so too beryl wants me to say she sends you her love and we all send our sympathy in what must be a shock to you but i am sure that it will all be for the best your affectionate fatherinlaw albert cousins i was at damascus when this letter came to cairo and i didnt get it till i got back to egypt a few days later by that time the letter from beryl had just come in so i got them both together that one read darling tom i saw dads letter before he sent it off and i have waited a bit before i wrote so as you should get his first i dont know what you must be thinking tom and believe me i wouldnt have had things happen like this for the world its such a mix up but im sure the best way to get it straight now is for you to divorce me i couldnt come back and live with you again not after what has happened not even if you wanted me which i suppose you dont not now feodor and i are very much in love and we want to get married so if you divorce me that will be best and youll be free to look for someone else im so terribly sorry its turned out like this i never thought a thing like this would ever happen to me i wish you could meet feodor tomhes such a dear his family is terribly rich with a big castle in the country and everything i do hope theyll approve of me he hasnt seen them since the war began but he knows theyre all right after the war when were married were going there to live hes given me the most lovely engagement ring diamonds and emeralds but first of all weve got to get the divorce dont be miserable about all this tom i know its all for the best your loving beryl i was up to the eyes in work at that time i read these letters through with my mind half occupied with the problems of getting enough aircraft serviceable to maintain our scheduled services and they were just another thing to me it was like when youre counting on an aircraft being finished for the morning flight to khartoum and an engineer comes up at six oclock in the evening and tells you he needs a righthand contact breaker and theyve only got lefthand ones in the store and theyve been telephoning all round and there arent any righthand ones in cairo beryl and her boy friend in my mind took their turn in the queue with all my other worries and must wait for attention till i got the decks cleared a bit at the same time i was sick and angry when i got these letters because thered been a lot of this sort of thing going on in england somebody once told me that ten per cent of the wives of men serving overseas had been unfaithful to them now i was in with that ten per cent in the brief moments that i had to think about my own affairs that day i wondered how in hell she expected me to set about a divorce in a foreign country like egypt in the middle of all my work in wartime and then i wondered if they were all mad to go believing such a transparent cock and bull story as this polish soldier had told them about his father being a count and huge estates and all that it was a crazy miserable business that theyd written out to plague me with the only thing to do was to put it out of my mind and get on with the work i had to go to luxor next day where a young fool of a pilot had run one of our ansons into the tail of a dakota of transport command i had to clear up the accumulation of paper work on my desk before going off again in the morning i worked on late that night it was after ten oclock when i had time for my own affairs and i was dead tired but i had to write to beryl because i should be away for another two or three days i got the letters out and read them through and i was bitterly angry once again that they should plague me so i pulled a sheet of paper to me and i wrote darling girl i got your letter and your dads together when i got back here after being away for a few days i wont say what i think because you probably know that but ill say this i think you must be bloody well daft all the lot of you first of all ill bet you a hundred quid to a sausage that this polish officers father isnt a count and that he hasnt got any estates and that the ring he gave you is either stolen or phoney for gods sake snap out of it and act like a grownup woman and tell your dad to do that too youve been sucked in and fallen for the oldest story in the world my girl thats whats happened to you now about this divorce you want i dont know how in hell you expect me to get you a divorce from here even if i wanted to and ive not made up my mind about that yet what do you think this isthe court of chancery with lawyers going around in wigs and gowns like that ill tell you what it is its a bloody hot dirty dusty aerodrome no fans and blinding sun and grit all over my desk ive come five hundred miles from one just like it today and im going off to another like it tomorrow theres no english lawyers here and no english law if its a divorce youre thinking of youll have to wait till i get back to england in a year from now and then ill see if im prepared to give it you some of you girls seem to think you can get a divorce just by putting a penny in the slot you think this over a bit more and then write and tell me how youre going on if i was in england now wed soon find put if this polish officer is a count or not and youd find out what the end of a strap feels like my girl im not at all sure that youd find out what a divorce feels like you cant just pick up being married and put it down like that you think it over a bit more ever your loving husband tom considering this letter it seems to me that i said everything that was in my mind except that i still loved her i didnt think to tell her about that perhaps i thought she knew nothing much happened then she didnt write again and nor did i i was very sore about this polish officer and till that was all cleaned up i hadnt got much to say to her if id been in england id have cleaned it up fast enough i did sit down once or twice to write but i never finished a letter i could never think of anything to say that wouldnt be pleading with her for our marriage and i was damned if id do that i had an arrangement to send her money through the bank deducted from my salary when it was paid in and this went on as usual she still took my fifteen pounds a month in spite of her polish count with his large estates i was content to leave the matter so i was far too busy in those cairo years of war to bother about any other girl i used to wonder sometimes if i was married or not and how it was all going on and then id put it out of my mind time enough to start and sort out that one when i got home i think i felt that so long as she went on taking my money there was nothing that couldnt be ironed out when finally we got together the end of the german war came and the end of the japanese war but there was still a vast amount of transport needed in the near east and i had to serve my full time out it wasnt till the middle of november that i finally got a date for my air passage home and then i wrote to her quite shortly and told her i was coming and id come and see her at her dads house as soon as i landed in england probably on the tuesday of the following week i landed in england on the day id said and went up to london on the airline bus it was pretty late in the afternoon when we got into town and i decided to stay in london that night rather than go down to morden there and then i didnt want to have to stay in the same house if this polish officer was living with her or anything like that i took my bag to a hotel i knew about just off the euston road that wasnt too expensive and i got a room there i went out and walked about the streets after my tea down tottenham court road to cambridge circus and to piccadilly the vbombs had made a good bit of blitz damage since i was there but london seemed much the same as ever i was the one who was different when i left england i hadnt been too sure of myself i was good enough on the bench or in the hangar but it always seemed to me that other people knew much more about the world and business than i did coming back after my two years in the east i felt selfconfident i knew that i could hold my job alongside anyone and teach them a thing or two besides when i worked in england i was just tom cutter in airservice ltd when i left cairo id been mr cutter to everybody for a long time from the managing director down i was looking forward to meeting beryl again and i wasnt much worried about this pole i reckoned i could sort out that one without too much trouble she couldnt be married to him and now that the war was over hed be going back to his own country the baby might be a problem but i dont think i really held that much against her i was still fond of beryl and quite prepared to make the best of things and fall in love with her again there wasnt any other girl i went down by underground after breakfast next morning and got out at morden station and walked up through the streets to her home it was a fine morning for the end of november with a pale wintry sort of sun i was still in light clothes and a raincoat only and i remember walking quick because it was chilly i went in at the little front garden gate and knocked on the front door and her young brother came and opened it morning fred i said remember me he hesitated and i looked at him more closely it was almost as if he had been crying and then he said oh yes how are you tom im fine i said beryl in wait a mo he said ill go and tell mum and with that he turned and fairly scuttled off into the kitchen at the back of the house i waited at the door it was bound to be a bit awkward for them but i didnt care i hadnt made the awkwardness i could hear a lot of whispering going on in the kitchen and then her mother came out to me wiping her hands nervously upon her apron and when i saw her face i knew that shed been crying too and for the first time i felt fear of what was coming morning tom she said hesitantly you didnt get our letter i shook my head no she opened the door of the sittingroom come in here she led the way in i wish father was here to tell you but hes just stepped out what is it i asked her i think i knew by that time what it was its beryl she said the tears began to trickle down her cheeks she did it with the oven with the gas some time in the middle of the night when we was all asleep she was weeping unrestrainedly now her dad told her itd be all right she sobbed we all told her but she was terribly afraid of meeting you and i was but a dog and a mad one to despise the gold of her hair and the grey of her eyes john masefield there wasnt any count of course and there werent any estates at jabinka or anywhere else captain wysock had disappeared one day and her dad had gone up to london to the polish embassy after a time to ask about him he found that he had been drafted out to italy he had been a waiter at a hotel in warsaw before the war and hed got a wife and family out there they never heard any more of him the ring was genuine enough and was worth about sixty quid i often wondered where that came from he beat it soon after the baby was born in february or march her dad wanted to write and tell me but beryl wouldnt let him i think she was too proud to want to come crawling back to me as soon as hed left her flat she told her people straight to let her affairs alone shed sort them out in time the way she wanted to so they shut up and probably that was the best thing they told me that they thought that in a general sort of way shed been looking forward to me coming home although she didnt tell them much when my letter came however saying that id be home in a week they said she seemed to go all to pieces first she wanted to go away and not meet me and then there wasnt anywhere convenient for her to go to and then she said shed have to meet me some time so shed better get it over they said she didnt know what to do she wasnt sleeping much they thought shed come down to breakfast one day and say shed made up her mind to go away and then by dinner time they said she seemed to have forgotten about that and was wondering if the butcher would put by a sheeps heart for them because she said i was always partial to heart for dinner if it was on the menu at the canteen they said that she was much calmer on the last day sort of quietlike and they went to bed quite happy about her they never heard anything in the night the baby slept in her room of course and at about six in the morning they heard it crying which was normal but as she didnt get up and attend to it her ma got up after a bit and went in and she wasnt in her room and she hadnt been to bed her ma called her dad and went downstairs and when they opened the door the kitchen was full of gas her dad held his breath and dashed in and turned it off at the oven and opened the back door and got out into the garden and then they had to wait a quarter of an hour before they could get in to her her dad went down the road to the call box and telephoned the police she had put a cushion in the oven and put her head on that and lain down to die she had a copy of the picturegoer in her hand open at an article about anna neagle and michael wilding the great lovers there was no letter or anything like that her father was inclined to be apologetic to me i dunno if we should have written to tell you after he went off he said at the time it seemed the best thing to let time go by a bit like we knew youd be home before so long and we thought thingsld settle down to comfort him i said i couldnt have done much if id kown and while i said it of course i knew that i was lying i could have done one thing i could have written and told her that i loved her they had the inquest the day after i arrived and i went to it with her dad and mum her dad had to give evidence ut our marriage and this captain wysock and the baby me coming home and how he found her the coroner me if id written to her lately and i said no and told about the first letter when i said i wasnt going to divorce her till shed thought it over a bit longer the doctor gave formal evidence about the cause of death and then the coroner summed it all up we have here one of those unfortunate cases for which the war is largely responsible he said the evidence is perfectly clear the deceased woman was unfaithful to her husband during his absence overseas and gave birth to a child born out of wedlock she was deserted by her lover himself a married man so that in any event no divorce and marriage with her lover would have been possible her husband seems to have behaved with commendable restraint and wrote nothing to her which would have led her to take her life and her family appear to have treated her with sympathy and understanding the deceased appears to have been the victim of her own conscience and as the time for the return of her husband drew near she became mentally upset i find that the deceased committed suicide while the balance of her mind was temporarily deranged he turned to us with fishlike stupid eyes blinking behind his spectacles i must express my sympathy with the husband and the parents of the deceased woman with her dad and mum i said thank you sir mechanically and as i did so indignation rose in me that such a fool should be a coroner because i killed her slowly like a chap might do with small doses of arsenic over a period of years i started killing her when i married her without giving her a home a bit was said about the baby and a woman a police court missionary or somebody like that came up and talked about it to her dad and mum they wanted to keep it and bring it up as a grandchild which of course it was and that seemed the best thing to do then the inquest was over and we went back for the funeral which happened in the afternoon i left her parents at the cemetery when it was all over they wanted me to go back home with them for tea but i said i had to get down to southampton that night i hadnt but i had got to be alone i went back to my cheap hotel near euston station and went up into the bare white bedroom and sat down on the bed i must have sat there for two hours or more just staring at the wall ahead of me you can only do a thing for the first time once and that goes for falling in love you may do it over and over again afterwards but its never the same when you chuck away whats given to you that first time its chucked away for good i started chucking it away when i married beryl and went off to egypt leaving her alone you can be very very cruel just by acting with restraint and everyone will say what a good chap you are you can kill somebody just by doing nothing and be complimented at the inquest you can be absolutely right all through and what youll get for it is a memory of happiness that might have been if you had acted a bit kinder i might have dozed a bit that nighti dont know i know that i heard every hour strike from a church clock outside my room i had to go and report to the company next day and that of course was at morden just by her house i had to go down again to the same underground station and there were the same red buses rattling the same diesel engines at the bus stop by the entrance where we had said goodbye she had said ill be terribly lost without you she had been i stood staring at the place by the metroland poster where i had stood holding her in my arms stood there in a daze i had told her that it was only for two years she had said miserably it sounds like as if it was for ever it had been it was there that she had stood waving me goodbye i turned away and walked up the main road through the shopping part before turning off up aerodrome lane to the works and now i was scared stiff that id meet her dad or mum out doing the shopping or some of her family i dont know why it was but i was afraid to meet them and i knew as i walked up to the works that i could never work in that place again id never have the courage to walk round those streets as we had walked together or go to the picture house that we had used or lunch in the works canteen where we had lunched the managing director mr norman evans he was very to me i think he must have heard about my trouble because when i said that id been back two days and id had personal things to see to first he said quickly i know cutter things get a bit tangled up when ones away for a long time im very sorry indeed and then he went on to talk about the work so that i didnt have to answer the business was all upset of course because it had been expanded greatly in the war years with war orders and now those had come to an end and it was having to contract again its easy enough to expand an aviatipn business but its bloody difficult to get it back to what it was before mr evans couldnt have been nicer i want to tell you how much i appreciate the job you did in egypt he said weve got to make a lot of changes now what i want you to do is to take over the whole of our repair and servicing side in the british isleshere and at bristol and at belfast it was a firstclass job of course as good as any i could hope to get i was only thirtyone years old the main office would be here sir i suppose i asked id do most of the work from here and travel to bristol and belfast thats right he said i thought you might take over mr holdens old office ill have that room next to it divided into two and you can have your secretary in there unless you want her in the room with you then he went on to talk about the salary which was good and as we talked i knew that it would never work unless i came to work each day by helicopter id have to use the same streets and the same underground and the same passages and roads about the works that i had walked with beryl i said presently ive got a months leave due to me sir can i take that now thats right he said he glanced at the calendar oh well that takes us up to christmas suppose we say youll start immediately after that i thanked him and agreed and then he took me for a walk around the works and we talked about the layout of the place and what parts we would shut down or use as stores and how the rest of it should be reorganised i had only half my mind on the job at every corner there was some new place i had forgotten about where i walked and talked with beryl in the lunch hour when finally mr evans asked me to stay and lunch in the canteen i couldnt take it any longer and i said that if hed excuse me id get off down to my home in southampton that afternoon as i walked down to the underground looking furtively around in case there were some of the cousins family about i knew it was impossible i couldnt go back there to work id have been off my rocker in a fortnight i got my bag and paid my bill at the hotel and went to waterloo and caught a train down to southampton i got there in the late afternoon and took a bus to the gas works and walked home from there our street between the gas works and the docks hadnt suffered much in the blitz old mrs tickles house had gone and mrs tickle with it but that was the only damage actually in our street and that had been done before i went to egypt i was surprised at how small it all looked now i knew it was dirty because you cant keep houses dean between the gas works and the docks but i had not realised till then how small the houses were how small and mean the shops as i got near our house i could see that an upstairs window was broken and shut up with windowlite tacked over the frame they had written to tell me about that done by a flying bomb that fell into montgomery street in july thought that while i was home id build up the frame and get a bit of glass and do that for them even if it was the landlords job i went in at the street door that opened straight into the livingroom and there was ma laying the table for tea it was getting on for five oclock when dad would be knocking off at the docks i put my suitcase down im back ma i said quietly she said oh tom youre looking so brown and when shed kissed me she said we know about poor beryl tom were all ever so sorry how did you get to know i asked mrs cousins wrote and told us she replied there was a bit about it in the paper too its been a sad homecoming for you boy thats right i said heavily nothing to be done about it now though and the least said the better she took the hint and she must have dropped a word to dad because they never bothered me with questions we had plenty of other things to talk about though specially when dad came home id written to them regularly while i was away and theyd got young teds school atlas and marked on it all the places that id been to and it made a sort of spiders web all over the near east i had some photographs that id collected from time to time and after wed done the washing up i got these out and showed them and told them all about it and my sister joyce came in with her husband joe morton who kept the greengrocers shop in allenby street just round the corner and he brought a couple of bottles of beer in and i sat talking and telling them about it all till nearly ten oclock when they had gone and dad and i were sitting with a final cigarette before the fire and ted and ma had gone up to bed dad said to me what comes next boy i dont know i told him about the job i had been offered that morning and i told him something about my great unwillingness to go back to morden he asked whats the pay like nine hundred a year i told him he opened his eyes thats twice what i get three times what i ever got before the war youre getting on in the world boy i know i said its a good job and id be a bloody fool to turn it down but its no good working in a place thats going to send you round the bend youre looking tired he said youll feel different when youve had a bit of a rest how long leave have you got theyre giving me a month i told him till after christmas i havent had a day off since i went out to egypt he said in wonder i never had moren a weeks holiday in all my life are they paying you my cairo pay goes on till the end of december i said do you spend it all i shook my head ive got a good bit saved up i hesitated i was saving up for furniture ted was the only one of the family still living at home he was just eighteen and due to go off for his military service pretty soon he worked for a firm of contractors and dad had had him taught to drive so he was all set to be a truck driver we had three bedrooms in that house when i was a boy it had been dad and mum upstairs in one room and the girls in the other and for us boys there was a room downstairs built out behind the scullery in the garden it was a good big room and it had need to be because four of us had slept together there when i was a boy in two beds ted had got the girls room upstairs and dad and mum had titivated up the big old room for me colourwashed it and all when they heard i was coming home theyd gone to a lot of trouble over it working at it over the weekend i slept there that night comforted a bit by memories of childhood and although i stayed awake some time i did sleep i went out early next day and got a chisel and a brassbacked saw and started on that window i worked on it all that day and the next and got it finished and glazed for them with a coat of white lead paint i did a lot of odd jobs round the house in the next few days and got an electric water heater and installed it over the sink in the scullery for ma while i worked at these things i was making up my mind what i was going to do by the end of the first day i think i knew what it was to be i took a bus one day and went out to the airport at eastleigh theres a firm there kenningtons who do quite a big business in overhauling and servicing aircraft i had thought once or twice of putting in for a job with them now i went to the sales side to a young chap called warren that i knew slightly and asked if he knew where i could get a foxmoth the foxmoth is a de havilland type obsolete now it was produced about it has a little cabin for the passengers and an open cockpit for the pilot and an engine of a hundred and thirty horsepower mine cruised at about ninety miles an hour it would carry the pilot and two passengers comfortably or four passengers if they were very little ones and if there was a good long runway to take off on with the overload the type hasnt been in production for a long time and there werent many of them left but warren said he thought he knew of one in leicester dismantled and unused for years and wanting a lot of work done on it we got on the telephone from his office and found that it was there all tight and about to be put out on the scrap heap i went to leicester next day and bought it with a secondhand engine for a hundred and twenty pounds and arranged for it to be sent down to eastleigh on a truck thats how i started in the air transport business i was headed for the persian gulf id been to abadan and basra and kuwait and as far down as bahrein for a night and id seen conditions there i had an idea that a chap with a little aeroplane for charter that could land on any decent bit of desert might do all right for himself theres no way to get about that country except by plane or car and travelling by car on those sand tracks is no fun at all there was nobody doing charter work in that part that i knew of i had a hunch that if i went there with a foxmoth i might make a living anyway it would be something different if i lost my money id always got my trade to fall back on kenningtons were very helpful i made a deal with them to pay for overheads and for any labour that i used and when the foxmoth came they put it in a corner of a hangar and let me get on with the work myself with a boy to help me they knew i hadnt got much money the plane wasnt in too bad condition i got it all stripped down and had the air registration board inspector to agree what wanted doing and by christmas time id got the airframe finished all except the final spraying i was working on it by halfpast seven every morning and i never left till eight oclock at night i hadnt got much time to spare because with every day my money was running out i wrote to mr evans at morden about the middle of december turning in my job i told him that it was for personal reasons that i didnt want to come back there and that i was going to do something totally different for a change he wrote me a very nice letter telling me to let them know if ever i wanted to come back into the repair business and with that i felt i had something behind me to fall back on i finished the engine and got it through a test run on the bench about the end of the first week in january and got it installed in the aircraft a couple of days after that i made a test flight on january th and there was nothing then to do but the final spraypainting and lettering and make the arrangements for my journey to the gulf ma was good to me while i was working out at eastleigh on the foxmoth i used to go out there on a bicycle to save money six miles each way and sometimes i wouldnt be home till nearly ten oclock at night whatever time i came home there would be something hot for me in the oven and a kettle boiling ready for my tea and a bit of cheese or cake to eat after once while i was eating my supper ma said how long will you be away for this time tom i grinned at her three months i said ill be broke by that time and home looking for a job she was knitting and she went on for a minute i dont think so she said quietly i dont think youll go broke lots of people do go broke i said and doing less daft things than this im playing at i dont think you will she repeated i grinned at her again well ive never starved in the winter yet no and i dont think you will she knitted on in silence for a time this place bahrein where youre going to she said what sort of place is it how will you be living its a fairsized town i said an arab town of course there are some white people living therethe raf and the chaps in the government and then inland there are sort of special towns like awali run by the bahrein petroleum company where a lot of british and canadian engineers live with their families will you live there i shook my head i think theres an arab hotel in the town ill probably be there at first at any rate will there be any white girls there she asked i knew what she was getting at of course not one i said there might be some waafs with the air force but i wouldnt get a look in there try and find someone tom she said quietly i know you dont feel like it now and maybe thats right but i would like to see you settled comfortable in a nice home with a nice girl and some children dont give all of your life to your work blowed if i know where ill find the nice home but it wont be in bahrein i said nor the nice girl either but ill bear it in mind ma thats right she said just keep it in your mind i do want to see you settled and comfortable like your dad and i have been ma never wanted anything better than shed got she knew it was a lousy little house of course but it was home and near dads work and there she had lived all her married life and had her children and watched them grow up and get out into the world she never wanted anything better she had a happiness quite independent of the quality of her house its convenient for dads work and shes accustomed to it shell never move i finished off the foxmoth a few days after that and she really didnt look so bad with a new aluminium spray all over her and green registration letters and a broad green line running backwards down the fuselage from the prop i had had the cabin seats reupholstered too and replaced the scratched perspex in the windows so that by the time id done with her she looked almost new dad and mum came out to see her when she was finished one sunday and i took them up for a joyride over southampton then i was ready to start it was a bad time of the year to fly from england and the foxmoth was a very little aeroplane with no blind flying instruments or radio or anything like that on the day i wanted to start monday the st there was a dense fog and it would have been crazy to leave the ground even if the airport officers had let me which they wouldnt next day was better ma came out with me to eastleigh to see me off i got the aircraft out and ran the engine to warm her up and got my stuff through customs and went and made my flight plan at the control then i was ready to get in and go this is it mum i said ill be back in a year or so she kissed me goodbye tom she said look after yourself and dont go killing yourself or anything of that i wont do that mum i said smiling one always thinks of course those things cant happen to me dont forget what i was telling you about finding a nice girl i wont goodbye mum goodbye son i swung the little propeller and the engine fired and i went round and got into the cockpit clumsy in my leather coat then i waved to mum and taxied forward and the control gave me a green light and i moved to the end of the runway and took off from england im not going to say much about that trip out to bahrein there was nothing to make it interesting but my own inexperience and the inadequacy of the aircraft for so long a journey i could fly the thing all right but my total flying experience was only about five hundred hours and i didnt know a lot about navigation when i started i knew a bit more by the time i reached the persian gulf i had to land a good many times for fuel on the way the extreme range of the foxmoth was only about three hundred and fifty miles later on i fitted an extra tank i went by way of dinard and across france to cannes landing at tours and lyon from there i went to pisa and rome and brindisi and araxos and athens and from there to rhodes and cyprus i rested a day there and did a quick run round the engine and went on by way of damascus to a place called h in the middle of the desert then to baghdad basra kuwait and so to bahrein it took me eight days of trundling along at ninety miles an hour and i was tired when i got there i landed one evening on the big raf and civil aerodrome on muharraq island there was a hangar there and the place is an raf station but there were no service aircraft stationed there at that time several used to come through every week and at that time the boac flyingboats called there as well as several foreign lines it was a lovely summery evening as i taxied to the hangar after landing just like a warm day in june in england it had been very cold over most of the route until i got south of baghdad and then it had begun to warm up a couple of raf flying officers strolled out to the machine as i switched off in front of the hangar and i got out of the cockpit to talk to them come far one asked eastleigh i said they raised eyebrows and grinned how long did it take you i left england last tuesday i said eight days going on to india no i said i was thinking of staying here a bit and see if i can pick up a bit of charter work we talked about it for a time and then i left them and went up to the control tower to report when i got back to the machine the officers had got some airmen and we pushed the foxmoth into the hangar and got my stuff out of the cabin as we did so one of the young officers that i later came to know as mr allen said pity you werent here yesterday whys that i asked party of three engineers going down to muscat theyre consulting on a new water supply or something they came in by boac from england if youd been here you might have got a job what happened to them i asked went on down to sharjah in a chartered dhow they left this morning how far is it to sharjah about four hundred miles i wouldnt like to do that in a dhow itll take them three or four days how far on is it to muscat about two hundred and fifty miles they were going to charter a truck to take them from sharjah to muscat i said is there any fuel at muscat allen nodded we keep a small party there theres a strip there and theres hundredoctane fuel this was too rich and rare a fuel for my common little engine but i could mix it with motor car petrol i said can i get a telegram to sharjah offering this fox for charter to them i should think so theyll probably send it from the control tower if you ask them nicely over the r t theyre always talking to sharjah its more reliable than the land telegraph line thats always falling down i got the name of the leader of the party from him and the rest house where they would stay in sharjah and went back to the control tower the control officer knew all about this party and advised me to wire them care of the political agent i sent off a message detailing the accommodation and range of my foxmoth and offering it for charter for eight pounds an hour from bahrein i had a bit of luck then because one of the wireless operators dick reed spoke up and asked me where i was going to stay he lived in a house in muharraq town just outside the aerodrome with all the other operators they ran it as a chummery and they had a spare room normally occupied by a chap who was on leave they offered this to me and i moved in there that night and messed with the radio crowd at the aerodrome they made me a member of the sergeants mess which meant that i could go in there at any time for lunch or for tea if i was working late that was a great help in those early months i spent next day working on the aircraft to get it overhauled and fit for work after the flight out from england and in typing out circular letters five copies at a time to send out to the eighteen or twenty possible employers of a charter aircraft in the persian gulf i got a job next day to take two engineers from awali up to kuwait for a conference leaving early in the morning and coming back at night they paid my eight pounds an hour without blinking and the job went off all right so by the end of the day i was fiftysix pounds in pocket and everyone seemed satisfied specially me my eight pounds an hour worked out at about two bob a mile but we had travelled six hundred miles in seven hours flying time next a reply to my sharjah wire came in ordering me down to sharjah at once three days in an arab dhow had made my eight pounds an hour seem cheap to the water engineers even though i couldnt carry the party in one load but had to ferry them everywhere in two trips i took them down to muscat and stayed with them for a week in all i was away from bahrein for ten days and i got back at the end of the job with thirtyeight hours of flying done for them and a cheque for three hundred and four pounds in my pocket thats the way it went on all the time the persian gulf is full of industrynew oilfields being laid out wells being sunk pipelines being laid new docks and harbours being built all over the place there are no roads outside the towns and no railways and no coasting steamers and few motorboats the country is full of engineers to whom time is money and there are always people wanting to get about in a hurry the country is mostly sand desert good for landing a small aeroplane when you have learned the different look of hard and soft sand from the air and i was right up to the neck in work from the day i got there most of the oil companies had their own aircraft but there was plenty of work left over for me i have been asked sometimes what led me to the persian gulf what instinct told me that i could build up a business there its really perfectly simple if you go to the hottest and most uncomfortable place on the map youll find theres not a lot of competition in my experience most british pilots would rather go bankrupt than get prickly heat if you can find as i did a place where theres a lot of business for a modest charter operator thats also hot and uncomfortablewell its money for jam only of course you cant afford to pay the wages of a european staff to start with i had no staff at all for the first two months i did everything myself serviced the aircraft washed it down did the correspondence on my typewriter in the evening kept the accounts sent out the bills andeasiest of allflew the thing presently it got a bit too much and i got in help for the washing down i got an arab boy about fifteen years old called tarik and paid him twenty rupees a month about thirty bob at which he was highly delighted i taught him to wash and clean the aircraft while i worked upon the engine and when he wasnt doing that he was running errands for me to the soukthe market he wasnt fully employed in those early days of course but it was useful to have somebody to help with the refuelling it was three months before anyone woke up to the fact that i wasnt licensed to carry passengers for hire or reward i only had a private pilots licence an arb inspector turned up from egypt one day travelling around to see what was going on in civil aviation in the persian gulf and told me that i was breaking the law every time i went up i knew that of course but i hoped that nobody else did he was quite nice about it i told him that next day i had to take mr cassidy and mr hogaarts of the arabiansumatran petroleum company from abu ali to kuwait and if i didnt turn up theyd be stuck at abu ali and after some hesitation he agreed that i should make this one trip while we were talking the telephone went and it was johnson of the bahrein petroleum company wanting to book me for the following thursday to take a couple of his chaps down to dubai i knew johnson well and i never believe in hiding things up so i told him i was with a bloke who said i couldnt carry passengers for hire because id only got an a licence for christs sake he said let me have a talk to him i handed over the receiver and be talked to the inspector saying that they couldnt do without me and all that sort of thing the upshot of it was that it was agreed that i should do that one trip also and by next morning the inspector had thought it over and said that he would recommend that i should be granted a provisional b licence the point of this argument was that i could get a b licence without much difficulty on the basis of the experience i had but i could only go through the examinations for it in england and i was in the persian gulf i couldnt have got it when i left england i wasnt good enough i knew that i could keep them talking for some months and in the meantime i could go on operating and after that i might well find myself in england by that time it was dawning on me that i should have to make a quick trip back to england before long to buy another aeroplane there was far more work than i could cope with i was flying four or five hours practically every day and maintaining the aircraft and doing the correspondence for the rest of the time at that i was only tackling the binge of the job it wasnt only taking engineers about the country though i could have used a sixpassenger machine on that to supplement the foxmoth there was machinery to be taken out to places in the desert drilling machinery to be fetched in for reconditioning spare parts for trucks and bulldozersall sorts of things some of them requiring really large aircraft nobody was doing more than scratch the surface of the work that was offering and over and above the lot of it there were things like the transport of pilgrims to jiddah and transport of food to relieve the perennial famines in the hadramaut if i didnt nip in and get myself established someone else would come along and do it over my head on bahrein aerodrome the local raf and civil air staff began to get quite interested in me it was obvious at the end of the three months that licence or not i was on to a good thing and i was doing pretty well british ncos with the raf used to come along and watch me working with young tarik and suggest that they were due to be demobilised in a few months and what about a job i never engaged one of them i knew from my own experience the wages that you have to pay british engineers in the east and i knew that if once i started on that sort of wage bill id be bust in no time moreover i didnt need them i had all the ground engineers licences myself young tarik brown though he might be was keen and quite intelligent and i reckoned that with two or three more like him i could service several aircraft myself it was about this time that gujar singh turned up gujar singh was a young sikh who worked as a cashier in the bank of asia he might have been twentysix or twentyeight years old at that time and he was the fiercest thing i had ever seen being a good sikh he never cut his hair and he had a great black beard that stuck out forward from his chin in a manner that would have frightened any gunman trying to hold up the bank into a fit when i got to know him better and travelled with him i found that he slept every night with a bandage round his head to make his beard grow fiercely outwards from his face he wore european clothes and was usually dressed in a neat light grey tropical suit but he always wore a turban beneath this turban there was long black hair that reached down to his waist coiled round his head out of sight and fastened with a comb he wore a plain iron bangle on his wrist and beneath his jacket he wore a ceremonial dagger belted round his waist he didnt smoke or drink because of his religion gujar singh was always pleasant when i met him in the bank he was a smiling softspoken friendly young man in spite of his fierce appearance he was reserved and discreet he was evidently interested in me and in my business but he never asked questions once he did ask me what the weather had been like the day before when i had been down to yas island or somewhere and afterwards the remark stuck in my mind because it had been a thundery sort of day and something in the words he used were well informed for a bank clerk he seemed to speak my language my whole life at that time centred round my work if i had had more time i think i should have been very lonely i lived with the four radio operators but i wasnt one of them and i was never one for lying on the charpoy reading or sleeping as they did in their spare time the memory of beryl was never very far from my mind whenever i had leisure i was moody and depressed so that its a good thing in a way that i had little leisure i must have been bad compary in the chummery perhaps it was this moodiness and loneliness that made me interested in the sikh cashier at the bank and when next i went there i asked him where he learned to speaksuch very good english he smiled i was educated in lahore he said i went to lahore college but apart from that my father was a captain in the army we often spoke english at home i wish i could speak arabic as well as you speak english i said itld make things a lot easier were you in the indian army in the war he smiled again i was in the royal indian air force i did about three hundred hours on hurricanes i struck up quite a friendship with gujar after that he told me all about his squadron and what they had done in the burmese war against japan he showed me his pilots log book one day and i found that hed done about four hundred and fifty hours in all with only one minor crash upon a tiger moth in the early days of his training he was deeply interested in my venture not only because it had to do with flying but because it was apparent from the bank account that it was very profitable he came down to the aerodrome several times in the evenings after that and i found that he was quite willing to take his coat off and give me a hand with the maintenance once a man has had to do with aeroplanes it gets into the blood whether he is western or asiatic and gujar singh used to potter about with me from time to time cleaning the filters and draining the sumps and checking the tyre pressures of the foxmoth presently one evening in the hangar he asked me to remember him if ever i wanted another pilot the thought had been in my mind for a week or two i had been at bahrein about four months when that happened and dearly if i got another aeroplane id have to have another pilot this gentle ferociouslooking sikh was certainly a possibility i said what about the bank gujar you want to think a bit before giving up a steady job like that i may go bust at any time he smiled it may be a breach of confidence but of necessity i know the balance of your account what it was when you came here and what it is now i am prepared to take the chance i liked gujar he was modest and careful it did not seem to me that he was likely to crash an aircraft i knew nothing of him as a navigator or how steady he would be in an emergency but in these things one has to trust ones judgment and my whole instinct now was to give this a trial tell me i said are you married i dont want to pry into your affairs but id like to know that i am married he said my wife is a sikh also i have three children i live at the northwest side of the souk i knew that part it was in a part of the town where only asiatics live a part where there are no made roads just alleys between the houses probably he lived in one room or at the most in two how much money would you want i asked i will tell you he said at the bank i am paid two hundred and fifty rupees a month and i can increase that by ten rupees a month for every year of service he smiled our needs are less than yours and we are quite comfortable on that i would come to fly for you for the same money as i am getting at the bank but if you should take on another pilot under me i should expect promotion that was fair enough of course i always have to translate rupees into english money in my mind because most of the aircraft costs and contracts are in terms of sterling two hundred and fifty rupees a month which he was getting in the bank was about two hundred and twenty pounds a year less than the wage of a farm labourer in england on that he was quite happy with a wife and three children if i were to get an english pilot out from england to fill this job i should have to pay at least a thousand a year more than four times the wage that gujar singh wanted the balance would pay for a good many minor crashes if my judgment proved to be wrong but i didnt think it was look gujar i said wed both better think this over for a bit until ive got another aeroplane i dont want another pilot itll be three months or so before the thing becomes acute but ill certainly bear it in mind that is all i want he said just keep it in your mind i would rather work for you than continue to work in the bank what sort of aeroplane do you think that you will buy theres a new thing just out called a basing airtruck i said thats what we want out here high wing two of these engines and a great big cabin for a ton of freight ive got the specification in my room if youd like to come in and see it i had a good many talks with gujar after that and i confirmed the good opinion i had formed of him his knowledge of aircraft wasnt very deep but then it didnt have to be he hadnt got a licence of any sort of course but i had little doubt that he could get a b licence in the lowest category making it legal for him to carry passengers in the foxmoth that spring the air ministry sent an raf tiger moth to bahrein an old instructional type that was used for ab initio training in the war they were evidently getting worried that morale would suffer if flying officers were stationed there indefinitely with nothing to fly and a large raf aerodrome with no aeroplanes at all looks rather odd to foreigners the tiger moth is a small open twoseater with dual control and for a time this thing was in the air all day mostly inverted when the rush for it subsided a bit i asked tie co if one of the officers might give gujar a run round in it and check up on his flying for me it wasnt strictly according to kings regulations of course but i have always found the raf to be quite helpful and allen and gujar went off and did circuits and bumps in this thing for an hour one evening while i watched the landings from the shade of the hangar when they came in allen told me he was all right gujar was as pleased as a dog with two tails that evening i told him he could give his notice in to the bank and start as soon as he liked i had his licence to negotiate then i had been given a provisional b licence for myself which had to be renewed each month and was only given on the understanding that i went to england very soon to take it properly i started in to battle then for another provisional licence for gujar singh so that he could carry on in the foxmoth while i was in england officialdom came back at once and asked who was going to maintain the foxmoth and sign it out while i was in england and i threw back the ball that flight sergeant harrison had a and c ground engineers licences and would do it in the evenings officialdom replied that flight sergeant harrison was licensed for dakotas it was true but not for a foxmoth and i replied that surely to god if he could sign for a dakota he could sign for a pipsqueak thing like a foxmoth so it went on presently it came out that gujar singh was an indian subject and we found that he could get a b licence with the greatest of ease in karachi there was a york of raf transport command going through to mauripur the week that he joined me and the co very kindly gave him a passage in that he was back three days later in a dakota of orient airways that was going through to baghdad and he had a brand new b licence valid for six months i wished i was an indian the way was clear then for me to go to england i sent gujar off in the foxmoth for a couple of charter trips and he came back all right from those i turned over the books to him and told him to do the best he could with the business while i was away and transferred most of the cash in the account to london when id left sufficient for him to carry on with safety in my absence i found that id got two thousand two hundred pounds to transfernot bad for six months work with one little aeroplane but id had to work for it i left bahrein six months and two days after i landed there i got a cheap ride as far as rome on a norwegian skymaster that had taken a load of italian emigrants to australia and was on its way back to pick up another lot there was nothing going to england from rome except regular services which would have charged me the full fare so i took a secondclass ticket by rail it took me longer to get from rome to london than it had to get from bahrein to rome and when finally i got out of the train at victoria station i was thankful that if all went well i should be going out by air in a week or two i got on the underground and went to the some hotel near euston that i always stayed at because it was cheap i had written to basing aircraft from bahrein on my cheap notepaper and they had sent me out details of the airtruck i rang up their sales manager a mr harry ford first thing next morning and said that i was coming down to see them right away he told me a train and said hed send a car to meet me i drove from basingstoke station to the works behind a chauffeur like a lord the first time id ever been to an aircraft works like that it felt very odd harry ford was quite a decent chap but i could see he didnt quite know what to make of me hed been in aviation a long time i knew of him though i had never met him i think he knew a little about me he gave me a cigarette and then he said we got your letters mr cutter what did you think of the stuff about the airtruck we sent you looks all right for what im doing i said id like to have a look at one in the shop well go out in a moment he replied there are just one or two things id like to dear up first whats the name of your company i havent got a company i said theres nobody in this but me he was a little taken aback i think you mean youre trading as an individual thats right youre doing charter work thats right i said ive got a foxmoth but i want something a bit bigger now just one foxmoth he was smiling but in quite a nice sort of way just one foxmoth i said firmly maybe youd think more of me if id got fifty thousand pounds of other peoples money and a dozen disposals haltons and a staff of three hundred and a company and a thumping loss as it is ive got just one foxmoth and a thumping profit show you my accounts if you like have you got them here i pulled the envelope from my pocket and unfolded the various papers the accounts certified by the iraqi accountant in bahrein up to three days before i left together with the complete schedule of the jobs id done the hours flown on each and the payments received to balance with the income side of the accounts im showing you these i said because i want to buy an airtruck if its the aeroplane i think it is and ive not got enough money to pay for it fine he said i wish some of my other clients came to the point so quickly he ran his eye over my papers and i saw his eyebrows rise once or twice he did not take more than a couple of minutes over it it was clear that he was very well accustomed to this sort of thing on the face of it thats a very good showing mr cutter he said i dont suppose many foxmoth operators can show profits like that i dont suppose many foxmoth operators work as hard as ive worked i said you do all the maintenance yourself as well as the piloting and the business thats right i see he thought for a minute i take it that if you bought an airtruck you would want credit i nodded id want a hirepurchase agreement over a year could you find anyone to guarantee your payments no i said firmly ive got no rich friends ive got the record there of what i do and that shows i can keep up the payments if we cant do business for an airtruck upon those terms ill have to go elsewhere and buy a cheaper aeroplane i see he took up the papers well go outside and you can have a look at an airtruck and talk to our test pilots jfr cutter theyll be interested to hear about your operations in the persian gulf while were doing that would you mind if our secretary has a look at these figures of yours not a bit i said so long as theyre kept confidential i wouldnt want any other operator to see them he left me for a time and took my papers out of the room with him when he came back we went out to see the airtruck he took me through the works there were a lot of airtrucks there on an assembly line and there were two or three new ones in the flight hangar unsold they could give delivery at once if id been able to pay cash id have got one at a discount off list price im sure i spent a couple of hours going over the machine from nose to tail and had a short flight in one with a test pilot when i had finished i knew that that was the machine i wanted for the gulf it had a big wide cabin with low loading high wing which would keep the cabin cool upon the ground in the tropical sun and full blind flying instruments with the addition of a small vhf radio set it made an aeroplane that would take a ton of load anywhere and very cheaply i knew that i could make money with that out in the gulf and i knew that i could learn to fly it without much difficulty i was very pleased although i did my best not to show it we went back to the office to talk turkey harry ford got the secretary to come along to his office a lean scotsman called taverner he had been through my figures and gave the papers back to me and then we talked about a hirepurchase deal how much could you pay in the way of a deposit mr gutter the secretary asked a thousand pounds i said thats only twenty per cent of the cost of the aircraft from the profits you show you should be able to do better than that ive got to keep some liquid capital in the business i said the cost of flying out the airtruck to bahrein is one thing i dont think i can do more than that mm i think that leaves too much for your business to carry ye cant pay off four thousand pounds in a year why not you see what i can make with just a foxmoth aye mr taverner said yeve done very well but you wont go on like that youre paying no insurance for a start maybe thats wise with just the foxmoth and in any case youve got away with it but if we give you credit terms upon this airtruck youll have to insure it with a policy that we approve thats a bit off your profits he paused but the big difference is going to be that from now on youve got to employ pilots and ground engineers up till now youve been doing everything yourself and youve made close on two thousand five hundred pounds profit in six months but youve taken no pay yourself ill guess that youve been working like a horse and youve been making money at the rate of five thousand a year and maybe youre worth it but its going to be different from now on he turned to ford what will he have to pay a pilot working from bahrein a thousand to twelve hundred and a ground engineer about eight hundred the secretary turned to me yeve got to have staff now mr cutter with two aeroplanes and thats going to alter the whole picture put in the wages of yourself at fifteen hundred and a pilot at twelve hundred and a ground engineer at eight hundred and theres three thousand five hundred pounds added to your overhead expenses right away im not saying that therell be no profit left but i doubt i doubt very much if you can pay off four thousand pounds on an airtruck within a year on the work youll do with it it does not seem possible to me or in two years either he paused yell not get the utilisation with the larger aeroplane that you get with your foxmoth i agree said ford all operators find the same thing when youre operating just one aeroplane a charter service can look very promising directly you have to start in and employ a staff the whole thing alters and the costs go leaping up ive seen it happen over and over again there was a pause that may be i said this thing of mine is different they smiled in what way ford asked if other operators go on the way you say they must all be bloody well daft i said i cant afford to go paying pilots twelve hundred a year ive got a pilot flying the foxmoth for me now while im away a darned good pilot running the business side as well do you know what im paying him what two hundred and fifty rupees a month i said thats two hundred and twenty pounds a year they stared at me with flying pay i laughed shortly no two hundred and twenty pounds a year flat i paused ive got a boy of sixteen cleaning down the aircraft hell work up and be a ground engineer one day do you know what he gets thirty bob a month i snorted im not surprised that charter operators go broke right and left if they pay the wages that you say they sat staring at me then ford said are these natives thats right i said the pilots a sikh the boys an arab oh would you propose that this native pilot should fly the airtruck i dont see why not wed have to think about that one if youre going to want credit terms on the sale we should have an interest in the machine think all you like i said so long as you do it quick this sikh ive got is an exofficer of the royal indian air force and hes done over three hundred hours on hurricanes without an accident much of it operational flying if your airtucks so bloody difficult to fly that hes not safe on it i dont know that we can go any further ford laughed you know i dont mean that anybody could fly an airtruck the proposal to employ a native pilot is a bit of a novelty you know i shrugged my shoulders youve got to go on the record if hes got a record of safe flying and if hes got a b licence thats good enough for me i suppose so if the business grows would you propose to employ more than one ill answer that in six months time i said if gujar singh is the success i think he will be hell be the chief pilot under me in that case any other pilots i take on may very well be sikhs i dont see that thered be any place in a setup like that for british pilots at a thousand a year taverner asked what about the ground staff would you use asiatic ground engineers for your maintenance i dont know i said frankly thats much more difficult than the pilots im fully licensed as a ground engineer myself a b c and d i can use asiatic labour for a time under my supervision then well have to see but i think by the time i need them asiatics will turn up i had some working under me in egypt during the war they were all right harry ford laughed youre planning an air service staffed entirely by wogsl i was a bit angry at that i call them asiatics i replied if you want to sell an airtruck you can quit calling my staff wogs no offence meant mr cutter he said one uses these slang phrases i take it that the point youre making is that by the use of native staff you can reduce your overheads to the point when you can bear the hirepurchase cost of eighty per cent of an airtruck spread over a year i nodded thats right i can pay off the aircraft in a year and still make money i thought for a moment i dont want you to think that a native staff is solely a question of money i said slowly if i extended my operations it will be in the direction of india not towards europe europes crowded out with charter operators already all going broke together theres more scope for charter work as you go east if i develop eastwards then by using asiatic pilots and ground engineers exclusively i shall be using the people of countries that i want to do business with thats bound to make things easier taverner chipped in then and we went over my prospective overheads in the light of the payments i would have to make for asiatic staff and the sum naturally came out a good bit better they left me then to go off and have a talk about it by themselves and when they came back they said fifteen hundred down and the machine was mine i stuck my heels in and refused to pay a penny more than twelve hundred and when i left the works that evening the machine was mine for delivery in about ten days subject to the completion of all the formalities i went to southampton that night and got home about nine oclock there was no telephone at home of course id sent a telegram from the works to say that i was coming but it was nearly six oclock when i telephoned it and after delivery hours so ma hadnt got it i walked in at the street door and put my bag down ma was in the scullery and when she heard the door go she called out that you alf she thought it was dad i said its me matom she came rushing out and pat her arms round me and kissed me and ticked me off for not letting them know which day i was coming and then she said my tom you do look brown how long have you got at home only a week or two i said im getting a bigger aeroplane and flying out as soon as its ready vnot bust yet she asked not quite i said wheres dad he stepped out to the lion for his game of darts she said he should be back now any minute mind if i go down there and fetch him ma she nodded hell like you to meet his friends bert topp and harry burke and chandler dont be moren a quarter of an hour tom ill start getting supper now i went down to the pub and there was dad playing darts with harry burke i said how do dad and he said how do tom and i told him id been home and he told the barman to give me a pint and went on with his game the barman said been out in the sun and i said persian gulf and he said uhhuh and i sat and watched dad going for the double at the finish of the game it was just as if id never been away at all as if bahrein and gujar singh and sharjah and yas island were places and people id read about in a book i walked home with dad when hed finished the game and told him something about what id been doing on the way back home when we sat down to the light supper that they had before going to bed ma asked me whats it like out where youre working tom what does it all look like she paused is it all palm trees and dates and that not in the country i said nothing grows outside the towns because of the water theres no water at all the land is desertgreat flat stretches of sandy sort of earth with maybe rocky hills or mountains here and there all yellow and dried up under the sun you get groves of date palms and greenery outside bahrein and outside most towns where they irrigate with water from wells dad said sounds a bad sort of country i rather like it dad i said it gets hold of you after a bit its good for peopleyou dont get any of the pansy boys out there it can be lovely when youre flying too some places and in some lights the desert goes a sort of rosy pink all over and then if youre flying up a coast the sea can be a brilliant emerald green or else a brilliant blue with a strip of white surf all along the edge like a girls slip showing ever had a forced landing in it and got stranded dad asked i shook my head not yet and i dont want one i had to put down once because of a sand storm and sit it out in the cabin for five or six hours then it got better and i took off and went on i always take a petrol can of water in the aircraft ma said my they wanted to know if id got anyone to help me and i told them about gujar singh and tarik it was difficult of course to make them understand however hard i was trying however much they wanted to dad said like niggers i suppose theyd be i shook my head no not like niggers gujar singhs an indian lascars are indian i think dad said he only knew the types hed seen about the docks of course thats right i said but this is a different sort of indian a better sort than lascars more of an army officer type i went on to describe what gujar looked like but i dont know that a description of him really helped me in describing what i had come to feel that our minds ran on similar tracks ma said theyd be heathens i suppose the question worried me a bit because i wanted her to like them i wanted her to understand i dont know i said slowly both of them believe in godjust one god not a lot of gods i suppose youd call them heathens they dont believe in jesus christ as godthe moslems think he was a prophet just like moses but i must say they seem to say their prayers very regular which is moren we do ma was trying her best they dont go to church i suppose she asked just have heathen temples like theyve got their own places where they go to pray i said friday is the big day like our sunday when they all go to the mosque most businesses shut up shop on friday and the offices and the banks shut on friday too we dont work on fridays but we work on sundays theyre very particular about fridays and then of course theyre always at their prayers i told young tarik after the first day i said you do your praying in the lunch hour and after we knock off ladnot in the time i pay you for a chap in the radio setup put me wise to that one theyll swing it on you if you let them but then on your side youve got to be reasonable and fix the hours of work so they can get their praying in do you mean they go off to the mosque on a working day dad asked i shook my head they can do it on any quiet little bit of ground it seems a moslem has to say his prayers five timesa day what young tarik does he goes out on a little bit of flat ground just beside the hangar and he faces west about in the direction of mecca thats their holy city where they go for pilgrimages he takes off his shoes and stands up straight and puts both hands up to his ears and prays then he stands with his arms folded in front of him and prays then he bends forward with both hands on his knees and prays then he goes down on hands and knees and puts his head on the ground and prays then he sits down for a bit and thinks about it all and then he starts in and goes through it all again he goes on like that for about ten minutes like doing physical jerks only you cant laugh about it dad when you see them at it they take it all so serious just like us in church it means a lot to them five times a day they go through all that thats right i said young tariks hours are sort of fluid cause theres only just him there at present hes supposed to start at seven in the morning and i must say hes usually there on time he works till nine and then gets a break for a cup of tea or a bit to eat and prayers starts again at ninethirty and works till twelve and gets an hour then for his dinner and prayers works from one to fourthirty and knocks off for prayers that makes an eighthour day if he works over then i give him a bit more at the end of the month ma said seems like theyre not heathens at all if they say their prayers that much theyre not christians ma i said but honestly i dont think you could call them heathens either they believe in god all right dad asked about the aeroplanes and i told him about the airtruck and got out a picture of it from my case to show him he asked how much it cost and i told him and then i told him about the money that id made and that was all going back into the business dad and ma were so pleased it was just fine they thought far more of my little success and took more pleasure in it than ever i did it was worth that six months of heat and work and sweat and fright to see the pleasure they got out of it they asked what i was going to do and how long i could stay and i told them that id have to go for a week to air service training ltd at hamble and get a radio operators licence that was only six miles out of southampton so i could live at home and go out on the bus each day young ted had gone off to do his military service so dad and ma were all alone at home ma asked where id like to deep upstairs or down and i said down in the big room where wed all slept together as kids i lay there for a while that night thinking of all sorts of things of the airtruck of my radio licence of bahrein and the persian gulf country of the last time i came to sleep there in the misery of beryls death if beryl had lived my life would have been a very different one i knew she wouldnt have fitted in at bahrein and shed have hated it but then id never have got out there if shed lived i got up with dad and ma next morning and had breakfast at seven with dad before he went off to the docks i hung around then and helped ma with the washing up because there was no point in getting out to hamble before ten as we were drying the dishes ma said ted brought ever such a nice girl home last weekend tom lily clarke her name is her folks live at fareham fathers a petty officer in the navy starting young i said mm met her at a dance i dont know if theres anything in it better wait till he gets through his service and in a proper job i said besides hes only just nineteen your pa was only twenty when we got married tom i had elsie when i was nineteen i grinned at her ought to be ashamed of yourself ma and dad too well i dont know it worked out all right with us i often wish youd married young tom but you were always so stuck into your books i know i said quietly i got around to it too late theres always another chance you didnt meet anybody out there i shook my head smiling a little its not that sort of a place ma you get more snowstorms in the persian gulf than unmarried white girls she sighed i wish you didnt have to work in a place like that will you ever come back and work in england tom i expect i will some day i replied the trouble is i rather like it in the east id like to go father if i get a chance into india and burma and on past those well anyway she said its not as if you had to be out there for ever being in the air business you do seem to be able to get home now and then she kept on trying ma did i went out that day and fixed up my course at air service training and got them to start me off next day on account of the urgency two nights later i came back to tea about six and there was a girl in to tea with ma doris waters daughter of old waters the plumber she was a pretty kid and quite intelligent about twentytwo or twentythree years old she taught in a school if id been different to what i was things might have been different too but i wasnt and they werent i was sorry for ma with all the examinations for the radio operators licence and the b licence and the renewal of my ground engineers licences i was busy in a maze of paper work for the next three weeks i had to go three times to london and then in the middle of it all the august bank holiday came and everything stopped dead for about four days i finally got away from england in the airtruck on august the nd having been in england nearly a month dad and mum came out to see the machine as they had done before with the foxmoth but this was a bigger and a better aircraft altogether i had about three hundredweight of spares and tools with me and quite a bit of luggage and it made a little heap in one corner of the big cabin that youd hardly notice the airtruck was faster than the foxmoth and better equipped and so much easier to fly having two engines i took the sea crossing from cannes to rome direct and then over the top of the appenines through cloud to brindisi instead of going round the coast short cuts like that made a lot of difference to the time and with the greater range of the airtruck i didnt have to land so often for fuel i got to bahrein in five days from england and as i turned downwind on the circuit i saw the foxmoth standing in front of the hangar and gujar singh and tarik standing by it looking up at the airtruck and waving to me they hadnt broken the fox which took a load off my mind as i came in to the runway on the final and put her down i felt like it was coming home again the wide bare sandy field under the mazing sun the blue sea besides the shimmer from the tarmac the white houses with their windtowersthese were the things that pleased me this was where i wanted to be gujar and tarik came up to the machine as i switched off in front of the hangar and they opened the door and came in to greet me as i sat quiet in the cockpit for a few minutes tired after a long day of flying from damascus via baghdad and basra writing up the journey log book on my knee they were very much impressed with the airtruck there will be a great deal of work to be done with this said gujar once the oil companies get to know that it is here i found that evening that he had done quite well in my absence with the foxmoth he had had a job to do most days and the bank account which was two hundred pounds when i went away was now over seven hundred there were a good few bills outstanding because i hadnt left him power to draw cheques but so far as i could see he had made a profit of over three hundred pounds in the month or so that i had been away i was very pleased with that and i told him so it meant that i could go away on jobs myself without the feeling that everything was going to collapse i got evans of the arabiasumatran petroleum company to come down and have a look at the new machine next day with one or two from the other companies the response was good and by the end of a week the airtruck was going hard every day spare parts for motor transport was one of our big constant loads the oil companies have a great number of trucks in various parts of the arabian deserts in connection with the oil wells and pipe lines and docks these trucks give continuous trouble however ruggedly they may be built a country that has no roads and a lot of sand is hard on things mechanical we could fly in spare back axles wheels complete with tyres drums of oil or engine parts to stranded trucks and its extraordinary how many stranded trucks there are apart from that we took surveying parties and all their gear about the place continuously and cases of tinned foodsall sorts of stuff from time to time we took quite big loads of people employees going in and out of some inaccessible place i had no seats for the airtruck and took them sitting or squatting on the floor presently of course the inevitable official popped up and told me that was illegal because they all ought to have a safety belt after a time i decided i should have to have another aeroplane gujar singh was used to flying the airtruck by that time though i did most of the work on it myself and let him fly the foxmoth now things were piling up on us there was still far more work than we could tackle and the foxmoth was due for its annual overhaul for the certificate of airworthiness i had engaged an iraqi ground engineer with a and c licences called selim but i didnt trust him much and anyway he wasnt licensed for complete overhauls i should have to do that myself i wanted another airtruck and that meant another pilot i was up to date with my payments on the first airtruck and had about two thousand pounds profit again in hand i wrote to harry ford and told him how i stood and sent him the accounts and said what about another airtruck on the nevernever i think they must have had a lot of trouble selling them because he wrote back at once and said come and get it it wasnt very suitable for ordinary charter operators perhaps but it fitted my work like a glove i had a talk with gujar singh about another pilot then he didnt himself know of another sikh pilot in ten days time however we had to take a load to karachi a trip which i proposed to do myself in the airtruck he suggested that he should come with me he knew karachi very well of course we went together and stayed for a couple of days at the end of that time we found quite a good pilot called arjan singh with another big black beard and another iron bangle just like gujar he had been instructing on harvards at bangalore in the war and had done a bit of time on dominies i took him on and put up gujars salary to three hundred rupees and we all went back to bahrein together i started arjan on the foxmoth and turned over the airtruck to gujar and went back to england in a chartered halton that had taken a ships propeller shaft out to singapore and was on its way back with a load of silk goods i was only home about four days that time because the second airtruck was all ready and waiting for me on basingstoke aerodrome in fact there were eleven of them standing in a row unsold i kicked myself that id got to have credit and so had to pay full price however it was better to have it so than to get outside money in i wanted to keep the show in my own hands i still wasnt a company and i didnt see any reason why i should become one for the time being theres no income tax in bahrein i stayed three of the four days with dad and ma as usual and took them up for a joyride in the airtruck then i was off again back to bahrein i was getting to know the route by that time and i was a much better pilot than when i went out first with the foxmoth when i got back to bahrein i started in to put the business on a proper basis with the two airtrucks flying all day long and the fox in for overhaul for its certificate of airworthiness i had to take on a good bit more staff i got another ground engineer an egyptian whod been with me at almaza and two more arab boys under tarik who was shaping quite well these boys worked as loaders when we wanted labour sometimes we parachuted loads down instead of landing if the ground was bad especially to stranded trucks and these boys went along then in the aircraft to put the stuff out of the door frame for those jobs we flew without the door i had to start an office going too i found a young bengali clerk called dunu who could work a typewriter and keep books he came from calcutta and was working in a shipping office in the town i managed to lease a disused hutment from the raf on a strictly temporary basis and i set the office up in that from that time onward my own work began to change i had to spend more time on the ground because i was the only ground engineer in the show who was licensed for aircraft overhauls i couldnt be away all day piloting while a machine was in for its annual overhaul and with three machines coming up for annual overhaul in turn it was clear that i should have to spend a lot more time in the hangar having to do that i was able to attend more to the bookkeeping and costs and it was about that time i set to work to get the prices down it had been all very well to charge a high figure for my transport in the early days but i knew that if i went on doing that the oil companies would start to kick and either get their own aircraft or else much worse encourage someone else to start up at bahrein in competition with me within a month of my return with the second airtruck i cut my own prices by twentyfive per cent and let them all know what id done and why id done it i still did all of what one might describe as the pioneering flying whenever we had to make a landing at a place we hadnt used before i used to take the machine myself if possible sometimes with gujar or arjan with me in the machine so that they could see it and get the gen that was the position some months after i got back to bahrein at the end of november when evans of the arabiasumatran rang me up and asked if i could quote for taking a load of fifteen hundred pounds of scientific instruments and one passenger from bahrein to diento in sumatra where they had another refinery diento is in the south of sumatra about four hundred miles south of singapore not very far from batavia in java it was by far the longest haul that had come my way and i regarded it as something of a compliment and as a sign of confidence in me that they had asked me to quote it meant a flight of about five thousand miles all through the east across india and burma through siam and down malaya into sumatra and past palembang to this place diento i knew i could do it in an airtruck and i was determined to go myself of course for an important job like that i had a lot of difficulty with the quotation though the trouble was in finding a return load if i charged him for the double journey the figure came out so high that it frightened me i wanted to do the job very badly but i wasnt going to do it and lose money in the end i took my figures to him and put the cards on the table i told him he would have to guarantee payment for the return journey to bahrein and i suggested he should put his sumatran organisation to work to find me a return load either from their own requirements or else from batavia in that case we would set off anything that we could get for the return load against his invoice with appropriate mileage adjustments if the return load was to a destination off my direct return route we thrashed out an agreement on these lines he told me that he would send a copy out to their office in batavia and i should probably receive instructions in diento to go on there for whatever freight load they could get together for me i started almost immediately in the new airtruck im not going to say much about that first hurried journey through the east this isnt a travel book it took me a week to get to diento flying seven or eight hours every day and servicing the aircraft in what was left of the day we got good weather all through india and burma but we struck a lot of monsoon rain in what they call the intertropical front as we went through malaya it got to be fair weather again by the time we reached diento i never saw anything of all these countries hardly on that trip i was working all the time when the machine was on the ground and it was dark each night by the time we could drive in from the aerodrome to a hotel i got just tantalising glimpses of brown men and pretty chinese girls in flowered pyjamas enough to make me realise what i was missing diento was a huge refinery town of over twenty thousand employees many of them dutch it had a good airstrip and i put down there about midday after flying in from palembang the strip wasnt much different from any other aerodrome in any part of the world but the grass was a bit darker in colour the cars and trucks and roads weiј all the same its a funny thing about the tropics i have found you go expecting everything to be quite different and theres so much thats the same my passenger was a young dutchamerican scientist he knew all about diento because hed been there before they sent a truck down for the laboratory gear and his boss came down to meet him in a car we waited to see the stuff unloaded and safely in the truck and then i went up with them in the car to the refinery offices that was a big place it stretched for miles out into the bush and along the bank of a river rows and rows of storage tanks and pipes and cylindrical towers and all sorts of things fullsized oceangoing tankers came into diento to take the oil away to ports all over the world as i expected in the office they had instructions to send me to batavia about a hundred and fifty miles further on they thought there was a small return load waiting for me there but they didnt know what it was i would have gone back to the aerodrome and got off there and then but the dutchmen wouldnt hear of it they insisted that i stay the night and have a party with them and relax and after all that flying i was quite glad to they had a club by the riverside and they gave me a fine bedroom in that there was a swimming pool and pretty girls out of the offices in it and a concert and a dance after dinner all by the riverside with sampans going past and lights over the water and flying foxes wheeling overhead in the velvety darkness and a huge tropical full moon i drank more bols than i wanted to but they were so kind and so pleased to see a strange face one couldnt refuse i got rather tight but so did everyone a good party they sent me down to the aerodrome next morning in a car i made a check over the machine cleaned filters drained sumps swept out the cabin and refuelled finally i took off at about tenthirty for the short flight down to batavia across the sunda straits and found the aerodrome and came on to the circuit behind a constellation of the klm the dutch pilots were all speaking english on the radio to their own control tower which seemed odd to me it certainly made everything very easy because i couldnt speak a word of dutch i landed and taxied to the parking position and locked up the machine and went to the control and customs for the necessary clearances it all took a long time because java was in an uproar with a fullscale war going on against the indonesian republicans and there were military officers in all the offices wanting to see every sort of document the klm people had been warned to expect me and were very helpful and got me through the various offices as quickly as anyone could and laid on transport for me and took me into town to the nederland hotel the hotel was crowded out with military and the best that they could do for me was a dormitory room with three other beds in it and other chaps gear lying round all over the place i was used to that sort of thing wed had it at several other places on the way i dumped my stuff on an empty bed and saw the room boy and went down to the diningroom for lunch i had been warned by the klm chap that most offices took a siesta in that hot place after the midday meal a suitable time to get to the arabiasumatran office would be between three and four i took the tip and went up after lunch for an hour on the charpoy myself there was another chap in the room now lying stretched out on the bed under his mosquito net naked but for a short pair of trunks i couldnt see him very clearly through the net i said conventionally i hope none of this stuffs in your way he turned and looked at me and then he sat up and lifted the side of the net to see me better i stood there gaping at him for a moment in surprise it was connie shaklin we travel not for trafficking alone by hotter winds our fiery hearts are fanned for lust of knowing what should not be known we make the golden journey to samarkand james elroy flecker it was thirteen years since i had seen connie and a lot had happened in that time but i knew him at once i said connie shaklin you remember meon cobhams circus tom cutter he pushed back the net got out and shook me by the hand he was leaner than i remembered him especially in the face in some ways he looked more chinese than ever but alongside a chinese you could see he wasnt one he was too tall too aquiline his russian mother was responsible for that he was a strikinglooking man he reminded me of something but for a time i couldnt think of what it was he said tom i what are you doing now last time i heard was years ago you were still at airservice then i offered him a cigarette but he said he didnt smoke i lit one and sat down on the charpoy i left them last year i said im on my own now still in aircraft yes im operating in the persian gulf i came down here on a charter job i was terribly glad to see connie again he was a part of my youth part of the fine time you have before you have to take responsibilities presently as you go through your life you undertake so many duties that you havent time for making new close friendships any more youve got too much to do for the remainder of your life you have to make do with the friends you gathered in in your short youth and for me connie was about the only one i ever had i started getting serious pretty early in my life i suppose i told him all about my charter service in the gulf as i tripped my few clothes off and stretched out on the bed in return he told me what he had been doing from cobhams circus he had gone to california he had got a job with the lockheed company in their service and repair department and he had stayed with them for six years or so then the war had come in he was a british subject of course and england was at war he felt it was his duty to serve although he had queer ideas about fighting and so he went north over the border to edmonton and joined the royal canadian air force as an engine fitter were you in aircrew i asked he shook his head i think that it is wrong to kill he said simply i told them that when i volunteered for the rcaf i told them also that if one could not kill in time of war one ought to work very hard i had the american ground engineers certificates of course for lockheed and pratt and whitney stuff and they were glad to have me for a fitter on the ground he had spent the whole of the war in canada working at various aerodromes in connection with the empire training scheme and later on some coldweather research projects at trenton he had sat for the canadian ground engineers licences at the end of the war and had got the lot without difficulty and at the beginning of he had gone out to bangkok and had worked for a time as a ground engineer with siamese airways i opened my eyes at that siamese airways is the national air line of siam and i thought staffed exclusively by asiatics what on earth made you go there i asked karma he said smiling i didnt understand him but his old magic was upon me once again and i didnt interrupt he knew so much more than i did i went back home to san diego for a few months and worked at the flying club but i couldnt settle there i didnt really like america and i wanted to know more much more about the lord gautama and the four noble truths i wanted to hear people talk about the buddhist faith who really knew somethingnot the sort of people you find in los angeles and presently i found i had to go to bangkok to find out about all that there was no alternative except the bughouse i grinned this was the same old connie different to anybody else that i had ever met he had been good for me when i was a callow and an ignorant youth he was good for me now i said were you able to get into siamese airways and then i said perhaps a little thoughtlessly i thought they were all asiatics he smiled well what do you call me youre british i said wondering i was born in penang he replied my father was a full chinese my mother was a russian who got out in at the time of the revolution i speak cantonese and a little mandarin i spell my name in two parts now that im out here shak lin like my father did im asiatic not a proper one i said loyally he grinned proper enough to get a job with siamese airways i think they were very glad to get me i got to bangkok just as they were starting up they bought a lot of disposals dakotas and had them converted in hong kong i was with them up till about four months ago what are you doing now i asked he said im with dwight schafter whos dwight schafter dont you know about him i shook my head no hes a gunrunner said connie he flies arms in to the indonesian republicans or he did the dutch have got him now here in batavia youre working for him yes well im muggered i said in wonder as we lay there on our beds in the hot afternoon he told me about dwight schafter dwight was an american a soldier of fortune by profession wherever there is trouble in the world the dwights of all nations foregather there are not very many of them thirty or forty perhaps and they are all supremely competent men because the others have been killed dwight had spent some years in central and south america and he had flown for franco in the spanish civil war he had been flying for the chinese against the japanese in and and he had come into the united states army air force via major chennaults flying tigers he delivered two or three disposals bs from america to the warring israelites in palestine just after the war but by the middle of he was back in the east flying loads of submachineguns from the philippines to indonesia for the benefit of brown men fighting the dutch at that time there was considerable sympathy in southeast asia for the indonesians in their struggle against the dutch in indochina the vietminh forces were engaged in a similar rebellion against french rule in siam there was sympathy with the asiatics in both cases though it would probably be quite wrong to suggest that the siamese government connived at gunrunning it would probably be quite right to say that when strange freight aircraft turned up at don muang aerodrome outside bangkok with thin stories of journeys to improbable places the siamese government saw no reason to initiate officious and unnecessary investigations dwight schafter was a small quick darkhaired man from indiana he turned up at don muang one day flying a brandnew cornell carrier the carrier was a great big american freight aeroplane in the same class as the british plymouth tramp it was powered by two pratt and whitney engines of about seventeen hundred horsepower each and it was very completely equipped it cost about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in the states quite an aeroplane dwight schafter said that he was starting an air service with it from saigon in indochina to manila in the philippines he did not explain what he intended to carry between these cities in this expensive freight aircraft and no one bothered to ask him he was known at don muang he had a dakota which turned up from time to time for servicing by siamese airways and he had always paid his bills with cash on the nail usually small cubical gold ingots of which he seemed to have an inexhaustible supply he wanted the carrier serviced with a routine engine check he said that there were no licensed ground engineers in saigon which at that time may or may not have been true conditions in indochina were certainly very disturbed in any case he brought the aircraft into don muang to be checked over and connie shaklin was put on the job with two chinese ground engineers to help him there was about two days work to be done when connie told me this i had not at that time seen him at work i can now say that he was the most thorough and careful engineer that i have ever met he was quick enough doing a job but he would never take the slightest thing on chance in consequence he added to his work far more than another man would have thought necessary dwight schafter was dearly very much impressed because on the evening of the second day when they were in the cockpit together at the conclusion of an engine test run he said say shak lin why dont you leave this outfit n come and work for me ill need somebody like you to help me run this baby he caressed the bakelite control wheel of the carrier connie stared out over the wide brown stretches of the airfield glowing golden in the evening light to the dim blue line of the hills up the north where are you based he asked where would the job be i run from the philippines to saigon said schafter carefully but the jobs not there ive got a private strip way out in the country where we do the maintenance its very quiet there of courseno europeans nearer than a hundred miles but that wont worry you because you speak chinese i speak canton said connie does that go at your strip he nodded the people that youd come in contact with understand canton not the peasants but you wouldnt have to worry about those he paused its very isolated but the job will probably be over in six months give you eight hundred american dollars a month and transportation back here to bangkok eight hundred dollars a month is at the rate of ј a year a high wage for a ground engineer even in the east in all his later life i never knew connie to take the least interest in money he always earned a good salary because he was firstclass at his job but he lived on the asiatic standard i know that he had no money at the time of his death i think he gave it all away while he worked for me he preferred to be paid in cash each month i dont think he had a bank account at all it certainly wasnt for money then that he left siamese airways and went to work for dwight schafter i know now that he had been in close touch with the ecclesiastics of buddhism while he was working in bangkok and he spoke once of his horoscope my own belief is that he felt the need to go out into the wilderness for a few months to get away from the crowd for a time to meditate on what he had learned of buddhism that is a possible explanation and it certainly fits in with the life that dwight schafter offered him a time of long periods of inactivity while dwight was away flying with only asiatics for his company upon the abandoned airstrip at damrey phong he had no illusions about the job i maintain aircraft he said there in the beautifully finished cockpit of the carrier with the long rows of blackfaced instruments in front of him below the windscreen i take no part in wars i would not fly with you to any foreign country to deliver any load you dont have to do that said schafter looking at him curiously i dont want you for an aircrew ive got a c and ive got this baby and i guess theres plenty for you to do keeping those two in the air i want somebody that i can trust to stay back at the strip and keep the maintenance of the one ship going while im away with the other i think i can trust you what do you say he said yes he left siamese airways a week later dwight schafter reappeared at don muang in a dakota with a brown man called monsieur seriot as his copilot and connie got into it with his small luggage contained in an old parachute pack and a tool chest the dakota cleared for prachaub in siam and flew towards the sea and down the coast of cambodia into indochina two hours later they landed on the strip at damrey phong damrey phong lies on the river kos about fifteen miles from the coast it is about a hundred miles from the siamese border and about a hundred and eighty miles as the crow flies from saigon it is a small asiatic village of palm thatch houses the homes of a purely rural community superimposed on this was the civilisation of the airstrip built for strategic purposes during the war there were two houses built of wood in european style and a store building there had been a hangar but the roof had fallen in with neglect and the remains of the wooden building were rapidly disintegrating there was a wharf to which small coasting motor vessels could come up the river and here there was a petrol store with a good stock of fuel and oil in drums the cornell carrier was parked beside the strip the place was in territory held by the vietminh forces in rebellion against the french and the pattern of the operations was soon explained to connie the loads carried up till that time had been exclusively trench mortars submachineguns and small arms they came from somewhere in the philippines he thought the island of negros the dakota would fly there across the china sea once every two or three days a flight of twelve or thirteen hundred miles it would return to damrey phong loaded with these arms all of which were examerican army weapons mostly in poor condition owing to neglect since the war consignments of ammunition arrived in the same way from time to time about half of these weapons and ammunition were sold to the vietminh forces but the supply was greater than they could pay for or recondition the loads not required remained in the dakota while it was refuelled and it then took off again for some destination in indonesia this flight was made direct but the empty dakota frequently returned to the home airstrip via bangkok to pick up any stores or spare parts that might be required connie gatheredthat it was a very profitable trade whoever financed it indeed found it so profitable that he was able to plough back profits into the business wherever the arms came from there was larger stuff than submachineguns going for scrap price there were antitank guns bazookas and seventyfivemillimetre field guns and ammunition for them too neglected and rusty maybe but still capable of being put to use these guns were worth their weight in silver to the indonesians and since the gold and silver mines of bencoolen and madoen were both in rebel hands there was little difficulty in paying for them in negotiable currency the cornell carrier was just fhe aircraft for the job six journeys and this baby will be paid for said dwight schafter after that its all clear profit when connie got to damrey phong the carrier had already made two trips and was loaded and fuelled ready to start on a third connie settled down at this outoftheway tropical village quite happily he had two indifferent engineers under him one a burmese lad and one a chinese from hong kong they messed together in one of the europeanstyle houses where these two engineers lived with two girls of the village serving as their wives simple and attractive girls who did the cooking and housework for them and who volunteered at once to bring along a selection of their friends for connie to choose from there was genuine kindness and good feeling behind the offer as well as the desire to ease the housework caused by a third man but he refused and chose an older woman as his servant he had not come to damrey phong for a domestic life dwight schafter and his copilot seriot lived in the other house upon the strip each with a local girl these girls had an easy time because their lords were hardly ever there there was no other aircrew schafter and his brown copilot flew every trip together alternatively in the dakota and the carrier they were superb as a crew they flew practically every day long difficult journeys with no meteorological reports except what they could glean by listening to the scheduled radio weather forecasts from singapore hong kong manila and bangkok they were very cunning at that there were no ground aids to guide them on their way in the dark night they always flew the last stages by night alone they had to make their landfall on dark inaccurately mapped coasts alone they had to find the secret airstrips where a few flickering flares of paraffin laid on the grass served as the sole help to them for putting down these large heavily loaded aircraft over all was the continual danger of detection and a quick burst of tracer into them from some defending fighter unseen and unsuspected that would end it all they must have been men of iron for they came and went over and over again and showed no sign of any mental stress it was a job to them like any other job except that it was an exceptionally good one in the thirteen weeks that connie was with them at damrey phong the carrier made eleven or twelve trips to indonesia loaded with two field guns every time they kept no records or log books and connie could not recollect exactly how many journeys each machine had made between the carrier journeys the dakota flew in fieldgun ammunition and small arms about the same number of trips it took the indonesians about that time to recondition the first guns they got them into action against the dutch army after about two months and raised a hornets nest for dwight schafter the dutch were no fools and they knew fairly well where all these arms were coming from the trouble was that at that time they controlled only small areas of java and sumatra round about the larger towns and it was fairly easy for a resolute pilot coming in by night to land upon an indonesian airstrip to discharge his load the dutch air force pilots were ready and valiant in flying on night fighter patrols but sheer bravery cannot replace the technical equipment necessary for a successful interception and at that time they hadnt got it a number of dutch mustangs were lost on these night fighter patrols the pilots if they survived were executed immediately by the republicans who fought their war according to an eastern code for a time the loss of aircraft and pilots was more serious to the dutch than the continued landing of small arms and the night patrols became infrequent when artillery appeared in rebel hands the defence was galvanised again coincident with the increased activity a few airborne radar equipments came to hand in batavia and these were fitted hurriedly in the bs for the first time the dutch air force had a reasonable chance of intercepting dwight schafter on his night flights and this of course was quite unknown to him they saw him on the radar screen as he was going away one night the first time they had used it operationally but on that occasion they were unable to get within fifteen miles of him they now knew his route however and they kept machines from palembang continuously in the air from then on during the hours of darkness on the fifth night he came again in the dakota and they got him it was his habit to fly from damrey phong southwards and parallel with the east coast of malaya and about a hundred miles offshore checking his course by wireless bearings from the broadcasting stations of bangkok and singapore he flew on on his course to jogjokarta the rebel headquarters in java passing somewhat to the east of the island of banka and it was here that the dutch fighter first made contact with him the pilot was under orders not to shoot the intruder down into the sea as it was necessary to get evidence and so he held the dakota in his radar and followed about three miles behind for an hour and a quarter till dwight schafter crossed the north coast of java a hundred miles or so to the east of batavia making his usual landfall at a distinctive turn of the coast north of tjerebon there the mitchell dosed up on him and shot him down upon the foothills of mount tjareme schafter and seriot were quite prepared for such a thing to happen it was one of the occupational hazards of their way of life the first thing that they knew was a long burst of tracer fire into the port wing the engine stopped with a rending jerk that shook the machine through it may have fallen out fire broke out immediately from the pierced petrol tanks they had their drill for this contingency all worked out both flew in parachute harness escape was by the door at the aft end of the cabin and the cabin was always loaded with an avenue down the middle to provide a clear run seriot was flying the aircraft at the time and schafter was at the navigators table schafter plucked him by the arm and nodded and then turned and ran aft to snap on his parachute and jettison the door the brown man at the wheel counted ten slowly trimming the aircraft as he counted then he left his seat and ran down the fuselage after his captain snapped on his parachute and followed schafter into the black void below the dakota went on for a few seconds burning fiercely then it fell over in a spiral dive and went down in a shapeless mass of flame the ammunition started going off before it hit the ground and for a time made an interesting display upon the forest slopes seriot reached the ground uninjured landing in some paddyfields on the edge of the forest schafter had bad luck he fell on the treetops which checked him and his parachute collapsed he was perhaps fifty feet from the ground the top branches broke beneath his weight after a moment and he fell through the branches to the forest floor clutching at every branch as he fell finally he dropped helplessly from a height of about twenty feet and fell across a root he broke his thigh in two places that was the end of it for him that part of java is fairly well populated and villagers found him before dawn then the dutch moving quickly in trucks threw a cordon round the district and picked him up without much difficulty seriot put on native clothes supplied by the villagers and attempted to get through to jogjokarta but the dutch were too clever and he was arrested a day later schafter was now in hospital in batavia when he was well enough to appear in court he would be tried and sentenced seriot was in jail in batavia awaiting trial but as he was an employee he would not be tried before his captain news of this disaster came to connie shaklin at damrey phong within twelve hours by way of broadcast news from singapore and from bangkok he had the carrier at damrey and he was working on it when the news came in he nad a short talk with his two engineers clearly the party was over and all that there was left for them to do was to wind it up and disperse the only real problem was what should become of the cornell carrier an aeroplane which only a short time before had cost nearly seventy thousand pounds and was presumably worth about that figure still in dwight schafters absence connie was responsible at damrey and he took his responsibilities seriously he paid the months wages out of money that had been left with him by schafter and went to bangkok travelling by fishing vessel up the coast it took him about four days in bangkok he went to the dutch embassy and explained the position well aware that they could not proceed against him upon siamese territory he said that there were stocks of fuel tools and spares for the dakota at their base in indochina and he wanted instructions from dwight schafter as to the disposal of these assets which were the property of this american citizen he did not tell them anything about the carrier his request added one more headache to the many headaches that dwight schafter had given the dutch it was impossible for them to be too highhanded with the donors of marshall aid and the united states consul had already intervened to ensure that this criminal awaiting trial should be imprisoned with all the amenities proper to an american citizen the question of his assets upon foreign territory was quite outside the jurisdiction of the dutch in java they cogitated over it for twentyfour hours and then decided not to irritate the state department any further they instructed their ambassador to give shak lin a visa for a visit to batavia to interview his boss in hospital and promised that he would be allowed a safe conduct to depart out of dutch territory at will to make assurance doubly sure connie shaklin went to the american embassy in bangkok and told them all about it before flying down to batavia he arrived at the nederland hotel the day before i did when i found him lying on his bed after lunch he was thinking over his interview in hospital that morning by the time he had told me all this it was three oclock and time for me to go to the arabiasumatran office to find out about my return load for the airtruck they knew all about me they had found a load of radio apparatus that had to get back to holland in quick time for a rebuild i was to take this back as far as bahrein and arrangements would be made to get it on to holland from there it would be ready for loading into the airtruck next morning i went back to the nederland hotel connie was in the room still lying on his bed i had been thinking as i walked back through the palmlined streets by the canal look connie i said ive got a proposition to put to you lets go downstairs and have a drink out in the cool the sun was going down and it was getting cooler out in the open than it was in the bedroom okay he said ive got one for you he put his shirt and trousers on and came downstairs with me to the open piazza in front of the hotel with all the little tables under sunshades he wore a pair of khaki drill trousers and a white shirt open at the neck and sandals as we turned the corner of the stair i saw his face in profile lean eastern and ascetic and i knew what he reminded me of he looked like a priest he wouldnt touch anything alcoholic so i ordered fresh lime squash for us both look connie i said this is what i had in mind my show at bahrein is growing and the ground sides getting a bit out of hand ive been looking after that myself so far with two asiatics aandcs to help me god knows how its all going on up there now probably not so good would you like to come and work for me as chief engineer i need somebody like you im still working for dwight schafter he said ive got his carrier to look after he cant go on employing you for long i said from what you tell me hell get a prison sentence as soon as he comes out of hospital he nodded yes he will go to prison probably for years but that doesnt mean that he wont want to employ me hes made enough money to employ a dozen people while he serves his sentence and still be a wealthy man when he comes out the dutch cant touch his money thats not here he paused if he wants me to stay on and serve his interests while he is in prison i will do so i would like to come and work for you in bahrein tom i could help you with your asiatic engineers and labour but until dwight schafter comes out of prison i will stay with him i took a drink of my lime squash and lit a cigarette it was no good saying that dwight schafter was a mercenary soldier of fortune about to be sentenced very rightly on a criminal offence that he had been gunrunning for the money there was in it that he richly deserved all he got that was the western way of looking at things but they seem different to asiatic eyes connie probably liked and respected the man probably regarded him as one who risked his life and liberty to help millions of asiatics in their struggle for freedom when liberty was lost connie would not abandon dwight schafter i sat there smoking for a time in silence looking out over the canal to the white buildings on the other side whats going to happen to the carrier connie i asked at last i said i had a proposition for you he replied shall i make it now i glanced at him and nodded i think you should take over that carrier and fly it to bahrein and operate it there he said frankly that thought had never entered my head although i suppose it might have done the carrier was a real aeroplane compared with the small stuff i was operating i measured my resources in hundreds of pounds at that time but the carrier cost more than sixty thousand it was so far beyond my capabilities that i had never bothered even to consider the economics of operating a thing like that but now that connie mentioned it i knew at once that in the persian gulf that aeroplane would pay it could carry a big truck it could carry five tons of machinery it could carry a fairsized boat or about ninety pilgrims at a time over arabia to jiddah for their pilgrimage to mecca it was a logical extension of the business i was doing i couldnt pay for it i said ive not got the money and what makes you think that schafter would want to part with it what else can he do if he leaves it on the field at damrey phong some war lord will turn up before long and take it and probably crash it if he has it flown down here the dutch will take it from him if he has it flown back to america his own government may take it from him to appease the dutch there are not many things that he can do with that aeroplane if he wants ever to see his money again but one of the first things he must do is to find somebody to fly it away out of this area to some other part of the world altogether and preferably into the british empire where the laws of property are clearly framed and easy to understand i think if you could use it he would charter it to you provided you would take it to bahrein and operate it there he paused if you did that i would ask schafter if i might go with it and work for you i think he would agree to that because that aeroplane is by far the greatest of the responsibilities that i now have for him i think that he would want me to stay with it we talked this over for half an hour and the more i thought of it the more i liked the idea i wanted connie to come and take over the maintenance of my little fleet and he wouldnt come unless i took the carrier too well i was willing enough provided that i didnt have to pay for this large aeroplane anybody would have been and the way he put it my fairy godmother was going to give it to me free he got up presently and hailed a rickshaw and went off in it to the hospital to see dwight schafter again before the nurses packed him up for the night i sat on in front of the hotel in the cool of the evening smoking and resting with the fatigue oozing out of me i was tired it was very very good to have found connie again it was like seeing a bit of light at the end of a tunnel he came back presently and found me sitting in the same place he dropped down into the same chair beside me i told dwight about you and your business at bahrein he said i said that you would take the carrier on charter if it was available and i would go with it to maintain it he will think it over during the night he wants you to go and see him early in the morning before you leave i nodded youll come along he shook his head it will be better if you talk your business with him alone i am a technical man i am not interested in money matters okay i said one little thing though did you tell him i could fly it you can fly it he replied its ten times heavier than anything ive ever flown before ten times i said i dont want there to be any misunderstanding about that what happens if i crash it you can talk about that with schafter he replied but i know this that you will fly it and you will not crash it i glanced at him but he was quite serious he spoke almost as if it was a prophecy oh you know that do you i replied more than i do im used to flying things that i land with my arse down on the ground not twenty feet up in the air still i dont mind having a stab at it if nobody else minds you will have no difficulty he said it is just like any other aeroplane they are easier to fly as they get bigger provided you are not afraid of them and you will not be afraid i grinned its a long time since ive been afraid of an aeroplane i went to see dwight schafter early next morning he was in a good ward in a normal hospital the ward sister was a dutchwoman the nurses javanese girls the only thing that marked him as a prisoner was a sentry on the door of the ward a dutch soldier in american battledress armed with a rifle he let me pass to see his prisoner without any question which relieved me i had thought that i might have to get all sorts of permits i sat down by schafters bed and told him who i was and he came to the point at once shak lin said you were here he said he told me about you said you wanted to charter my carrier i can use it i said but i cant pay much for it if im to take it to my operating basethats bahrein in the persian gulfits going to cost me six hundred pounds in fuel and oil and landing fees to get it there as a start thats got to be recovered out of profits before i can pay you anything at all for the hire bolony he said fuel will cost you nothing theres over twelve tons of hundredoctane fuel in the store at damrey phong right now you can fill her up before you start and take five tons with you in the cabin thatll get you there if you dont take it someone else will theres oil there too the rest is chicken feed maybe its chicken feed to you i said its not to me ive got to fly another pilot out to bangkok to take over the machine im flying now i suppose his fare is chicken feed too that carriers worth five thousand bucks a month in charter fees he said youd better find someone who can pay that much then i replied i cant im operating in a small way youd better offer it to pan american all right wise guy he said whats your angle on it we started in then and in a quarter of an hour we had thrashed out what i still think was equitable in the circumstances i was to take the machine to bahrein with any fuel and spares from damrey that i could carry in it with connie shaklin as my engineer i was to hold it insured as soon as it reached bahrein insurance from damrey was hardly practical i was to charter it at the rate of a dollar a month for three months or three hundred hours flying time after reaching bahrein whichever was the least in that three months schafters attorney in indianapolis would make contact with me at bahrein and i would deal with him if i wanted to buy it or charter it further or surrender it to him the machine was not to be flown into dutch or us territory jesus he said i wish some guy had given me a deal like this when i was young i wouldnt have needed to go flying guns its fair enough i said maybe but youre a darned lucky guy all the same i left the hospital and went to the arabiasumatran office and borrowed a typist and had copies of our draft charter agreement made and took them back to the hospital for him to sign we talked for some time about the flying qualities of the machine he already knew from connie that i had no large aeroplane experience he was more phlegmatic about that than i had thought he would be from something he said i knew that connie had given me a good character i bring her in about a hundred knots he said hundred and ten if its a full load or very rough take it easy and youll find her quite all right youll have shak lin with you as flight engineer thats right i said hell be with me he turned and glanced at me from the bed say he said youve known that guy a long time havent you we started off together as boys in the same air circus i said i havent see him since those days oh well hes a good engineer and hes one you can really trust you see the way hes come down here to find out what i wanted done butsay hes a queer sort of a guy in other ways isnt he i dont know i said i only met him yesterday what sort of ways hes got some mighty strange ideas for an engineer said schafter its a thing you ought to know about since youre taking him on about religion and alt that i nodded slowly connie always had been one for going to odd churches and he had the look of a priest it was a pity does it affect his work i asked ill say it does it makes his work a whole lot better i glanced at this american gunrunner in enquiry it wasnt quite the answer that i had expected ive been away a lot of the time he said i dont know all of whats been going on at damrey phong hes got a statue of a buddha set up in a little sort of a pagoda just by where we park the aircraft one of these painted clay buddhas you know like you see in the villages he has a sort of a prayer meeting there each day before they start work on the machines and after they knock off i blinked at him thats right he runs a sort of buddhist prayer meeting all in chinese or siamese or something hes got both the other engineers coming to it and the local labour and the girlsthey come along too see them all kneeling down in front of this buddha with flowers in their hands saying their prayers every morning then up they get and straight off to start work on the machines and the same thing as soon as they knock off down they go on their knees before that painted image and pray for about ten mintes then off they go is that usual with ground staff in this part of the world i asked ill say its not ive never seen it done before did shak lin start it then i think he did i think he must have done did you ask him why he did it i never had much time he said ive always been flying i did say something once and all he said was something like men worked better if they prayed he grinned just like a preacher back in indiana but i will say this those boys at damrey phong did a good job for me most asiatic engineers you knowyou just cant trust a thing they do they mean all right but theyre not responsible well these boys werent like that theyd look you right in the eye and tell you when theyd done a job on the aircraft that wasnt quite so hot like using copper wire for locking instead of steel because they were out of steel wire or putting gasket cement on an old washer to make it tight because there werent any new ones things like that theyd just come and tell you like as if they were as good as you and werent afraid of being bawled out he paused i never knew asiatic engineers like that before he said its always been the other way he glanced at me pack of lying crawling rats mostly you know i knew it only too well i dont know the east i said i worked in egypt in the war but this is my first time out here ive never met an asiatic engineer id like to trust except shaklin of course and hes really british ill be interested to hear how you made out with him one day said schafter maybe theres something in this religion business after all i wouldnt know he hesitated my copilothes an asiatic he used to go to these prayer meetings in front of the buddha regular see him kneeling there with all the others with a gladiola blossom in his hands funny to see a pilot doing that i smiled you didnt go yourself i did once he said unexpectedly the morning we were taking off in the c for this last trip here he hesitated i guess i was kind of worried or i wouldnt have done a thing like that i reckoned that the artillery roust be in action by that time and the dutchmen theyd be hopping mad n we might meet more opposition than wed had till then and when i came out of the john that morning there was nobody around no girls or anyone and there they all were praying at the buddha so i didnt want to be snooty see i went and picked a flower and knelt down with them too i couldnt understand what shak lin and the rest were saying and i got to thinking about the white wooden church at home with all the cars parked outside and the minister preaching and the sun coming in through the stained glass back home in shelbyville where i was raised in indiana he paused i guess it does you good to have a quiet time to think like that before you take off on a dicey trip i would have liked to have stayed and talked to him longer but my load would be arriving at the airport and i had to get off that day i said goodbye to him and left the hospital and went back to the hotel and paid the bill and picked up connie and drove out to kermajoran two hours later we were in the air in the airtruck on our way north to palembang we stayed there for the night i sent a cable to gujar singh in bahrein telling him to drop everything and come by airline to bangkok at once to meet us there and told him to cable me care of the flying control at don muang to say when he would arrive next day we made an early start and got to songkhla in the south of siam after landing to refuel at singapore and at kuantan we landed at bangkok about midday next day i saw very little of connie in the two days that we waited at bangkok for gujar singh i had a room at the trocadero hotel but he wouldnt stay there with me he said that he had asiatic friends who wanted to put him up and i foundlater that he was staying in a buddhist monastery just by the wat cheng pagoda he came along to the hotel each morning and evening to find out the form and when i wanted him then he would go off and i wouldnt see him again i got a guide to take me round some of the pagodas the loveliest sort of churches that i ever saw in all my life i sent a lot of picture postcards of them to dad and mum back home in southampton between the gasworks and the docks i wanted to make them understand if possible while i was waiting in bangkok i made a few enquiries about the formalities of flying in and out of indochina from siam at that time there was no very settled government in saigon and the french who were in power by virtue of their army probably had no idea that dwight schafters cornell carrier was in the country at all it seemed somewhat superfluous in those circumstances to seek for a permission to take it out of indochina but if i did not do that could i bring it into siam without getting it taken from me by the siamese i mentioned this worry to connie when he came to see me on the morning of the second day he went i think to the siamese airways manager at don muang and together they went to some department of the government about it dwight schafters prestige amongst the asiatics was high and the siamese would put no obstacle in connies way as the agent of dwight schafter in the disposal of his assets by the time gujah singh arrived connie was able to assure us that we had leave to fly in and out of don muang with no questions asked for the sake of the record when we left for indochina in the airtruck we cleared for hua hin a siamese seaside resort about a hundred miles to the south i unloaded my cargo of radio apparatus for holland from the airtruck before taking off and left it in the bonded store at don muang if anything should happen to the airtruck in indochina i didnt want to lose the cargo i took off from don muang early one morning with connie and gujar squatting on their bags behind me in the empty cabin three hours later i was coming in to land upon the strip at damrey phong that strip was very beautiful there was a mountain about two thousand feet high just to the north of it which made things a bit awkward on the circuit but this mountain was covered in flowering trees the flame of the forest and these trees were all in bloom so that the side of the mountain was covered with orangered splashes on the jungle green the little atap village was just by the strip and there were flowers everywhere bougainvillaea and hibiscus and frangipani all over the houses and the little streets beyond the village was the river and a flat plain with hills again in the blue distance beyond it was a quiet happy beautiful little place nothing had ever happened there before the airstrip came and now that dwight schafter had passed on probably nothing would ever happen there again the cornell carrier was parked just off the middle of the strip by the two european houses i put the airtruck down and taxied to park her by the carrier as i did so men and women came streaming from the village i swung the airtruck quickly into the parking position and stopped the propellers in case the natives came crowding round but they formed a sort of circle round the aircraft at a safe distance waiting for us to get out i turned in my seat and said to connie its a pretty little place he smiled i am glad to see the carrier still here i was worried that some war lord might have gone off with it we got out of the machine and he introduced us to his two mechanics u myin the burmese lad and chai tai foong the chinese from hong kong u myin spoke no english and seemed a bit dumb generally but tai foong could make himself understood in english and seemed brighter all round we went at once to have a look at the carrier the people parted to let us through they were mostly men and children some of the men very old such young women as were there were i think the mistresses or housekeepers of the engineers relations were evidently very good with these people they paid little attention to me or to gujar but when connie spoke to any of them or even when he turned his head they touched the right hand to the forehead and bowed to him the carrier was in very good order she was only four or five months old of course and she had only done about three hundred hours flyingnothing in the life of a machine like that in the cabin or hold where the load was carried she had had rough usage but externally the paint was hardly scratched and in the pilots cockpit everything looked new she had been very carefully maintained by connie and his boys in the cockpit everything was spotlessly clean the windscreens newly polished the safety belts folded neatly across each seat as if for an inspection i was amazed that fortune should have brought so fine an aeroplane into my hands the only thing now wascould i fly her she was only half full of fuel which suited me for a first solo we had a meal of rice and little side dishes of curried fish and chillies served by the girls in the house of the two engineers and then connie and i went out to the carrier to try my luck we spent about an hour on the machine together mostly in the cockpit till i knew all the controls by heart then with connie by my side in the copilots seat i started up the engines ran her warm and ran them up to power for the engine check then i throttled back to idling and eased the brakes and taxied out on to the strip a queer thought came to me then as i taxied down to the far end in that lovely place i leaned over to connie by my side in the wide cockpit weve come a long way since we used to drive that ford in gretna green in cobhams circus i said i had not sat beside him since that i could recollect he smiled those were good days i turned the machine at the end and the strip lay stretched out before us there was little or no wind i was in no hurry i sat there for a few minutes doing the final cockpit check and getting comfortable then when i was ready to go i raised my head and had a good look round about half the people including gujar singh and the two engineers were standing watching under the shade of the wing of the airtruck but the rest were kneeling in front of the buddha on his throne under a little palm thatch roof it was all very bright and colourful upon that aerodrome i said to connie what are they doing there praying yes he said for me that im not going to make a muck of this he laughed for us both probably more for me than for you well i said its nice to know somebody cares and with that i pushed the throttles open and we took off down the strip as connie had said she handled just like any other aeroplane except that she had better manners than most i climbed her slowly straight out over the sea to about five thousand feet then turned and came back over damrey phong i played about with her up there for twenty minutes till i had the feel of her with engines on or throttled flaps up or down and then i brought her down and did a circuit and made a long approach the landing went all right the undercarriage was so good it didnt seem to matter how you put her down i took her off again in all i did four landings on her without incident when i taxied in beside the airtruck i was very pleased with myself i could fly that thing fuelling at damrey phong was quite a business the petrol was in fortygallon drums in a store down by the river and these drums had to be rolled up by hand to the machine a distance of about half a mile we needed about six hundred gallons to put into the carrier and about twentyfive more drums to load into the cabin to be taken with us on the flight there was a small portable motor pump to lift the fuel from the drums twenty feet up into the wing tanks but even with this help the work was severe and lengthy damrey phong though healthy is a humid place and we were all sweating in torrents before long we could not get it done that evening as the sun went down i told connie to knock off the men we would finish in the morning i had an idea that he would want some daylight for his worshipping before the buddha and we couldnt go on working after dark anyway i walked across to the house that had been occupied by dwight schafter and his copilot seriot which was where i was to sleep and threw off my wet shirt and trousers and stood under the kerosinetin shower and put on dry clothes when i came out it was evening there was still a golden sunlight on the big hill by the strip but overhead the sky was getting blue and the light was going i had guessed correctly about connie he was standing in front and to one side of the buddha and all the people were kneeling in front of it with flowers in their hands as dwight schafter had said i strolled up closer to see what was going on i could not understand what he was saying but it was clear that he was leading them in prayer one phrase of four words was continually repeated as in a litany connie would say a sentence or two facing the statue and the rest of them would then repeat this phrase with him very reverently it was with something of a shock that i saw gujar singh kneeling there amongst them his turban on his head a flower in his hands beneath his great black beard i was the only one who was not praying the only one from the west in damrey phong perhaps like dwight schafter i didnt want to be snooty perhaps it was that i couldnt bear to be left out it couldnt do any harm in any case i went forward and went down upon my knees in the last row i couldnt understand what it was all about but that didnt seem to matter there was an asiatic by me a coolie who had been rolling barrels all the afternoon he had a sheaf of gladiola blossoms in his hand quietly he parted them and gave me two to hold beryl had put her head in the gas oven because i had been proud and righteous in the eyes of other people and unkind that had set my life upon the course that in the end had brought me to this place far from southampton docks and my own people worshipping with natives in an eastern village beryl had died because i was proud and unkind how many other people should i kill like that before i died too presently i realised that connie was speaking in english he had not altered his posture or his tone but he was saying it is written in the dhammapada your yourself must make the effort buddhas only show the way cut down the love of self as one cuts the lotus in the autumn give yourself to following the path of peace and then he repeated and the others with him the phrase that i had noticed before om mani padme hum i stayed there on my knees with them till it was nearly dark o spiritual pilgrim rise the night has grown her single horn the voices of the souls unborn are half adream with paradise james elroy flecker we got the loading finished next morning and got the fuel drums lashed down in the cabin i had no intention of flying the carrier by night till i was more used to her and so we made the first days stage to bangkok only we had to stop there anyway to load the cargo that i had left there back into the airtruck on connies advice i engaged chai tai foong to come with us to join the staff at bahrein he was a good lad who spoke a little english and he knew the carrier the other one u myin i had no place for but i offered him a passage in the carrier to rangoon where we should land after bangkok i didnt quite know how gujar would get on in foreign countries and i meant to stay with him as far as calcutta where he would be in his own ground after that i would leave him and go ahead because the carrier was much faster than the airtruck and had a much greater range we had a meal at midday and got off for bangkok after lunch it was affecting in a way because the people of the village were so deeply grieved to see connie go he had his service at the buddha in the morning before starting work and most of the village turned up for it women as well as men there must have been over two hundred people there n the strip it only lasted about ten minutes the people hung about the strip all day they paid no attention to the rest of us but their eyes followed connie everywhere a curious thing was that three monks turned up in yellow robes with shaven heads and bare feet they made the same obeisance to him that the villagers made touching their fingers to the forehead and bowing low this seemed odd to me but i was sorting out the maps with gujar at the time and didnt take much notice of what they were doing the trouble was that we had only one set of maps for the two aircraft which made things a bit tricky we couldnt fly in company because the airtruck cruised at a hundred miles an hour and the carrier at a hundred and fifty at the cruising speed of the airtruck the carrier would have been just about falling out of the air there was quite a good assortment of spares for the carrier in dwight schafters house and several valuable bits of ground equipmenttowing bars hydraulic jacks and all that sort of thing in all there was over a ton of stuff we put this in the airtruck for the flight to bangkok as the carrier was loaded to the limit meaning to transfer it at don muang when the carrier had used up some of her fuel load in this way we managed to take with us everything of importance that dwight schafter had at damrey phong except about four tons of petrol that we had to leave in the store for the benefit of whoever came along we taxied down to the end of the strip together and took off in turn gujar singh first in the airtruck with the two engineers i followed in the carrier with connie by my side i turned after taking off and followed gujar round upon a lefthand circuit before getting upon course and having raised the flaps and throttled back the boost and set the revs i glanced out of the window at the strip on my left side the whole village seemed to be standing by the buddha looking up at us they were not waving they were just standing there motionless and sad watching us as we flew away we flew past gujar singh and waved at him and went on a compass course that would bring us to the menam river between bangkok and the sea i had given our one map to gujar having made a few extracts from it on a sheet of paper the carrier had an automatic pilot and at our sector height and on our course i put this in and sat for ten minutes watching that it was working all right then connie and i left our seats and went to the wireless and found bangkok broadcasting station and took a series of bearings on it to check our course in the course of an hour the bearings gradually crept round from degrees to degrees magnetic which should have brought us to the river and when we got to that point and stood up to look out of the windscreen there was the river it was as easy as that we landed at don muang about an hour ahead of gujar singh the siamese control officers knew the carrier well they were most tactful and asked no questions we transferred the loads next morning and took off about midday for rangoon flying by the three pagodas pass and the line of the burmasiam railway made in the war with the labour of asiatics and prisoners of war at a vast cost in human life again we got to rangoon an hour or so before gujar plodding along behind us at a hundred miles an hour i was able to raise some more maps at mingadon airport we stayed the night in the hostel there and said goodbye to u myin and went on at dawn next day that day we landed to refuel the airtruck at chittagong after flying up the coast of arakan and took off in the early afternoon for calcutta at calcutta i left gujar to follow on behind at the best speed he could make and went ahead with connie in the carrier we made one long hop to karachi in the day flying right over india at about ten thousand feet stayed there the night and left next morning for bahrein direct we got there in the early afternoon and circled the familiar airport in our new large aircraft there was the other airtruck parked outside and arjan singh with the ground staff standing looking up at this strange freight aircraft that was coming in to land they didnt know it was a new addition to the fleet in the next few weeks i had a lot of work i reorganised the ground staff and put connie in charge of all maintenance i wanted to get gujar singh on to flying the carrier as soon as possible but i was resolved that he should do a hundred hours on it with me as copilot before taking it on alone with two of us off nearly every day in the carrier because there was a lot of business for it from the start it was urgently necessary for us to get another pilot by that time i was getting letters in almost every mail from british pilots wanting a job but i was getting on all right with asiatics at a quarter the salary and probably harder working i got an iraqi called hosein who had been an officer in the iraqi air force he could fly twinengined stuff and so gujar put him on the airtruck right away i now had four aircraft all going hard and so i found i had to get another boy clerk and more labourers it was getting to be quite a business there was work for the carrier more work than we could handle from the first day for the first time we had an aircraft in the persian gulf that was really designed to carry heavy commercial loads we could take a motor pump out four hundred miles into the desert or a concretemixer or a truck we could fetch a crashed aircraft from sharjah or kuwait and take it to egypt in a few hours for repair and we did that more than once returning with loads of cases of machinery or engineering stores there was all manner of work for a big freight aircraft we discovered in the persian gulf and it showed no sign whatever of getting any less in batavia dwight schafter came up for trial by the dutch and got three years imprisonment his copilot seriot got twelve months i wrote to schafter about that time saying that the carrier was safe and earning its keep and i should be willing to negotiate with his attorney to buy it at my own price by instalments over a period so far as i could see the thing would have paid its cost in about two years if i could spread the instalment payments over that time i should get it without having to put down any capital at all dwight schafter i felt wouldnt need the money till hed done his sentence it might well be that he would agree to such a scheme in the hangar connie got the organisation into order in a very short time i had increased the staff by the chinese chai tai foong that we had brought from damrey phong and by another iraqi so that i now had connie four licensed engineers and five engineering labourers the latter all arabs from bahrein i had suggested to connie that i should get him into the radio operators chummery with me but he wouldnt have it i am an asiatic he said it would lead to difficulties i dont see why it should youre only technically an asiatic after all he smiled perhaps but i should prefer to live in the souk i must learn arabic now and anyway i shall feel freer there he had a great ability to learn languages i was to discover three months seemed to be quite enough for him to become fluent in any eastern language all right i said i dont want to press you to live on the station where are you staying now gujar singh has found me a room near his place he said a room in the house of an arab merchant who sells silks i shall be all right there its a good long way from the hangar i said what will you dowalk it he grinned do what gujar singh doesget a bicycle my chief pilot came to work each day on an old rusty ladys bicycle his black beard flowing fiercely in the breeze all this expansion made a considerable stir on bahrein aerodrome practically every month i had to go to the raf and ask if i could lease another building although in theory i was making money hand over fist there was never any of it in evidence it all went back into aeroplanes and tools and sparesinto various capital accounts i should have been hard put to it to find the money to erect the simplest wooden hut but fortunately there were plenty of empty buildings belonging to the raf that had been put up in the war and had been empty ever since the accountant officer was very helpful whenever i wanted a new store or office he could usually produce something although on a very shortterm lease i was lucky in the officers i had to deal with perhaps certainly without the help and encourage ment of the raf id never have been able to build up the business in those early years i had no time of course for any social intercourse nor eould i have kept my end up in such matters i got my education at the fitters bench not at a university the persian gulf states are advised by a british resident sir william faulkner who lives at the residency in bahrein with secretaries and whatnot from the foreign office i saw these people sometimes as they came and went in aircraft at the aerodrome but i never spoke to any of them for years i never did any work for them because my business was freight alone ive never put a passenger seat into an aeroplane unless its weight was charged for or employed a stewardess and i hope i never shall i went into that business to make money not to lose it and my sort of aircraft werent the sort to carry diplomats about the place i went on living at the radio operators chummery and in the sergeants mess i got to know some of the young officers quite well however when they went on leave i could often give them a free ride to india or to egypt if they didnt mind sitting on their luggage with the load in an unheated and unsoundproof cabin and i was always glad to help them in this way as they helped me a lot of them had nothing much to do and they were keen on aeroplanes i did far more flying at bahrein in those postwar years than ever the raf did and these boys used to come down to the hangar sometimes and just sit around and watch some of them got to know as much of what was going on in my crowd as i did myself or a bit more flight lieutenant allen came into my office once for something or otheri forget what it was as he turned to go he grinned and said hows old harpic getting on who do you call harpic i enquired it was a new one to me sorry he said mr shaklin your chief engineer doing all right i replied why do you call him that hes clean round the bend hes a bloody good engineer i said hes brisking up the other boys im getting the maintenance properly done now that ive given up trying to run everything myself he talks religion to them all the time well what of it i said do some of you young muggers good if you thought about your immortal souls a bit you cant maintain aircraft with the koran in one hand and a spanner in the other or can you course you can i said hes doing it who told you anyway because i knew that anything of that sort that was going on in my hangar went on in arabic i was starting to understand a bit of arabic myself by that time but i was pretty sure that flight lieutenant allen didnt know a word the barman in the mess was telling us its getting talked about all over the town they say that if you want religion you can go and listen to the imam in the mosque or you can go and listen to old harpic in the hangar i grinned do you a bit of good to go to either he went away and i sat on at the bare table that i used as a desk listening to the typewriter in the next room slightly uneasy connie was getting talked about it seemed i should know more of what was going on i knew it happened mostly in the afternoon in the last hour of work before they knocked off for the afternoon prayer i went down to the hangar that afternoon and got into the cockpit of the foxmoth with a pencil and a notebook i had intended for some time to fit a blind flying panel in the instrument board and i wanted to scheme it out but that wasnt really the reason that i went standing beside the fox was the first airtruck and connie was doing a top overhaul on the port engine he had a working platform rigged up by the engine of a couple of planks on trestles and he was up on this thing with a ground engineer and one of the arab boys most of the rest of the staff seemed to have arranged their work to get within earshot they were all doing something but they were listening at the same time up on his platform working on the engine connie was talking to them he was speaking partly in english and partly in arabic which he could already speak much better than i could we are a peculiar people he was saying we who care for aeroplanes for common men it is enough to pray five times in each day as the imam dictates and as is ordained in the koran but we are different we engineers we are called to a higher task than common men and allah will require much more from us than that he paused and said to the man working with him got a fivesixteenth box there thanks now hold it just like that they worked on for a time in silence you have heard from the imam of the journey that the prophet of god made when he was roused from sleep by the angel gabriel who mounted him upon the horse with eagles wings al borak you know how he passed by the three temptations and traversed the seven heavens till he came to the house of adoration and the presence of god god then gave to the prophet the main doctrines of the faith and ordained that prayers should be said by the faithful each day he paused and slipped the nuts collected in his hand into an old cigarette tin now draw her off gently wait a minutethe gaskets sticking on this side they disengaged the cylinder head and passed it down carefully from hand to hand to the ground connie straightened up how many times were prayers to be said each day there was a momentary silence then two or three said at once fifty times and someone added teacher i noted that for thinking over later on this thing was going deeper than i knew about that is correct said connie fifty times i see you all dont know this story or you have forgotten it and yet of all men you should know it do you not know that when the prophet descended from the presence he met moses one or two of the men nodded moses asked how many times god had required the people to pray and mahomet said fifty times and moses told him that it was impracticable that he had tried it with the children of israel and he had never succeeded in getting anybody to pray fifty times a day he said that the prophet should go back to god and humbly beg that this number of prayers each day should be reduced mahomet did so and on coming from the presence he met moses again and told him that the number was reduced to forty prayers a day that is still too much said moses the people will not pray so many times you must go back and ask him to reduce it further he paused lets have that no cranked cylinder head spanner presently he went on urged by moses it is written that the prophet went back and back to god until the number of prayers was reduced to five each day and still moses said do you think you can exact five prayers a day from your people by allah i have been through this with the children of israel and it cannot be done go back and ask him to reduce it yet again but the prophet said no i will not go back i have asked his indulgence already until i am ashamed my people are not israelites and they shall worship him five times a day that is the reason why every believer has to say his prayers to god five times each day he spoke again to the other engineer about the cranked spanners and then decided to loosen a part of the induction manifold to get at the nuts he went on that is the story that you know and have been taught as true believers only gome of you seem to have forgotten it but you will see that five prayers is the minimum the number was brought down to be within the power of the unlettered common mana camel driver or a shepherd but we are not like that we engineers we are men of understanding and of education on whom is laid responsibility that men may travel in these aeroplanes as safely as if they were sitting by the well in the cool of the evening we are not men like camel drivers or shepherds and god will demand much more from us than from them from men like us the full tally of fifty prayers a day will be demanded five of them must be made in public or in private according to the way you know but this is the bare minimum for all men from men like you another fortyfive prayers are demanded i will tell you about them they detached a part of the induction manifold and passed it down to the ground and started to slack off the nuts of the next cylinder head fortyfive prayers a day may seem a lot to you he said in arabic they did to moses yet fortyfive more prayers a day was the commandment of god and god is allseeing and allknowing and allmerciful he would not command that you should do more than you can perform men who work as you do upon aeroplanes can pray to god fortyfive times a day quite easily and i will tell you how he straightened up upon the trestle and looked down on them spanner in hand he was wearing a soiled khaki shirt and khaki shorts he wore old oilstained shoes with socks rolled round about his ankles beads of sweat were making little glistening streaks upon his face in the heat of the hangar and the shirt clung to his back in dark wet patches his hands and forearms were stained and streaked with oil from the engine mixed with sweat i inspect some of the work you do upon these engines and these aeroplanes he said god the allseeing and allknowing he inspects it all you come to me and say i have replaced this manifold and the job is finished i come to look at it to see if there is any fault and i see everything in place i look at the nuts and i see the locking wires correctly turned the right way to prevent the nuts unscrewing and that is all that i can see i cannot see if the nuts are screwed only fingertight i cannot see if you have put a lever on the spanner and strained them up so tight that the bolts are just about to fail in tension these things are hidden from me but nothing is hidden from the allseeing eye of god he paused god the all knowing knows if you have done well or ill he said quietly if you ask him humbly in prayer to tell you he will tell you if you have done well or ill in that way you will have a chance to do the job again and try to do it better or you can come to me and say help me to do this work because i cannot do it right god is allmerciful and he will not hold bad work against you if he sees you striving to do right so i say this to you he paused again with every piece of work you do with every nut you tighten down with every filter that you clean or every tappet that you set pause at each stage and turn to mecca and fold your hands and humbly ask the allseeing god to put into your heart the knowledge whether the work that you have done has been good or ill then you are to stand for half a minute with your eyes cast down thinking of god and of the job and god will put into your heart the knowledge of good or ill so if the work is good you may proceed in peace and if it is ill you may do it over again or come to me and i will help you to do well before god he turned back to the engine if you do this he said you will soon find that you are praying to god fortyfive times a day or more as he directed the prophet in the first instance moses and mahomet were quite right to get the tally reduced because the people of that day were nomads and camel drivers but you are educated men doing the most skilled work in all the world and so much closer to god god will require more of you than of common men you are worth more than many camel drivers because men look to you to see how good work should be done and now i tell you good work can be done only with the help and power of the allknowing god it was only then that i noticed what young tarik was doing he had got out a penny exercise book bought in the souk or stolen from a school and he was writing busily in it with a pencil using the workbench as a desk he was obviously having difficulty in keeping up and i would have given a good deal for a look at the book i didnt know that tarik could write but equally obviously he was doing his best to write down everything that connie said i wondered when i saw him how long he had been doing it it was five oclock presently and time for the men to knock off those who were moslems which meant most of the men working in the hangar went out to the little patch of ground beside the hangar and turned to mecca and commenced their afternoon rakats i had noticed a couple of days before that they had fallen into the habit of doing this together in a little crowd or congregation and i was surprised to see some of the arab servants from the raf camp join them one of these i thought i recognised as the barman in the officers mess though i had only seen him once or twice and i couldnt be sure connie did not join them in their devotional postures he went with them and knelt in prayer a little way apart from them facing to mecca as they did but kneeling all the time i guessed that this was because he was not a moslem and for the first time i wondered what he was i must say i was rather impressed in aircraft work of the somewhat pioneering sort that i was doing you have to be adaptable when a new situation arises without precedent you have to go to first principles and make the precedent yourself and this religious turn that my maintenance crew were taking was just one of those things i had chosen to staff my enterprise entirely with asiatics having done that with my eyes open i could not expect to run the nonessential parts of my business wholly in the european way there must be tolerance on my part and i must adapt my way of doing things to suit their ways of life you can run a workshop in the western style with time clocks and job cards and ratefixers and premium bonus schemes but to make a success of that youve got to have some people from the west to work in it and i myself was the only one in the party or you can run it in the eastern way and thats not necessarily a bad or inefficient or slovenly way connie had introduced into my shop a form of discipline that was quite new to me but the proof of the pudding after all was in the eating and i was coming to the conclusion that the results were pretty good the aeroplanes were being well maintained dwight schafter had commented on that when i had met him in the hospital in batavia he had said that asiatic engineers who worked with connie became confident and responsible people my own experience was tending in the same direction and i began to watch the work that went on very closely i must say i was very pleased indeed so pleased that i mentioned it to gujar singh one day to get his views gujar and i had flown the carrier to a place called el hazil in the arabian desert about halfway between kuwait and egypt with a load of machinery for the pipe line el hazil at that time was little more than a sand airstrip three wooden huts and half a dozen tents with a bedouin encampment in the middle distance it was nearly dark when the unloading was finished and there was some stuff to go back to bahrein that was coming in to the strip in the morning so we stayed there for the night sleeping on camp beds in the cabin of the aircraft as we often did we had supper with the engineers in their mess hut and strolled over to the aircraft presently smoking in the cool of the night it was very quiet in the desert the dark blue sky was sown with millions of bright stars i said to gujar how do you think things are going in the hangar now he said i think very well i nodded i think so too we walked on for a few paces i think shak lin is very good with them i said at last i had fallen into the habit of using his asiatic name when speaking to an asiatic im just a little worried about all this religion i suppose thats quite all right he smiled i do not think you have anything to worry about i think it is a very good thing i hesitated one of the raf officersflight lieutenant allenwas saying the other day that hes getting talked about in the souk do you think thats true he said there is talk in the souk about him not going to make any trouble is it i had in mind vague stories of religious riots and that sort of thing i dont think so he said you know that he is great friends with the imam i didnt know that oh yes he told me they have long talks together very frequently that was something anyway if the imam knew what was going on in the hangar it was unlikely that there would be trouble with the orthodox moslems what is he gujar i asked is he a moslem he smiled he is not a moslem when i met him first i thought he was a buddhist at damrey phong now i dont know what he is i glanced at him i saw you praying with him there before the buddha i thought you were a sikh he laughed i saw you too mr cutter i thought you were a christian oh well and then i stopped a bit embarrassed i was about to say that that was different and then it seemed tq me to be a bit silly to say that i didnt know what to say it was infinitely quiet and blue and peaceful in the desert night perhaps said my chief pilot presently he is just an ordinary man like you and i who has the power to make men see the advantage of turning to god as you have power to make men see the advantage of sending new tracks for a bulldozer by air it seemed a funny sort of way to look at things maybe i said vaguely the part that concerns me of course is the maintenance and im bound to say i think thats going a lot better since he came i think it will do so gujar said we strolled on together lor a while in silence presently he said people get into such bad habits when they start to learn the techniques of the west bad habits i said he struggled to express himself in english i am not trying to be rude you english and americans have your own way of life which is different to ours i know you have your own codes of behaviour which are based upon the christian religion and very good they are but you are not religious people as we understand it in the asiatic countries few of you pray to god in public or in private even once a week he paused but god and prayer to god is necessary to us when one of our boys starts to learn an english or american technique like the maintenance of aircraft he said he learns from men who are materialistic in their way of life he learns that science is the ruling force in the world that every effect has a certain cause only when men are old and wise can they begin to see the power of god even behind these things of science and our young men are neither old nor wise they see that railways run and ships steam and aeroplanes fly without the help of god so they abandon god and turn to science and then because religion is necessary to us they are bewildered he smiled i know what english pilots say about asiatic ground engineers he said i myself prefer to fly an aircraft serviced by a british engineer with god taken from their way of life our engineers become slovenly and irresponsible they need a british or an american foreman who can check their work all the time if the aircraft are to be safe to fly i think that shak lin understands this very well he is showing your men that god is with them in the hangar and making them turn to god for help in doing their work well he is giving back to them the thing that has been taken from their lives i think that you may find that in a years time your ground engineers are as good or better than any english engineer he laughed if that happens you will have a maintenance staff that is unique in asia in more ways than one we went to bed soon after that i let him go first because in the cabin of the carrier there was no privacy and he had a lot to do with combing his long black hair bandaging up his beard and saying his prayers that did not seem to be any concern of mine i stood outside leaning against the tail of the aircraft thinking about what he had said i was starting to get an uneasy feeling that there was more in this business than operating aircraft and cutting the costs and charging enough to show a decent profit there were things going on that i didnt really understand and though they seemed to be beneficent i found them worrying they did not become less worrying as time went on the three months nominal hire of the carrier came to an end and left me of course with a very substantial profit on its operation for it was flying several hours every day i had engaged iha protracted threecornered negotiation to buy it in instalments conducted by means of letters and cables to dwight schafter in prison in batavia and to his attorney in indianapolis it wasnt an easy deal because they wanted dollars for it and i could only pay in blocked sterling however they werent in any position to sell it in america while it was his property which gave me some advantage we finally settled on a price of twentyfour thousand pounds for it to be paid in equal instalments of a thousand pounds a month at that it was a cheap aeroplane and i was very well pleased in the hangar after a month or two there was a tendency for casual arabs to drift in and sit about around the machines especially in the afternoon when connie was in the habit of talking to the men in the last hour of the day apparently these people came from muharraq and even across the causeway from bahrein for the sole purpose of listening to what was going on in the hangar and saying their payers with the party afterwards the aerodrome was an raf station and there was a guard on the road but so many arabs were employed about the camp that there was ttever any difficulty about getting in there was the obvious danger that tools would be stolen and apart from that the people were a nuisance to the work i had a talk with connie about it in the office one day well have to keep them out i said i dont want to be unreasonable but we cant have all these bodies round the aircraft he nodded i quite agree ill get a notice put up on a board in arabic then well string a cord across the mouth of the hangar and have one of the labourers on guard but im afraid theyll probably come all the same you wont mind if they come and sit outside the hangar behind the rope i dont mind what they do so long as they dont come into the hangar i said what do they come for the engineers have been talking about the prayers we have after work he said the people come to join in those they walk all the way from bahrein to say their prayers outside our hangar yes he said its a bit of a novelty for them you see well its all right with me i told him so long as we keep them out of the hangar i dont want the tools stolen he said oh they wouldnt do that says you they wouldnt all they want to do is to come here and pray they wouldnt steal things from a mosque i should be very much surprised if we lost anything you mean they come to our hangar as a mosque in a way well i dunno i said a little at a loss anyway lets keep them out ill see to that he got up to go and then he said my mother died last week he had never mentioned his family to me at all he was a queer solitary man i say im sorry about that i said im very sorry indeed connie was that in san diego he nodded these things have to happen he said quietly she had been ill for several months my sister had been looking after her im very sorry i repeated and then i said youve got just the one sister havent you he nodded she lived with my mother not married no one has to try and help ones staff when they are in trouble and i had known connie since i was a boy whats she going to do i asked does she work there he nodded shes got quite a good job shes a secretary with an american export firmcollins and sequoia inc she speaks and writes chinese you see shorthand typist he nodded too bad youve got to live on opposite sides of the world i said if shed like to join you here ill give her a tryout in the office for a couple of months no hard words if she doesnt suit though and the job comes to an end after two months i had never had a shorthand typist and though the babu clerk was good up to a point the correspondence was always on top of us a semiasiatic girl might be the answer he said thats good of you tom i dont know that shed fit in here but ill certainly write and put it to her i nodded do that connie id like to help if i can and im damn sorry about your mother i really am the rope across the mouth of the hangar and the notice in arabic did the trick all right most afternoons people used to collect outside the hangar at about four oclock they would squat down on their heels in the shade beside the rope and look at what was going on inside and listen to what they could on some afternoons there were as many as twenty of them mostly elderly men they were quite orderly and never made any trouble for moslems there is extra virtue in prayer as a congregation and these chaps used to sit around until the engineers knocked off and then they would all go together to the bit of vacant land beside the hangar and do their rakats in a group connie kneeling a little way apart the chinese chai tai foong took to coming to the prayer meeting after a bit he was not a moslem and he knelt apart behind connie i used to keep an eye on what went on in the hangar in the afternoons because it all seemed a bit difficult to me however much work i had on my desk on the days when i wasnt flying i usually took a stroll down to the hangar about that time i did this one afternoon about a month after the rope up and found a big new hudson saloon parked just by rope and four very welldressed arabs squatting by the rope a little apart from the crowd looking at what was going bn inside one of these men was very old i knew him and one of the others by sight it was the sheikh abd el kadir and his wazir hussein there is a great big barren island by bahrein which is the sheikhdom of khulal its practically all desert with a few tiny hamlets scattered round the coasts where fishermen and pearl divers live the place is about a hundred miles long and fifty or sixty across but it is quite waterless and uninhabited in the middle i suppose there may be six or seven thousand arabs in the whole sheikhdom about three thousand of whom live on the east coast in the one place that can be called a town the capital baraka there is an airstrip there marked out upon the desert with small cairns of stones painted white and in baraka sheikh abd el kadir had his palace about a hundred miles as the crow flies from bahrein khulal produces a little dried fish a few pearls of poor quality a negligible quantity of dates and a vast amount of crude oil the arabiasumatran company have a field of oil wells near the southwest corner of the island and a refinery at a place on the west side called habban there is a pier here to which the tankers come and a town of modern standardised houses where about a thousand europeans live they pay a royalty to the sheikh for every barrel of his oil they take away and i had heard various opinions of his income from this source some said he had an income of a million pounds a year but others said that it was nothing like so much as that not more than three hundred thousand whatever his financial position was the old man had sufficient for his daily needs considering that he paid no taxes whatsoever he lived quite modestly in a small palace just outside baraka white and rococo and surrounded by a grove of date palms i had flown a new packard to him in the carrier a month or two before and had met the prime minister hussein now there they all were sitting gravely before the rope that kept them out of the hangar trying to hear what was going on inside i didnt quite know what to do but i walked up to them and smiled at hussein who got up from the ground to meet me the others looked up and rose too even the old sheikh i said this is a great honour mr hussein the rope wasnt meant to keep you out he smiled and bowed and then speaking in arabic he introduced me to the sheikh who bowed to me i said in halting arabic so many people come to hear what shak lin says to the engineers that we have had to put this rope or the men could not work but if you want to hear more will you not come inside the old man replied but he was very old and he mumbled so that with my poor knowledge of arabic i couldnt understand him i said forgive me i speak arabic so badly which was one phrase that i knew by heart hussein said in english the sheikh wishes very greatly to hear the teacher but he is rather deaf it is very kind of you i lifted the rope for them and the four men moved majestically across the floor of the hangar their long white skirts swishing with every step i could not take any part in their devotions or in their relations with shak lin he was doing something with one of the engineers on the benchchecking the gap of a contact breaker i think i crossed to him and said connie this is the sheik of khulal and his party ive told them they can come into the hangar any time is that all right with you he looked up i can deal with them all right then ill leave them with you i took him forward with me and introduced him to the old sheikh in my halting arabic and they bowed to each other and then i that i had a great deal of work waiting for me in my office and went away i felt at the time that it was cowardice but it was a situation that i really couldnt cope with at all when i looked out after the men had knocked off there was the sheikh and his party outside the hangar with the rest of them going through the rakats but a little to one side of the crowd later they got into the hudson and drove off they didnt come to the aerodrome again that i know of but connie used to go to them usually on friday which is the moslem day of prayer he made these visits to baraka at irregular intervals sometimes once a month and sometimes i frequent intervals than that baraka although only a hundred miles away is pretty inaccessible there is no post or telegraph service and no regular boat service or land transport i always knew when he was going there because he came and booked the foxmoth and got one of the pilots to fly him over he never learned to pilot a machine himself i used to charge him the full rate for these trips less ten per cent we went on steadily for some months after that building up the business i got a proctor a singleengined fourseat aircraft cheap in egypt as a replacement for the foxmoth which was really much too slow and too short in range for the work we put it to in the persian gulf we kept the foxmoth in commission for short trips about bahrein and the two airtrucks were working steadily but the bulk of the turnover of course was done by the carrier i charged sixty pounds an hour for the carrier which came to about a penny for every pound weight carried a hundred miles and at that the machine was working practically to capacity all over the persian gulf and lar beyond in those months i took on another sikh pilot a chap called kahan singh i still did the longest trips upon the carrier myself though gujar normally now flew it as chief pilot with one of the others with him as copilot we got a big job for the carrier one day to fly to burma the arabiasumatran oil company had interests in the oilfields at yenanyaung in central burma and had a load of machinery to send there from bahrein the return load was to be a number of the european staff coming home on leave these men were to ride home as far as bahrein in the carrier and would go on to england or to holland by the normal airlines i took the carrier upon this trip myself with arjan singh i wanted to see how arjan carried on before approving him as the chief pilot of the carrier in gujars absence i used this as a training flight in fact and sat in the copilots seat all the way making arjan act as captain of the aircraft as well as doing all the navigation and the radio i only helped him when it was physically impossible for him to be doing two jobs at the same time i made him do all the formalities upon the groundthe manifests the customs clearances the immigration formalities the flight planseverything he got on all right of course he had in fact a good many more hours flying experience than i had myself and on more types but one likes to be certain and he didnt know the route beyond calcutta while cruising across baluchistan and india upon tail journey in the long hours of sitting relatively idle in the copilots sea while arjan singh did all the work i had leisure to consider my business as a whole the various oil companies in the persian gulf were growing accustomed to the use of a large freight aircraft in their daily work and i was offering the service to them at an economic rate it would not have paid them individually to keep such a large machine as a carrier for their private use but amongst the jot of them there was more than enough work for one such aeroplane much more it was this aspect of the matter that was worrying me a bit on this journey to burma i wai taking the carrier away from the gulf for a week in that week the heavy air transport business would be at a standstill having accustomed them to the advantages of heavy air transport i could not expect them to tolerate that for long i might have to get another large aeroplane or there would be competition cropping up moreover this journey to yenanyaung was only to be the first of many the arabiasumatran people had made that fairly clear to me they had these interests in burma and they had their big establishment at diento in sumatra which i had visited in the airtruck in addition they were starting to develop an oil field on the east alligator river about a hundred and fifty miles to the east of darwin in north australia these four oil centres formed a chain fetching from the persian gulf to australia before the days of air transport each of these centres would have been equipped with the necessary scientific staff and laboratory arid field scientific equipment for it to function entirely as a separate entity with air transport it was now becoming possible for the arabiasumatran company to transfer scientists and their equipment quickly and readily from one oil field to another and this they were doing in an increasing degree there were obvious economic advantages to them in doing so and they were quite prepared to use my organisation for the transport job it meant however that if one aeroplane was to be cruising most of its time between australia and the persian gulf i should have to have another for the daytoday business at bahrein to buy another cornell carrier would be out of the question i should never get an allocation of the dollars it would have to be a british aeroplane and the plymouth tramp was the obvious british counterpart the tramp was about the same size as the carrier and had certain advantages in easy loading i knew that i could use a tramp very profitably if i could add one to my fleet the trouble was the purely mechanical business of paying for it always a bugbear a new tramp cost about fiftyfive thousand pounds and of course i hadnt got a hope of raising such a sum it was too much to expect that i should find another gunrunner operator of a tramp on his way to prison and though i could try for a secondhand tramp i very much doubted if there were any on the market i wasnt sure what sort of a reception i should get from the plymouth aircraft company if i went along as an individual tom cutter with very little money to put down upon the table and asked for an expensive aeroplane upon hirepurchase terms without any guarantees or backing whatsoever the plymouth aircraft company were a very large and powerful concern full of the most important work with no need to scratch for orders or to provide finance for small operators wanting to use their products i had a notion that i should be shown the door pretty quick if i went to their sales department with the only sort of proposition i could offer all these matters occupied my mind as i sat idly in the copilots seat from bahrein to rangoon we left about midday one day and made karachi in one hop making a night landing there at about seven oclock we slept at the airport and flew on early next day across india to calcutta and on the morning of the third day we flew to rangoon down the coast of arakan and crossing the arakan yoma south of the island of ramree we landed at mingadon airport about midday that day was a saturday and there was trouble at rangoon because all the governments civil servants were on strike this included the customs officers and mingadon airport was in confusion the police were very active and there were two other charter aircraft full of freight parked under a police guard when we got there delayed until the customs officers resumed work and could dear them passenger aircraft were allowed to function normally it was the freight that they were interested in the control officer explained the position to me quite politely i must park my aircraft under guard alongside the other two they hoped to make arrangements to clear them all on monday when travelling in the east one has to keep ones temper and take things as they come i parked the aircraft where they said and locked it up and rang up the arabiasumatran office in rangoon twelve miles away they said that one of their staff would come straight out to the aerodrome and asked if we wanted hotel accommodation in rangoon i said id rather stay out at the aerodrome i never like sleeping very far from the aircraft in a foreign country the representative of the oil company in rangoon a scotsman called macrae turned up threequarters of an hour later in a chevrolet and found arjan singh and me at lunch in the airport restaurant he was a pleasant young chap he apologised to us for the delay and promised to report on the demurrage to the bahrein office because this affected the charter fee he said that he had ascertained from the customs that all aircraft would be cleared on monday morning in the meantime he would be delighted to show us rangoon he quite understood that we preferred to sleep at the aerodrome near the aircraft but would we dine at his home that night if he sent a car for us and then tomorrow sunday he would take us to the shwe dagon pagoda and show us that it really was very good of him i told him that we had some work to do on the machine that afternoon but we would be delighted to dine with him that evening he went away then and we fetched our small luggage from the aircraft and took it to the aerodrome rest house then we refuelled the carrier and looked for a small oil leak on the starboard engine and put that right i used the last of the locking wire in the tool kit on that job while arjan was polishing the windscreens biting away the maps and making all tidy in the cockpit i trolled over to the hangar that housed the aircraft of the burmese national airways to see if they could let me have a hank of locking wire from their stores one of the first men that i saw in the hangar was u myin the burmese boy who had been with dwight schafter and connie at damrey phong he was working on the port engine of a dove he recognised me at once and he was very pleased to see me he seemed more upstanding and competent to look at than i had remembered him but he had very little more english at his command than he had had then he understood technical words of course and when he understood i wanted locking wire he left his job and took me up to the office of the chief engineer moung bah too moung bah too was a friendly and smiling young burmese who spoke perfect english he listened to what u myin had to say to him in burmese and then said to him in english of course he turned to me i think we have eighteen gauge and twentytwo gauge wire eighteen gauge all right to u myin he said go to the storekeeper and ask him for about a pound of eighteen gauge galvanised iron wire and bring it back here the boy went off and bah too offered me a cigarette its really very kind of you i said its not fair to come in and want supplies like this i hope that ill be able to do something for you in the persian gulf one day he smiled and we talked about our operations and compared notes for a few minutes presently i said hows u myin getting on oh he is very good his chief said a very good engineer he is reliable you can trust that work is well done if he says it is all right im glad to hear that i said id have taken him on myself when dwight schafter packed up but for the fact that he couldnt speak much english at that time i was running the ground engineers myself so all the people i took on had to know english fairly well he nodded i think he was very well trained when he was with schafter he said you have a chief engineer have you nota chinese called shak lin yes i said he was with schafter too hes not exactly a chinese though hes a british subject born in penang of a chinese father and a russian mother he went to school in england is that so there was keen interest now upon the wide intelligent brown face before me i had often wondered who he was youve heard of him then oh yes i have heard of him many times u myin talks to me and to the other engineers about him constantly in the workshop about his methods of teaching and inspection in bangkok too they talk of him a great deal with siamese airways i have two or three engineers from bangkok working for me now i had not thought that connie would be so well known yet it was reasonable enough because he was a man to be remembered and the aviation world was small he is religious is he not there was no mistaking the interest that moung bah too was showing yes i said hes very religious tell me what religion does he teach is he a buddhist do you know it was the same question that i had asked myself several times before i dont know what he is i said i dont think hes a buddhist because he talks about god you dont do that do you he shook his head hes certainly not a moslem although he talks a lot about god to the moslems in the hangar at bahrein i shouldnt say hes much of a christian im afraid i cant tell you what he is i have heard it said bah too observed that he has the power to make men of any religion bring that religion to daily work upon the aircraft and the results are very good i think thats fair enough i said slowly i should think thats the best definition that youd get of what he does it is very very interesting he said earnestly i am not religious myself when u myin and two other men came day to this office and asked if they might set up that that you see in the hangar i had not noticed i did not know what to say in england in the de havilland technical school where i served for five years do not put a cross up in the hangar and i run this in the way that i was taught my heart warmed to this little brown man whose problems had been so very similar to my own he laughed i did not know what to do he said in the end i told them that they might put it up but no time was to be spent in prayer in working hours it might have been myself telling somebody about my own difficulties in bahrein what have the results been like i ask does it help the work it is very good he said seriously it is a very good thing they pray before and after each shift for five minutes or less than that they say a few verses from the payehtgyee our litany of praise and then they say a prayer that shak lin taught u myin in damrey phong about the aircraft that right thinking is indicated in right work and right work in right thinking because both are one by his teaching right meditation which leads to nirvana is only attained by the exercise of right work no man cumbered with error in the work can reach the state of right meditation which is the approach to what you would call heaven i do not know if you are used to these ideas but i can tell you this since u myin introduced them to my hangar the standard of maintenance of the aircraft has improved enormously i nodded ive had the same experience i said im a christian myself of course but most of the ground staff at bahrein are moslems shak lin teaches them the same sort of thing in my hangar but conforming to the moslem code so its all a bit different but as regards the results i must say theyre very good indeed my people have got more responsible since he took over the hangar than ever they were under me he nodded it is the same here i think this new teaching is a very good thing he smiled the only complaint i have is that it is spreading most of our engineers now join in the prayers before the buddha in the hangar the transport drivers have been coming along too that is all right for our own transport drivers but lately all sorts of other people have been coming to the hangar to pray with the engineerstransport drivers from the other companies and from the petrol companies and even taxidriversthey have been coming in i cannot have all these people coming into the hangar i do not quite know what to do about it i had to put a rope up i said i told him what had been going on in bahrein and we compared notes for a few minutes then u myin came back with the locking wire his chief took it and gave it to me and i asked how much i should pay for it and he smiled and said that he was glad to be able to help i thanked him during this u myin was standing by the door although bah too had indicated that he could go but now he said laboriously mr cutter he stay two three days till monday anyway i said i cant get customs clearance until then because of this strike he said english pongyi but then his english broke down and he turned to bah too and began speaking in burmese his chief listened to him nodding now and then occasionally putting in a question presently he turned to me he says that one of our monks living just outside rangoon is an englishman he told me he is a very holy man he has been a buddhist monk a pongyi we call them for over thirty years he is a very old man now and he will not live for very much longer his name is u set tahn he has heard about shak lin this boy wants to take you to see this monk in order that you may tell him more about shak lin would you like to do that i dont mind a bit i said ive got nothing much to do tomorrow so far as i know u myin understood english much better than he could speak it because i saw his face light up when i said that and i wondered what i was letting myself in for bah too said it would probably be a great kindness if you can spare the time i got out a pencil and an old envelope and wrote the name down on the back of it with bah toos help u set tahn that is a burmese name of course he said it means mr rainbow he spoke to the boy but neither of them knew what the old mans english name had been i fixed up to meet u myin at the office of the airline in rangoon at three oclock on the following afternoon and gave me the address in montgomery street near the sulei pagoda road i drove into rangoon that evening dressed in a clean suit of whites to dine with the macraes with arjan singh with me in a neat grey suit and a red and gold embroidered turban looking like a robber baron in full dress they had an english couple to meet us and we had a very surbiton sort of a dinner party but for arjan and the two boys who served us we might have been thousands of miles away from the east they were very kind and hospitable people keeping up the english way of life meticulously far from home i asked them if they knew this english pongyi u set tahn macrae had vaguely heard at some time that there was such a person but it was news to the rest of the party that any englishman in rangoon was living as a buddhist monk and there was a marked indication that he was letting down the side by doing so i didnt pursue the subject beyond saying that i had promised to go and visit him the next afternoon nobody offered to come with me arjan singh had made a date for sunday with a countryman of his own a sikh pilot of indian national airways that he had met during the war in the royal indian air force i drove into rangoon on sunday morning a long interesting drive past lakes bordered by flame trees very beautiful the macraes took me round the shwe dagon pagoda in our stockinged feet and i marvelled then we went back to then house and changed our socks and had a drink and went down to the strand hotel for them to have lunch with me then they left me very kindly putting their car and driver at my disposal for the afternoon and i went out to meet u myin i picked him up at the air line office and we drove out together northwards from rangoon he knew where the old man lived and gave the driver the instructions in burmese we went out about six or seven miles past the lakes and came to a country district where the good class suburban bungalows standing in their gardens were merging into farm land and the palm thatch houses on posts of the poorer burmese peasants here we drove down a side road and stopped the car and got out a littleused footpath led through the scrub up on to a small hill with a few palms rising above the lower trees on top this way to ashram u myin said english pongyi live here he led the way and i followed him up the path past a farmhouse in this place that was wholly in the east i was queerly reminded of cornwall for there little farms lie close beneath small hills in just the same way we went up the path between the bushes and came to a small palm thatch house on top shaded by the palm trees all rather tumble down and decaying we stood by this and called up to it because like all these houses it stood on posts and the floor was five or six feet from the ground reached by a rough bidder a very old man came to the door and looked down on us his head and face were shaven clean and he wore only the coarse yellow robe of a monk he listened to u myin for a minute and then said good afternoon it is very kind of you to come and visit me will you come up we climbed up into the house it had an inner and an outer room all very poor in the inner room there was a bed with a mosquito net in the outer room a broken deckchair a wooden stool a table with a few tattered books upon it and little else the old man made me take the deckchair and he sat upon the stool u myin squatted on the floor beside us i knew enough about the east of course not to approach the subject of my visit directly i had all afternoon and evening to spare and it was for him to raise the subject of shak lin when he wanted to i said that i was passing through rangoon and had heard that he was living there and had come to visit him to see if there was anything that i could do for him or bring to him from other countries i explained that my aircraft were likely to be passing through rangoon fairly frequently he was a pleasant and a matteroffact old man whose manner contrasted oddly with his way of life he told me he had few needs but under a little pressure he confessed that he wanted one thing a british admiralty nautical almanac astrology enters largely into buddhist religious and he was hampered in his studies of the world to come by the fact that his nautical almanac was out of date and he could not forecast the positions of the stars and planets upon any given day i promised to get him that and we talked of unimportant things for over an hour before he raised the subject of shak lin the old man had been a colonel maurice spencer in the royal army service corps in the first world war and had come to india after that for the prosaic job of organising a service of lorries in bengal within two years he had become a buddhist and had achieved a small circle of indian buddhist friends in calcutta where he must have been a great grief to the english official and business community presently his friends told him that they were going out as monks to walk through bengal villages for a month and they proposed that as some leave was due to him he should put on the red robe red for buddhist priests in india and get a begging bowl and come with them it had been as simple as that he had come back from that walk settled up his western affairs and had put on the buddhist robe again for good he had walked on foot across india and down into ceylon eating only what the pious put into his bowl as he walked through the village silent every morning i asked what happened if they didnt put anything in and he said that that had never happened there was always more than he could eat each day he would walk on to the next village and sit talking with the elders under the village tree giving what advice to them in local problems that he could helping spiritually where he was able one by one they would slip away to bed till he was left alone beneath the tree in the night he was too holy a man to share their houses when all were gone he said he would hunt about for somewhere to sleep himself if there was a temple he would wrap his robe around him and curl up and go to sleep in a corner of that but you had to be careful of the snakes which sought the warmth of a body on the cold stone floor if there was no temple he would go out into the country and find a haystack or else go to sleep in the lee of a hedge he had never come to any harm in many years of this life though he had had fever often enough he had walked across india and down into ceylon and all over ceylon and back up india and into burma in the course of ten or twelve years he had come to rest there on the outskirts of rangoon and had found this place where the people had built the ashram or small monastery for him when it needed repair or rebuilding the villagers would make a day of it in a gang and rebuild it for him he had three or four small boys that he called his disciples they came to him each morning and together they all walked out through the district for an hour or so with begging bowls held before them eyes cast down never looking to the left or the right never speaking the people brought out food and filled their bowls they would return and eat and for the rest of the day he would instruct the boys in reading and writing the buddhist scriptures in the pali script at evening the boys went back to their homes i asked if he had ever been back to england and he said once in but he found the world set upon the wrong course and was glad to return to his quiet ashram on the outskirts of rangoon i asked him what he wore in england and he said well thats a damnfool question do you think i walk down piccadilly looking like this one could ask him anything a monk he told me in explanation of his poverty may possess only a few articlesthe robe the bowl the drinking cup the spectacles if he needs them the sunshade the needle the fan with which he shields his eyes from the sight of women as he was a friendly and a candid old man i asked about his mosquito net and his deckchair to which he replied that they were weaknesses of the flesh that he could not do without which meant that he was not a very good man there seemed to be no answer to that one presently as we sat talking easily about these things he turned the conversation to shak lin u myin has told me that you have a man working for you a remarkable man he said he told me that you wanted to know about him i replied hes my chief engineer his name is shak lin and he is remarkable i hesitated probably not to you in england people would say that he was mad i say that hes a fine engineer who makes men reliable by bringing religion to their daily work you can take it any way you like he nodded and sat in thought for a minute stooping to scratch a brown and rather dirty leg with a lean skinny hand his legs and feet were covered in old scars i had heard of that he said u myin has given me some information but several people have been talking to me about him have they indeed they have he made a great impression on the monks in bangkok an arab merchant from aden came here to rangoon a month or two ago and told one of my religious friends about the teaching that was going on in bahrein a parsee from karachi told us the same story and then came u myin who had actually been taught by this man and who was teaching others at the airport out at mingadon as one of his disciples and now you come who know more than anyone perhaps well i said what can i tell you father im not a very religious man myself but ill tell you anything i can he said do you know where he was born it was a question that i was not prepared for no i dont i said i think it was in penang but i cant say for certain his father was chinese and a british subject i think shak lin himself is certainly british his mother was a russian he looked up quickly a russian from what part of russia a vague memory of the idle chatter of boys in cobhams air circus stirred my mind i seem to remember that she came from irkutsk he got up from the stool and went to the table with the books on it he had a tattered school atlas there a little cheap thing such as children use in a council school he stood there fingering it with fingers that trembled a little a bowed old man with bare legs and feet in this coarse blanketlike yellow robe thrown over one shoulder leaving the other skinny shoulder bare he stood staring at the map of asia for a time and then closed the book and put it down he came back to me and sat down on the stool again do you know the date of his birth and the hour he asked i shook my head im afraid not father i dont even know how old he is ive always supposed he was about the same age as myself i think he is within a year or so how old are you he asked im thirtythree so you were born in the year thats right i said he sat in silence for a long time after that i shot a glance or two at him after a time his head was shaking in the way that very old people do it seemed to me that he was getting very tired i had been with him for something like an hour and a half i glanced at u myin and in his return look it seemed that he agreed with me it was time we went away i broke the silence presently after at least ten minutes father i said i think its time we went home now and left you to rest ill come again one day if i may and ill send the nautical almanac as soon as i can get one out from england stay for a minute he said i have things to tell you he sat in silence again and i waited at last he said i know that you are not a religious man i will put what i have to tell you in words as simple as i can make them men are weak and sinful and foolish creatures when they are given something that is beautiful and good they can recognise it and they venerate it but gradually they spoil it infinite wisdom infinite purity and infinite holiness cannot be passed from hand to hand by mortal men down through the ages without being spoiled errors and absurdities creep in and mar the perfect vision all the religions of the world have become debased according to the present code of this religion i may not take life yet i may eat meat if somebody else kills it and puts the cooked meat in my bowl you christians have similar absurdities you have a curious ceremony in which you eat your god the moslems fast which is a stupid thing to do and they give far too much thought to the outward forms of prayer and pilgrimage he paused every religion in the world requires to be refreshed from time to time by a new teacher gautama mahomet jesusthese are some of the great teachers of the past who have refreshed mens minds and by their lives and their example brought men back to truth we are very far from the truth now far enough here even farther in the west belsen and buchenwald exceeded any horrors of the war here in the east but we are all in this together wandering far far from the truth he raised his head this thing is beyond the power of ordinary men to put right he said we must look for the new teacher one day the power that rules the universe will send us a new teacher who will lead us back to truth and help us to regain the way there have been four buddhas in the history of this world of whom gautama was the last one day a fifth will come to aid us if we will attend to him here in burma we earnestly await his coming for he is the hope of the world i sat silent while he rambled on he was putting into words things that i had resolutely kept in the background of my mind in little cups that i hoped might pass from me we know a little of the teacher from our sacred learning based upon the movements of the celestial universe he said we know that he is very near to us in time we think he is already born we think that his birthplace is somewhere in that corner of the continent of asia where tibet and russia and china meet we think that he will be of a mixed eastern and western stock we think that this man is the saviour of the world i moistened my lips do you know where he is going to teach father that has not been revealed he said the only certain fact we know is that his ministry will last for four years and twentythree days he was silent again and when i looked at him he was sitting with his eyes closed perhaps in some kind of a trance perhaps asleep i glanced at u myin and got his agreement we got up to go the old man never stirred i waited for a minute but there seemed to be no point in staying any longer or disturbing him and after a time we climbed down the ladder and went back to the car oh threats of hell and hopes of paradise one thing alone is certain that life flies one thing is certain and the rest is lies the flower that once has blown for ever dies edward fitzgerald rubaiyat of ornar khayyam i got back to bahrein about four days after that after taking my load up to yenanyaung i landed back at our base with eighteen passengers from the burma oil field late one evening i went into the office before going to the chummery and found as i had suspected that we had had to turn away or to postpone a number of important transport jobs for the various oil companies due to the fact that the carrier had been absent from the district for nine days clearly i couldnt go on doing business in that way i had a talk about it to connie and gujar singh in my office next day ours was a personal business and all the decisions and responsibilities were mine but i had got into the way of talking things over informally with my chief pilot and my chief engineer whenever difficult decisions had to be made i had them in now and told them how we were we cant go on like this i said weve brought this business into being by offering air transport to the oil companies and now theyre offering more business than we can cope with im going to try and get another big aeroplane and i think itll have to be a plymouth tramp wed never get the dollars for another carrier even if wed got the sterling which we havent we talked about the tramp for a time they both liked the idea indeed gujar singh said roundly that hed rather have a tramp for our business than another carrier connie was in favour of a tramp but concerned at the diversity of spares that we would have to carry for another aircraft of another type there was a great deal in what he said already we were operating five aircraft of four different types and if we got a tramp we should have six aircraft of five types ill see if i can sell that fox and get another proctor i said that makes it a bit better a tramp it would have to be and i told them then about my money difficulty theres nothing wrong with the business i said but all the profits are taken for the time being by the instalments that im paying on the carrier all of our profits going into that till may next year the most that i can raise in cash at present is about five thousand pounds and thats less than ten per cent of the cost of a tramp i dont believe the plymouth people would let us have a tramp for that gujar never forgot his banking experience and he was quite useful at times like this you have sufficient assets for a considerable loan he said i do not think the bank here would advance much because aviation enterprises are not quite their business but they would certify whatever was required to an industrial bank in london you have a very good name in bahrein we talked about that for a time it meant a trip to england but that was necessary in any case for the negotiations about the plymouth tramp i did not then know what amount of capital i needed what gujar said was probably quite right but the idea of going trailing round from office to office in the city of london trying to find somebody to lend me fifty thousand pounds or so at some crippling interest rate was not one that i relished from the point of view of the business it was wrong utterly wrong from start to finish inevitably it meant a big mortgage or debenture held by some stranger gentile or jew whose interests would be purely financial and possibly divergent from my own who would have to be consulted whenever i took a chance who would have to be argued with when things went wrong not a happy outlook and it worried me a lot i didnt see what else i could do however i pointed out these disadvantages to them if i boob on this one itll mean the finish of the business i said im not taking any bouquets for what weve done up to date weve done it all together but theres one basic factor thats been at the bottom of our success and that is that the man who controls the money has been working out here on the jobthats me if the money control had been by an accountant in a london office wed have been bust long before this and thats just what may happen to us if we dont look out they saw that point and we broke up the meeting with nothing decided on the financial point i hung about at bahrein for a week although i should have been in london looking for money i could not bring myself to start on what i knew to be a wrong road and i stuck around at bahrein flying the carrier on local day flights trying to think of some better finance moody and badtempered i had got myself into a jam and i couldnt see how to get out of it i came in from ras mushaab one evening in the carrier with a threeton truck on board with a broken differential for repair as i passed the hangar on the circuit before landing i saw a big maroon car outside my office that looked like the hudson that sheikh abd el kadir kept in bahrein and i wondered if the old man had taken to coming up to the hangar again to say his prayers i landed and taxied in and stopped the motors and connie came forward from the hangar and met me as i got out of the cabin door wazir husseins waiting at the office to see you he said hussein what does he want he hesitated i went over to baraka on friday he said i go there sometimes to pray with sheikh abd el kadir and to talk to his imam i told them you were thinking of getting another big aircraft i stared at him did you tell them that i hadnt got any money to pay for it he nodded i think that hussein may have come with a proposal for christs sake i said he smiled i dont see whats wrong with that its local money and thats better than london money that was true enough if it came to a choice between having an arab sheik in the business or a london accountant who had never been out of england id choose the sheikh theres just one thing connie said watch what you say about interest if they should offer a loan they never take interest you know theyre very strong against usury it would be very easy to offend them by asking what rate of interest they want i left him to organise the unloading of the truck from the carrier and walked across to where hussein was standing by his car outside my office a grave bearded figure in the arab dresswhite headcloth bound with two black cords and a long white underrobe with a wide skirt and a long coat of a light black linen goldembroidered open down the front he wore a plain leather belt with a goldhilted curved dagger stuck into it with a richly chased sheath he bowed as i came up and i said im so sorry to have kept you waiting wazir shak lin says that you are waiting to see me he smiled and said i know how hard you work he spoke very good english somebody once told me that as a young man he had been at cambridge we went into the office and sat down together and i sent the boy to get coffee from the airport bar till it came we talked of general things the weather the state of the date crop the irrigation schemes that the sheikh had in hand around baraka the yield from the pearl fishing and how the packard was behaving then the coffee came and we sipped it together when the boy had left the room the wazir said my master the sheikh of khulal was told by shak lin el amin that you are thinking of buying another large aeroplane i nodded that is true and i went on to tell him why i had decided that i had to have it that there was more work than we could handle and that if we didnt do it somebody else would two companies both operating in the same area might split the work so badly that both would be ruined whereas if we kept it in our hands the business should go steadily ahead all the profit that we make goes back into the business i said i take nothing for myself beyond my living expenses he nodded gravely my master has been told that you are having to resort to usurers to find the money for this aeroplane he said i have explained to him that this is common in england and that no sin is involved on either side but he has been very much distressed i said its very nice of him to think of us like that you know the processes of business in the west mr hussein ive got no feeling about paying interest provided that its reasonable what worries me is that if im not careful this business may become controlled by those who lend me money and i think that would be a disaster he smiled a little and said all contact with sin is a disaster there was a little silence then and presently he said i do not want to be impertinent mr cutter my master has sent me to enquire if you need money for this aeroplane as a loan it seems very undesirable to him that you should fall into the hands of usurers there was another silence while i thought about this magnificent proposal first of all i said will you tell the sheikh of khulal how very deeply touched i am by his consideration its true that im in a difficulty but ive been in difficulties before and got over them i paused im not sure if you realise the scale of the money that is involved the price of this aeroplane is fiftyfive thousand pounds his face did not change but then he was an arab spare parts and equipment will be needed for it which will cost about another five thousandsay sixtyfive thousand pounds in all thats about eight lakhs of rupees all i have in the blank at present is about five thousand with such an aeroplane i can earn sufficient profit to pay off its cost in three or four years so that in four years from now i should hope to be free from debt but if some bad luck should come to the business that we cannot foresee i could never hope to pay back such a loan from what i can earn upon a salary no man could do that if your master should lend money to me in this way and bad luck comes another war or something terrible that we cannot foresee i may never be able to pay him back he inclined his head i understand that point i will explain that to my master i said this is a personal business wazir i am not a company and no person but myself has any share in it the aeroplanes are all my personal property i thought for a minute i will get the accountant to make up an account of my assets to the end of last month and i will show that to you i think the book figure will be able to show that the aeroplanes and goods that i own are worth about fifteen thousand pounds to which should be added the bank credit and the balance of the money that i am owed in trade and the money that i owe i think the total figure of my assets will be twentyone or twentytwo thousand pounds which would be available towards repayment of this loan if things should go very wrong it means that if disaster came there would be a balance of thirtyfive thousand pounds or so which your master would almost certainly lose but as i say i will have the accountant make a statement of my assets and give you a copy he inclined his head it is my duty to guard the interests of my master and i shall be glad to see it i have never known him to be harsh with a debtor who was unable to pay his debt through no fault of his own i sat in thought for a time theres one point id better mention i said it may be that in the next year or two i shall have to form the business into a number of small companies one in india one in pakistan one in siam one in burma and so on that may be necessary in the future because each country reasonably demands that profits which are earned in that country shall be retained in that country and spent in the country i do not think that this affects the matter because i shall be the only shareholder but complications of that nature may arise as the business grows he nodded it is an interesting point but so long as all the property is owned by you i do not think my master would complain if some of it was in siam and could not be transferred repayment of the loan should be made here in bahrein if possible of course i said we went on to discuss the details they were apparently quite prepared to lend me sixty thousand pounds without interest to be repaid over a period of four years at the rate of ј a month i told him that i would fly over to baraka with the statement of my assets on the following tuesday and he said that he would have a document ready for my signature acknowledging the loan in arabic and in english side by side then he got up to go and i showed him to his car he said may god protect you and got in and drove away i walked over to the hangar in a daze connie had gone home probably to avoid me but gujar singh had just come in in one of the airtrucks and i told him all about it as we walked up and down on the tarmac in the evening light he was delighted with the news of course and he made two comments on it that were both shrewd and illuminating the first thing he said was this puts us on very firm ground with the arabiasumatran company i blinked in surprise how does that come into it he smiled their refinery at habban its all his oil the refinery is on his land and they pay him the royalty if they started giving air transport contracts to anybody else the old sheikh might lose sixty thousand pounds they wouldnt want any trouble with the sheikh it was a point of course a sort of discouragement to competition the second thing he said was of course its a religious matter i walked with him in silence for a minute then i said shak lin yes you say he suggested it to them i shook my head the mere idea that connie would have used his religious influence with the old sheikh to induce him to lend me money was utterly repugnant thats absolutely wrong i said shak lin could never have done that as i spoke i wondered why i felt so positively about it it was inconceivable i dont say that gujar said slowly i think like you he is too good a man but this is a religious matter all the same i was silent it is too near a gift for it to be otherwise he said you have told them and they must have known before that if things should go wrong you cannot pay this back when sheikh abd el kadir dies he cannot leave a legacy to you or to me by moslem maw he can only leave his money to his family or he can leave a legacy for a religious purposeto build a new mosque or something like that they are very strict about such things legacies are governed by hadith based upon the koran he cannot even dispose of his money as he likes within the family his children by his concubines share the inheritance equally with his legitimate family boys two shares and girls one share when this old man is dead he could not possibly leave money to you and as he is so near death now it would be most improper for him to make you a large gift or even an unrepayable loan i wrinkled my brows why is he doing it then he said i think he must have consulted with the imam and the majlis and made this loan for a religious purpose we were getting into deep waters to buy me another aeroplane no if i may say so i do not think he cares if you an englishman and a christian possess another aeroplane or not but usury in the business that employs shak lin that is another matter to him this hangar is a very holy place and you and i and everyone who works here down to tarik and the babu clerk we are all touched with holiness if usury threatens us it is a pious and a godly act on his part to step in and stop it that the shrine may remain undefined he could devote his money to that purpose we walked on in silence do you really think that thats the reason behind it i asked at last i do i think he has consulted with the imam and the majlis before doing this i see i suppose he saw that i was worried because after a time he said there is no harm in it and no reason why you should not take his loan i know it is unusual in the west for men to give large sums for a religious purpose perhaps it is more common in my country than in yours perhaps it is i said it all wants a bit of thinking about i left him soon after that but i thought about it till the small hours of the morning in the hot brilliant night i had told gujar singh the whole story except two words which i had kept to myself wazir hussein had referred to connie as el amin el amin is arabic and it means he who is worthy of trust not a bad name for a chief ground engineer of course except for the fact that it was one of the names of the prophet i got the accountant on the job next day and the figures came out just as i had expected i thought them over for a bit in a negotiated sale the business was probably worth more than the book value of the assets but if some disaster were to force a sale the aircraft might not realise the book value in the accounts i was writing everything off over five years i added a note about this to the accounts suggesting an additional depreciation of twentyfive per cent on the aircraft in the case of a forced sale and then i got into the proctor and went over to baraka i circled the palace and the wazirs house before landing and saw a car leave for the airstrip then i landed and parked the aircraft as the car drove up i got out and drove to the wazirs house hussein came out to meet me at the door it was a twostoreyed house built around a court one side of this court was a blank windowless wall behind which lay the harem hussein and his son and a secretary with him he greeted me with a grave courtesy and took me up to a room with a balcony on the first floor there was practically no furniture in this room except two wooden long chairs a table and a very beautiful carpet on the floor we sat down and he clapped his hands and an arab servant came with coffee it was delightfully cool in that top room with a sea breeze blowing through it we talked of casual things for a timethe weather for flying the design of the house the condition of the airstrip and presently i produced my accounts and explained them to him i dont want to conceal anything from you i said this is the true position of the business as i understand it at the moment i paused please ask anything which may occur to you i will tell you anything i can he asked a little bit about my forward contracts and about my relations with the arabiasumatran company and i told him about the longrange work which was developing lor them which had made this new large aircraft necessary then he laid the accounts down and smiled i do not think that there is anything further he said smiling my master knows of you as an honest man the money is at your disposal when you need it sixty thousand pounds have you a bank in bahrein ive got an account with the bank of asia i said if you would pay it into my account there i should be most grateful in that case i shall transfer most of it to a london bank at once and fly to england to place the order i paused i can only tell you what i think you know already that your help is making things very easy for me he said that is my masters wish he told me that the sheikh was anxious to meet me and presently we went downstairs and walked a hundred yards or so down the lane to the palace this was a white house standing in a garden of flower beds and date palms just outside the town it was not very large as palaces go it was arranged in two storeys around a courtyard and might have had about ten or twelve large rooms in all it was in a sort of moorish style with fretted wooden sunshutters at the windows there was rather a beautiful little mosque immediately adjacent to it in the garden i had been entertained by sheikhs a good many times since i had come to the persian gulf and there was very little to distinguish this lunch party from many of the others the old man met us at the door he spoke no english and i had to do the best i could in arabic from time to time the wazir helped me by translating when i got stuck he had a crowd of about fifteen of his ministers and hangerson with him and we sat around on hard chairs in a circle in an anteroom and made polite conversation until lunch was ready then we went through into the diningroom or whatever they call it where the meal was prepared upon a tablecloth in the middle of the carpet on the floora huge pile of rice on an enormous dish with the best part of a sheep boiled and lying on top of it all very greasy i knew about this of course and had prepared for it by eating nothing that day and very little that evening before one goes into training for an arab feast we sat down on the floor myself next to the sheikh and washed our hands in the bowls that the negro servants brought round then the old man tore a bit of mutton off the carcase in the middle with his hands and put it on my plate and a servant began to hand a multitude of side dishes to me curries and mushrooms and truffles and dates in sweet syrup and lord knows what im always very bad at eating writh my fingers and i always seem to make more mess upon the carpet than the arabs do but i must say theres a fascination in that sort of a meal some of it was perfectly delicious finally the old man got up and the servants washed our hands for us and we went back into the anteroom for coffee flavoured with cloves it was only then that the sheikh raised the subject that had brought me there he said the wazir tells me that your business has been satisfactorily concluded there only remains for me to express my very deep gratitude for so much help i replied i say this not only for myself but for the pilots and the engineers who work with me it is good that men who bring others to the way of god should not be perplexed for money the old man said and i though gujar singh was right thats what is behind it all presently i took my leave of the sheikh and went back with wazir hussein to his house the sheikhs eldest son came with us a young man called fahad and at the wazirs house we had another cup of coffee and he produced the loan agreement this was a document written on parchment in arabic and in english in vertical columns with the two languages side by side it only had three clauses and was very simple and straightforward fahad who spoke good english explained it to me with the wazir and i signed it there and then and they gave me a cheque for sixty thousand pounds i flew back to bahrein in the proctor wondering when i was going to wake up next day i spent an hour telephoning round to all my clients in the oil companies to tell them that i was leaving for england to bring out another large aircraft i sent a cable to the plymouth aircraft company ordering a tramp and laving i would visit them during the following week to finalise the specification and to pay a deposit and i sent a cable to dad to say that i was coming home there was a dakota of orient airways going through to almaza that day and i got a ride in that and from egypt i flew home by boac which had a spare seat in a constellation of the australian service it was more than a year since i had been in england and it was good to be back it was may and as i travelled down by rail to southampton i thought that i had never seen a country look so green and beautiful i had forgotten that england was lovely i sat with my nose glued to the window in the train just looking at the varied greens of the fields and trees and hedges at the delicate colours of the flowering trees it was wonderful i went by bus from the station to the gas works and carried my bag from there it was evening and the tall steelwork of the gasholders and the cranked cranes of the docks were all touched with a golden light i walked down the familiar streets through the games of the playing children in a dream this was my own place and i was home again the places i had worked in were all very wonderful and strange but this was my town where i belonged i turned into the door of our house and went into the livingroom ma was in as i had known she would be and dad wasnt he was down at the lion playing darts ma came out of the scullery when she heard the door and she said tom and then she said oh tom youre thinner whatever have you been doing with yourself as i kissed her i said am i mum she said of course you are i have you been ill or something i smiled not a day im as fit as a flea really tom honest mum ive not been ill at all she felt my shoulders well i dunno you dont look ill i must say but you must be a stone lighter she stood back and lopked at me youre looking older too have you been working overtime or night shift ive been working i said i expect thats it well now youve got to stay at home a bit and get rested up she said how long are you home for now tom i dont know i said ive come home for another aeroplane but it may be a month or so before its ready in the correspondence they had said four weeks delivery well then she said youll be able to lie in tomorrow and have a real rest ive got to catch the seventhirtythree for plymouth tomorrow morning mum i said ill have to have breakfast before dad oh tom you ought to get some rest youre looking quite worn out im all right i said she told me i was sleeping in the same old room and i took my bag through and unpacked it none of us children were at home with the old people ted had been the last but hed gone now hed married his lily as soon as he got out of the army and hed got a job driving a truck for a builder at wootton they had been living with dad and mum up till a week or so before but now theyd got a council house because she was expecting all the kids were out in the world and all married and settled except me while i was in the back room ma sent young alfie lamb from next door down to the lion to tell dad i was home and dad came back ten minutes later ma got supper for us and we sat and talked till after eleven i told them everything i could about the business all except the religious part i left that out because i didnt properly understand it myself i didnt tell them about the loan id got from sheikh abd el kadir either and they didnt know enough about business to be curious about where all the money was coming from they thought i made it and i didnt undeceive them once dad said how much money have you got now tom bloody little i said grinning ive got about five thousand pounds in the bank ma said thats a lot of money dad said hes got more than that ma hes having us on just look at him she said tom how much have yon really got thats all i said ive got some aeroplanes of course how much are they worth id only be guessing if i told yon mum i said seriously they stand me in at about fifteen thousand pounds in the books if i went bust and got sold up they probably wouldnt fetch that much if i sold the business as a going concern with goodwill they probably fetch a bit more dad said slowly so youve made twenty thousand pounds then have you i suppose so i said slowly it doesnt feel as if i had i mean it just sort of happened how much would twenty thousand pounds bring in if it was invested tom say in a row of houses like it might be these oh i dont know dad something like seven hundred a year i should think seven hundred a year you could sell the business and retire and do nothing for the rest of your life and still have dose on twice as much as me each week to live on youve not done bad for yourself son ma said quietly why dont you do that tom and stay at home and get a job in england you could buy a business with that money and a good one too she meant a shop of course i said its not so easy to get out as that mum theres a lot of other things to be considered i mean when you start a thing theres other people get mixed up in it and you cant let them down you cant pick things up and put them down just as you fancy youve got to see things through thats right said dad youve got to think about the other people in the business but what your ma says is right tom theres no call for you to spend your whole life in the persian gulf ma started to put the plates together you want to look about a bit now that youre home she said you want to find yourself a girl and settle down thats what you want were none of us getting any younger i laughed okay ma i said with mock obedience where shall i start looking she called from the scullery theres two or three nice girls right in this street would do you very well you dont have to look far if they knew that youd got twenty thousand pounds we wouldnt be able to get in or out of the door well dont you go telling em i said i was up early next morning and took a few things in my bag and caught the seventhirtythree for plymouth it was a plow journey and i didnt get there till after dinner there was the hell of a fine car with a chauffeur waiting there to meet me and i was whisked out to the works just as if i was somebody important instead of being tom cutter from the sergeants mess out in bahrein its an enormous company of course employing over twenty thousand hands in all the various divisions of the business like most big concerns they were quite brutal about the money within the first five minutes i had to write a cheque for ten thousand pounds before theyd even talk to me but when theyd got that in their hands they took me seriously and were they good i whenever any of them quoted a performance or gave a price or a date you kind of knew that that was dead right and no bolony whats more they put me through the hoop about my business to find out what kind of loads i carried or was likely to carry they werent going to have their aeroplane give any trouble because i was using it wrong when they heard i carried bulldozers they pulled out a reinforced floor scheme when they heard i aimed to carry pilgrims they pulled out a seating scheme of long hard dural benches very light and easily washed down when they heard i flew normally with a crew of two they pulled out a revised crew accommodation that did away with the radio operators position and added a hundred and ten pounds to the payload it was an education dealing with those people they had machines on the production line coming through and they gave me twentysix days delivery from noon the next day it was getting towards evening by that time and they pushed me their way like as if i was a little boy theyd got accommodation for me in their own hotel just by the works and they gave me a mass of drawings to study that night they arranged a demonstration flight for ten oclock next morning for me and they made it very dear that they expected me to confirm the order then with another twenty thousand pounds after that i was to go away and not bother them any morethey told me the time of my trainfor twentyfive and a half more days i could come back then with another twentyfive thousand pounds and fly my aeroplane away exactly at noon unless i care to stay for lunch the only thing they didnt make exactly and precisely clear was if i had to pay for lunch id never have got anywhere with those people if i hadnt been able to pay cash down their business was quite simply to make the best aircraft in the worldnot to lend money i didnt have to go back to southampton by train as it happened there was a proctor there owned by my old company airservice ltd that had come over for some spares i knew the pilot slightly and he knew me he had been out in cairo for a bit and i had met him once or twice when i had taken a load there in the carrier he was interested to see me with the sales people and he said that mr norman evans my old chief would be very glad to hear i was in england and would be sure to want to meet me i said id be free for the next three weeks and gave him my address he wanted the telephone number but of course he was unlucky however he was genuinely pleased to see me and we got along so well i touched him for a lift to eastleigh it was a bit out of his way but he said the firm would be glad to do that for me so i was home with dad and mum that evening in time for tea instead of about midnight as i thought i would be mum wasnt expecting me so early when i went into the house there was a girl there in the kitchen with her doris waters the schoolteacher that id met when i was home before daughter of old waters the plumber theyd got teds school atlas spread out on the table and theyd marked in ink with lines to all the places i had been to and a lot of picture postcards that id sent home and some photographs id brought back with me mum had been having a grand time telling this girl all about me ma said as i went in hullo tom thought you werent coming home till late i got a lift back to eastleigh i said evening doris she smiled and said good evening tom your mothers been telling me about your travels havent you been a long way you dont have to believe everything ma says i said a bit awkwardly doris had filled out since i was home last got more mature she must have been twentyfour years old or so it was years since id spoken to a young woman like her she was quiet and graceful and pretty i could hardly take my eyes off her hes a bad wicked boy said ma you can believe that anyway doesnt write home enough and when he does he doesnt tell us anything we have to wait till he comes home to hear whats hes been up to and thats only when he wants another aeroplane when hes got all the aeroplanes he wants we shant see or hear from him at all the girl said oh mrs cutter how terrible he must be a great disappointment to you she was grinning dont you ever get married doris said my mother youll find children more trouble than theyre worth one thing i said is that theyre always wanting their tea i dont know theres anything for you said ma i didnt think youd be home so i only got three kippers one for your pa one for doris and one for me i dunno what youre going to eat tom unless you slip down to alberts and see if hes got another one there was plenty in the box this morning doris said ill go mrs cutter no i said ill go well dont start fighting over it said ma so she stayed to dear the table and put the kettle on and doris and i walked down to the fishmongers together i knew of course that ma hadnt engineered this meeting although she was quite capable of it doris was in the habit of dropping in to see mother once or twice a week i knew that from mas letters i was glad of that because with us kids all out in the world and mostly living in other places it must have been a bit lonely for ma with dad away all day especially now that ted and lily had moved out and set up their own home i tried to tell doris something about that as we walked down the street nice of you to keep coming in so often to see ma i said she looks forward to you coming i like it she replied your father and mother are such genuine people and theyre so proud of what their children are all doing specially you i walked on for a moment in silence wish i wasnt so far off i said at last theyre neither of them getting any younger i know she hesitated your mother was really worried last winter when your father got that pneumonia i stared at her when did dad have pneumonia last january didnt you know not a word are you sure of course it was just after christmas tom he was off work all january she had reason to know because the crisis had come in the school holidays and i found out later that she had been in the house with mother every day and sitting up several nights i was worried ma told me that hed had a cold and been off work a bit i said i didnt think much of it she nodded she didnt want to worry you i mean out there you couldnt do anything to help course i could i said the show can get on without me for a bit almost any time i could have been home in thirtysix hours if there was any trouble with dad or mum like that she said flying home itld cost an awful lot your father wasnt as bad as that not much sense in flying home just for the funeral i said a bit shortly what happened did he go to hospital they hadnt got a bed she said it was all right at home mum and dad like our house and theyd never move away from it but its not much of a place to nurse a serious illness in with no running water upstairs and the only toilet out in the back yard and shared with the house next door did they try and get him into a nursing home i said i dont think so she said it comes a bit expensive you know i said for christs sake i was worth twenty thousand pounds all made in about three years it wasnt real money of course to dad and mum it wasnt very real to me i wish id known i said id have been home inside two days and got all that fixed up theres plenty of money for a nursing home or anything they need im very glad to know that she aaid seriously ill remember it we walked along in silence for a bit i was worried thinking what a bad son i had been if that happens again tom she said seriously would you like me to send you a cable i turned to her i wish you would but if you do that send it good and early so that i can get home in good time and do something ive got all the money in the world to help them if theyre sick dont wait to send a cable till theyre dying she hesitated it might mean bringing you home on a wild goose chase she said you wouldnt thank me then i would id rather have it that way i dont get home to see them enough anyway if you cable me like that i wouldnt hold it against you if dad was back at work again when i got home or mum out at the pictures do you really feel like that about it tom of course i do i ought to be home every six months but im not i could be but one gets stuck into things you get so that you cant bear to take a holiday but for a thing like this id come home any time will you let me have that cable ill do that she said full rate i said none of this deferred or night letter nonsense she laughed all right we came to the shop and i went in and got my kipper and they wrapped it up in a bit of newspaper for me and we turned to stroll home how long are you back for this time tom she asked three weeks i said i told her about the delivery of the tramp its not worth going back to the persian gulf and doming out again thatll be nice for your mother she said she loves having you at home we walked on in silence will you fly the new aeroplane out to bahrein alone i shook my head i think ill get my chief pilot back here two or three days before well fly it out together gujar singh i turned to her in surprise yes you know about him she smiled i think i know all about you that your mother knows tom you mustnt mind that she loves to talk i dont mind i said i didnt either hes a sikh do you know what a sikh looks like she nodded ive got a book at the school with a picture of a group of sikhs i brought it home and showed your father and mother they look terribly fierce your mother was quite frightened gujars not fierce i said he comes to work each day on a ladys old rusty bicycle ill introduce you to him when he comes if you like but hes married so dont get any ideas into your head got three children too she laughed and then she said something about east being east and west being west and the twain never meeting poetry i think it was that sounds like bolony to me i said if you fly east and keep on going past rangoon and bangkok and manila and wake island and hawaii youll find youre back in the west again although you still going east thats only geographical she said what kipling meant was that the peoples of the east are so different to us well never understand them thats bolony too i remarked youre very fond of them arent you i get on all right with most people i said asiatics are just the same as anybody else ive not found them any more different to us than spaniards say or czechs she was quite unconvinced anyway i wouldnt want to marry gujar singh she said a little stiffly i think mixed marriages are horrible so does gujar singh i replied that put the lid on it and we walked the last hundred yards in silence dad was home and ma cooked the kippers and i told dad a little bit about my trip and how norman evans wanted to see me and id probably go up to london one day for that then we all had tea and after tea doris waters got up to go i went with her to the door sorry if i was rude about gujar i said hes a friend of mine i paused like to come to the pictures tomorrow night she hesitated wondering i suppose if i was quite hygienic id love to she said at last i dont know whats on its all one to me i said i havent seen a picture for two years i fixed up to call for her at her dads house next evening after school and take her out she knew a cafй where we could get fish and chips for tea then she went away and i went back into the house im taking doris to the pictures tomorrow i told ma i wont be in for tea well you might think of a worse way of spending an evening than that said ma doris is a nice girl tom from all i hear shes earned an evening out i said whats this i hear about pneumonia i spent the next day wiring up the house for power they had electric light and a little cooker in the scullery for using when the range wasnt lit but it had never entered their heads to have any heat upstairs in the bedrooms when dad had been ill they had bought an oil stove and had it upstairs in his room which wasnt so good in a tiny room when you couldnt open a window i got a lot of rubbercoated flex and fittings and a couple of electric stoves and set to work to wire up all three bedrooms and the livingroom with power points doris and i had a grand time that night i dont know what it was but everything seemed to go right the picture wasnt a particularly good one and ive known better fish and chips but we enjoyed ourselves she wasnt so snooty about the east as she had been the night before she asked a lot about it as if she really wanted to know in turn she told me about her school she had never been out of england but she had worked for a time in leicester during the war when the schools were evacuated from southampton as we were walking home from the pictures that evening she asked what are you going to do tom are you going to stay but in the persian gulf for ever it was may and england was a very lovely place it was a question that i had been asking myself perhaps subconsciously its where my business is i said you cant run away from that is it nice out there its all right i said its not the part of the east id choose to live in if i had my pick but theres not much to complain of really will you ever come back to live and work in england i walked on for a time in silence im king of the castle out there i said running my own show id never get to that position here in england not in aviation does it have to be in aviation i could run a garage i said thats about the nearest thing to what i know a garage or a haulage contractors business or something like that id be no good at anything else she nodded i should think youd run a garage awfully well would you like that or would it be dull after the east she had put her finger on the point itld be dull i said butwell theres other things to think of too id like to be in england now that dad and mum are getting on i think one could settle down all right with a big garage in a little country town some place like romsey or lyndhurst or poole id like that all right it would be nice for your father and mother if you ever did that she said quietly of all the children youre the one they think the most of you know tom maybe i said it was a fact that none of the others seemed to do much for the old folks ted could have put those power points in for them but he hadnt thought of it we walked on for a time in silence dont you ever get depressed out there she asked presently i mean away from your own sort with only black people to talk to they arent black i said patiently she meant her question kindly enough theyre brown and when youve lived with them a bit you dont see them as brown people any more you see them as just people she laughed you are touchy about them tom but dont you ever get depressed it wasnt a riot of fun when i left england i replied i was depressed when i went out there you mean about beryl thats right i said that all happened a long time ago she said quietly i dont know the rights or wrongs of that i dont suppose anybody knows that except you but i know this much that theres nothing in that old story to make you spend your life out in the persian gulf away from everyone you know and then she said a very queer thing very shrewd i know why you went you went to find a sort of hermitage i stared at her well i dunno i had gone there in a tenthhand foxmoth because i was out of a job and wanted to make some money or had i and then i said perhaps i did i know but its time you came back into circulation tom if you stay there alone much longer youll go round the bend i smiled and she thought i was laughing at her she flushed a little i suppese you think thats silly but people do go funny when they live isolated from their own sort out in the tropics i dont think thats silly i said what you say is right ive got a chap working for me now that everybody says is going round the bend i thought you hadnt got any white staff i havent hes an asiatic i meant english people i know you did but a chinese can be further from his home when he works in the persian gulf than any englishman and lonelier is this a chinese that youre speaking of whos going round the bend half chinese and half russian i said born in penang and so a british subject just like you and me whats wrong with him she asked what does he do he believes in god i said a little wearily he teaches engineers who work with him to turn to god in everything they do upon the aeroplanes and he gets people to believe that thats the sensible way to set about the job of aircraft maintenance hes obviously going round the bend everybody says so and with that my old worries and responsibilities dosed down on me a month was too long for me to be away from bahrein anything might be happening in my absence but surely thats not wrong she asked i dont know if its right or wrong i said i only know its liable to make a packet of trouble any time we were just at her house and there wasnt time to tell her any more and i didnt want to anyway it would have been useless to try and make her understand all that was going on out in bahrein and further east i turned to heir ive enjoyed this evening i said like to do it again one day she smiled of course i would im free most evenings tom tuesday i bring home the essays to correct but most of the rest are free im expecting to have to go to london i remarked there may be a letter tomorrow ill probably be there for a night or two ill drop around one evening when i get back she nodded fine i may be round with your mother i have enjoyed this tom it was nice of you to ask me i turned away okay i said well do it again as i had thought there was a letter from mr norman evans next morning he said that he had heard a lot about my success out in the persian gulf and he wanted to congratulate me he went on to say that as they were operating both in egypt and in india we ought to get together as wed have a lot in common to talk over would i like to lunch with him at the royal aero club one day he was free any day that week perhaps i would give him a ring and suggest a day i rang him from the call box at the end of our street and went up to london a couple of days later with my bag packed for a night or two i went to the same economical hotel in bloomsbury and left my bag and took a briefcase with a few papers in it and went out to lunch with my old boss he was very glad to see me id never been inside a london club before and it was all new to me we had a drink in the bar and i was really glad to be back with him again one gets kind of attached to people that you work for sometimes and i had always hit it off with mr evans he asked how many aircraft id got operating and i didnt mind a bit telling him that id fixed in my own mind the day before the things i wasnt going to talk aboutcontract prices and things of that sortbut except for one or two essential bits of business like that i saw no point in hiding anything up we had a drink or two and then we had lunch i asked him question for question and he told me all about his staff and aircraft out in egypt and in india most of which i knew already and i told him about mine over the coffee he said what weve none of us been able to understand here at home is how you managed to work up such a fleet of aircraft on no capital at all cutter i couldnt have done that it looks like black magic to us i hear youve placed an order for a plymouth tramp you keep your ear pretty close to the ground i said well of course i wish i knew what you use for money i smiled there were some things i didnt mean to tell him but i could tell him most of it for one thing ive been very lucky i replied for another i probably work at a much bigger margin of profit that you do i dont employ any europeans at all not one none of my aircraft carry upholstery or soundproofing if anybody wants a seat he pays extra for the weight of it at standard freight rates little things like that third class travel for everybody he said thoughtfully thats right ive been wanting to ask you about staff he said i knew of course that you use only asiatic pilots and ground engineers are you satisfied with that perfectly weve had no accidents yet and the maintenance is good you can ask the arb its very very interesting how much do you pay a pilot say for one of your airtrucks i grinned im not telling you he laughed all right theres quite a number of people wanting to know that they may find out if they black their faces and come to bahrein for a job i said theyll have their work cut out to find out any other way we sat for some time upstairs with the coffee i still dont understand where you have found the capital he said its very wonderful the amount that youve been able to do you arent a company even are you im just trading as tom cutter it seems to work all right i did not want to keep anything from him that i could reasonably divulge ill be quite frank with you mr evans up till now ive been very lucky with getting easy hirepurchase terms for the airtrucks and the carrier so that i could meet the instalments out of profits for this new tramp ive got in some new money as a personal loan local money he stared at me local moneyin bahrein thats right and as a personal loan i nodded its a personal business the aircraft are all my propertyso far as theyre paid up i see you must be getting to be worth quite a bit if its all personal on paper i said laughing you wouldnt believe the struggle that its been to pay the wages and the petrol bill sometimes i would he said ive had some presently he said look tom this is just an idea thats been passing through my mind in the last month or two im putting it to you without prejudice and with my fingers crossed and all that i nodded you know what we do we operate charter aircraft based here and in egypt and in delhi weve been a bit slow over setting up an organisation in iraq and the persian gulf for a variety of reasons well now in a way youve stolen a march on us and youve done what we should have done ourselves and good luck to you as things are no competition has developed between us and i hope it never will i always think of you as one of us but geographically we operate each side of you if we try to join up delhi with egypt we shall come into competition with you if you try to get out and extend your operations either way youll come into competition with us ive been wondering if we couldnt get together in some way thats very interesting mr evans i said cautiously i think im all right as i am but theres no harm in talking it over that began it and for the next week i was up in london almost all the time i edited an edition of my balance sheet for them and gave them that to chew over and in return i asked for theirs mine was a darn sight better than theirs was although my total business was much smaller i met evans again at morden with an accountant and then i met him again in london with his chairman sir roger sale i told them early on that after running my own show i wasnt going to work for anyone but that if they cared to make an offer to buy my business as a going concern id be interested to hear it i told them straight that if i went on in aviation i was going on as boss of my own show but id consider a proposal whereby theyd pay me hard cash for the business and id get out i was thinking of the garage and of dad and mum at home not getting any younger they took a few days to think it over and i went home i was troubled about the whole thing because i didnt know what i wanted to do in three years id got further ahead in my own business than i had any right to expect i couldnt suppose that id go on getting bigger and bigger at that rate for ever there was nothing behind me in the way of finance if the aeroplanes stopped operating for a month id be bust i lived from hand to mouth all the time in that business there was no cash in it but it was my own show and id made it a success and out there people depended on my efforts back home dad and mum were beginning to depend on me too as they got older it looked as if airservice ltd would make an offer and i had a pretty good idea of what it would be a garage in a country town was well within my reach with a quiet pleasant life in the south of england dose to all the places and the people that i knew i could get married again with more chance of a success this time and raise a flock of kids and i knew somebody whod marry me if i put it to her right too i went around on the morning i got back to the garage out at bitterne on the portsmouth road that i had worked in as a boy and that i had got the sack from when cobhams circus came seventeen years before mr collier still ran it greyer and older than when i had worked for him he remembered me and he had heard i was in aviation in the persian gulf i asked him how one would set about buying a garage business if one wanted to and he produced some copies of a privately issued paper called the garage and motor agent with a lot of businesses for sale in it he lent me half a dozen copies and i fixed up with him to hire a little tenyearold ford to run around in while i was at home i went off in this car next day alone and drove around thinking there was a business at petersfield for sale and another one at arundel and one at fordingbridge and one at lymington in the new forest on the solent and there was a good big one in bournemouth i got back home on the first evening and parked the car on a bombed site near our house doris waters was in having tea with mother it was a friday and there was no school next morning i said to her like to come for a joyride in my rolls tomorrow she smiled id love to do that where are you going to fordingbridge lymington and bournemouth i said oh lovely tom shall i make us up some sandwiches not a bad idea i said make us independent ma asked me see anything you fancied today i saw two i said trouble is i dont know if i want a business or not or even if i can pay for it if i did want it im just looking ma said well doris can help you look four eyes are better than two i ought to have slept well that night but i didnt i lay awake hour after hour in the little back bedroom we had all slept in as boys together listening to all the church clocks in southampton as they struck the hours the noise of shunting engines and the clang of trucks from the goods yard and the occasional siren from a steamer in the fairway i couldnt sleep at all a man has a right to get married and have children and id earned the right to have a wife both in work and money a mans got a right to live in his own place a man has a right to make his life where he can look after his dad and mum a bit when they get old i owed nothing to the east if this deal went through i could pay back the sixty thousand that id borrowed from sheikh abd el kadir for the tramp everyone working for me at bahrein would go on working for airservice ltd just as they had for me except that they might get a bit more money airservice ltd paid higher wages than i did i could get clean out injuring nobody putting nobody out of a job and i could come back to my own place with capital to buy a garage with and settle down it was reasonable and straight and the obvious thing to do and i didnt want to do it i lay in bed tossing and turning trying to reason out why i was such a bloody fool it was the glamour of the east of course the colour and the easy life and the quick money these things had got hold of me intoxicated me so that i couldnt break away and come back to a harder saner more humdrum life in england that was the trouble with me i told myself now that id realised it everything would be all right and i could sleep thats what i told myself but it wasnt all right at all it was no good kidding myself like that there wasnt any colour in bahrein there was an awful lot of grey dust but no pretty girls there wasnt an easy life out there or if there was i hadnt had it what i had had was hard work and bad food prickly heat and sores that wouldnt heal because of the sweat and nobody to talk to if i had made money it had not been easy money and it had done me no good whatsoever in terms of fun or goods or holidays id have been better off working in england on the bench in some factory at six quid a week it wasnt true when i tried to tell myself that the glamour of the east had got hold of me there isnt any glamour or if there is it hadnt come my way i lay sleepless hour after hour somewhere sometime i had read a story about a spitfire pilot going into a dogfight his squadron it was near the end of his tour of ops and he couldnt take it any longer the story told how he fiddled with his safety harness as they dived towards the jerries making sure that everything was ready for him to get out quick and slid his cockpit cover back a fraction just to make sure it was free he knew just what hed do hed carry straight on in his dive and not attempt to get a jerry but just go right through them then while everybody else was engaged with no eyes for anything but the jerry in his sights or the jerry on his tail hed turn his spitfire over and bale out and nobody would ever know he hadnt been unlucky he did that and got down all right and the french resistance boys got hold of him and hid him and made a fuss of him as a great hero two days later he shot himself i lay awake till dawn with that damn story running through my mind then i slept an hour or so and then it was time to get up and take doris for her day in the country she turned up about halfpast nine as pretty as a picture in a white summer frock with a little fine red and green pattern on it she had colour in her cheeks and a sparkle in her eyes she was carrying a basket full of lunch with a white napkin tucked around the top of it oh tom isnt it a heavenly day she said when she saw me ive been up since six i grinned her mood was infectious and all my gloom was rolling away at the sight of her what got you up so early ive been making your lunch tom you can eat sardines cant you i can eat anything i said what have you got sardine sandwiches and brawn sandwiches and cheese and biscuits and some little cakes i made last night ive not got anything to drink except a thermos of coffee are you going to bring some beer might as well i said shall i get some for you i dont drink it she said ill have cider i went out and down to the lion and in at the back door and they let me have the bottles in a bag because it was out of hours it was bright and sunny and fresh out in the street i went and fetched the old ford from the bombed site and drove it up to the door of our house and got all the stuff and put it in the back seat doris came out and got into the seat beside me and ma stood at the door waving us goodbye and two or three of the neighbours were peeking at us the corner of the curtain i let the clutch in and we moved off with a haze of blue scorched oil rising up around us in the shabby little saloon doris turned to me oh tom this is fun it certainly was lovely summer morning when we got out on to the road we went by cadnam and over the open heaths of the new forest and we didnt go very fast because the car wouldnt go very fast it had been nobodys darling for so many years that about twentyfive was its safe cruising speed we couldnt talk much either because it kicked up a pretty fair racket we just sat and enjoyed the colours of the country and the warm tolerant sunshine alternating with cool shade and we were happy i stopped outside fordingbridge and showed doris the advertisement of the garage in the paper i had with me and then we drove in to have a look at it it was advertised as having a twobedroomed house and they wanted seven thousand for it when we got to it we found it mostly built of tin and rather dirty and the house was nothing much i went in and spent about half an hour with the chap looking after it the owner had just died and previous to that he had it run down badly i didnt think a lot of it but it was cheap and in a good position we got into the car again and went on to see the one at bournemouth we stopped for lunch on the way by a wide river heavily preserved full of enormous trout there was a waterfall a little sort of weir we carried our lunch along the bank to the tumbling water and sat down and had it as doris was spreading out the white napkin for a decloth we saw a kingfisher doris was very positive about the garage that wed seen at fordingbridge its all right she said but it wouldnt do for you theres not enough scope there for a man like you tom itsits all too small id have a bit of capital left over for building it up i said its a possibility anyway she shook her head all right for some people but not for a man like you i grinned fat lot you know about me i cant see you fitting in at fordingbridge she said obstinately not after all that youve been doing youd be bored to tears at the end of a year give me another of those rock cakes i said theyre good i knew she had made them herself she passed them to me smiling and i took one and bit into it about fordingbridge i said you may be right but im not sure you are you think i couldnt stick it in a small town but ive been living in one for three years she stared at me where bahrein i said but thats different tom thats in the east a small towns a small town wherever it is i said ive got no feeling against small town life i rather like it she switched the subject its a rotten little house anyway she said id hate to live in it i grinned at her i havent asked you to she flushed a little and i was sorry id done that i didnt mean it that way its a rotten little house and you cant make it any better youd have to find another house and that would take you away from the business i know what you mean i said gently youre right too in a place like that i think you ought to live on top of the job its a smallscale business she said and it always will be but youre not a smallscale person tom we sat and smoked a cigarette after lunch watching the tumbling water and the birds and presently we packed up and walked back to the car and got on the road for bournemouth the bournemouth business was a good one it was on the west side of the town out towards canford cliffs in a very good suburban district it was clean and fairly new on a street corner on a busy main road with a wide area behind it covered with good houses all of which would have a car and many of them two it had four petrol pumps with a good concrete pull in under cover and a very good machine shop about ten hands were regularly employed and there was a showroom built on to it they held a subagency for austins it was a good prosperous modern business going for twentyfive thousand pounds because of the death of the owner the price seemed a bit on the top side to me there was no house i spent an hour and a half there and had a long talk with the manager a smart young chap whod been in the raf hed had a shot at buying it himself but hadnt been able to raise the cash he said there were one or two people after it as an investment he was quite frank and showed me everything but i think he was a bit windy that if i came in id turn him out and run the show myself he was probably about right there because there wouldnt have been room for two of us we left that place at about halfpast three and drove down to the sea and went into a cafй for a cup of tea and for doris to tidy herself up in the ladies room she was very much taken with that garage its a good business isnt it tom she asked its all so clean and nice and in such a good neighbourhood i should think its all right i said would you have enough money for it i think so yes i think i should she sipped her tea i think youd do awfully well there its big enough to give you plenty of scope yes i said its big enough for that what the matter with it you dont seem very enthusiastic i sat in silence for a minute looking out of the window at a sailingboat tacking up and down the beach well i said at last its somebody elses business she wrinkled her brows but its for sale if you bought it itld be yours wouldnt it i nodded the first thing id have to do would be to sack chap who showed us round because id want to run it the moneys nothing its his business really hes worked it up i paused the moneys just what makes it possible for me to pinch his business off him thats all the blasted money does what a horrid way to look at it tom its the right way i said quietly its the truth its a business and ill think about it but if i go in there chap goes out and he knows it his staff wont care about that much eitherhes got a good crowd there i dont know that i want to start off on the job like that i see that she said slowly couldnt you keep him on i dont know i said it all wants a bit of thinking about i couldnt keep him on as boss which hes been up till now we still had one more place to see in lymington and that was on our way back to southampton we left the cafй and got into the little ford again and drove out through christchurch lymington lies about fifteen or twenty miles to the east of bournemouth it is a little town at the west end of the solent on a river near the mouth its a great yachting centre with the unspoilt country of the new forest all around i had planned our trip to leave this till the last because i had a hunch from the advertisement that the anchor garage might be what i wanted and it was it was at the end of the town right down on the waterfront it wasnt as big as it had been at one time because in an me had come over on a tipandrun raid and had flattened most of it with a bomb and killed about fifteen people on the side half of it was still standing and the owner had put up a couple of disposal nissen huts for machine shop and stores the same bomb had brought down about six houses beside the garage the debris had been cleared away of course so that there was now a big open space right on the waterfront suitable for expansion the garage had two pumps and a fair amount of car work but much of the business before the war had been marine and motorboat engines were very much in evidence in the showroom it was owned by an old chap called summers who must have been over seventy he was a good mechanic himself and the place was in good order considering the limitations of the premises but he was tired and wanted to sell out and settle his affairs before he died he told me that he was leaving everything to his married daughter but he wanted to leave it in cash he was quite willing to stay on and help me if i bought it till i got the hang of things he wanted fifteen thousand pounds and there was no house i spent the best part of a couple of hours there with him he had bought one of the house sites and he thought the others could be got without great difficulty he expected a licence to build within twelve months but i should have to see the council about that the bomb had made possible a project that he had always had in mind a slipway for motorboats in his own premises but he would have to leave that to another man to do he was old now and wanted to get out i didnt say much except grunt now and then or ask a question because i was afraid of seeming too eager it was a lovely garage the one bombed site hed bought went through to the main road and had a frontage there right on a corner so you could have the pumps and showroom up there with a good drive in from that the ground hed already got ran down to the original premises on the quay and alongside that as i say there was vacant land for expansion along the water front there was any amount of yacht work there increasing every year as yachting grows in popularity and yacht work is good work because its not so cut price and people will pay for goodquality workmanship in yachting it was saturday evening and about seven oclock by the tine that id learned all i had to know the old man said that several people had been to see it and were considering it but i could see that it was rather a big proposition for the average man looking for a garage over and above the purchase price a lot of money would need spending on it in the way of buildings to develop it to what it could be made into far more than the war damage compensation at the same time there wasnt much immediate return for the next year or two till buildings could be got up so that as an investment it wasnt so attractive as some others i said id think it for the weekend and if i wanted to go on with it id come over on monday or tuesday and with that i got back in the car with doris and drove off its an awfully pretty place she shouted above the rattle of the worn little engine i nodded well find somewhere to stop and have a pint and talk it over there is a little pub on the edge of an open heath just the other side of beaulieu it was a warm summer evening and i parked the car on the grassy sward outside this place and we went in and got beer and cider and bread and cheese and took them out on to the bench in front looking out over the heath it was very quiet there and calm and peaceful thats the place i said thats what i want she turned to me smiling really its marvellous i said didnt you think so i loved it she said its so pretty with the water and the boats and everything but theres an awful lot needs doing tom thats whats going to make it fun i said she turned to me have you got enough money for it ive not got any yet i said if airservice make an offer for my business ill hear in the next day or two if they come through all right there ought to be enough there isnt any house she said i thought of that one i replied theres a lot of building to be done id like to have a big flat over one bit of the garage for a start oh tom looking out over the water with the yachts and everything i nodded thats what i had in mind she said a brandnew flat that one could plan and have everything just right from the start you do have lovely ideas i dont see why not i said ones got to live somewhere and that ground was all housing at one time i think oneld get a permit to do that all right i thought about it for a minute or two drinking my beer keep a boat perhaps i said id like to do that a little sailing yacht that one could take away for the weekend she said it sounds just heavenly i sat there staring out over the heath it was as she said just heavenly too good to be true i was getting tired i suppose at the end of the day and i hadnt slept a lot the night before it was all within my grasp and i could grab it if i wanted to and my other life out in bahrein could go to hell in time id probably forget all that even if it took a year or two to do it i put the tankard down lets get going i said quietly dad and mum will be wondering whats happened to us i ought to have pulled up somewhere on the way back in the shade under a tree in some quiet spot and given her a kiss or two and told her that i loved her it would have made her day perfect if id done that and mine too perhaps still its no good getting into things too deep unless youre sure of yourself id done that once before with beryl that was how i started killing her although i didnt see it at the time i wasnt going to have that happen to doris i still had bahrein on my mind and so i drove straight on and presently got home and dropped her at her fathers house she said its been a lovely day tom thank you ever so much for taking me i smiled ive enjoyed it ill let you know how things go on i went back to the house and there was a letter for me from gujar singh and another one from connie they wrote to me every two or three days to tell me how things were going i opened connies first there was not much in it except news that his sister was on her way to bahrein she was coming in an american ship to alexandria and from egypt she would fly he expected her to arrive in about a week and said that he had fixed up accommodation for her in the house that he lived in i wondered how a girl from san diego would react to the condition in the souk it was none of my business of course except that i had offered to give her a trial in the office he saiod that one of the ground engineers a chap called salim had left and had taken a job with sind airways ltd in karachi and he was looking for another one i knew that he had worked in karachi during the war and i was not surprised that he had left to go back there the rest of the was about the routine work going on in the hangar gujars letter was more serious after telling me about the flghts that had been made and booked ahead for the next few days he went on i think it will be better when you can return the secretary from the residency mr connop came to the office yesterday and asked when you would come back and when i said a fortnight he seemed angry he did not say his business and went away in the bazaar men are saying that the resident is angry with you for the loan of money from the sheikh of khulal because they say that religious influence has been used to make that old man lend his money there is much talk about this so that some say that what goes on in our hangar is good and comes from god and others say that it is evil i do not think it would have entered anybodys head that it was evil if the english people at the residency had not been angry and the servants told it in the souk and now there is a great deal of talking going on shak lin has told you that salim has gone back to karachi i think he has gone to tell the engineers in sind airways our way of doing things but that is nothing to us because he is gone shak lin is looking for another one ma was in the room as i was reading this one bad news tom she asked no i said just business i was furious over what had happened in bahrein the loan that had been offered by the sheikh of khulal was not of my seeking nor was it due to any religious trickery on the part of connie shaklin news of it had got to the residency as some distorted rumour and they had assumed that we had swindled the old sheikh with a confidence trick and got away with sixty thousand pounds of his money if they believed that of course it was their duty to commence enquiries because it was their job to do what they could to protect the arab population from exploitation they had been hamhanded in the residency and had talked in hearing of the servants and now god knew what might be stirring in bahrein it might end in religious riots easily i didnt get much sleep that night either i lay and tossed upon my bed all night wakeful and in a weary anxious maze salim had left and gone to sind airways in karachi i knew salim he was one of the most devout of our ground engineers gujar said that he had gone to teach the engineers of sind airways our way of doing things what way the religious way gujar could hardly mean anything else was salim then a missionary spreading a new gospel amongst ground engineers was he starting up a cult of shak lins teaching in karachi as u myin had started it in rangoon what was ahead of us and where was it all going to end if riots started in bahrein because of shak lins teaching how far would they spread would the flame run from bahrein to karachi to rangoon and on to bangkok in siam i lay unhappy and distressed all night through in our small slum house in southampton between the gas works and the docks out in the east the situation might be getting out of control and here i was in england away from the job and powerless to influence events there were eight days to go before the tramp was ready for delivery i got up in the morning tired and stale it was sunday so we had breakfast late over the meal dad said weve not heard anything about how you got on yesterday tom see anything you fancied i stared at him my mind was far away in the persian gulf anything i fancied any garages recollection came flooding back to me but it all seemed unreal now and vastly unimportant ohgarages we saw one or two but nothing very much he grunted what are you going to dogo on looking i had to get away and be alone to think things over yes i said i think ill go out today and look around a bit more ma said taking doris again i shook my head ill go alone ive got a lot of things ive got to have a think about she said no more and i went out after a time and got the car from the bombed site and drove down to the central post office i sent a very long cable to gujar singh from there two sheets of it i asked him to let me know at once by cable if i ought to return i said i would fly back immediately if there was any need and come back again to england a week later to fetch the tramp if everything was quiet and in order in bahrein i said he should fly to england himself by boac on friday arriving on saturday and i would meet him at heath row we would go to plymouth on monday morning and take delivery of the tramp and fly it out to bahrein as soon as possible i sent this off and went back to the car i had done the right thing i felt and i had done what was in my power to take control of the events that i had started but i was most unhappily aware that i was vacillating wildly twentyfour hours before i had been driving out with doris waters to look for a garage and an english home perhaps with her now all that had gone down the wind and was almost forgotten so that dad had had to remind me about it at breakfast and here i was having just sent off a cable committing myself to go back to bahrein it crossed my tired mind that i could go back for a week or two perhaps just to get things straightened up in order to hand over clean to airservice ltd i drove north that day through winchester and whitchurch on the road to newbury i drove on in a dream not thinking much where i was going to not really caring i got sleepy presently for i had had two bad nights and so i pulled into the side of the road somewhere and slept in the drivers seat a bit nodding forward on the wheel i woke up half an hour later with a bad taste in my mouth and wondered where i was and what the hell i had come there for there was no sense in it i turned the car and drove back south again and presently i found a pub and stopped and went in for a pint and a couple of packets of biscuits as my lunch i felt better after that by midafternoon i was running south and entering the outskirts of winchester i had been a choir boy once when i was young when youre in a bit of trouble i think your mind goes back to childhood to the time when you had no responsibilities when all decisions were made for you thats a grand time that is i got to thinking of my time in the choir that sunday afternoon as i drove into winchester id got nothing better to do and i turned left down the high street and then right and parked by the cathedral it was quiet and dim and cool in the cathedral i stood at the end of the nave vaguely looking round it was restful and a good place to think in presently i went into the north aisle and began to walk slowly up it looking at all the names of famous people on the walls and on the floor i walked on sir henry wilson who was murdered and jane austen maybe theyd had their troubles too i thought and like me theyd not known what to do for the best there was an old man in a long black cloak at the end of the aisle he came up to me and said quietly the service is in the choir this afternoon sir may i show you a seat it was on the tip of my tongue to say i didnt want to go to any service and then i thought perhaps i did and so he took me through the carved screen and put me in a choir stall of old carved wood with more prayer books in front of me than you could shake a stick at there wasnt anything in particular about that service good singing a hymn or two an anthem all in the familiar ritual that i had known as a boy i was still tired and once or twice i nearly fell asleep upon my knees maybe god did that for me i know when it was over and i walked out of the choir i was rested and quite calm i knew what id got to do id got to go back to bahrein and forget about the garage i drove back to southampton with a mind at ease it was bad luck on dad and mum and doris but it had to be it was just one of those things i parked the car upon the vacant lot and before going home i walked round to the waters house the old man came to the door himself evening mr waters i said doris in she came to the door behind him and he went back into the room look doris i said ive got to tell you something like to walk down the street a minute she came out and we walked together down the road past all the kids playing about that garage business i said its all off im going back to bahrein oh tom wouldnt they buy the business its not that i said its something different things arent so good out there how long will you be gone for a long time i said quietly when once you start a thing youve got to see it through i turned to her you mustnt count upon me coming back at all i see she said quietly i understand tom she didnt understand of course but her way was the best i thought id better let you know i said a bit awkwardly ill have to be getting back out there as soon as ever i can she smiled then all i can do is wish you luck shed got plenty of guts i smiled with her maybe ill need it i held out my hand and she took it goodbye doris im sorry its turned out like this im sorry too she said goodbye tom i walked back to our house and went down to the lion with dad and had a game of darts with him theres no sense in agonising over what cant be helped and it pleased dad no end to have me in the pub with him i only had a few days left to please them in next morning there was a letter for me from mr norman evans of airservice ltd he said theyd had a board meeting and he was pleased to be able to tell me that they had unanimously resolved to make an offer for my business he went on to the details broadly speaking they would take over the tramp contract they could pay sixtyfive thousand pounds for the remainder of the assets at that date that meant that after paying back the loan from sheikh abd el kadir id have thirtyfive thousands pounds clear profit from the sale of the business it was about seven thousands pounds better than i thought theyd go to at the end of the letter mr evans said he hoped that id be able to reconsider my decision to leave aviation he said that if i should do so would i get in touch with him i walked down to the telephone box at the corner of our street and rang him up at morden as i stuck the sixpences and shillings in the slot while the children gaped at me through the glass i felt as if i was signing my own death warrant and perhaps i was he came on the line at last this is cutter i said mr evans ive been thinking this thing over and im not selling just yet im in a bit of trouble out there and ive got to get back quick im sorry if ive led you up the garden to meccah thou hast turned in prayer with aching heart and eyes that burn ah hajji whither wilt thou turn when thou art there when thou art there james elroy flecker i got a cable from gujar singh on tuesday evening in reply to mine he said that there was no immediate trouble likely to arise in bahrein largely due to the imam who had visited the aerodrome and had himself conducted evening prayer outside the hangar one day this service had been attended by about a hundred people from the town the liaison officer had been up at the aerodrome that afternoon but had taken no part in the proceedingt he said that according to the gossip in the souk the people in the residency were still very much upset about the loan there was no reason why he should not come to england however and he proposed to leave on friday as arranged i met him at heath row airport on saturday evening when he came in on the constellation from australia and drove him down to southampton in the little ford gujar had never been in england and this was a great thrill for him he was amazed at the fertility of the country i did not know it was like this he said i had read about the green grass and the fields and seen pictures and the cinema of course but even so i did not know it was like this he created quite a sensation amongst the kids in our street when he got out of the car i had no need to apologise to him for our house because he knew quite well that i was a working man and my father too and anyway the house was probably a better one than the one he lived in in bahrein i took him in and introduced him to dad and mum and fixed him up in the top bedroom and then we all had tea together downstairs dad and mum took to gujar as i had thought they would once you got accustomed to the great black beard and the turban gujar was all right and before long he was telling mum all about his kids he didnt drink or smoke of course so it was no good taking him down to the lion and so we sat at home all evening just talking he confirmed that there was no cause for alarm about the doings in bahrein largely due to the statesmanlike action of the imam he said that he had called at the office of the arabiasumatran company after a telephone call with mr johnson and there were developments there as i had supposed would happen they wanted to transfer a load of scientific equipment and three technicians from bahrein to their new oil field on the east alligator river in the northern territory of australia and they wanted a date as soon as possible for the bight the load totalled about three tons so it would have to be either the carrier or the tramp gujar had discussed my absence and the tramp delivery with them which they already knew about and had quoted a date about three weeks ahead which would give me about ten days in bahrein after i got back before leaving on this journey being a flight over new ground he knew that i would want to go myself i took him for a joyride next day in the little ford finishing up at portsmouth and taking him over the victory nelsons flagship berthed for ever in her drydock in the middle of the dockyard he was very much impressed with that next day we went by train to plymouth the tramp was standing ready for us on the aerodrome clean and new and shining with the sales manager we got into it and inspected it all through and then with one of the test pilots flying it and myself in the copilots seat we took it off and flew round a bit after a landing or two we changed seats and with gujar standing behind us i took it off and landed it a couple of times it handled rather better than the carrier everything worked and everything was right we spent an hour on the ground then checking over the inventory and paid the final cheque then the machine was mine we stayed that night at plymouth in the firms hotel and spent a couple of hours next morning buttoning and unbuttoning every cowling with the firms engineers getting to know the aircraft intimately then we said goodbye to those efficient people and took it off and flew it down to eastleigh we landed there about dinner time and i took a taxi and went home and fetched dad and mum out to the aerodrome as soon as dad got home from work and showed it to them dad stared up at it in awe bit different from the first one tom he said what impressed ma most i think was the toilet in the rear fuselage i declare its nicer than what weve got at home she said i dont think the rest of the machine really registered with her it was too big and too complicated for her to take in all those clocks and things in front of you she said however do you get to know what they all mean while i had been fetching them out gujar had had the tramp refuelled she had tankage for twelve hundred gallons giving her a stillair range of about two thousand miles i was taking a small load out with me a spare engine for the proctors and one for the airtrucks and a few airframe spares and he had got all this stuff loaded in when we left her that night and went home with dad and mum we were all ready to go we got up at four in the morning and mum got up and cooked us breakfast then the taxi was there and it was time to go i went and said goodbye to dad in bed look after yourself i said no more of that pneumonia and he said get on with you and that was our parting i went down and kissed mum goodbye tom she aid dont be so long away this time she was crying a little a thing i never saw mum do before but she was getting old ill try not to mum i said quietly cheer up ill be back before long and as i said that i couldnt help remembering beryl because that was what id said to her its bad when youve got to say goodbye thirtyfour hours later i put the tramp down on the runway at bahrein a bit different to that first journey in the foxmoth as i taxied in towards the hangar all the staff came crowding out to see the new machine although i was still sick at leaving mum at home it was good to be back connie was there to meet us of course i left the clearing up of the pilots duties to gujar singh and walked down the length of the vast cabin and opened the rear door and got out on the hot tarmac it was midafternoon late in may and bahrein was warming up the heat hit me like a blow afternoon connie i said well heres your baby he grinned looks a nice job have any trouble on the way out i shook my head not a thing just kept going we moved away and looked up at the engine nacelles there were no oil leaks and everything was factoryclean i think shes quite all right i turned to him how have things been here okay he said mr johnson rang up yesterday to ask if wed be able to do that flight to australia i told him i thought you were on the way and that youd give him a ring as soon as you got in i nodded ill ring him this afternoon which one will you takethis or the carrier carrier ready he nodded shes got about two hundred and eighty hours to go before the engine change but thats plenty i think ill take this one i said slowly id like to get to know her i dont think ill take the carrier through the dutch indies till ive got to you never know i strolled into the hangar with him and had a look at the maintenance that had been going on in my absence everything was in applepie order as i had known it would be i didnt keep him very long because i knew he would be wanting to get on to the new machine and i had a mass of stuff waiting for me in the office okay i said better get that one inside and give her a check over theres a sort of family bible of maintenance schedules for her with the log books gujar knows about it if you get started on that ill be out as soon as ive had a look in the office he hesitated my sister arrived the day before yesterday he said would you like to see her in the morning i had forgotten about her ohyes shed like a job with us i think she would theres nothing for her to do here unless she works wheres she staying i wasnt quite sure how much of an asiatic this girl was thats all right he said ive got her a room alongside mine in the same house i wasnt quite sure how he lived or where except that it was somewhere in the souk near gujar singh thats all right for her is it oh yes she wont come to any harm if he was satisfied it was no concern of mine how the girl lived shorthand typist yes fine i said tell her to come up tomorrow morning and ill give her a tryout two months i said didnt i he nodded well no hard words if i boot her out at the end of it he grinned ive told her that all right whats her name nadezna i stared at him how much nadezna how do you spell it he spelt it out for me nadezna i said thats a new one on me its a russian name he said it means hope does it i never knew anyone with a russian name before he smiled well you know me constantine is russian our mother was a russian so we both had russian names she met my father at a place called barkul he was a silk merchant from canton shed done something in russia and the tsarist police were after her she married my father in barkul and they went down to shanghai and then they emigrated and got settled down in penang i was born in penang old mutluq bin aamir here the chap whose house i live inhes a silk merchant and he knew my father wheres barkul i asked he smiled now youre asking something its right in the middle of asia somewhere but i dont know where in sinkiang i think its somewhere about a thousand miles northwest of shanghai ive never heard of it before i said no nor has anybody else i turned away well tell your sister to come up tomorrow morning nadezna ill have to write that down i went into the office to the babu clerk he had done his best while i was away but there was a great pile of invoices and statements and arb notices and notams and applications for jobs and correspondence about spares and payments over a foot high i shuffled through this mass of stuff hoping to god this girl was going to be some good and then i rang up johnson of the arabiasumatran he said glad to hear you cutter gujar singh told you about this flight we want on the th oh yes i said weve got all that laid on ill go with him myself in the new aircraft when are you coming down to see it sir i want to meet you he said there have been some developments if this first trip to the east alligator goes all right we may want more we might even have to have something like a regular service id better come and see you i said when shall i come he thought a minute id like to see your new machine he said ill come over late tomorrow afternoon i settled down to plough through the pile of papers that had accumulated for me when you run a show like mine thats what you have to do you fly all day and come into the office tired with the strain and start off on the real work id been at it for about half an hour when a car drove up and parked outside it was the liaison officer major hereward he hadnt wasted much time in coming up to see me i suppose theyd seen the tramp flying over on the circuit as i came into land hereward was an indian army officer or had been at one time he wasnt a bad sort but id had very little to do with him i never got invited to any of the residency parties of course because only officers go to those and i lived with the radio operators and in the sergeants mess id spoken to him once or twice upon the tarmac and hed always been quite friendly i got up as he came in and gave him a chair and a cigarette what ive come about he said is this loan i understand that youve been borrowing money cutter from the sheikh of khulal thats right i said you may know the amount sixty thousand pounds i nodded that right it struck me that he didnt care about the job he had to do well thats a very large sum of money he observed it would be to you or me i said its a very small amount in the aircraft business its the cost of one aeroplane that may be he replied quite frankly mr cutter we dont much care to see the sheikhs lending their money to buy aeroplanes we should very much prefer to see them spending it upon their people in the provision of roads hospitals schools and things of that sort there are other sources of finance for aircraft projects but unless the sheikhs provide the schools and hospitals in their own sheikhdoms nobody else will its very undesirable that they should lend their money to enterprises that are of no benefit to their people he had a point there of course but i didnt see what i could do about it i see what you mean i said this is a local enterprise and we employ a good many local people i should have thought local capital was rather a good thing im afraid we dont take that view of it at all up at the residency he said in fact you employ hardly any truly local people half a dozen labourers at the most all your employees come here to work for you from other parts of the east if you were employing two or three hundred arab labourers recruited in the district upon work that they can do digging ditches for example we might take a different view of this large loan as it is im afraid we consider it very undesirable and in more ways than one im sorry about that i said i sat in thought for a minute wondering how much trouble they intended to make this loan wasnt my doing i said at last i didnt go round asking for it i had to get in some more money to do what the oil companies want me to doi had to get another large aircraft the sheikh of khulal heard that i was in that position and sent his wazir to offer me this money as a loan thats what happened where is the money now he asked i didnt like that one just outside the hangar i said evenly that is unless my chaps have pushed it in you mean its been spent upon the aeroplane that youve brought back from england thats what it was lent me for i replied fiftyfive thousand pounds was the cost of that aircraft ive got about eight thousand pounds worth of spares on order for it i see he said how did the sheikh of khulal get to hear you needed money it was no good trying to conceal anything from these people they probably knew anyway my chief engineer goes over to khulal sometimes i said i think he told them i was having to expand thats shak lin for some reason his use of the chinese version of the name annoyed me though i did it often myself but this was a pretty formal matter and connie was a british subject mr shaklin is my chief engineer i said yes and he goes and talks some bastard form of religion to the old man i dont know anything about that i said whatever he does over there he does in his spare time on his day off i know of course that mr shaklin is a religious man but ive never discussed the sheikh of khulal with him or him with the sheikh youre not suggesting are you that he should have had a permit of some kind before going to see the sheikh no he said thoughtfully youd better know the suggestions that have been made though mr cutter it has been suggested that your man shak lin used his religious influence with the sheikh of khulal to get you a very large loan which would be free of interest under the islamic law whereas for a speculative business such as yours you would have had to pay large interest charges on a loan obtained from any other source i got up and crossed over to the window and stood looking out i wasnt going to answer that one in a hurry i was too angry thats a nice suggestion i said at last who thought that one up he said it seems rather an obvious deduction from the facts maybe the trouble was that it was so very nearly true it was the truth told with a twist the facts are what you say of course i have saved interest charges the motive was completely differentthe motive for taking this loan you can believe that or not just as you like its all very unfortunate he said it lends itself to misinterpretation i swung round from the window id had just about enough of this what do you want me to do i asked give back the money he smiled i dont suppose you can do that i could have wiped that grin off his face with the greatest pleasure but i didnt do it i crossed to the table where my briefcase was full of the papers i had brought from england i could i said i dont know that im going to however ill show you something i pulled out the letter from mr norman evans and chucked it across the table to him thats a cash offer for this business i said ive just refused it but i could get it back again i could pay back that sixty thousand in a month from now if i decided to but i shant do that just because you and the resident have come to the conclusion that im a bloody crook he took up the letter and began reading it thats rather extreme language he said mildly i didnt answer that but i stood in silence staring out of the window as he read the letter one works and struggles to build something up over the years and then an ignorant and suspicious official full of his own importance comes along and tries to knock it down he came to the end of the letter and laid it down i see he said you say that you have refused this offer thats right why it seems a very good offerto me i crossed to the desk and sat down in my chair and lit a cigarette ill tell you why i refused it i said slowly i was going to accept it first of all and retire from the gulf and take my money and go back and live in england then i heard from my chief pilot that you people had been raising a packet of trouble out here over this loan and over mr shaklins religious doings in england it looked as if youd stirred up a hornets nest here for no reason at all well when i sell a business i sell it cleannot with a packet of unknown trouble hanging round its neck i called the deal off and i came back here why do you think that we raised any trouble i know damn well you did everything was quite all right here when i went away then you found out about this loan and your boys at the residency heard you talking and spread it all over the souk my people live down therethey know what happened if the imam hadnt been such a good chap youd have had a holy war or something on your hands he coloured a little thats a considerable exaggeration he said stiffly all right i said lets leave that where do we go from here i beg your pardon what do you want me to do i asked im quite willing to cooperate with you provided what you want is reasonable well mr cutter he said i shall have to go and talk it over with the resident some rather large issues may arise out of this matter concerning the whole future of commercial development in the district if anything has to be done ill get in touch with you again he paused in the meantime may i take it that there will be no more borrowing money from the sheikhs you may for the next month i said ive got no further expansion in mind at the moment only for a month i should have thought that was time enough for you to make your mind up what you want to do i said im not going to accept a permanent restriction of that sort just from you this afternoon that was the end of it and i went out with him to his car it was a bit unfortunate that sunset prayers outside the hangar were just starting up i hadnt seen that for a month or so and it had grown a great deal in my absence the waste ground by the hangar had been levelled off over an area of about a hundred yards by fifty and marked out with white stones with a semicircle in the side towards mecca that had been done since i went away there were only about twenty of our people from the hangar but there were three motor bus loads from the town and a large number of miscellaneous arab bodies from the raf camp there must have been about a hundred and fifty people there in all all turned to mecca and in prayer about ninety per cent of them were moslems doing their rakats together the nonmoslems knelt a little way apart behind connie facing to mecca like the others but in silent prayer some of the men who had come up from the town in the buses i knew as merchants in the souk and some of them were quite well dressed a few were in european clothes major hereward stood looking at this going on in silence for a minute his disapproval was evident but there didnt seem to be much that i could do about it finally he snorted got into his car and drove away without a word it didnt look so good when i got to the office at halfpast seven next morning our normal time for starting work in that hot place the girl was there waiting for me she was in european clothes a light cotton frock bare legs and white shoes she had long black hair done up in european style upon her head but you could see the chinese in her as indeed you could with connie i think her russian mother must have been a pretty woman because nadezna had good features and she had a sort of impish cheerfulness that may have come from the chinese father morning i said its miss shaklin thats right she said my brother told me to stick around here she spoke with a slight american intonation come on in i said i led the way into the office and gave her a chair your brother told me that youd like a job with us she nodded that was the general idea can you take dictation at the rate im speaking now why surely mr cutter i can take quicker than that i told your brother that id give you a tryout for a couple of months if you came here i said after that no hard feelings if we part she nodded what we didnt discuss was what the wage would be got any ideas on that she shook her head i just dont know what people pay out here or what it costs to live i dont pay san diego wages i know it i sat in silence for a minute then i raised my head and smiled at her why did you come here miss shaklin its a pretty dud sort of place and rough living for you i should think she smiled well she said its kind of different to san diego she was silent for a minute then she said i suppose connie told you about mother dying i nodded and said something or other well after that there didnt seem to be much sense in brother and sister living right on opposite sides of the world and neither of them married nor likely to be so as he was stuck fast here and i was sort of loose in san diego after mother went i said id come out here for a time anyway and keep house for him i wondered if she had found him living as she had expected but there was no sense in starting a discussion of that sort with this girl i had troubles of my own to deal with without digging into hers i straightened up at the desk okay miss shaklin i said now about the wage i havent an idea what a shorthand typists gets here i dont suppose there is another one outside the bloutside the residency i should have to watch the language now with a girl in the office ill tell you what im going to suggest the wage of a cashier in the bank here is two hundred and fifty chips a month thats supposed to be enough for a married man with a family living in this town i know that because gujar singh was one before he came to me thats on the indian standard but then youre a single woman ill give you that for a start two hundred and fifty rupees a month and see how it works out if its not enough come and tell me about it i dont want to put you to any real hardship but i dont pay european wages id be bust in a fortnight if i did she said that sounds fair enough the same rate as a teller its good enough to make a start on mr cutter maybe i wont be here long enough to feel the pinch right i said well ill just show you round and then well get started i took her in and introduced her to the babu clerk and showed her our one typewriter she said it looked as if it had come over in the ark and spent most of the intervening time up in the snow on mount ararat i said id get her a new one because i knew that thered be trouble if i tried to take it from the babu or make them share it it was a sort of badge of office to him and a sign of social elevation that he wrote letters on a typewriter there were some new royals in a shop down in the souk id make gujar go and buy one for me because hed get it cheaper then i showed her where the ladies room was in the airport building about a quarter of a mile away and then we got settled down to the dictation i heard no more from major hereward but johnson of the arabiasumatran came out to see me that afternoon the tramp was in the hangar and i took him and showed him that and we climbed all over it and opened the big nose doors to show him how a truck was driven into it it was absolutely brandnew of course and everything was clean and shining and polished he was quite impressed then we went over to the office and i sent for cups of coffee from the restaurant one falls into the eastern way of doing things he told me what he wanted and it was as i had supposed this first flight to australia was in the nature of a test of a new mode of operating their vast concern they were thinking in terms of a much freer exchange of staff and equipment between their properties in the persian gulf in central burma in southern sumatra and in north australia they had in mind a regular service once a fortnight linking up these places if this first flight proved to be a success and this trial service would continue for at least six months it might be after that that it would need to be stepped up to once a week or else they might want to run a smaller and more comfortable aircraft for passengers only on alternate weeks with the freight machine we started then and did a little figuring to run the carrier or the tramp from bahrein to east alligator river via the other places was going to cost them ј for the return trip so that the fortnightly service was going to cost them about ј a year it was a fleabite to them apparently but it was the hell of a lot of money to me i told him that i could handle it for him and i convinced him with facts and figures that i could i think he wanted to be convinced and indeed he said as much im very glad to hear that youre happy about the fortnightly service he said presently i should be sorry personally if we had to put the business elsewhere for one thing your quotations have always been lower than anybody elses and yet you seem to make your business pay its the hundredpercent asiatic labour that i use i said he nodded its partly that and partly you own ability we like the use you make of asiatics we think youre on the right lines politically i think youll have fewer difficulties in running a service for us through pakistan india burma and southeast asia than a wholly european concern might have i think i will and youre quite happy that this thing wont overstrain your resources its about the limit i can do upon my present capital mr johnson i said frankly i shall put the new tramp on the service and use it for nothing else when you decide to start i shall get another spare engine and put it in australia with a couple of engineers ill have to have some staff out at the other end the utilisation of that tramp will be at the rate of hours a year well thats reasonable we can do that we may have to send the carrier occasionally when the tramp is in for c of a or for an engine change but that should be all right your carriers pretty well occupied isnt it thats so i replied as i say a contract of this sort would pretty well fill me up i can handle it all right but if any more work comes in ill have to get another aircraft somehow or other he smiled quietly we shant be difficult about the schedule we can adjust the date of the flights by a day or so to help you if you give us plenty of notice only our own people are involved its not as if it were a public service that may be a great help i replied we might want that for an engine change will you have any difficulty in expanding further if more work comes in not technically i replied i can get the aircraft and i can get the staff every asiatic ground engineer in the east seems to want to come and work herei dont know why the only difficulty will be finance youve got a good business he said i shouldnt have thought youd have much trouble with finance theres been the hell of a lot of trouble over the last lot i said candidly sheikh abd el kadir thats right it seems my name stinks round these parts he nodded i know they arent pleased at the residency do your people object i dont think so he said slowly i dont think we object at all we have to pay the sheikhs these vast sums in royalties for the oil that lies under their deserts really huge sums of money that theyve done nothing to earn if some of that money finds its way back into your business i dont think we object at all it means that parta small partof the money we pay out comes back to do a useful job for us i think we rather like it he went away quite satisfied and i went on with my work i stayed at bahrein for about ten days before we took off for australia and in that time i didnt fly at all there was too much to do upon the ground the growth of staff continually made new organisation necessary in the business what had been adequate for a staff of two was quite inadequate for a staff of thirty the stores were a headache now i had one or two long talks with connie about that we were having rather a curious trouble there was practically no pilfering from the hangar most unusual for the east i could only put that down uneasily to the supposition that the staff regarded our hangar as a holy place tools and materials however were continually getting lost one day there would suddenly be no quarter drills in the store and next day six or seven would be found in various drawers or other parts of the hangar it was the same with gasket material and taps and dies and things like that i worked out a new stores system and put it into force with the help of connie and his sister nadezna was a great help she was quiet and efficient and she was always there moreover she took an interest in the business and living with her brother as she did she could learn the ropes without having continually to bother me with questions like most girls in an office she had an aptitude and a liking for routine work and she filled a very necessary place in our business it was always a burden to me to check invoices releasenotes and all the many documents that every aeroplane must have for every part put into it but it was no irritation to her to trace out the pedigree of a spare length of flexible petrol pipe and enter it under the proper reference numbers in the aircraft log book she seemed rather to like that sort of job i commented on that once and she said i like seeing everything all entered up and right and the job properly done it makes me feel good youre very like your brother i remarked thats what he tells people in the hangar i know it she paused and then she said quite a few people round these parts seem to be taking an interest in what connie says in the hangar didnt you know about thatwhen you came here she shook her head he always was a bit that way at home but nobody ever listened to him i dont mean that he got up and preached he never did that although theres plenty of people in california who do no he just had ideas but nobody paid any attention to them back at home we wouldnt pay any attention to them in england i remarked but they seem to fit in out here she sat in silence for a minute then she said have you seen the way they treat him in the souk i shook my head how do they i dont know its like he was a prophet or something some of them get up and do a sort of a salaam when he walks by i hadnt heard that one theres no harm in that i know but one or two of them have started doing it to me do they do that when you go walking down the souk only beggars do they come and beg off you she shook her head these are well dressed old men merchants you know sitting in their shops not poor people i laughed because it seemed best to take it as a joke i look too english nobody salaams to me unless they want something i wish they didnt do it to me she said uneasily it makes you wonder what it is thats going on i didnt pursue the subject it seemed better to let things sort themselves out in their own way in a sense i was relieved the girl and her brother were a mixture of the east and the west and when first i had heard that she was living in the souk i had been a bit troubled if respectable old men got up and bowed when she passed it probably meant that she was perfectly safe down there it seemed to indicate that she was already known and respected so far as it went that was all to the good and resolutely i put the matter out of my mind we took off for australia in the tramp a few days after that gujar singh and i with a load of four passengers and about three tons of technical equipment we left at dawn and put down in the early afternoon at karachi to refuel after an hour we got going again and spent the night at ahmedabad we refuelled at calcutta next day and slept at rangoon and on the third day we got to diento after stops at singapore for fuel and palembang for customs on the fourth day we stopped for fuel at sourabaya and went on down the island chain of indonesia and then over the timor sea to australia we put down on the big aerodrome at darwin just after dark and ran our heads straight into a pack of trouble australia is a white mans country and nobody could have presented gujar singh as a white man i found in the first ten minutes that everyone knew that my aircraft were normally flown and maintained by asiatics and that a strike of the air line staffs control officers and ground engineers throughout australia was threatened if my aeroplane was handled by the customs or allowed to fly into australia at all preoccupied as i had been with all my own affairs i hadnt foreseen that one the row broke in the darkness on the tarmac and it went on for hours the customs refused to clear the goods in the aircraft or at first to pass the passengers through immigration somebody said at one stage that i could have fuel and fly away back to indonesia with the load and passengers and all after an hour and a half of argument they allowed the four passengers to go into the town to the hotel but the machine was placed under a military guard till the morning at about ten oclock they said that i could go down to the hotel but when i asked about gujar they said flatly that no hotel in darwin would accept him i was so angry by that time i said they could take their hotel and treat it unconventionally and went off to sleep with gujar in the cabin of the tramp having sent a radio message to the arabiasumatran company at east alligator river to tell them my predicament i found gujar sing waiting patiently by the tramp he had very wisely kept in the background while all this was going on look gujar i said im very sorry about this theyve got this colour trouble on their minds here and weve got to make the best of it i told him what had happened and then i said well sleep in the machine tonight and see what happens in the morning it looks as though the idea of running through to the east alligator river will have to be revised a bit he smiled gently dont be upset about it he said this is nothing new to us i am upset i answered hotly by god i am ive never heard such bloody nonsense in all my life my people do things as silly or sillier than this he said it was just after the british had left india and pakistan and india were at each others throats and mass deportations of pitiful refugees were taking place from both countries all countries are stupid in these things he said it does not matter its economic i said they know that we can undercut their rates because we employ asiatics i dont believe weve got a hope of operating in this country there are plenty of other countries he said philosophically youve said it i was still very angry they can keep this one there was no trouble about sleeping in the machine of course darwin is hot all the year round and we had no need of coverings in the rear fuselage we had the engine covers and the cockpit covers which i had brought with me in case we had to leave the aircraft parked in monsoon rain and these great masses of canvas were quite new and clean we were both well accustomed to this sort of thing and we made beds of this stuff in the cabin behind the load and made ourselves comfortable for the night i lay awake for some time worrying about my business this regular fortnightly charter for the arabiasumatran was a very big thing to me a steady contract running at the rate of ј a year was not one that i could afford to let slip through my fingers at the same time i had heard enough about australian reactions to the flight that evening to realise that it would be quite impossible to operate my aircraft in white australia my asiatic pilots and staff were a valuable asset to me all the way from bahrein to timor they smoothed the way politically for the free passage of my aircraft and they made it possible for me to quote low prices for my freights the last leg of the journey however was impossible for me to operate at all half waking and half sleeping for i was tired with the strain of four days hard flying i wondered if i could operate to the nearest extremity of indonesia and make arrangements with an australia air line for the last leg of the route suppose i flew as far as koepang in timor and transhipped the loads there to an australian machine with an australian crew which would fly to koepang from darwin pick up the load and take it to east alligator river to operate like this would put the costs up but the cost of the service to the oil company would still be far less than if the flight all the way from bahrein were carried out by a white company and in this way they would keep the political advantage of running an asiatic service all the way through asia i drifted into sleep thinking about this one they allowed gujar and me to go out of the aerodrome next morning to a small cafe just outside the gate but they sent a soldier to stand guard over us while we were eating our breakfast i asked him to join us at the bacon and eggs and after some hesitation he agreed he was a good clean lad and said a little awkwardly that you had some pretty funny things to do when you were in the army when we got back to the control office there was a signal there for me from the east alligator river to say that they were sending over a representative and at about ten oclock a grumman amphibian landed carrying a mr fletcher as a passenger mr fletcher knew all about us and our way of operating aircraft indeed he had been at bahrein when first i went there with the foxmoth and i remembered him when i saw him as a passenger that i had carried once or twice in those early days knowing australia as he now did he was not in the least surprised that we had run our heads into a brick wall his first concern was to secure the release of his passengers and freight but he listened to my proposals to end my service at timor and make arrangements in the future for the goods and passengers to be brought into australia on an australian aircraft after half an hours talk he left in a taxi to go into darwin for a conference with the administrator of the northern territory mr walker he didnt invite me to go with him so i stayed up at the aerodrome and had a long talk with the pilot of the grumman a dutchman called beebs who spoke very good english beebs knew australia well and had flown the grumman repeatedly between east alligator river and diento in sumatra he thought that the proposal to stop my service in indonesia was sound and he suggested that maclean airways at alice springs would probably be the best people with whom to negotiate for bringing the loads on into australia he said they had a dakota which they used for freight with the encouragement of regular work for this dakota operating from darwin he thought eddie maclean would so adjust his services as to use this aircraft more in the northern part of the country and so make it available to me as regards the terminal point for my service he suggested dilly koepang or bali as these three places all had customs organisation and good fuel supplies he pointed out that customs would be necessary he showed the geography to me on the maps the island of timor is half dutch indonesian territory and half portuguese dilly is in the portuguese bit and the authorities there were pleasant and easygoing and delighted to see australians or anyone else who came to visit the colony koepang in dutch territory at the other end of timor was a military airstrip where civil aircraft were tolerated as a necessary nuisance of the two places he preferred dilly the third alternative was bali further back along the chain of islands to the west bali he said was a friendly place with very good dutch officials and very suitable as my terminal but it was a good way further back and would bring up the last leg of the route to be operated by white australian aircraft to no less than eleven hundred miles with a corresponding increase in the costs mr fletcher came back from darwin presently with his four technicians my passengers to australia he had settled the business got his technicians through the immigration and secured permission to unload the cargo from my aircraft he planned to take the technicians back to east alligator with him in the grumman and to send over a truck for the three tons of cargo unloading the cargo was a headache because the labourers at the aerodrome belonged to the wharfies union and refused to touch it with pilots technicians and mr fletcher there were eight of us however and we got it out of the aircraft in an hour of sweat in that hot humid place and carried it all to a store i had a talk with beebs and fletcher then about the future operations of the service and we went down to darwin in a car and had beer and lunch with jimmie corsar the local agent for maclean airways we told him what we proposed and found as i had expected that he was keen on getting the business and saw no difficulties beebs and fletcher left to go back to the aerodrome to fly to the east alligator river in the grumman with their technicians and i went with jimmy corsar to his office and wrote a long letter to eddie maclean in alice springs then i drove back to the aerodrome it was four oclock when i got there and gujar had had the tramp refuelled and was all ready to go i think he was tired of darwin and i dont blame him however i had decided to go back by way of dilly and the strip at dilly was right up against hills and with no nightlanding equipment except paraffin flares i didnt fancy that so much in a strange place and anyway we hadnt got permission to go there i went to the control office and made a signal asking for permission to land and arranged to leave at dawn next day gujar and i had high tea in the cafј by the gates and walked round the aerodrome a bit and then we went to bed in the cabin of the tramp as we had done before we took oft for dilly about halfpast six next morning we crossed the timor sea to the north end of timor skirted the mountains and flew westwards down the north coast till we came to dilly a pretty little tropical town on a white coral beach with mountains behind much damaged by the japanese the strip was right up against the town and fairly short but we got down without difficulty as we had no load and taxied to park outside the hangars we stayed in dilly with the australian consul for a day the governor and all the portuguese officials were kind and cooperative but they had a regular storm in a teacup vendetta on hand with the dutch in indonesia and relations were very strained it seemed that the colony had one ship the bottom of which was dying of old age so they had sent it for repair to the dutch naval dockyard at sourabaya the dutch had estimated a high price for the job and had demanded that the whole estimated cost of the repair was to be paid in united states dollars before they would begin if there was any change they would give it back in dubious indonesian guilders the ship was in no condition to go anywhere else and in dilly the governor was furious he maintained communication with portugal by flying his air mail to koepangand sending it to portugal by the dutch air line his angry comments about the ship stung the dutch to retaliate by refusing to handle his airmail accordingly he was now flying his mail to darwin and sending it by boac and in this far corner of the world there was almost a complete diplomatic rupture between the portuguese and the dutch probably their governments in europe knew nothing about it i liked dilly although the strip wasnt very good for the operation of a large heavilyladen aircraft in the heat of the day the takeoff might be dicey the chance of political trouble however was more than i could face my aircraft would have to enter and clear customs whenever they passed from indonesia to timor or vice versa and if those two were at each others throats my aeroplanes might feature as pawns in a quarrel that was no concern of mine regretfully i washed out dilly and took off for koepang in dutch indonesian territory at the other end of timor koepang had a good airstrip but it was ruled entirely by the military and garrisoned by troops at that time the dutch were conducting a fullscale war against the indonesians in java and sumatra punctuated by somewhat dilatory truces and negotiations i broached my business to the military commander of the aerodrome a colonel rockel but when i told him that my pilots would be asiatics and i wanted to station asiatic ground engineers with a spare engine and stores on the airstrip he turned sullen and obstructive he said that the airstrip was only nominally a civil one because it was used by the internal services of klm and that only the smallest aircraft with limited range ever used it nowadays for flying to australia in consequence there would be continual difficulties over customs he said that he could not agree to have my asiatics in the dutch military zone that he commanded without reference to his superiors in batavia who would probably seek guidance from the hague this didnt look so good it was just possible that we might force our way in there but there would never be cooperation and there would always be the risk that we might be turned out of koepang at any time for military reasons the dutch in indonesia at that time were troubled and a little bitter with the world pursuing a policy that they sincerely believed to be right they were badgered by well meant advice from uno and infuriated by criticism from india the civil administrators seemed to stand this strain better than the soldiers after an hours discussion with colonel rockel i could see little future for my service in koepang and we took off at dawn next day for bali bali was totally different the strip is a good one on a narrow isthmus of land between two very beautiful bays it was long enough for anything we wanted and no high ground near it so that you could approach it in bad weather by flying along the coast at a hundred feet until you got there to my delight i saw a very large hangar by the strip with a roof in good condition i studied this as we went round on the circuit and pointed it out to gujar singh who elevated one thumb we found on landing that this hangar had been put there by the japanese navy during the war it was big enough to take a carrier or a tramp but it was seldom used and normally was only occupied by the governors auster we landed and taxied to the airport building and stopped the engines a young dutchman in clean whites came out to meet us a cheerful young man called voorn he said he was the airport manager and klm representative he was very pleased to see us because at that time his service only came to bali twice a week and so good a chap found spare time heavy on his hands he said there were no military on the aerodrome and very few soldiers in bali at all he didnt want to see our passports and had only a casual interest in our papers when we asked about customs he said that the customs officer lived in den pasar the chief town of the island ten miles to the north and he would invite him to the hotel for a drink that night this looked good and we went into the airport building and had a fresh lime squash and broached our business to mr voorn he saw no difficulties at all bali he said was an island run by the dutch administration purely for the benefit of the asiatics living there it was a happy and a prosperous place that imported little and exported less the balance of payments was made up by what the dutch in indonesia spent when they came to this delightful place on leave he thought that there would be no objection at all to the presence of a few asiatic engineers upon the aerodrome in fact he said we should probably be offered a contract to maintain the governors auster he was interested in our colour troubles but assured us that we should find nothing of that sort in bali perhaps because the girls were so attractive and the people so friendly he drove us into the hotel in den pasar i had heard vague stories of bali from time to time in my travels about the east i had not known it was so beautiful the island itself was beautiful a place of palm trees and ricefields and white coral beaches and a great volcanic mountain in the middle the people were peacable and friendly and very artistic so that every beam of every house was carved and ornamented and stone carvings were everywhere i found later that they had a deep religious sense and spent a good part of their lives in that good place where food was easy to come by in prayers and temple festivals but their religion was a form of degenerate hinduism unworthy of their sincerity the women i found were normally beautiful and attractive and they frequently went naked to the waist though they were very careful not to show their legs the most attractive of them went about in this way in the home but when they went out shopping they would usually have a shawl of some sort to put round themselves if they saw a stranger or someone they didnt like i thought bali was a grand place so did gujar singh we met one or two of the dutch officials of the administration during the afternoon serious competent people whose one concern was for the welfare of the people of the island they went into our proposals with some care but they raised no obstacles i think they welcomed the idea of an australian aeroplane coming to the island now and then because at that time consumer goods were very short in indonesia and small things such as thermos flasks and electric torches which mean so much in the east were almost unobtainable we were taken to call upon the governor that evening and received his approval of the proposals next morning we had a detailed talk with a dutchman called bergen who seemed to be the second in command and fixed with him the rentals of the hangar and the landing fees i should have liked to stay in bali and rest there for a time but the demurrage on a tramp is a heavy charge and i had to go on i told bergen that i would come out with the first series flight and stay ten days and go back on the next machine in order to see the engineers settled in and the show running smoothly we went down to the aerodrome about midday and had a last look round the hangar then we took off again and flew through to batavia and spent the night there and flew on next morning to diento to pick up a small return load for bahrein we got back to bahrein three days later and i went into a huddle with gujar singh and connie that evening they just wont have us in australia i told connie too bad but thats the way it is and then i told him about bali and about maclean airways who do you think of sending out there he asked presently what about chai tai foong i asked he was the chinese ground engineer who had been with connie and dwight schafter at damrey phong he had been with us for two years or more and he had come on a lot i always reckoned him in my own mind as second in command upon the ground staff he nodded hed be all right hes got an arab wife here i dont know about that it was a point that i had missed when talking to the dutch administrators at bali whether foreign asiatic wqmen would be acceptable i shouldnt think thered be much difficulty i said slowly ill write and ask if thered be any objection find out first though if hell go and if he wants to take her i suggested that we should send a young egyptian called abdul with chai tai foong but connie said they would quarrel he preferred a siamese that we had with us whose name was phinit that was a better choice as it turned out the siamese are a gentle and artistic people and phinit was mentally much closer to the balinese than abdul would have been he was unmarried so that complication didnt arise i left it to connie to put the matter to these two and then to bring them in to see me in the office it was dark by the time all that was finished and i couldnt get hold of mr johnson at the arabiasumatran office i had to see him soon to find out how he reacted to the whole idea of transfer to an australian machine at bali it might well be that he would wash out the whole thing and give the contract to a british company with a white staff the cost did not mean a great deal to them i worried over this a lot that night as luck would have it a cable came in that night from maclean in alice springs i was in bed in the radio operators chummery where i still had my room the operator on duty saw it was important and sent it over to me by a boy in it maclean gave me his quotation for the return trip of a dakota once a fortnight between bali and east alligator river it was exactly what i wanted i got up and went over to the office on the aerodrome and stayed there for two hours revising my quotations to the arabiasumatran cutting everything as close down as i dared when id finished i still had a figure that was about fifteen per cent lower than anything my white competitors were likely to quote for the whole journey from bahrein to the east alligator and i went to bed moderately happy about the job i was over at the office bright and early next morning and when nadezna came in i had the new quotation ready for her to type out she ran through it in half an hour and i rang up mr johnson and by nine oclock i was in his office showing him the new figures and telling him all about it he had already had a cable from fletcher at east alligator river telling him about the difficulties and he wasnt at all happy about changing airlines at bali he was afraid quite reasonably that one or other of the aircraft wouldnt be there on time and so his men and loads would get hung up at bali theres worse places to be stranded at than bali remarked he glanced at me ive never been there ive heard that its a very lovely island it is i said it breaks my heart to think you wont see much of itnot travelling this way i turned more serious youre absolutely right i said there is a danger of a holdup there what i propose doing if you go on with this is to go to australia and either form a new white company to do this last leg or take a financial interest in macleans show if i can ill have to get control of that last leg he grunted its just possible that we might operate it ourselves from the east alligator river he wouldnt say yes or no to the new scheme at that meeting he said that he wanted to talk it over with his colleagues and hed telephone me later in the day i went back to the aerodrome worried and anxious wondering if my ј contract had gone down the drain i roamed about restless and irritable in and out of the office and the hangar unable to settle to anything or attend to anything i had a miserable day so did everybody else in the party at about four oclock in the afternoon johnson came on the phone he said they had decided to try the service in the way that i suggested in cooperation with maclean airways he said that i must have escape clauses to the contract enabling us to get rid of maclean if he was late at bali and he wanted to see me about that he wanted to talk to me again about the possibility that they should operate a dakota themselves for the last white leg of the journey he suggested i should come and see them next morning and he said they wanted to start the service on a six months basis with a flight leaving upon thursday week in nine days time i put down the telephone and i was so relieved i could have wept it was all right after all nadezna had been standing by my desk she had come in while i was talking and was waiting to say something to me major hereward is here waiting to see you she said shall i bring him in even the liaison officer couldnt worry me at the moment show him in i said lookslip over to the hangar then and find your brother and gujar tell them its all okayjohnson has accepted the bali scheme and maclean airways ill be over there as soon as ive found out what this chap wants she smiled at me radiant perhaps it was my own relief that made her look like that im just terribly glad its all come out all right she said my god i remarked with feeling so am i she brought in major hereward and i got up to greet him good afternoon i said im sorry to have kept you waiting but i had someone on the phone i offered him a cigarette but he refused it im afraid that what ive come to tell you may be rather unwelcome mr cutter he said its about your man shak lin we feel up at the residency that the influence that he is building up here is quite undesirable and could even be dangerous i see i said the sun seemed suddenly to have gone in its very unwise to play about with religious matters in this country he said seriously ive been here twentyfive years and i know a new sect makes a schism and in this country schisms may break out into an open riot any time im afraid we cannot tolerate a british subject who gains influence in this country by starting a new sect there doesnt seem to be much harm in it i said dully well thats for us to judge mr cutter shak lin is a british subject and youre a british subject and in this im afraid youll have to do what we decide i was silent youll have to get rid of him cutter he said not unkindly im very sorry about it and so is the resident but shak lins got to go god be thy guide from camp to camp god be thy shade from well to well god grant beneath the desert stars thou hear the prophets camel bell james elroy flecker major hereward was adamant that connie had to leave the persian gulf he said that i could see the resident if i liked but it was obvious that they had made their minds up he made it pretty clear too that if they had any trouble with me theyd kick me out too they didnt seem to have a lot of use for any of us and yet i think wed done a useful job while we were there perhaps it would have been better if id gone into the officers mess as i could have done long before i should have got invited to the residency parties then and got alongside them more perhaps i had stuck too closely to the job using his own words i told him that what he proposed raised rather large issues maybe i shall wind the business up i said the chief engineer is a key man in a thing like this in any case im not going to decide anything tonight i may go to london and talk it over with your people there mr shaklin has done nothing but talk a very harmless and sincere form of religion not christian he said no i replied not christian does that make a difference he shrugged his shoulders i cant enter into that where british subjects are concerned one expects christianity however mr cutter there it is i dont want to upset your business unduly but i want shak lin out of this district within a fortnight we cant have him here any longer than that he got up to go i got up with him i understand what you want ill think it over and let you know what im going to do he went out and got into his car and drove away i went back to my chair and flopped down into it tired and depressed nadezna came back from the hangar presently and found me sitting so staring idly at the pad in front of me wondering with a dulled brain what i was going to do she said theyre all very pleased gujar was asking if youre going on the next bali trip yourself or if you want arjan singh to go with him or what i could not take in what she was saying whats that i asked she looked at me curiously and repeated the question arjannoi dont know i said ill have to think about it is anything the matter she asked i shook my head i wanted time to think about things before spilling them to anyone ill be going off in a minute if youve got the letters ill sign them now i think it was on that day that my business stopped being fun up till then it had been a game to me i had made money out of it it is true but this had been a paper profit that i had seen nothing of i was still the same tom cutter living with the radio operators as i had been when first i came to bahrein in the foxmoth i had no more goods no better clothes or food than in those days figures on white typescript sheets might say that i was worth thirty thousand pounds or so and it was just like any other fiction to me as unreal as a page in a novel no rollsroyce had yet come my way i drove a dodge station wagon that i had bought in the first year the only difference in my life was that i had more work even than in those early days and larger aeroplanes to play with and it had been play it was a game to all of us in those first years a game that we all played together as a team we had all been of the same mind i think the fun that we had had in working the thing up together and had been the real essence of it now it seemed the team was to be broken up and we should go on one man short fun is a delicate flower that doesnt stand up very well to changes of that sort you cant play about with fun you can kill fun very easily as easily as you can kill a wife i didnt sleep much that night towards morning i gave up the idea of going to london to argue with the foreign office they would only take the advice of their officials on the spot i had no prestige no influence or reputation that would weigh against the vagaries of these foolish people i was just tom cutter exground engineer who made too much money to please civil servants if i had been sir thomas cutter bart deep in debt and divorced three times i might have commanded some attention in official circles but as just plain tom cutter i hadnt got a hope connie would have to go to bali and set up the party there and chai tai foong must take command of the ground staff at bahrein in his place connie and phinit to bali i reached that conclusion towards dawn and dozed a little then thinking unhappily of what i had to say to connie and how gujar singh would react and all the rest of the party dont like stalling when theres anything unpleasant to be done i walked over to the hangar soon after the men came in at halfpast seven and called connie out on to the tarmac look old boy i said as soon as i got him out of earshot of the others were in for trouble im afraid he faced me smiling gently he had a wonderful smile that sort of comforted you his sister had it a bit too i know he said they want to get rid of me thats it i suppose youve heard about it then he nodded the imam came and told me a couple of days ago thats what major hereward came up about last night how did the imam get to know about it he shrugged his shoulders still smiling the bush telegraph works very well here in bahrein far better than the residency know those bloody fools i said bitterly ive been trying to think of some way out of this and i cant think of one dont let it trouble you he said i know its going to be a setback to the business but its no injury to me its time that i went on in any case ive been here long enough its good of you to take it that way i said i dont believe you but its nice of you to say it i dont believe you meant to make a change no he said thoughtfully i wouldnt have left you just as you wouldnt leave us but ive done all i can in this place and i should go on we strolled into the shade of the hangar for the sun was getting hot already ive been wondering if youd care to start up bali for me i said let chai tai foong go on here in your place and you go down to bali with phinit theres not a lot of work there im afraid but its all ive got to offer he smiled again that wonderful comforting smile ill go there he said id like to go somewhere for a bit now where theres time to think things out bali is what i should have asked for if you had suggested any change before this happened its no injury to me to go there he paused and then he said theres only one person damaged by this nonsense i glanced at him whos that you im not damaged i said nothings happened to me nothing that you cant ride over he said because you were born a valiant and courageous man and you can take hard blows but you were going to sell this business werent you i did think of it i said i gave up the idea he nodded and with it you gave up england and wealth and an easy life in a beautiful place and love and the children that you long for you gave up all these things and came back to the persian gulf why did you do that i stared at him how did you know all this he smiled gently youre thinking ive got second sight he said i havent your mother told gujar singh about these things and he told me i stared out along the tarmac of the runway already shimmering in oily waves of heat it didnt seem to be a very good idea to sell the business after all i said one does what one thinks is for the best you thought it for the best to give up all the delights of the world and come back to this hot barren place of difficulties and insults he observed why did you do that you hardheaded man did you do it for penance i dont know i said if i did ive got plenty to do penance for so have all men he replied but all men dont do it i dont know that im doing it either i said as regards selling the business i very nearly did sell it i only rejected the idea on final inspection half a thou too small he said the difference between right and wrong half a thou bigger and itld be right as it is its wrong and you cant cheat about it he smiled again too bad when god gives you the mind of an inspector isnt it i laughed youd better get into the hangar if youre going to talk that sort of stuff he smiled i shant talk my beliefs here very much longer when do you want me to go im laying on the first flight down to bali on thursday week provided maclean airways can play at such short notice i told him will you and phinit come with me on that i shall take arjan as pilot so that he can learn the route he nodded ill tell phinit i stood staring out across the wide expanses of the airfield to the sea revolving all the problems in my mind theres your sister i said i suppose shell go with you he glanced at me youd like to keep her here wouldnt yon thats all right i said i can get along without her no he said i think youll need her i think shed better stay here i hadnt got the heart to combat that one if nadezna went with connie as was only fair and reasonable my office and my works would be disorganised at the same time its all very well for you to talk like that i said nadeznas got a mind of her own she wont want to stay here alone with you in bali about five thousand miles away ill have a talk with her he said you didnt run out on us i dont see why she should run out on you dont force her to stay here if she doesnt want to i said i dont want anybody in the party whos unwilling he smiled i think shell want to stay i dont think youll find that shes unwilling we stood in silence for a time for there was nothing else to say i broke it at last i think id like to get the carriers engine change done before you go i said give chai tai foong a break when he starts off i dont want to land a big job like that on him in the first month he nodded i was thinking that myself youll send the pair thats in her now to almaza we talked about the details of the engine overhaul for a few minutes hard simple facts that were so easy to discuss then i turned to go back to the office he strolled a few steps with me the residency want me to go because theyre afraid i may make trouble i suppose thats what they said i replied the cockeyed bloody fools i should never make any trouble he remarked but they will i stood for a moment in thought will there be trouble in the souk because youve been kicked out not while im here he said definitely but after i have gone there may be trouble some of them will miss me i shrugged my shoulders thats just one of those things if there should be any trouble he said see that some fool of an officer doesnt go and close the aerodrome with an armed guard they may want to come up here to say their prayers i laughed shortly ill do what i can but whether ill get major hereward to see it from that angle i dont know i went back to the office and drafted a long cable to eddie maclean aboilt the dakota that he was to send to bali in the following week to meet us there i was too worried to settle down to office work and so i went out to the tarmac where hosein was just about to take off in an airtruck for el haura with six lorry wheels fitted with new tyres and two truck radiators and put him out of it and flew the machine myself its good to have something physical to do when youre a bit worried i spent the middle of the day with the repair gang at el haura and flew back in the evening with an air compressor set that had got sand where no sand ought to be i landed shortly before dark and handed the machine over to connie and went into the office nadezna was still there waiting for me she had one or two minor matters for me notices to ground engineers and information circulars i glanced them over okay i said to her you can get off now no need to wait she hesitated i wanted to see you mr cutter ive been talking to my brother sit down then i dropped into my chair myself hes told you about everything i think so hes told me that hes got to go to bali thats right i said im sorry about that but its the only thing to do youd like to go with him i expect wouldnt you she shook her head ill stay here while youve got a job for me i thought the only reason you came out here was to be with him i know it and now hes got to move on when ive only been here a month but all the same i think id rather stay here for a time at any rate if youll have me i smiled at her ill have you all right but are you sure you wouldnt rather be with your brother she shook her head ive got a job to do here and im getting interested in it in bali id have nothing to do at all its not as if i shall be out of touch with connie either therell be machines going and coming to bali all the time from now on wont there ohyes i said once a fortnight certainly and probably more often if he got ill or anything could i go to him on one of the trips of course you can get on one of the machines and go and see him any time you like the weight wont make any odds she smiled in that case ill stay here a point that had been worrying me all through the day while i was flying came back to my mind when your brother goes where are you going to live ill go on where i am she said will that be all right i asked uneasily i suppose after all that time i still had something of an englishmans dislike and fear of the native quarter of an eastern town surely she said gently i live in a house owned by a very respectable old man mutluq bin aamir hes a silk merchant hes a great devotee of connie and he knew my father and gujar singh lives only just across the way youll be all right there living alone after your brothers gone of course she said smiling a little i should never come to any harm down there if she was happy about going on there alone i didnt see that i could raise any objection moreover i didnt know of anywhere else where she could live any better i asked her how are you for arabic can you get along without your brother she nodded im learning it i can ask for all the ordinary things now and anyway lots of the people know a little english really i shall be quite all right you dont have to worry about me i couldnt press it any more well of course ill be very glad if you can stay i said i sat in silence for a minute its going to be a big loss when your brother goes i said quietly things have gone very smoothly under him and under you she said i mean in the hangar ive had nothing much to do with the ground engineers since he came i know she said but under you he has been able to teach people in his own way when connie started talking his religion over the fiftyhour schedules and the daily inspections not everybody would have allowed it to go on you must have been very puzzled sometimes yes i said i was because you saw virtue in his way of teaching engineers to do their work you let him go on in his own way although it was not an english or an american way if the results are good a share in it is yours she paused his way has spread a long long way from here and may spread farther engineers worship in the hangar in his way in rangoon and bangkok in karachi and in abadan she paused again and then repeated and it may go further there was a long silence what is this thing nadezna i asked at last is it a new religion what is a religion i was silent i couldnt answer that one as i see it she said thoughtfully its a way of life that brings men to worship through their work who wouldnt worship in the oldfashioned way if thats what a religion is i suppose this is one but does it matter what we call it i shook my head the only thing is to accept it and just see what happens after all there isnt any harm in it no harm at all she said only a lot of good there was a tension in bahrein in those last days before we left for bali i wrote a note to major hereward telling him what i proposed to do and i got a short and not unfriendly reply in acknowledgment i did not see him again before we left and nor did connie on the friday connie asked for a proctor to go over to the sheikh of khulal at baraka and gujar flew him over nothing seemed to happen as a result of that years later gujar singh told me that the visit had averted a major clash between the sheikh and the resident and johnson of the arabiasumatran once hinted at the same thing but at the time i knew nothing of all that there were more worshippers than ever at the sunset prayers outside the hangar in those last few days each evening more bus loads of men arrived from the souk and the surrounding district on the last evening before we took oil for bali there must have been nearly five hundred people there including the imam who led the rakats i know i counted eleven buses parked by the roadside and some of them had made more than one journey many of these people were what in bahrein would pass as intellectuals grave whitebearded old men in flowing arab clothes but with them there were men who had to do with things mechanical every taxidriver and every truckdriver in the district must have been there and men from the waterworks and from the refineries and from the electrical power station we had a failure of the power supply that night there was no demonstration and no sign of any emotion they came and lined up for their prayers outside the hangar with the imam leading in the motions of the rakats they went through it all as i had seen them do so many times before only now there were far more of them none of them seemed to pay any attention to connie and the other nonmoslems kneeling apart and after it was over they went back to their buses and got into them the engines started up and the old vehicles moved off there were no speeches no farewells no protests or debate watching this from a distance i was vaguely uneasy it seemed unnatural that if they loved him well enough to come out of the town to pray with him they should go so quietly it didnt seem right to me but then i reflected i knew nothing really about the east we loaded up the tramp before dawn next day there were eleven great metal rods that i was told were drills each about six inches in diameter and nine feet long swathed in sacking these weighed together about four tons there were five passengers from the arabiasumatran one of whom was getting off in central burma and two at diento the other two were going through to the east alligator river with the drills then there was arjan singh as pilot and myself as copilot and connie and phinit travelling with us to bali all told we had a pretty full load even for a tramp we took off for karachi with the first light and i left everything to arjan singh only flying the machine myself while he was at the navigators table the route eastwards was becoming a wellworn track to me by that time but my pilots had flown it less frequently and i was anxious for them to get in the maximum experience we went up to about ten thousand feet in dusty air conditions so that it was difficult to see the ground or sea except immediately below and navigated by radio we got fixes from bahrein and sharjah till we were well past bandar abbas and soon after that we picked up the broadcasting station at karachi and began to home on that getting a few cross bearings from jiwani as we passed we began to lose height when we were half an hour out from karachi the dust haze was quite thick and arjan had to be on the job of piloting the whole time to help him i relieved him of the radio work and picked up the microphone and called the airport to announce our arrival in their zone karachi tower this is george able nan how victor from bahrein eta one one five zero zebra over a highpitched pakistani voice speaking clipped english acknowledged the call and cleared us into the zone i laid the microphone down and told arjan i kept the headphones on and the set going on a listening watch and a couple of minutes later they came through again george able nan how victor this is karachi tower said the control officer his english was not very easy to understand is on board your aircraft over i could not get the missing words and asked him to repeat this time he spoke more clearly and distinctly is mr shak lin on board your aircraft karachi tower i said roger shak lin is on board how victor roger thank you out one cannot ask questions about nonessential matters on the radio and it was difficult to understand the control officer on any but the standard routine calls i sat wondering uneasy for a few minutes then i passed the microphone to arjan and got out of my seat and went down the ladder to the cabin and to connie seated behind the load karachi tower have just asked if you were on board i said are they expecting you he shook his head not that i know of well i observed they are somebody must have got on the blower from bahrein he said he meant the radio telephone that connects the aerodromes all down the eastern route the operators are talking to each other all the time i nodded thought youd like to know thanks i went back to the cockpit and slipped into my seat again arjan knew the karachi district very well and found the airship hangar without difficulty in the thick haze and we got cleared for landing as we passed down wind and put down on the one long runway and taxied to the control tower as we swung round into wind and stopped the engines i saw brown men in overalls running towards us down the tarmac from the hangars i pointed them out to arjan singh he nodded i think they know that shak lin is with us i slipped down into the cabin and went first to the door when i opened it the first man i saw was salim the pakistani ground engineer who had been with us at bahrein and who had left to take a job with sind airways here in karachi i said hullo salim how goes it i am very well mr cutter thank you he replied mr cutter is shak lin with you hes here i said do you want to see him oh yes many many people here want to see him i got out of the machine dont keep him too long salim i said weve got to go on as soon as weve refuelled im going through to ahmedabad today may we have one hour he said there was a considerable crowd behind him now brown men in oilstained overalls and more were coming up it is important to us mr cutter just one hour it would take us most of that time to get refuelled and get the necessary clearances from the control i glanced at my watch all right my watch was all wrong of course and i glanced at the airport clock and then there was a low murmur from the crowd and several of the men touched their foreheads i turned and connie was standing behind me in the door i said connie i want to take off in about an hour lets say three oclock local time by that clock salim here wants you he nodded okay i shall be ready he got out of the aircraft and went away towards the hangars with salim and the crowd and from the airport building officials in blue uniforms customs officers perhaps or busdrivers came out and went with them making a small stream of people down the tarmac in the brilliant sun the shell refuelling truck arrived and arjan singh gave them the instructions and we left phinit in charge and went up to the control office with the documents and log books i knew the controller slightly from previous visits he was a lean brown pakistani who had been in the royal indian air force in the war his name was khalil he smiled when he saw me and i offered him a cigarette and we smoked together while arjan got on with the job with one of his assistants he asked you are taking off again at once in an hour my chief engineer is with me mr shak lin and they want to see him in the hangar was i speaking to you about him on the r t not to me personally he said but i passed the message the men down there especially those working for sind airways wanted to know very much if he was coming they know about him here do they he smiled oh yes they know about him we call his method here the new maintenance it seems to be a system which maintains an aeroplane according to ethical principles so far as i can understand it is that right im blowed if i know i said my men have all been very devout since shak lin came to work for me and the maintenance has been firstclass ive let it go at that that is what the managing director of sind airways tells me that the men have become devout and the work has greatly improved he hesitated some of my staff go down sometimes to the hangar for the sunset prayers and though he would not admit it to an infidel like me i knew that he was telling me that he was in the habit of going himself i think it is a very good thing i think it is i said i left arjan singh to get the met report and clearances for ahmedabad and went down to the restaurant for a quick meal there was a chap there called harrison who had been a pilot in almaza during the war he was working for a small charter company operating from bombay now i knew him slightly and went over to talk to him my word cutter he said your ges have started something havent they i dont interfere with what they do i said if asiatics like to say their prayers its not for us to try and stop it all going round the bend if you ask me he said you cant get a thing done up here until theyve said a prayer or two and now its starting in bombay i came in yesterday in a commuter and she was missing a bit on the front bank so i took her into sind airways for a plug change it was like being in a bloody church did they do the plug change all right oh they did that they found one or two cowling cracks too that our lazy muggers down in bombay hadnt noticed theyre quite a good crowd in sind airways if it wasnt for all this religious nonsense i think theyve come on a lot lately connie did not keep me waiting he came back down the tarmac punctually at the end of the hour with a crowd of forty or fifty engineers tagging along behind him as he walked with salim there was no ceremony and no trouble as he got into the machine he paused in the door and looked back at them with that wonderful smile he had and then he was lost to their view in the cabin the rest of us got in and shut the door and arjan and i got up into the cockpit and started up the engines and taxied out for the takeoff to ahmedabad we stopped there for the night and took off next day just before dawn landing for fuel at calcutta about midday nothing much happened there and we took off again for rangoon after an hour and flew down the coast of arakan past akyab and ramree in the evening passing sandoway i went down into the cabin to talk to connie i squatted down beside him on the load im nightstopping at mingadon i said we shall find u myin there probably he nodded hes with bna hell want to see you i paused do you know anything about an old man called u set tahn the english monk thats right i said u myin took me to see him once if hes alive still hell be very anxious to meet you i was wondering how this would be were nightstopping tonight at mingadon and going up to yenanyaung tomorrow with this chap whos getting off there and picking up two more bodies for diento im reckoning to be back at mingadon tomorrow night and on to diento next day fuelling at penang would you like to have a day off in rangoon theres no sense in you coming with us to yenanyaung unless you want to he said id like that if youre sure you wont need me id like to meet u set tahn i shant need you i said theres quite a bit going on here in your line u myins introduced a lot of your ideas from what i can make out have a talk with the chief engineer moung bah too if you can manage it hes a very good type i went back to the cockpit to my job we cut in over the arakan yoma at a point just south of sandowy and made for rangoon across the irrawaddy delta the sun set before we came in sight of the city and we put down at mingadon airfield in the dusk and taxied to a parking place we spent the night at the rest house upon the aerodrome i left connie in the rest house when i got my party out at four in the morning for a cup of coffee in the restaurant and a dawn takeoff for yenanyaung its only an hours flight or so and we landed in time for breakfast i could have got back to mingadon by noon and gone on to bangkok that day but i didnt want to hurry connie in his conference with u set tahn and i had promised him the day i stalled a bit at yenanyaung and was glad when one of the passengers asked if he had time to go to the head office there so we stayed there on the airstrip all the morning and had lunch from what we carried with us in the aircraft and took off for rangoon at about one oclock and landed back at mingadon in the middle of the afternoon as we taxied in i could see there was a considerable crowd on the tarmac round the entrance to the burmese national airways hangar there seemed to be a rope barrier keeping a clear space upon the tarmac in front of the building we parked the aircraft and i sent my passengers to the rest house and set to work with arjan singh and phinit to get the tramp refuelled and ready for the morning i sent phinit to make contact with the fuel manager and get the petrol bowser up to the machine he came back presently without it no driver he said drivers and fuel men all over at the hangar listen to shak lin manager says in one hour will that do it would have to shak lins over there now is he he nodded many pongyis there too very holy men he hesitated may i go there was little for him to do till the bowser came all right find the bowser driver and bring him back here in an hours time he went running off to join the crowd i finished cleaning up the aircraft with arjan and then twenty minutes later i strolled down myself to see what was going on at the bna hangar there was an old anson parked outside it connie was standing up upon the wing of this and talking to the crowd there were several pongyis monks in the yellow robe standing by the wing and in one of them i recognised the old man i had visited in his ashram u set tahn at one time colonel maurice spencer of the rasc i stood on the outskirts of the crowd but they were so massed i could not hear what he was saying he was speaking in english i could hear that much and in the crowd of karens and burmese and chinese and indians there was a good deal of whispered translation going on which made a low hubbub drowning of all but a few sentences of what he was saying he was impressive standing up there on the anson wing speaking quietly with that wonderful smile he had i had not seen him quite like that before looking up at him silhouetted against the sky it struck me suddenly how very thin he had become he had always been a lean man but now and from that point of view he looked almost emaciated it was a good thing perhaps that he had left the persian gulf for the milder and more generous climate of the isle of bali two years of the desert seemed to have taken a good deal out of him i wondered vaguely if it had not taken a good deal out of me i couldnt hear and so i turned away and walked around outside the crowd on the other side of the anson i met moung bah too the chief engineer of the air line he recognised me and came towards me with a smile im sorry about this i said quietly indicating connie on the anson wing it seems to have stopped work a bit he shook his head i allowed it we heard that shak lin was to come through here four days ago and i arranged a holiday we are treating it as a duty day he meant as if it was a sunday he paused it is a great honour he said quietly he is a very wonderful man ive only just come up i replied what has he been talking about he said he took as his thesis the mingalathut our sermon on the beatitudes he said he took the words to the buddha in the list of the blessed things that a man ought to hear and see much in order to acquire knowledge and of study all science that leads not to sin he has been saying that in studying the stresses and the forces in the structure of an aircraft the thermodynamics of an engine or the flow of current in the oscillating circuits of a radio transmitter we are but following the injunctions of gautama who said expressly that we were to learn these things the world is full of suffering and pain caused by our wrong desires and hatreds and illusions and only knowledge can remove these causes of our suffering he paused he listened for a moment please forgive me he said it may be years before he comes this way again and he left me and pressed through the crowd towards the anson i stood on the outskirts of the crowd and listened and for a few sentences i could hear him plainly you know that aeroplanes do not crash of themselves he was saying you are intelligent men you do not think there is a jealous god who stretches out a peevish hand to take an aeroplane and throw it to the ground aeroplanes come to grief because of wrong cravings and wrong hatreds and illusions in mens hearts one of you may say i have notgot the key to the filler of the oil tank i cannot find it i looked yesterday and there was plenty of oil it is probably all right today so accidents are born and pain and suffering and grief come to mankind because of the sloth of men his voice was lost in the murmurs of the crowd it was the same message that he had preached so often in the hangar at bahrein that the maintenance of aeroplanes demanded men of a pure and holy life men who would turn from the temptations of the flesh to serve their calling first here the message was transmuted into terms of buddhism but it was the same set of ideas that good work and good living were one and indivisible i turned away and strolled back to the tramp deep in thought it seemed to me that connie had done something quite remarkable he had gained support for his ideas both from the imams of the persian gulf and from the pohgyis of rangoon he had succeeded in impressing both moslems and buddhists with the same message true it was all coloured by the fact that he was talking to the men who maintained aircraft whose profession made a bond of internationalism which might transcend the narrower boundaries of their religion but all the same it seemed to me to be a remarkable achievement i wondered if he would make his mark upon the degenerate hinduism of bali after a time the meeting broke up and presently phinit came with the bowser and we refuelled the tramp when that was over i went back with phinit and arjan singh to the rest house there was a small crowd of burmese around the veranda and the door of connies room was closed squatting outside it was u myin the burmese lad that we had found at damrey phong i greeted him evening u myin i said is shak lin inside he got to his feet the teacher is very tired and he must i rest may i go and speak to him he hesitated and then stood aside and opened the door for me connie was lying stretched upon the charpoy in a short pair of pants it was very hot in the room with the door shut and he was sweating in streams so that dark patches showed upon the sheet on which he lay i noticed again how thin he had become he raised his head as i came in and then raised his body on one elbow evening he said i was just having a liedown i grinned takes it out of you i supposeall that talking a bit let me send over for a whiskya chota he shook his head i never touch it you know that i nodded have you eaten anything today he shook his head ill wait till the crowds gone and then ill slip over to the restaurant that crowds a fixture i said ill send one of the boys over for a tray theyve always got a curry there curry and rice he thanked me and got up and went across the room and had a long drink of water from the chatty i went out and spoke to u myin and phinit and u myin went to the restaurant leaving phinit to guard the door and keep the crowd away he came back presently carrying a tray covered with a white cloth a meal of curry and rice and fruit i went into connies room and saw him settled down and eating it takeoff at dawn tomorrow morning i said refuel at penang and enter the dutch indies at palembang and then to diento for the night that okay with you he nodded ive got nothing more to do here what about all those chaps outside theres one or two monks with them ill go out presently and say goodnight to them tell u myin to tell them that would you i nodded ill tell him he looked up at me smiling i sometimes think that youre a very patient man i grinned im a chap whos been operating aircraft for three years without a sniff of engine trouble i said if the price is to send for a meal of curry and rice over from the restaurant well thats okay by me we got to diento at dusk next day without incident and spent the night with those hospitable people in their tropical country club by the riverside next day we flew on we passed batavia and went on down the length of java to sourabaya and landed there to refuel then we got going again and flew to bali we landed on the airstrip there about the middle of the afternoon there was no other aircraft there but just as we were preparing to leave the strip to drive into the city den pasar a dakota appeared from the east circled once and came in to land it taxied to park by our tramp and stopped its engines i had not met eddie maclean before though we had cabled and corresponded he drove with me in to the hotel and when we had had a shower and changed our clothes we mett in the wide airy forecourt for a drink at his end everything was working out all right and he was anxious to retain the contract and prevent the arabiasumatran people from operating the service themselves i said that that was his affair he was anxious to examine my tramp and very interested to know how much it cost and he had heard a garbled tale of connie shaklin that i had to put right for him i liked him well enough and we sat for a long time together in the blue of the night in the cool forecourt of the bali hotel drinking bols and talking about aircraft and their maintenance from time to time balinese young men and girls passed by in the road talking and laughing softly together in quiet musical voices both men and women wore much the same clothes a sarong with a blouse or shirt above for they were in their best clothes now and walking oat together they seemed to me to be a very beautiful people we all went out to the aerodrome early next morning and transferred the load from the tramp to the dakota a troublesome business because each of the great drills weighed peven or eight hundred pounds it took us two hours with a gang of men to get the eleven drills out of the tramp and into the dakota and then we set to work to refuel finally maclean took off in the dakota and vanished over the island of lombok in the direction of australia and i was left upon the airstrip with connie and phinit and arjan singh i stayed two days at bali with them which was all the time that i could spare with the changes that had taken place at bahrein i had to get back there as soon as possible i could spend a week or ten days holidaying in bali as i had intended i went and called upon the dutch administrator bergen that i had met when i was there before and took connie shaklin with me and introduced him with bergen and voorn the airport manager we went back to the strip and inspected the store and workshop building that i wanted to rent built into the side of the hangar the buildings were in fair condition and the rents were not too bad and having no option in the matter i arranged to rent them there and then the next day was spent in arranging with voorn and connie the alterations that were needed we had brought with us in the tramp one spare engine and a fair assortment of tools and spares enough to carry out minor maintenance work and repairs we found a carpenter to come and work under connie to put up all the necessary racks and shelves and got that going then we had to fix up some accommodation for connie and phinit at that i must say i was a bit out of my depth they were both asiatics and though in that place of no prejudice it would have been quite possible for them to live in european style in den pasar they both declared that they preferred to live with the people in some village closer to the strip they had a point there because den pasar was ten miles from the airstrip and i had no car to leave them nor would it have been at all easy to buy one or get petrol for it in that place if they wanted to live with the balinese in asiatic style that suited the work best and suited me the major difficulty was of course the fact that they had no common language if the balinese spoke anything at all but their own tongue it would be dutch however connie made light of this point when i raised it he said that it would be an inconvenience for the first week if he could not converse with the people but after that the language would present no obstacle so we went and talked to voorn and bergen and went out that afternoon with a young man called andel from the administration office driving us in a jeep to look for somewhere for connie and phinit to live he took us to a place called pekendang a village about a mile to the south of the airstrip in the other direction to the city this village was a lovely place it was built in a grove of coconut palms a little away from a white coral beach in fact a proportion of the men were fishermen behind it ricefields stretched in terraces up the hill the village itself seemed to consist of three or four walled enclosures grouped around a temple enclosure and the high walls which surrounded these enclosures were pierced only by narrow entrances or gateways with carved limestone ornamentation i asked andel if the people put these walls up for defence he grinned defence against bad spirits he said these walls they put up to keep out the ghosts at night he stopped the jeep outside one of these gateways a man is here i think will help he said we all got out and followed him through the wall inside the wall enclosed a space about a hundred yards square the ground was of hard beaten earth and dotted about in the area were a number of singlestorey dwellings wooden structures with palm thatch roofs and walls each seemed to consist of one or two rooms the floors were raised about three feet above the earth as walls were absent on one side of each house if not on two sides the effect was that of a number of deep verandas which disclosed sleeping charpoys in the dim background this is a house temple said andel each house for one member of the family with his wife and children arranged around a central square were six or eight shrines small alcoves on masonry pedestals raised five or six feet from the ground there did not seem to be an image in any of them but a few artificial flowers of palm fronds were laid in a few of the shrines as offerings the whole area was well shaded with palm trees men and women were sitting about the men mostly working at fishing nets or carving woodwork the women weaving or cooking on open fires behind the houses or nursing their children in the confines of this family enclosure both men and women went naked to the waist in a sarong they were well developed happy people golden brown in colour going tranquilly about their daily life in the warm sun it struck me that they had achieved a better life than i had who dashed hurriedly from country to country in an aircraft pursuing god knew what they paid little attention to us except to smile as we went by andel stopped at rather a larger house apparently the home of the head of the family an old greyheaded man got up from squatting on the steps as he approached and smiled at him they talked together in balinese for a time then andel turned to us and said this is i wajan rauh rauh was the name and wajan meant first son of his father an indication of his standing in the community wajan says that the village can accommodate your friends if they have no objection to living as the people do he says they can have a room to themselves i said may we see where they would have to sleep the old man led us to another house i said to connie what about it is it a bit primitive you can live in den pasar if youd rather he said i would rather live here with these people what about you phinit the siamese boy said it is similar to how they live in my mothers village near hua hin i should be happy to live here the house that wajan showed us with a single room with one charpoy in it apparently kept for putting up a casual traveller he could produce another bed as regards food he had a daughter who would cook for the two strangers and he sent a child running for his daughter she came in a few minutes a strikinglooking smiling woman of about forty perhaps but very well preserved she was wearing only a sarong but as she had come to meet the strangers she had thrown a towel over her shoulders with the ends hanging down her back so that her firm fine breasts were partially hidden she talked to her father and to andel for a minute or two smiling and then nodded the dutchman said this is mem simpang simpang is her son balinese women take the name of their first child unless there is another to make a confusion you call her mem simpang connie repeated that and the woman nodded laughing with him he indicated himself still laughing and said shak lin she repeated it and then turned to andel and asked something he replied in the negative she asked if you have a cast he said she thinks you must be an aristocrat connie shook his head tell her were just ordinary people i will do that a little conversation ensued while a small crowd of people gathered round a girl of seventeen or eighteen with a very sweet face with a piece of cloth thrown over one shoulder and breast as a sign of good manners came and stood by mem simpang presently andel turned to us again she will provide food and cook for you he said they are asking for three guilders a day each for food and lodging i have told them that it is much too much and they should be ashamed to treat strangers so but they say you are high born people and must have the best three guilders a day is about six english shillings connie laughed and said ask her if shell take two if i help to look after the children andel translated and for some reason that sent the fine middleaged woman off into fits of laughter and the people round laughed with her andel coloured a little she has only two children he said the eldest a boy is away fishing he indicated the pleasantlooking girl this is the younger ni madй jasmi you call her madй that means second child she will probably do most of your work he paused and then he added im afraid you will find that these people have a very broad sense of humour mr shak lin connie said most country people have in all parts of the world tell her that we will pay three guilders and madй shall look after us we went back through the houses to the wall entrance having made arrangements for connie and phinit to get their gear and move in next day passing the open space with the shrines connie said they are hindus arent they andel said of a sort i do not think that indians would recognise much of their religion in what these people do it is a very complicated religion mr shaklin there are over forty thousand temples in bali and each has a festival two or three times a year the people here spend most of their spare time in going to festivals or making up offerings to take to the next one they are very devout and yet i do not think they really know what their religion is about certainly i dont connie said quietly it will be interesting to learn about it andel said you will learn plenty about it as soon as you can talk to them because their whole life centres round the temple festivals they are a very religiousminded people as we drove off in the jeep i wondered uneasily what would come of putting connie down to live in such a place as that next morning arjan singh and i took off in the tramp for diento on our way back to bahrein we left connie and phinit to get on with it and set up the small maintenance base i had planned i left a credit at the bank for him and told him not to economise too much on cables it would pay us to know what his requirements were before the next trip left bahrein to come to him we got to diento that day after a stop at batavia for formalities and fuel we loaded up with about a ton and a half of machinery and three passengers for yenanyaung and made rangoon next evening after one stop at penang at yenanyaung next day we picked up five passengers and two tons of load for bahrein and got back to mingadon by dinner time refuelled and made calcutta for the night next day took us to karachi where we nightstopped before going on to bahrein we stopped outside the airport building at karachi and arjan went up to the control office to do his stuff there i went and fixed up accommodation for my passengers in the airport hotel then i had to move the tramp because it was in the way of other aircraft and i got in and started it up and taxied it down the tarmac past the hangars to its parking place for the night it was evening by then and after sunset i was very tired we had flown and worked continuously for four days since leaving bali and even in so wellequipped an aircraft that can be a strain i stopped the engines and locked the controls there were things i should have done that night but it was nearly dark and all the jobs could wait till we were fuelling at dawn i got down from the cockpit into the big empty fuselage and walked down to the door and got down on to the tarmac locking the door after me there was a man waiting for me by the tailplane he came towards me and i saw that it was salim the lad who had worked for us at one time and was now with sind airways he came forward and said good evening mr cutter evening salim i said how goes it i am very well mr cutter he said mr shak lin he has not come back with you no hes staying down in bali for a time i said hes looking after things for us there he was silent then he said mr cutter you heard about the trouble in bahrein i turned to him quickly i havent heard of anything has something happened there they say there has been fighting in the souk he said much trouble very much trouble it is because the teacher has been sent away nadezna lived in the souk but gujar singh lived near surely he would have been looking after her what happened in the souk salim an english officer was stoned he said they say he was very badly hurt he would have been killed but the sister was there who was this english officer it was the liaison officer from the residency major hereward i dont know the name it was the liaison officer the people of bahrein say it was because of him that the teacher was sent away and so they stoned him and then the raf stopped men from going to the hangar by a guard and when the people came the guard fired but they fired into the air and the people went on and said their rakats at the hangar as usual one of the bullets fired into the air fell down and killed a goat then the guard was taken away and now the people go and say their rakats every night many people go every night god this was awful it was just what connie had warned me might happen i had done nothing to prevent it but there was probably nothing that i could have done the residency would not have listened to anything i said how is this liaison officer i asked will he recover when did this happen it happened the day after you came through here with the teacher he said eight days ago how is the liaison officer he is in the hospital it is all right because the sister was there and she saved him i was puzzled which sister was that i was thinking of someone from the hospital the sister of the teacher he said the one who works for you as secretary nadezna was it she who saved the liaison officer yes he said the sister do you know what happened salim the englishman was driving in his car alone in the muharraq road towards the causeway he said someone threw a stone and broke the windscreen and the man stopped and got out of his car and more stones were thrown and one hit him on the arm and broke it and one hit him on the head and then he fell down beside the car and more stones were thrown to hit him as he lay upon the ground by many people but god the compassionate the merciful took pity on him the sister who was in the street came running and she saw the crowd and the men throwing stones and the sister came to the crowd and they made way for her and she went forward through the stones that men were throwing and stood over the englishman who was lying on the ground she said this is a bad thing and the teacher will be angry when he comes to hear of it then the men stopped throwing and she called to two of them to take up the englishman and lay him gently in the back seat of his car and that was done and the sister got into the car and drove it to the hospital and the crowd made way for her to pass with the car and when they came to the hospital men came with a stretcher and they put the englishman upon it and took him inside and he will recover from the stoning and when that was done the sister was ill and she was sick in the road by the car because she is a woman and had been afraid and one came and said sister of the teacher shall we take you also to the hospital but she said i will go back now to the souk to my own place go you to the residency and tell the guard to come and drive this car away and see that no harm shall come to it and that was done i walked back with him to the main airport building but he knew nothing more than that it had all happened a week ago a machine of orient airways had been through bahrein upon a pilgrim flight to jiddah and the crew had heard all this and brought the news back to karachi but since then there had been no authentic news of what was going on i think everything is quiet now said salim if there was still trouble we should have heard because the radio operators talk to each other all the time outside the main building we met arjan singh walking towards us in the tarmac lights he said there has been fighting in bahrein but it turned out that he knew no more than we did and had the same story we talked about it for a time but there was nothing we could do except get going for the persian gulf as soon as possible in the morning so we dined and went to bed with an order to be called at four oclock we landed at bahrein about midday next day gujar singh and hosein were both out on jobs gujar flying the carrier and hosein one of the airtrucks chai tai foong was in the hangar however and he came out and met us as we stopped the engines on the tarmac i got down quickly from the door ahead of the passengers leaving the machine to arjan and walked over to the chinese engineer and said morning tai foong how are things here now they tell me that youve had a bit of trouble while ive been away he smiled all is quiet now it was only one day the people were angry with the major hereward and they hurt him with stones but now they listen to mem nadezna and there is no more trouble was there trouble here about the people coming in to pray he nodded one day only after that mem nadezna went to the co and said the people meant no harm in coming here to pray and flight lieutenant allan he spoke on the radio to air vicemarshal collins at habbaniya near baghdad and saidhis own words mr cutter i am sorry he said the local jesus had been crucified and he was in a mess and wanted some advice because there was nothing in the book to tell him what to do and next day the air vicemarshal flew down from habbaniya in his devon and after he had talked to flight lieutenant allen they both came here to the hangar and talked to gujar singh and then they talked for a long time to mem nadezna and after that the guard was taken off the road and there was no more firing and the people now come here to pray each evening it is quite all right now mr cutter no more trouble at all i went into the hangar with him and he showed me what had been going on in my absence but i had only half my mind upon his maintenance jobs i told him to get on with the routine checks on the tramp since she would be leaving again for bali in a few days time and i went over to the office it was the lunch hour and the babu clerk was there eating something that he brought with him every day done up in a cloth he told me that nadezna was over in the restaurant having lunch as she usually did i went there to find her she was eating curry and rice at a table by herself and at first she did not see me i crossed the room thinking how small she was how delicate with her slim figure her black hair and her kind thoughtful features it was incredible that this slight girl had pressed through a yelling crowd of furious arabs stoning a man to death to walk through the flying stones and stand over him and tick them off it was more credible that she had been sick afterwards from nervous exhaustion i walked towards her not quite knowing what to say because she had become very dear to me and i was shocked at the risks that she had taken she heard my step and looked up and got up to meet me mr cutter i didnt know you were back have you come back in the tramp yes i said we landed about a quarter of an hour ago i had no idea im so sorryid have come out to meet you have you had lunch i shook my head ill join you if i may i pulled out a chair and sat down opposite her they tell me that youve had a bit of trouble here nothing to speak of she replied it was just one afternoon down in the souk the people were a little upset but thats all over now hows major hereward hes still in hospital hes going to be flown home on leave in a few days time his relief captain morrison was flown up here from aden yesterday is this one any better you mean as a liaison officer i nodded they say in the souk that he was quite popular at aden i dont think hereward was very bright i dont suppose well see him here again i said theyll probably send him to another district after this i smiled at her he ought to be very grateful to you but i dont suppose he is she said oh but he is he sent a message asking if id go and see him in hospital and all he wanted was to say thank you she hesitated it was a bit pathetic he didnt know what hed done wrong to make the people so angry didnt he realise that sending your brother away was likely to make trouble i dont think he did i think he thought he was preventing trouble when he sent connie away you cannot argue with stupidity you just have to accept it patiently as one of those things i said you didnt get hit by any of the stones she shook her head they stopped throwing as soon as they saw me thank god for that i said quietly she looked at me curiously for a moment and then coloured a little there wasnt any danger she said they wouldnt do anything to me i knew that from the first like hell you did i said thats why you were sick as loon as it was all over she stared at me however did you hear of that did chai tai foong tell you i shook my head salim told me last night at karachi hes a pakistani lad who used to work for us here hes with sind airways now he told you id been sick outside the hospital he mentioned it in telling me the story she looked me in the face with her thoughtful eyes they know about that in karachi do they know that i was sick in rangoon in bangkok in bangalore and in bombay i was silent does every little thing we do here in bahrein go halfway round the world i met her eyes if you want a straight answer to that one nadezna i replied i think it does she smiled a goldfish in a glass bowl has more privacy than we have if i cant even be sick without the whole of asia knowing much more i agreed but thats what comes of having connie for a brother how did you leave connie she enquired what sort of place is bali anyway i told her what had happened on our flight out as we sat over lunch in the airport restaurant and about that faroff village he was living in pekendang its very quiet very lovely there i said its not like this at all its tropical of course but its a gentler place than this with plenty of rainfall plenty of shady trees and greenery and cleaner gentler happier people than live here he hasnt got a lot of work to do i think he should be able to rest there and put on weight a bit it seemed to me that he was getting very thin she nodded i know hes terribly thin i think hes been in bahrein long enough i sat thinking for a time wondering if i could ask her what was in my mind at last i said i wonder if youd tell me something was connie every married she shook her head smiling never came within a hundred miles of it was he ever in love with a girl i dont think so not that i know of anyway he always thought too much about religion whats all this about mr cutter i dont want to be nosey i said its just that hes stuck down there in a very lovely place with very lovely women to look after him i was wondering how hed make out she smiled like a hermit or a monk or something i wish he was different more like other men if hed go around with girls and fall in love id be much happier about him i know i said everyone ought to do that she coloured a little and then she said ill have to be getting back on to the job mr cutter can i ask arjan for the journey log book of the tramp thats all right ill get the airframe and the engine log books written up then right away oh mr cutter tarik wants to see you as soon as you can fit him in what does he want he wants to go down to bali to work under connie tai foong came and told me all about it what does he want to go there for this is his home town she sighed a little hes writing up the gospel according to st tarik in a lot of five cent exercise books hes afraid therell be a gap i suppose i was dead tired i just sat back and laughed as if that was something very funny i knew it really wasnt funny at all and yet for a few moments i couldnt stop laughing i saw her face change and she came across and laid her hand upon my shoulder i think that was the first time she had ever touched me stop it tom she said gently i think that was the first time she had called me tom though i had called her nadezna for some time i never had been quite sure if shak lin was her surname or what i took a pull upon myself sorry i said tarik cant go down there hes got phinit with him that bitll have to be the gospel according to st phinit she nodded dont bother about that any more ill see tai foong and tarik go to the chummery and rest an hour or two theres nothing very urgent in the office i cant do that i said i must go up this afternoon to the arabiasumatran and tell johnson how the trip went off i went and got the dodge out of the hangar and drove into town to the arabiasumatran office i told johnson how the trip had gone and fixed with him the details of the next one to start in four days time we spent half an hour talking of the business which was going smoothly from his point of view then as i got up to go i said i hear that there was some trouble the day after i went he nodded it was very foolish of hereward to advise the resident to expel your man shak lin very foolish indeed as it is hes lucky to be alive today he wouldnt have been but for that girl nadezna i know i said i heard about it he thought for a moment we owe a lot to her he said id give her a medal if i had one to give things seem to be quiet enough now i remarked i suppose the people in the souk have accepted the position the souk ohthey dont matter its the sheikh of khulal and his oil that i was worried about im a bit worried still i dont mind telling you the sheikh of khulal i see you dont know the half of it he said the sheikh of khulal was behind that business in the souk not a doubt of it he was in bahrein that day i think we might have had a firstclass riot if your girl nadezna hadnt gone to see wazir hussein i was startled when did she do that the same evening she put on one of those black milfa veils to hide her face and went to see the wazir at sheikh muhammads palace where they were staying he paused it would be very awkward for our interests if an open breach were to develop between the sheikh of khulal and the resident he said thoughtfully i wish youd bear that in mind cutter we want peace in this country in a way i think perhaps you and nadezna can do more to bring peace back into this district now than the resident can bear it in mind and just do what you can especially if anything crops up that has to do with khulal i left him and went back to the aerodrome as i crossed the causeway i saw an airtruck on the circuit coming in to land and when i drove up to the hangar gujar singh was just taxiing in i met him on the tarmac and walked with him to the office he told me about the various flight jobs that had been going on in my absence about the disturbances he knew little that i did not know already i think things are becoming quiet now he said i think that when air vicemarshal collins took the guard off the road and let the people come back here to pray it made a great deal of difference i should think that would begin to tail off now i said now that hes gone away they wont be quite so keen to come out all this way just to say their prayers i dont know he said i have not counted them but it seems to me that more of them come here to pray each evening i think there are more coming now than when shak lin was here he paused and then he said i think a movement such as this is strengthened if you try to repress it i told him that i wanted him to take the tramp on the next trip to bali with hosein as copilot and discussed the route with him a little there was not much to talk about because he had flown it already once with me he had plenty of time in the next four days to study his maps and radio information to prepare the flight i left him presently and went back into the office and started on the correspondence that was the bad part of my job the office work i had been flying and working hard for five days in the tropics all across the world and as a solace and a rest i came back to a desk piled high with papers to be dealt with i dictated to nadezna for three quarters of an hour and gave her more than she could cope with that day then i sent her out to get on with the typing and sat on at my desk turning over the remainder of the stuff with a mind dulled with fatigue presently outside my office arabs from the town began to pass along the road it was getting towards sunset and the time of evening prayer i could not concentrate enough for useful work i got up and went out of the office and watched what was going on from a distance a string of motor buses and taxis were parked on the road and men were streaming from them to the empty space reserved for prayer just by the hangar there were a great many of them i did not try to count them for i was too tired but as i stood there watching it seemed to me that there were many more than i had seen before there was an imam with them and presently he stood up in the semicircle of white stones that faced to mecca and began to lead them in the evening rakats i stood and watched them for a time most desolately alone i could not go and join them because i was a european and a christian and because i had never done so i just stood at the corner of the restaurant watching as they laid their troubles before god and cleansed their souls with the ritual i was tired and depressed and i would have given anything to be there with them joining in their prayers and presently i couldnt bear it any longer and i went back to the office and sat there with my head resting on my arms upon the desk if i had been able to i would have wept but i had not wept since i was a child and presently nadezna came in with the letters i raised my head and i said heavily the post must have gone ill sign them in the morning she came to my side and put the letters down upon the desk and then she put her hand to my head and caressed my hair and said youre very very tired you must go home and rest she was comfort and security and stability to me a touch of everything that was lacking from my life i pulled her hand down and kissed it and she said softly poor tom we stayed like that for a long time perhaps ten minutes it was no good starting off upon another beryl presently i got up and smiled at her and said thanks nadezna that was good of you and then i went out to the old dodge station wagon and drove in a daze down to the chummery and went and lay down on the charpoy i didnt sleep much that night perhaps i was too tired and god shall make thy body pure and give thee knowledge to endure this ghostlifes piercing phantompain and bring thee out to life again james elroy flecker from that time on there was a period when everything went well it was autumn for one thing and with the onset of the winter weather nerves became less strained tempers less ragged as the nights got colder so that first a sheet was necessary over you for sleep and then a blanket everybody slept better and was able to relax the summer is a bad time in the persian gulf even if you can stand it every one of our party was accustomed to great heat or we wouldnt have been there but even sothe summers a bad time in bahrein the new liaison officer captain morrison turned out to be a great success he was quite a young chap not more than about thirty but my god he was good he had come into the army when he was about twenty for the war and had found his way into some branch of the intelligence in egypt and the sudan he had stayed in after the war was over and had been seconded for cvil duties he had travelled very widely in arabia with the bedouins he spoke arabic fluently and half a dozen dialects of it he was unmarried he came up to the aerodrome soon after he arrived and came into my office he had a shy diffident manner very unlike hereward there was no professional charm about him at all it was difficult to believe that he was in the army he seemed just like an ordinary person he said i suppose you know what ive come for i must say he got me a bit confused as a matter of fact i did know gujar singh had told me that morning that he was coming to see me to ask me to have dinner with him in his quarters at the residency gujar had heard that in the souk of course the gossip was that this young man had told the resident that he wanted to tackle things in bahrein from a different angle he had told him that i tom cutter was one of the most influential people in the district and that it was absolutely necessary to get my cooperation and advice in tackling the religious difficulties that seemed to have arisen all this had got down to the souk in about five minutes and ten minutes after that one or two grave whitebearded old men had visited the house of the silk merchant mutluq bin aamir to tell the rumour to the sister of the teacher and ask her what she thought about it gujar singh told me that nadezna had told them gravely that it was a good thing and that the teacher would certainly approve of any such cooperation from the liaison officer so everybody in the souk was happy as for me i didnt know what to say to my shorthand typist so i said nothing i temporised with morrison i said how on earth should i know what youve come for i just thought you might have heard something he said awkwardly i wanted to ask you to have dinner with me tonight it was a friendly approach meant in a friendly way i was a bit embarrassed in my turn because essentially i was a fitter come up from the bench and id never had time for any social life or anything like that id like to do that i said but theres just one thing im afraid i havent got a dinnerjacket he said that didnt matter because thered only be him and me and so i dined with him that night we sat on his veranda for a long time after dinner drinking his whisky and because he was simple and really anxious to learn what had been going on i told him everything i knew we must have sat like that talking for over an hour after dinner looking out into the still blue night with the moon making a bright track across the sea i told him everything right from the first day i met connie in cobhams circus i even put in a word or two about my marriage i told him about dwight schafter and i told him about u set tahn in the end he said quietly what do you really think about shak lin mr cutter what sort of person do you really think he is i stared out over the dim sea i think hes a very good chap i said at last i know but there are a large number of people here who think he is divine hes not i said hes just a very good ground engineer with a bee in his bonnet i paused and then i said if i thought he was divine i couldnt very well dictate my letters to his sister no he said thoughtfully i could not put it into words but what i meant was that nadezna was a human being a girl like any other she was somebody that one could get to care for very much and to depend upon it was unthinkable that her brother should have qualities above humanity it was a gross fallacy that had to be put right at all costs i can assure you theres nothing like that i said positively that was the first time i denied him he got up and went and got some papers from the room behind us and when he came back he poured me out another whisky and got a fresh bottle of cold soda water from the refrigerator then he sat down beside me again did you know about the raf plans for expansion here he asked i shook my head not a thing its in a very early stage he said i think theyre planning to put a squadron on the aerodrome at last of course the trouble is that you are occupying the only hangar and thats right on top of the raf camp i see i said do they want to kick me out not from the aerodrome he said they realise that your business mustnt be disturbed the proposal is that they should build a new civil aviation hangar for you at the south end of the northsouth runway he unfolded a plan of the aerodrome and showed me where they meant to put it here at the same time they want to extend the present hangar by building over the vacant land to the south of it here the present hangar wont be large enough for them apparently i stared at the plan in consternation hell i said they cant possibly do that they cant build over that bit to the south thats where the people come to say their prayers its all raf land of course its holy ground i retorted honestly youve got to put a stop to this if they prevent the people coming there to pray youll have all hell break loose thats because its the bit of land that shak lin used for praying on thats right i said its very holy ground he smiled gently and yet you dont think shak lin is divine of course i dont i said but other people do that was the second time he sat studying the plan i think as you do he said at last i dont think we can let them put their hangar there not just at present anyway its going to make a lot of difficulties i suppose but i think theyll have to put their hangar somewhere else let you stay in the present hangar and choose another site for their new buildings we talked over the details for a time it was certainly an odd position that a holy place had come into being in the middle of an raf camp i told him that i thought that air vicemarshal collins might be reasonable about it he seemed to have acted with understanding at the time of the previous trouble presently he laid the papers down i dont feel that the present situation is a static one he said do you im not sure that i know what you mean i said well what i mean is this either this cult of shak lin will die out in a few months or else it will increase and be a bigger thing than ever i dont believe that two or three hundred people will be coming up to the aerodrome to make their rakats every evening in two years from now there may be more or there may be less but not two or three hundred i think id agree with that i said slowly i think therell be a change if we could guess which way the change would be he remarked wed know what to tell the raf about their hangar if the people have forgotten all about shak lin in two years time and nobody goes to the aerodrome to pray then the raf can take that bit of land and build on it i shook my head i dont think itll go like that theres been no sign of any diminution so far this thing is growing now at a great pace shak lin has never been anywhere near bombay and yet his cult is strong amongst the engineers there now so far as i can see its growing every day all through the east i havent seen a sign of any falling off yet not in any place youll have to work on the assumption that this thing wont die out here i think myself that it will grow he said quietly youre saying in effect that we must work on the assumption that shak lins divine god damn it i said angrily i tell you hes not i know him and hes just a damn good engineer whos going round the bend a bit thats all there is to him that was the third time a damn good engineer whos going round the bend a bit he said thoughtfully it wouldnt have been a bad description of the prophet mahomet only he was a damn good merchant i got to my feet time i went home i said im sorry if i spoke strongly but i know shak lin very well and i know his sister too theyre very ordinary people she works in my office you know i could not possibly admit that there was anything different about nadezna i was growing to depend on her too much i expect youre right he said weve passed the age of miracles except the ones that come from nuclear fission he came down with me to the courtyard to my old dodge station wagon it was very good of you to come this evening he said its a great help to have a talk to somebody who really knows whats making this place tick it was nice of him to say that i said something or other of the same sort in reply and drove back to the chummery feeling that at last the administration would be guided on the proper lines by this young chap gujar singh took the tramp down to bali on the first of the regular trips with a load of passengers and freight for yenanyaung diento and east alligator river he was back in nine days in accordance with the schedule bringing with him four passengers and about half a ton of fresh fruit for the oil companys employees mangoes and pawpaws and pineapples things that we didnt very often see in the persian gulf he brought me in a basket of this fruit to my office and told me about the trip and showed me the journey log book it had been a good uneventful journey except that he had had a bit of trouble with the monsoon at the intertropical front over north malaya he hadnt been able to get high enough to overfly the cloud banks and it looked so bad ahead that he had been unwilling to go through them so he had gone under and had flown for five hundred miles in heavy rain along the beaches only fifty feet up coming back it had been easier i asked him how things were going at the bali end he said that connie and phinit were getting quite a good little workshop going in the hangar they had taken on two balinese lads temporarily for whitewashing and painting and they were getting the place shipshape the governor wanted them to maintain his auster as we had supposed gujar had a list of tools and materials that they wanted to be sent down on the next trip hows the accommodation working out i asked did you go to the village where they live pekendang oh yes he said we went there to sleep and spend the evening with them hosein and i he hesitated and then said i was not sure if we would have been accepted in the bali hotel or if that is only for europeans im sure that would have been all right i said there were asiatics there when i was there i ought to have told you im sorry he smiled we liked it in pekendang it is much cheaper too we did not pay at all but in the bali hotel it would have cost ten or fifteen guilders it is better for us to stay in pekendang with shak lin and phinit how are they getting on there gujar are they hitting it off with the villagers all right its pretty primitive accommodation he said they are very happy there mr cutter i think bali is a happy country where people can live well and still have time to work upon their arts and serve their temples i think that they are very happy there indeed im glad to hear it i replied i was just a bit worried that they might not have fitted in that woman mem simpang is she looking after them all right he said i think so i only saw her once her daughter brings the food and keeps the room clean and mends shak lins clothes thats the goodlooking girl ni madй jasmi they call her madй he said i did not hear the other name she does for them he hesitated there is another girl who seems to take care of phinit they call her ktut suriatni the two girls do the work between them but madй works mostly for shak lin i said is phinit behaving himself gujar he laughed in his great black beard with ktut suriatni i do not think so the village would probably be very insulted if he did not going to make any trouble he shook his head he is a good lad from a country that is not so far away and he knows the rules by which this game is played he will do whatever is the right thing in the eyes of the village there will be no trouble mr cutter im glad to hear it i said what about madй he looked more grave ah madй he said she thinks nothing of phinit and in any case he could not have two women at one time i do not think the village would approve of that but madй only serves the teacher and is she getting any joy out of that he shook his head no joy i did not think she would but it was an interesting situation will the village take that as an insult then he smiled i do not think that they are very touchy but in any case shak lin is different to phinit and the village know it phinit is one of them but shak lin is different how do connie and phinit spend their time gujar he said they are at the airstrip working most of every day but in the evenings they sit in the village and talk with the people they can talk to them now fairly well what do they talk about he grinned broadly what would phinit talk about to ktut suriatni mr cutter your guess is as good as mine but shak lin talks to the old men a great deal a buddhist priest came to the village the night i was there he had walked from besakih a great temple in the middle of the island to see the teacher he stayed after we had gone i thought they were hindus he laughed i think you english call every religion that you do not understand hinduism but there are buddhists in the island just a few shak lin is finding out about the religion i suppose he nodded i think so and thats bad luck on madй he nodded gravely he could have happiness for the asking and give it too but the teacher is different to other men there was no arguing about that one ill go down there myself one of these trips gujar i said stop over for a fortnight till the next one its time i took a bit of leave he said i think that would be a very good thing it is a lovely island and you should rest sometimes mr cutter i think that would be very good indeed we left it at that but the idea stayed in my mind late that night before going to sleep as i luxuriated in bed in a cold room with two blankets over me i got what seemed to me a pretty good notion the more i thought of it the more i liked it and i drifted into sleep with a smile on my face it was still there when i woke up i could hardly wait till i had finished dictating to nadezna next morning look i said when the last letter was done ive been talking to gujar about your brother and how theyre getting on down there she nddded ive asked gujar about connie too oh i grinned at her did he tell you about madй jasmi she smiled thats the bali girl whos looking after him thats the one shes a very beautiful girl so gujar says what i thought was this i said i want a bit of a holiday i was thinking we might get everything cleaned up here in the office and go down there and stop over for one trip not this coming trip but the one after that gives us a clear fortnight in the office here to get everything buttoned up so that dunu can look after things while were away go down on one trip and come back on the next one that would mean wed have about a fortnight there we should be away from here about three weeks i hesitated and then i said youd like to see your brother wouldnt you she sat silent with her eyes cast down tracing a little pattern faintly with her pencil on the cover of her pad i was disappointed that she had not welcomed the chance of a visit to bali but a man gets used to disappointments as his life goes on i said gently wouldnt you like to come she said may i think it over and tell you this evening she hesitated i dont think we ought both to be away at the same time think it over i said gujar and dunu can cope with anything thats likely to crop up id leave gujar here in charge i went on with the days work in the office but it was a weary day i had counted on her coming with me for this holiday and i didnt see what there was against it it couldnt possibly be that she wanted a chaperon or anything like that and i knew she was becoming fond of me i wanted to be with her to get to know her better to find out what she liked and didnt like outside the office she must have known id never do her any harm i spent the day uncertain worried and impatient in the evening as she was putting the cover on her typewriter i said thought any more about this bali business she turned and faced me she was wearing a white drill frock very simple ive been thinking about it all day tom she said i dont think id better come i suppose id known that was coming though i didnt know why my face must have shown my disappointment because she looked up at me and said im just terribly sorry its not that i dont want a holiday with you its bali i sat down on the edge of the desk whats it all about i asked as kindly as i could whats wrong with bali she said i dont want to go there not just now dont you want to see connie i thought youd like the chance she shook her head i dont want to see him for a bit i reached out and took one of her hands in mine tell me why i said im only trying to help i know you are she said she smiled a little youre doing that in your own way all the time thats why this party runs so well id like to know why you wont want to go and see connie i observed i know you do she said thoughtfully otherwise youll think that its because i dont want to go away with you and its not that at all thank god for that anyway i said she raised her eyes and looked at me i want to leave him alone for a bit she said i dont mind you going it might be quite a good thing if you did but i dont want to go myself not now i think hes better without me why is that nadezna she withdrew her hand and walked over and stood by the open window the people were beginning to go past to the place by the hangar for the evening prayer she was silent for a bit and then she said did you meet this girl madй jasmi i was amazed that she could raise that thing again surely she wasnt jealous i said yes i just met her she was with her mother when we were settling how much they were to pay i didnt speak to her of course i couldnt is she nice tom shes got rather a nice face i told her to look at her youd say she would be kind and eventempered and probably faithful she nodded slowly thats what gujar said did gujar tell you much about her tom he said that she looked after connie mostly theres another one whos looking after phinit did he tell you that she was in love with connie yes i said he told me that she stood looking out at the muddled buildings between us and the hangar with glimpses of the tarmac and the sea beyond if thats true she said its the first time its ever happened the first time anyone has ever been in love with him i think so you dont know of anyone do you i shook my head i never saw him take an interest in a girl or any girl in him nor did i she said but now if gujar singh is right there is a girl and shes in love with him i thought about this for a moment well you can put it like that i said at last i dont know much about the balinese and i dont think gujar singh does either shes a very lovely girl nadezna but its a very primitive village she may want to go to bed with him probably she does but whether you can put it any higher than that i wouldnt know she said i only wish she would i grinned think itld do him good she said gravely i know it would she came and stood by me again i want you to try and understand about connie tom she said theres such a lot of nonsense being talked about him that one cant deny because it means so much to so many people so many people think that he that hes a prophet or something they do honestly down in the souk they think that hes a sort of prophet i took her hand again and examined it i know i said some people quite high up are starting to say that you dont believe that do you tom she looked at me appealingly i smiled at her i dont i think hes just a damn good chap whos got a bee in his bonnet perhaps hes been out in the east too long she nodded i think he has he always was interested in religions ever since he was a little chap and then when we lived in america we were asiatics you seedifferent to the rest mother was russianborn and we always reckoned we were european but we werent reallynot connie and i and of course it made a difference i dont think connie ever had a girl friend in his life not one and his religion made up i see i said this was a new light on the man i knew she said quietly tom i believe this is his chance and it may be the last one that hell have i dont care who she is so long as shell be kind to him and make him happy like an ordinary man and give him children if shes an asiatic well hes asiatic too and so am i i want her to have him hes never had a girl in love with him before and thats whats made him into what he is i want her to make him love her and make him an ordinary man i stood studying her fingertips holding her hand in mine you think thats what hes missed i know it is she said hes always been incomplete because hes never had that hes slid deeper and deeper into his religion just to compensate i stood thinking perhaps more about nadezna whose hand i was caressing than about connie i was wondering if the same asiatic nature of her birth had denied her boy friends too it might well be so but she had had her mother to look after and perhaps she had found compensation in that way youre a good bit younger than connie arent you i asked she nodded eight years she said there were two others between usboth boys there was a typhoid epidemic in our street down by the harbour in penang and my father and ivan and victor all died after that mother took connie and me to london because my father died fairly well off and mother didnt want us to grow up as chinese my father had helped sir alan cobham on one of his flights through penang and mother wrote to him in london and sir alan took connie on as an apprentice thats how he got started in this business i came back to the point that we had started from why dont you want to go to bali then i asked she said i might frighten her and spoil it i see she said gujar and you say shes just a village girl living in a very primitive place but gujar says that shes in love with him and phinit living there with him is living with another of the girls there one of madй jasmis friends if ever connie had a chance of knowing what love means its now and if he can have that i think he might snap out of all this prophet stuff and come back to us as a normal man why do you think youd frighten her i asked youre on her side nadezna said if shes a village girl like that shed never believe it different clothes different speech different colour if i turned up there as his sister shed be terrified of me and angry too because shed think that i resented her and wanted to take him from her id never get her to believe that i want her to have him no i said thoughtfully i dont suppose you would i think ill have to keep away she said however much one wants to help her i think this is a time when another woman just cant help at all would you rather i kept clear of them myself i asked she shook her head i think it might be helpful if you went if you can spare the time connie thinks so much of you tom he may want to talk to somebody before he takes her she smiled hes such a bunch of ideals she said hes quite capable of keeping a girl hanging round while he consults a friend to ask him if hes doing the right thing i laughed you want me to push him into it i do she said but she wasnt laughing at all i think that its the only thing to save him now there was real pain and anxiety in her when she said that and for a moment i thought that she was going to start crying i put an arm clumsily around her shoulders its not as bad as that i said after all nothings going to happen if he doesnt get this girl only one thing she said sadly whats that i think hell turn into a prophet i was silent i dont know how a man becomes a prophet she said quietly but thousands of people spread all through the eastthey think hes one already i suppose that if a person gives up earthly things and preaches a new simple way of life to people who are hungry for his teachingi suppose thats what a prophet is isnt it or is there something more to it than that i pressed her shoulders gently look i said i dont know what a prophet is or what makes one i only know that its a very long time since theres been a prophet in the world far as i know mahomet was the last and he lived about fourteen hundred years ago thats a good long time ago i dont know what a prophet is but i do know this that its pretty long odds against our having one here in our little party now in all these ages people must have been thought to be prophets who werent really just ordinary chaps whod been out in the east too long thats all that connie is nadeznahonestly and if we treat him that way its the best thing we can do i paused id like to see him have a job in a cold climate for a time in england or america she smiled and pressed my hand and said dear tom but he wouldnt go no i thought about it for a minute well then id like to see him get this girl i think youre quite right there i think that it would do him good perhaps she looked up smiling if he became the father of twins itld knock him off his perch wouldnt it i burst out laughing and she freed herself from my arm and laughed with me well anyway she said you go alone this time and find out what hes up to and give him a push the right way she was calm and matteroffact about it now all apprehensions of the unknown put away ill stay here and look after things with dunu she paused but dont think its because i wont come with you for a trip tom id like to do thatbut not to bali not just now all right i said ill go and see what i can make of it arjan and hosein took the tramp down for the next journey to bali and i went on quietly at bahrein making my preparations to go down on the following trip and spend a fortnight there i flew one of the airtrucks once or twice upon a local journey and i spent some time in the hangar with chai tai foong and the ground engineers most of the time i spent in the office because it was there that i liked to be now there was always something to talk about with nadezna something to make a joke about with her i never took her out anywhere for the very good reason that there was nowhere to take her to in bahrein there was no restaurant where we could have a meal together or anything like that if one drove out in the car you got out into the dry parched desert in a couple of miles without a tree or any vegetation whatsoever i did think once or twice of taking her bathing but thats not much catch in the persian gulf you cant go in more than knee deep because of the sharks and theres no shade at all which makes it rather trying id never felt the need of anywhere to go except the office up till then and now it was in the office that we met and got to know each other it was very pleasant there in those few days hosein and arjan came back in the tramp according to their schedule and i warned gujar singh and a new pilot that we had called kadhim that they would be the first and second pilots for the next trip down to bali the one i should be going on hosein and arjan singh had spent the night in pekendang with connie and phinit but they were neither so observant or so much in my confidence as gujar singh and i didnt like to question them too closely about the women i learned nothing from them nadezna asked gujar to find out anything he could from them but they had little information for him they were both devout followers of connie hosein in particular and it had probably never entered their heads that the teacher could take any interest in a woman two days before i was due to leave for bali i was in the hangar with tai foong when nadezna came to me wazir husseins just arrived and wants to see you mr cutter she said she always called me mr cutter in front of other people hes in the office waiting i left the hangar and went over to the office wondering what he wanted i was up to date with my payments on the loan to buy the tramp and with the work that the machine was doing i could step the payments up if need be i thought about that quickly as i walked over to the office past the maroon car with the arab chauffeur i went and greeted him how very nice of you to come i said let me order coffee i nodded to nadezna in the doorway and she nodded back that she would send for it and closed die door softly behind her so that i was alone with hussein we began to talk about the weather and the crops as usual and very soon he asked me how the tramp had been behaving so i knew it wasnt that that he had come to talk about i told him all about it and the work that it was doing wondering all the time what he had come for if it wasnt that and he listened politely and said all the right and courteous things at the right time then dunu brought a tray with the small cups of turkish coffee and put it on the desk between us and went out and closed the door behind him presently the wazir said and where is shak lin now mr cutter hes at bali in indonesia i said looking after the far end of our service there i told him what shak lin was doing and how he was living i found he did not really know where bali was and he wasnt too sure about indonesia either so i took him to the big map of asia that i had pinned up on the wall and showed him where bali was and how the aircraft flew there every fortnight to meet the dakota coming up from darwin he was an able man with an alert mind and he grasped the various points very quickly we went back to our chairs and will el amin be coming back here to bahrein in the near future he asked i dont think so i said carefully as you must know there was a small amount of friction here about him and the liaison officer suggested to me that he should be sent away he inclined his head and his face darkened with his black beard and aquiline features framed in the white cloth of his headdress he looked quite an ugly customer for a moment things are much more pleasant now i said i think perhaps if i were to ask for his return the government might allow it i paused on my side i dont need him back here hes doing good work for us where he is and the chinese boy chai tai foong who has succeeded him is doing well i added doing well in the straight performance of the work i mean no one could replace shak lin as teacher of ground engineers or as a man he nodded gravely that is very true he is not likely to return here then i dont think he is i hesitated i doubt if he would want to himself when he left here he felt that his time here was over that it was time that he moved on in any case he went without resentment for that reason he nodded again and we sat together for some time in silence at last he said my master the sheikh abd el kadir is becoming an old manhe will not live for very many months more he is not ill but he is tired now and ready to put down his burdens he wants very much to meet el amin once again to pray with him and take his blessing before he lies down to die i see i said the old man after all had lent me sixty thousand pounds at a time when i needed it badly i still owed him most of it thats very easy to arrange i said shak lin can come back here on one machine and go down again on the next trip hed have about four days here if he did that i should have to ask the resident of couse but this new liaison officer captain morrison would help us there and as for shak lin i know hed be glad to come he said evenly my master would not ask the resident for any favour in this matter nor would he allow you to do so there was another long silence while he left that to sink in i had known of course that there was some bitterness i had not realized that it was quite so strong as this time would heal it of course because the old sheikh would be dead before so very long but it seemed to me to be a sad thing that official clumsiness should have produced such lasting illfeeling if anyone could ease the matter for the resident and captain morrison perhaps now queerly it was me what can we do about it i enquired at last how can i help your master who has helped me so much he said my master would like to travel to el amin i do not think that he would ask so great a man to come back here halfway across the world to visit him my master wishes to arrange that you should fly him to el amin in your large aeroplane with some members of his household so that he may see shak lin again and talk to him before he dies i thought quickly the sheikh would have to go in his own aeroplane the tramp no doubt that was his idea because of the relationship between the arabiasumatran and the sheikh by which they paid for his oil johnson would probably forgo one of his fortnightly trips for this purpose if i put it to him we could free the tramp for the job but the tramp was a bare box inside unfurnished unheated and unsoundproofed a poor vehicle for an invalid old man to live in for four days to bali and four days back all through the tropical extremes of heat and cold i said of course i will do that wazir if thats what he wants to do he shall do it i can arrange for him to fly to bali in the tramp the large aeroplane which he lent me the money to buy or i can arrange for him to charter a more comfortable aeroplane that an old man can travel in without so much fatigue and i went on to tell him of my doubts about the suitability of the tramp we walked over to the hangar together for me to show him the tramp we got up into it and stood in the great empty cabin floored with duralumin with bare stringers and formers supporting the outer skin of the walls innocent of any upholstery i showed him the toilet that my mother had admired so much back in distant eastleigh that was about all the passenger accommodation that there was as an alternative i said i can arrange for him to charter a york from boac that would have a crew of five or six probably with two stewards in uniform with proper arrangements for serving meals it would be warmer for him and much less noisy i cant say quite what it would cost probably between five and six thousand pounds for the return journey he said the money is not important he looked around the inside of the tramp could we put a carpet on the floor and a couch for my master to lie on i said of course we can wazir if he would like to use this aeroplane we can do anything like that only limited by the amount that we can carry which is five tons he said i think my master would prefer to go in one of your aeroplanes he would not want to go upon his pilgrimage in luxury and carried by a crew of unbelievers he glanced around him at the bleak functional utility of the metal cabin this is more suitable he turned back to me my master would prefer to be carried by devout men of course i thought for a minute if he wishes i said i can arrange for the whole crew to be moslems i can arrange for hosein and kadhim to go as first and second pilots theyre both iraqis then i should send two of my bahrein men who are accustomed to travelling by air to act as servantstarik and khail i think but frankly i should like my chief pilot to go with your master upon such a journeygujar singh hes a sikh if your master has no strong objection i should like to send gujar as chief pilot and hosein as second pilot it does not matter that the crew should all be moslems he replied el amin himself is not a moslem my master knows gujar singh and everybody trusts him as we walked back to the office i told him that the arabiasumatran had first call upon the tramp under their contract and that i would see johnson at once and see if i could get him to release the aircraft for one trip i told him that i was going down to bali on the next flight myself and we arranged that the sheikhs journey should be the trip after that so that i should be at bali to meet the aircraft when it arrived and could make arrangements for the accommodation of the party then i would travel back with them to bahrein on the return journey he was staying with sheikh muhammad with his master the sheikh of khulal at the palace just outside the town i told him i would see johnson at once and call on him at the palace later in the day then he bowed to me and said may god protect you and got into the back of his maroon hudson and was driven away i went and saw johnson and got him to agree to stand down for one trip as i had thought he was very ready to oblige the sheikh of khulal in this way i went to the palace and drank coffee with the party and confirmed the arrangement with the wazir and told him how much it would cost him and got away from there after only an hour and forty minutesgood going in those parts then i went back to the aerodrome gujar singh was there and i had a talk to him about it in the office we rearranged the pilots schedules to send arjan on the next trip with kadhim since gujar was to pilot the old sheikh because i didnt want my chief pilot to be away from the home base too much as he got up to go gujar said this is the next phase then whats that i asked he said this is the first pilgrimage to visit shak lin nadezna was in the room taking some papers from the basket on my desk i felt her check and stiffen this is exceptional i said uncertainly this wont happen again he smiled we cant do anything to stop it if it does he went out and nadezna was still standing there motionless by my desk it is exceptional i said gently it doesnt mean anything she said dully only that an old man who is dying thinks it worth while to go six or seven thousand miles to get connies blessing itried to cheer her up perhaps madй jasmis done her stuff by this time and then i said youre sure you wouldnt like to come down with me she sighed a little no she said i couldnt help you go alone tom and do what you can i left with the tramp two days later and travelled like a passenger resting in a long chair in the cabin with the load the pilots were getting the hang of the journey by that time and were making longer stages we were circling the airstrip of den pasar on bali by midday of the fourth day half a day ahead of time the dakota from darwin wasnt due until the evening i made a note to put its times forward by a day connie and phinit were on the aerodrome to meet us and began to work at once to check the aircraft and the engines and to refuel we had two australian scientists and a dutchman with us to go on as passengers to east alligator river and for courtesy i had to stay with them and not go off alone to pekendang moreover it wouldnt have benefited me to do so because connie and phinit would be working very late upon the tramp perhaps all through the night to get it ready for the trip back to bahrein probably they wouldnt get back to pekendang themselves that night i sent my passengers into the bali hotel in the klm car and set to work with the pilots and the engineers to get the aircraft serviced and the load ready to tranship to the dakota when it came it turned up just before dusk and taxied in and as we were all there and working we changed loads that night it was most of it light stuff that could be carried over from one aircraft to the other all except one motor generator set that the dakota had brought for us to take back to diento this weighed over a ton and we had to rig the sheerlegs for it it was nine oclock by the time we could leave for the bali hotel and connie and phinit were still working on the engines of the tramp when we went they were there when we got ouf to the airstrip next morning at about halfpast seven connie said that they had finished about one oclock and had slept for a few hours on charpoys in the hangar they had the engines running and the machines all ready to go when we got there so they had probably been working again at dawn the crews and passengers got into their respective aircraft and made ready with the usual deliberation then the machines taxied out and down the strip together the dakota took off first and headed straight out from the strip towards the east the tramp followed and climbed straight ahead till it was at about five hundred feet slowly raising flaps then it turned in a wide circle and flew past north of us climbing and set a course to the northwest for sourabaya and vanished up the coast connie phinit and i were left upon the ground tired they with a nights work and i with four days flying connie said where are you going to stay will you stay in den pasar or come with us id like to come and stay in pekendang if that can be arranged i said would they mind having a european in the village not a bit he said i thought you might want to come there for a day or two anyway ive fixed up a room for you to yourself and a bed and a mosquito net but its all a bit primitive you know i nodded if i get fed up with it ill go back to the bali hotel but i dont suppose i shall theyve got very interesting techniques of wood carving he said theres quite a bit to see i had brought my bag with me to the aerodrome and he sent one of the balinese labourers to get it we locked the workshop and dosed the hangar doors and started off walking across the airstrip towards the village we went slowly because the sun was getting up and the heat increasing but when we got off the aerodrome the track led through scrub and palm trees and it was shady and cool and pleasant after about half an hour we came to the walled family enclosures that made up the village and turned into the one that i remembered and into the internal square with the shrines round it connie and phinit i found now lived separately connie was alone in the oneroomed atap house that i remembered but phinit had moved out and had gone to live with one of the families of the village the family of the girl ktut suriatni who looked after him he was in fact living happily and openly in wedded bliss connie was living alone he had got another singleroomed house for me a few yards away and he took me there a little place with a thatch roof and atap walls the floor raised about three feet off the ground there was no door and not much privacy except what would be provided by the darkness when night fell people will come in and have a look at all your things he said they wont take anything a girl came up as he was showing me the little house madй jasmi that i remembered from my previous visit she had her long black hair gathered behind her head and hanging down her back she wore a little cotton jacket which represented her best clothes in deference to me because i was a stranger open down the front for coolness i smiled at her in recognition and she smiled at me and then she asked a question of connie she wants to know if we want food he said id like to rest this afternoon if you dont mind i was up most of the night shall we eat something now i said that that would suit me what do you eat here rice he said always rice usually with something curried on topdried fish or meat they eat a good many vegetables and a certain amount of fruit i leave it all to madй here and she feeds me very well he spoke to her and she smiled shyly and went away she brought us food to connies house presently he had a table and two rickety chairs she brought two wooden bowls filled with rice and two spoons and a number of broad leaves upon a tray each with a small portion of curry or dried fish upon it im teaching her western ways he said the people here eat everything off leaves so theres no washing up i told her that i had to have a bowl and a spoon and youd want one too he had two glasses and madй brought water in an earthenware jug with a curious long spout if youre a balinese you can drink out of that by pouring it into you mouth very hygienic i cant do it without choking though it looks as if you make quite an unreasonable amount of work for her i said i dont think she minds that he said she wants to learn how people do things in the west the girl settled down upon the edge of the small balcony or floor before the hut and watched us while we ate the food was good well cooked and appetising as we ate connie asked me how tai foong was settling down into the job at bahrein and i told him about that and about the new liaison officer and how the work had been going generally he was interested in the proposal of the raf to build on to the hangar it would be better if they didnt build just there he said its not very important though its only sentiment because i took our people there to pray after work and then the others from the souk got into the habit but that could very easily be changed if the raf really need that bit of land let me come back there for a week and ill see that they start praying somewhere else its not necessary i said theres all the land in the world there the raf can put their hangar on the north side of the long strip theyve got to have a civil aviation hangar anyway if its going to make any trouble he said we can easily put it right he spoke to the girl and she smiled and got up and went away i asked her to get fruit he said theyve got some quite good things like grapefruit here youve learned the language very quickly i remarked i never have much difficulty with that he replied i was brought up to speak canton in penang when i was a boy and i speak malay of course these languages are all very much the same the girl came back with a wooden bowl full of fruit and put it on the table and went back and sat on the edge of the floor again phinit eats in his own place i suppose i said he nodded hes gone to live with the other girls family just over there he smiled quite a married man thats all right is it i asked he said i think so madй here tells me that its a very good idea the girl hearing her name spoken looked up and smiled but im afraid shes got an axe to grind i didnt follow that one up and presently i got up and went to my own hut and dropped off my two garments and blew up the air pillow that i carry on these journeys and lay down on the charpoy from where i lay i could see out into the brilliant sunlight across to connies hut he also had gone to bed and the girl had carried away the remnants of our meal i lay dozing before sleep while the sweat slowly ceased to run and presently she came back with a flat basket of palm leaves and sat down on the corner of his hut in her usual position and began doing something with her hands later i found that she was making lamaks woven panels of dark green and yellow palm leaves in a chequer design and stylised artificial flowers of the same craft for offerings at the shrines of the house temple i fell asleep and slept for about an hour in the heat of the day when i woke up she was still sitting there making her offerings waiting perhaps to be ready to fetch connie anything he wanted when he woke i got up presently and put on my khaki drill trousers and bush shirt and a pair of sandals and went to the entrance of my little house madй saw me and got up and moved softly into the room behind where connie was asleep i crossed over to where she had been sitting to look at her basket and examine what she had been doing she had been using a crude knife of hoopiron to split the fronds of the green leaves and her basket was half full of her offerings she came out of the room and she was carrying her earthenware pitcher of water and a glass and she poured out the cool water for me it was no good trying to talk to her so i smiled at her and took it from her and drank and she smiled gravely in return and put the pitcher back in the shade and the draught she offered me the bowl of fruit but i refused that and strolled slowly through the village there was a girl weaving at a loom and a young man roasting a pig upon a spit over a wood fire and a very old man carving an elaborate wooden sculpture of a girl dancer a very advanced and refined piece of artistry or so it seemed to me i stood and watched all these for a time and then i went out into the road and down towards the sea two or three children followed me at a safe distance quiet and a little timid watching everything i did there were fishingboats on the beach and a few children bathing the boats were beamy wellbuilt vessels with one big lateen sail there was a lighter type also a sort of dugout canoe stabilised with an outrigger formed of a large bamboo log i sat in the shade of the trees at the head of the beach for a time watching the boats come in and go out women were washing and gutting the fish nearby and salting them and spreading them out to dry in the hot sun both men and women on this job were less crude in their manner iban fishermen and herring girls in other countries it seemed to me that they must make their living more easily permitting greater attention to the arts and graces of their lives i left the beach presently and went back into the village in the late afternoon there was a temple there an enclosure of brick walls with facings of a soft white limestone most elaborately carved with fruits and gods and gargoyles inside there were a number of platforms with thatched roofs and a number of shines but the shrines were all empty and unattended and the whole place was swept and clean and empty i learned later that there was a festival there three or four times a year when the whole countryside came to make offerings and pray but at other times it stood empty and unused the daily worship taking place at the shrines in each house i came out of the temple and looked around there was another one a short distance away and here i was brought up with a round turn at a statue before the door it was a stone figure more than lifesize of a hideous old woman perhaps a witch she had huge pendulous breasts and the face of an animal her body appeared to be covered in hair in the talons of her hands she held a baby and she was about to eat it the children were still following me i stopped and stared at this monstrosity and they gathered around me one little girl went and patted the stone figure and said rangda whatever the thing was it didnt seem to worry them a bit i left the enigma and found my way back to my own place connie was up and sitting at the entrance to his house in a deckchair madй jasmi was still sitting at the corner of his house weaving her offerings he said something to her and got up to meet me and she came back in a minute with another deckchair and i sat down beside him i told him where i had been and what i had seen and i asked him about the hideous statue outside the temple he laughed oh thats rangda he said thats the death temple where they do cremations rangda symbolises death and evilall the bad things of this world to make it perfectly dear shes usually shown eating a baby well i said that doesnt seem to leave much doubt he smiled no the opposite to rangda is the force of good or life hes the barong the barongs an animal thats a cross between a lion and a bull very fierce at one season of the year mummers go round every village and act a sort of play they have a pantomime barong with two men in it and this has to fight a pantomime rangda it goes on for hours im not sure who wins but everybody gets very excited about it specially the children is all this hinduism i asked uncertainly he shook his head its something much olderanimism i think youd call it its not got much to do with the daily worship although of course it all gets a bit mixed up what madй is making she looked up at the mention of her name and smiled is offerings for the shines here in the house those are for the hindu gods in the shrines the one in the big shrine in the corner is the kingpinthats surya the sun god then theres brahma and vishnu and shiva and ganesh and half a dozen others madй doesnt know them all the only ones she knows are surya and shiva she picked shiva when she was a little girl because the shrine was the fourth from the left and she liked that one best perhaps she was four years old shes always said her prayers to shiva ever since she asked the pemangkoe oncehes the local priestshe asked him who lived in that one and he told her shiva so she says her prayers and makes her offerings to shiva i asked is there an image in the shrine i didnt see one he smiled no image shiva likes to come down and live in a bit of quartz she got the pemangkoe to show it to me the other day he keeps it in a sort of cupboard with a lot of other bits of thingsa piece of coral a bit of lava a bit of carved ivory one for each god shivas spiritual home is this bit of quartz on holy days the priest takes them out and puts each in its own shrine and then the god comes down and takes possession of it the soul of the god that is she works for days before that holy day to make offerings that will please the god not only palm lamaks like theseshell kill a duck and roast it and dress it up nicely as a cold roast duck with little sweet rice cakes all round she mustnt smell it if she can avoid it because that takes the essence of it thats reserved for the god he paused when the great day comes the takes her offering and lays it down before the shrine roast duck and all and kneels down to say her prayers the priest comes along and sprinkles it and her with holy water while she prays and the soul of the god comes down out of the shrine while she is praying and he takes the soul of the roast duck and the soul of the rice cakes and the soul of the lamaks she stays there praying for an hour or more than that and she feels good after it so she knows that the god is pleased with her shiva doesnt want whats left of the roast duck and the rice cakes hes taken their soul and so only the husks so to speak are left she can have those and so she picks them up when shes done praying and takes them away to eat and has a feast with her friends i got a bit of shivas offering for supper the day before yesterday i couldnt make out if he was making a joke of it all or not i said uncertainly that sounds like a very debased sort of religion is it he said thoughtfully im not so sure it keeps her praying i didnt quite know what to say to that one what does she pray for all the usual things he said she prays for her mother for her good health and long life she prays for her father that he may rest quietly and that his ghost shant come and trouble them she prays for a good rice crop and for good fishing and she prays for her brother and for her cousins who are children that they may grow up clean and good and because shes a girl she prays for a man that she can love and respect and she prays for children by him and that she may stay faithful to him and he to her until they die she probably spends an hour upon her knees in prayer each day and double that on holy days apart from the amount of time she spends in making up the offerings i dont know that you can say that its a bad sort of religion i dont know that you can say its a good one i replied it seems to me that these people are naturally devout and thats all about it maybe so he said thoughtfully somebody once said it doesnt matter much what you believe in so long as you believe in something these people here believe that their religion helps them to lead better lives if we think that the impulse is from their own nature not from the religion does it matter does it matter much if they believe in jesus or shiva or mahomet or gautama so long as the results are good slowed if i know i said perhaps it doesnt i dont know nor i he said i only know that the results here are good and i like to see it i glanced at him you like this place all right he nodded yes he said i like it here i was afraid there might not be enough work for you i said enough interests in training and directing other people which is what you are good at he smiled cant you believe that im a normal man and that i like to draw my pay for doing nothing and be lazy no i said it would be all too easy if you were like that why do you think im not youd be living with madй jasmi if you were as you say i remarked phinit hasnt wasted much time he sat silent for a little behind his hut the sun was going down the small buildings were casting long shadows and the air was golden with the light of sunset i was very tired when i came here he said at last it was time for me to get out of things and sit quiet for a time and think where i was going these weeks have been very good for me i think and where are you going connie i asked him do you want to go back into the active life again or to stay here what do you think i ought to do he asked you know me well enough by now to say perhaps it was as nadezna had said he wanted someone to advise him i said well this job is pretty stable far as one can see ill probably be getting a small passenger machine before long a dove perhaps and then well run that down here turn and turn about with the tramp that means therell be an aircraft down here every week within a few months and youll have a bit more work then i was talking to gain time and he knew it i think you ought to settle down here i said quietly take whats given you and be happy with it marry madй jasmi and raise a family like an ordinary man he smiled and you he said are you an ordinary man i wasnt ready for that one you mean im a fine one to talk i know that you have been married he said and that it ended in a tragedy but is that any reason why you should not marry again will you ever be really happy till you do all very well to swing it over on to me like this i said its you that i was talking about you and madй jasmi he smiled and i was talking about you thats not fair i said stick to the subject she would marry you if you asked her he observed i knew that of course when i lived in bahrein and gujar singh he tells me that she is in love with you gujar it seemed was something of a twoway street i wouldnt ask any girl to marry me and raise a family in the persian gulf i said the summers are too bad if i did that i should want to give up everything and go and find another job in a cold climate in england or america perhaps i dont know that im ready to do that yet ive started something and ive got to see it through so the work comes before the chance of marriage and children and a quiet home he said if you put it that way i said yes i think it does and so it does with me there was a pause we are two men of the same temperament he said madй would marry me tonight if i should say the word i dont think she knew what he was saying but she heard her name and knew that we were talking about her and she looked up smiling if we did that i should stay here of course probably for ever living is cheap and easy here and while there are aeroplanes and an airstrip upon bali there will be casual work for an engineer to let him earn the few guilders that mean wealth among these people i would not take her from this place into the world outside here she is known and loved and happy but in the outside world she would be treated as a savage marriage with one of these people means a life spent in this place and there are few better places in the whole wide world to spend ones life he paused only the work prevents we sat silent for a little and then he went on this power of the job so much greater than we ourselves when you came to bahrein with one foxmoth to do a little charter work you never thought that you were setting up a power that would rule your life impede your marriage dictate where and how you were to live when a good man employs others he becomes a slave to the job for the job is the guarantee for the security of many men so when a man speaks candidly in the hangar of the things the ethics of the work that he believes in he may bring others to believe in those things too and to depend upon his words then he too is a slave to his own job because if he relaxes his endeavours to teach men proper ways of work and life he may destroy the faith he has created in them and so throw them back into an abyss of doubt and fear and degradation lost indeed he paused i think that we are very much alike you and me both in our own way in the same boat both going round the bend a bit if you ask me i said a little bitterly yes he said thoughtfully perhaps the road has a curve in it perhaps it is necessary to go round the bend a little before you can see clearly to the end nadezna would be very happy if you were to marry madй i said it was my last argument she wants to see you married very much indeed he smiled gently shes been a good sister tom not many women would have left california to come to the persian gulf to live as an arab woman in the souk merely to look after me will you give her a message from me of course i will i said what is it tell her that i should be very happy if she were to marry you i cant tell her that i think you can i hedged i might in my own time but not just yet tell her in your own time he said but be sure that you tell her it was nearly dark the girl got up from beside our feet and said something to connie he exchanged a word or two with her and she went away supper he said we have it soon after dark here i usually go to bed after that and get up before dawn its the best routine in a place like this i think i said something or other agreeing with him and then i said nadezna was going to come down with me on this trip for the holiday but then she thought shed better keep away till things were settled between you and madй things are settled now he said but not the way she wanted them to be madй knows that does she he nodded if it looks like being difficult for her i shall go away live in den pasar perhaps and buy a bicycle and come to work on that he paused but very soon i think that there may be a change what sort of change i asked he said vaguely a change i dont know what sort of change but i think perhaps a change is coming and quite soon i see i said he glanced at me have you got any other message for me that you have not told me yet not exactly a message i said slowly but there is something youll have to know i had a visit a few days ago from wazir hussein the sheikh of khulal is a very old man now perhaps dying he nodded i know that he is near his time hes very anxious to see you before he goes i said and then i hesitated it seemed such a stupid thing to say to my chief engineer hewell he wants to get your blessing hes chartered the tramp and hell be coming here to visit you on the next trip hell be here in about ten days from now hes liable to die upon the journey isnt he i dont know if he is its a risk that theyre prepared to take were rigging up a bed for him in the fuselage is the imam coming with himthe imam from baraka i dont know i said i know theres quite a party coming to look after him seven or eight of them at least i would have gone to him he said why strain an old man to come all this way i offered that connie but they wouldnt have it i told him they seemed to think that he should come to you he nodded you see the workings of the job he said once you start something you must see it through i am at much enmeshed in my net as you are in yours only by an act of treachery to those who believe in us can either of us escape and god shall make thy soul a glass where eighteen thousand aeons pass and them shall see the gleaming worlds as men see dew upon the grass james elroy flecker i look back on the ten days that we spent in bali before the arab party came as one of the happiest periods of my life for the first time in many years it was impossible for me to control events in any way that of itself might not have freed me from the worries and the strain of my responsibilities but being with connie did we had no more serious conversation there was little to do in the workshop except painting and distempering which was being done by a couple of balinese boys from the village who were doing it very well each morning soon after dawn we would stroll over to the hangar and see them started working under phinit and as the sun got warm we would go off and go down to the beach and bathe it would have been just perfect if nadezna could have been with us we didnt go far from pekendang there are forty thousand temples in bali i believe but i only saw the one i never was much of a sightseer connie had wandered fairly widely inland and had been up to the central volcanic mountain kintamani but transport wasnt easy and he seemed to think that when one had seen and absorbed pekendang the rest was largely repetition we went once or twice to a place the other side of the strip called sanoer where a belgian artist was married to a very fine balinese woman i think that was the most wonderful house i have ever been in the walls covered with paintings of the balinese and their way of life and full of balinese young men and women so that it was difficult to say in memory which of the scenes remembered from that house were real ones and which were paint we saw a good deal of the headman of the village wajan rauh he used to come and sit and talk to us sometimes about the crops and the fishing and about the dutch and the fullscale war that they were waging against the indonesians in java and sumatra i could not understand these conversations and i used to sit back smoking watching the old man and his friends watching connie as he talked to them one did not need any interpreter to see how greatly they valued his advice all through my life i had seen him gain this influence over people it had been the same story even in cobhams circus as a boy i think and certainly it had been so in damrey phong in rangoon in bahrein i do not think he ever worked for it or sought this influence when simple people came and told him things that troubled them which they did very often he gave them straightly what advice he could and his manner of doing it encouraged them so that they came back with more important and more intimate matters for his ruling i think thats all there was to it he told me that they thought little of the war in java they did not greatly care who ruled them whether the radjas who had ruled before the dutch came and who still ruled them in name or whether the dutch the balinese had no national ambitions all they wanted to do was to get on with their farming and their temple festivals and let the world go by them they had no desire whatever to become involved in great events if the dutch or the indonesians or anyone else wanted to come and rule them they were welcome to do so thought the balinese they were shrewd enough to know that in the case of one small selfsupporting island it could not make any great change in their daily lives because they thought so very highly of connie and because i was his guest the village went out of their way to show me all their arts they put on a dance one evening a most complicated and picturesque affair of stylised dancing by little girls eleven or twelve years old dressed heavily in goldembroidered skirts and jackets sewn with tiny mirrors and enormous golden headdresses this dance was called legong it was danced to the music of an orchestra of bamboo xylophones and small brass gongs it went on for over threehours and seemed to be an affair for the whole village when one xylophone player tired another took his place and the little dancers danced in relays too though the two chief ones danced the whole evening with only short pauses for rest the village sat around in a rough square that formed the stage and children played about among the dancers who avoided them skilfully and dogs walked through from time to time a mother would get up and go out on the boor to adjust the clothing of a little dancer that was slipping and the dance went on at about ten oclock at night it stopped quite suddenly and for no particular reason and the people all streamed away to bedgossiping and chatting well content cockfighting was a sport of the men and they held a main in my honour i had never seen it before although it still goes on in england quietly and illegally it is a cruel sport of course because the fight is to the death and usually bloody it was not the sadist angle that appealed to the balinese though but the opportunity for betting they are tremendous gamblers and bet furiously on their cockfights though i think that this is general in southeast asia phinit told me that in his mothers village in siam they breed small fish three or four inches long that will fight fiercely to the death when put together and the people bet on those they put on a play for me one night entirely incomprehensible to me and i think to connie also it was quite colourful and it was amusing to sit in a deckchair and watch madй jasmi i think didnt understand much of it either because it dealt with very highborn people kings and princes who for the sake of verisimilitude spoke a regal dialect called kawi which nobody of common clay can understand madй jasmi evidently thought i needed sustaining through this entertainment because she kept bringing me glasses of toeak palmjuice beer in the end the performance came suddenly to an unexpected finish as the dance had done and people and actors melted quickly away i cannot describe the grace and the charm of that small village it was like nothing i had ever seen before i shall find nothing like it in this world again i suppose there always must be something or there would be nothing to distinguish places such as that from those that we have been taught to look forward to in the world to come in this case it was the physical condition of connie shak lin that began to worry me as i have said he had grown very thin i doubt if he weighed more than about eight stone at that time and yet he was a big man five foot ten or eleven in height when we went bathing together i could see every bone in his body so it seemed and i began to get a little worried about him he ate fairly well though nothing like as much as i did he didnt smoke or drink he never had he was well in himself at least when i was there but he had little energy and spent a good part of each day within his hut lying upon the charpoy dozing or asleep he had a great store of nervous energy that he could call upon however it had not distressed him unduly to work most of the night upon the aircraft when it had been there and he could sit for hours in the evening talking and discussing with the old men there seemed to be nothing really wrong with him and certainly nothing that required a doctor butwell i was a bit uneasy over him as i have mentioned he was very thin after a few days of this idyllic life we began to make preparations for the arab party it was a bit tricky because i had to get the permission of the dutch governor for the party to come to the island at all and though i didnt expect any difficulty it did mean that i had to disclose the fact that they were coming on a pilgrimage five thousand miles or so to see my chief engineer which was unusual to say the least the governor spoke no english and in any case he was too high a dignitary for me to approach direct i went and called on mr bergen his second in command who had served with the american army in the war and spoke english as well as i did he was interested to hear that this arab sheikh and his retinue were coming to visit bali he had already had a telegram about them from his headquarters in batavia which was quite incomprehensible to him and he was glad to find somebody who could inform him on the matter only the crews of aircraft people such as myself and my pilots and ground engineers can move easily about the world these days and sheikh abd el kadir and wazir hussein and all the rest of them had to have passports and visas for their journey before i left captain morrison had been getting busy with all this and the foreign office in london had requested permission for their visit from the dutch ambassador in london as a matter of diplomatic urgency morrison must have been very positive with the resident back in distant bahrein because cables had been flying backwards and forwards halfway round the world in english and in dutch so that a notification of permission for this visit had come to the governor of bali from his immediate superior without any information what the visit was about probably the people in batavia didnt know themselves i suppose i was a coward but i really didnt feel equal to explaining to this dutchman that the sheikh of khulal was coming to get connies blessing i felt that it was better to go softly on the religious side i stressed the vast wealth of the sheikhs and their power to indulge their slightest whim i said that this sheikh and connie had become great friends during his time at bahrein and now that the old man felt his end approaching he wanted very much to see connie again and say goodbye to him i said confidentially that to europeans like us a journey of this sort might appear unreasonable but that he of course was accustomed to asiatic ways of thought which were not always quite upon our lines i said that the desire of the old man to see his friend for the last time had become an obsession with him and his position in the persian gulf was such that the british government were anxious to oblige him hence the permission which had been requested for this visit on the highest level and which had been granted by the dutch in holland this went down all right and mr bergen went out of his way to help me to arrange accommodation for the party there were few people staying on the island at the time and the bali hotel built for a considerable tourist trade before the war was not more than half full as is common in the indonesian islands this hotel was built in bungalow style and spread widely as a number of little suites built around courtyards somewhat in the manner of a very good american motel i got a row of six of these rooms for the party each with two beds and a bathroom and a sitting veranda and i arranged for two cars for their use the tramp came in to schedule in the late afternoon connie and phinit and i were there to meet it of course we stood in the shade of the hangar and watched it touch down on the strip and run to a standstill it turned and taxied towards us and i saw the familiar bearded face of gujar singh in the chief pilots seat on the port side he taxied to the hangar and swung it round accurately into position for pulling in then he stopped the engines and we went forward to the door tarik opened up from the inside and put down the steps and wazir hussein came down first grave and dignified in long white skirts as ever he told us that the old sheikh had stood the journey well he was tired but not unreasonably so there were nine of them in the party all told including the imam from baraka and the sheikhs personal physician a frenchspeaking arab who came i think originally from tunis i told him the arrangements i had made and i showed him the two cars which were at their disposal then i handed over to connie who went up into the machine to greet the old man and i retired myself into the background gujar singh came out of the machine in a few minutes and came over to where i was standing by the bowser ready to refuel the tramp i asked him how the trip had gone he said it had been normal the old sheikh had been interested in the details of the flight and had followed their journey on the maps with a good deal of intelligence at every night stop the most elaborate arrangements had been made for them at karachi and at calcutta and at singapore a fleet of cars had been waiting on the tarmac to meet the aircraft and suites of rooms had been reserved at the best hotels the difficulty was to prevent taking on more passengers he said smiling it is not possible to keep a journey that concerns shak lin a secret at every stop ten or fifteen engineers came to me or to hosein or to the wazir asking if they might join us to come here to listen to the teacher the wazir consulted me and i advised him to refuse them all i think that was the best otherwise there would have been too great a crowd that would have tired the sheikh loo much it was like that was it i asked thoughtfully everywhere people knew about this journey he said it is the radio operators of course talking with each other everywhere people wanted to come too i could have filled the aircraft three times over while we were talking the arabs were getting out of the aircraft organised by connie there was a bustle of flowing white skirts and black beards and then the old sheikh himself appeared helped down the steep duralumin steps of the tramp by a couple of his retinue i went up and said something to welcome him and he recognised me and smiled and wazir hussein translated for him thanks be to allah he said they had had a safe and an easy journey in the hands of gujar singh he was not tired and he was grateful to me for the arrangements i had made for his comfort i replied that anything i had done for him was nothing in comparison with what he had done for me and he smiled again when that was translated then he turned away and spoke to the imam and said something about sunset prayer that didnt concern me of course as a european and an unbeliever and so i excused myself and went up into the cabin of the tramp with gujar to inspect the aircraft and the journey log hosein was there tidying up and putting maps and instruments away into their stowages and i told him that prayer was about to take place and he could go down to it if he wished gujar didnt want to go he often used to go to connies prayer meetings outside the hangar at bahrein but not i think when there was an imam conducting the rakats perhaps that made the prayers too officially moslem so that a good sikh could not participate i stood at the chart table in the tramp behind the pilots seats watching the arabs through the little navigators window connie had marked out a small square area of ground beside the hangar with white stones and he had had the grass cut here by two balinese boys so that it made a small level sward the square was carefully oriented towards mecca and in the northwest side there was the usual semicircular indent tarik and the other servants brought three carpets from the tramp and spread them on the ground inside this square the imam took his place in the indent and they began their devotions connie knelt beside the old sheikh in prayer motionless all the time he did not follow the others in the ritual of moslem devotions the standing the kneeling the prostrations he remained kneeling all the time the old sheikh had one of his retinue each side of him who helped him to his feet each time from the kneeling position he was evidently getting very feeble phinit was there praying with them like connie he remained kneeling all the time but his position was just outside the square he was a buddhist i think it must have been something quite exceptional that connie should have prayed inside their prayer ground amongst the moslems and yet not go through the ritual of their devotions the prayers lasted for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes then they were over and i went down and drove with the party into den pasar to see them comfortably installed in the hotel connie stayed with fhinit at the airstrip to refuel the tramp it is better in the tropics to keep fuel tanks always full to prevent condensation troubles there were not going to work late however as the aircraft would be there for a full day and could be serviced normally in working hours i stayed that night in the hotel myself to be on hand to assist the arabs if they got into any difficulty i had a room on the far side of the courtyard from them in order to be near and yet not be obtrusive they had brought a moslem cook with them to ensure that no unclean meat was prepared for their food i took this chap along and introduced him to the kitchen staff and i arranged for one of the cars with a driver to be permanently on call parked near their rooms there was nothing else they wanted so i went and changed and had a bath myself and had a bols and dinner they had phinit up there that evening but not connie from my suite across the courtyard i could see him squatting on the ground talking to the old sheikh and his wazir i found later that connie had spent the evening quietly in pekendang apparently he was in a position to dictate to these arab princes who had come six thousand miles to see him when he would see them and when he would rest in default of connie they had got hold of phinit and i had little doubt that they were hearing from phinit heavily embroidered stories of the asceticism of the teacher madй jasmi would come into this i thought but there was nothing i could do about it once talking with the desperate humour of fatigue to nadezna i had spoken of the gospel according to st phinit perhaps i thought as i looked out across the courtyard the first chapters of that gospel were already taking shape when i got up next morning soon after dawn the arabs were already gone they met connie down at the hangar on the airstrip for the sunrise prayer at about six oclock they must have stayed there for two hours or so because when i was ready to go down to the airstrip at about halfpast eight they arrived back in the two cars i waited till the sheikh was settled back into his room and then went over to see wazir hussein to find out what his plans were he told me that they were to meet the teacher again in the cool of the evening and that they would like to start back for bahrein next morning after the sunrise prayer i got a car and went down to the airstrip to see what was happening to the tramp i found connie and phinit working to give her the routine check over with gujar and hosein helping them they had got the cowlings open and they were checking the filters changing the sparking plugs and examining contact breakers there was a defective directional gyro to be changed nothing indicated that there was anything unusual about my party at all it was just a large aeroplane being serviced by a good crowd of asiatics i found that connie already knew about the plan to start back for bahrein next day and he was working through the heat of the day to get the servicing of the aircraft finished by midafternoon there was nothing much that i could do to help them i told connie that i would move back to my hut in pekendang for that last night for i was going back to bahrein with the sheikhs party i wanted to spend the last night of my holiday in pekendang rather than in the civilised luxury of den pasar my car was waiting for me at the small airport bungalow and i walked from the hangar to it across the sundrenched tarmac as i got near the bungalow another car drove up one of the two allocated to the arabs it had only two people in the sheikhs personal physician and the wazir hussein i went up to their car as it came to a standstill and spoke to the wazir i told him that i was just going back to the hotel to check out and said that if he wished i would settle the bill for their party and invoice him for it in bahrein i told him that i was going to spend the night myself in pekendang and that i would join them for the return flight at the airstrip in the morning we talked about these matters for a few moments and then he said i am glad that we have met you here mr cutter there is another matter which i came here to discuss with you if i could find you he turned to introduce his companion this is dr khaled i bowed and said something or other the doctor was dressed in a grey european suit and a panama hat he had a short black beard trimmed to a neat point he might have been fortyfive or fifty years old conversation with him was difficult because he could only speak french and arabic i know hardly any french and my arabic at that time although adequate for the hangar and the direction of casual labour wasnt good enough for a prolonged conversation on any subject but aircraft the wazir said dr khaled is worried about the health of el amin mr cutter he would like to ask you a few questions and perhaps talk also to the teacher of course i said im not too happy myself i took them through into the small veranda with a few chairs and tables that served for an airport restaurant it was a shady place where we could talk quietly looking out over the strip i ordered coffee but that was difficult so we drank fresh lime squashes ill tell you anything i can i said the wazir had to translate for us i think dr khaled understood a little english though he could not speak it he wanted to know at once what connie weighed but i could not tell him that he asked if his emaciation was a recent matter i told him that connie had certainly been heavier when he had joined me nearly three years before but that i had not noticed any very sudden change he asked if he had been ill and i said that he had never had any time off he asked if he was eating well and here i was able to give him some definite information about connies habits of life having lived with him for ten days he was interested in his lassitude when there was no work to be done and asked several questions about that he asked about women after a quarter of an hour of this the wazir asked if i thought connie would permit the doctor to make an examination of him i said i thought that was a very good idea and that connie should certainly take this opportunity to be checked over i indicated as politely as i could that though connie might be a prophet to them he was an employee to me and that if i said hed got to have a medical examination hed bloody well have one we walked back to the hangar and i got connie down off the machine and introduced him to dr khaled connie spoke fluent arabic of course and he knew dr khaled well from his visits to the sheikhs palace at baraka he made no objection to a medical examination and they went off together to the workshop dr khaled carrying a black case in his hand i took wazir hussein back to the restaurant and sat with him there till the doctor joined us he came after about three quarters of an hour connie had gone back to work upon the tramp the wazir questioned him at once and translated his replies to me the examination had revealed nothing particularly wrong beyond the obvious fact that connie was exceedingly thin and had only small reserves of physical energy in general he was careful with his health apart from the fact that throughout his life he had been in the habit of eating what the native peoples of the countries that he lived in ate and drinking what they drank he had had malaria of course but it had not troubled him recently perhaps because i always issued ample supplies of paludrine to any of my party who were travelling away from bahrein thats an economy measure of course because if an aircraft gets delayed because the crew are ill you can lose hundreds and hundreds of pounds easy as wink i always made the money side of illness clear to everybody and my pilots and my engineers appreciated that and took far more care over my money than they would ever have done over their own health connie had taken paludrine regularly while he had been in bali and his malaria had not recurred the doctor said that he had taken samples of sputum blood and urine and he had these in test tubes in his case there were no facilities in bali for an analysis of these samples he had good connections with hospitals in karachi and in cairo where such things could be investigated and since the aircraft would be passing through karachi in three days time he proposed to put his test tubes in a thermos jar full of ice and stop off in karachi while the analysis was carried out and come on to bahrein by air line as soon as he had the report he wanted to know if the wazir would agree to this or if he would prefer him just to leave the samples and travel to bahrein with the old sheikh in which case the report from the karachi hospital would come on by post the wazir was emphatic that he must complete the journey to bahrein with the sheikh and see him safely installed back in his palace at baraka after that and if the sheikh was in good health he could return to karachi if necessary for a consultation about connies samples he asked me if i could provide an aircraft to take the doctor back to karachi if that should be necessary i said of course i could do that if there was no convenient machine upon a scheduled service i went on to suggest that perhaps it might be a good thing to make some contact with the dutch doctor in den pasar now since if any treatment should prove to be necessary it would hardly be practical for it to be directed from bahrein the wazir said blandly that if any treatment should be necessary he did not think that his master would agree that it should be put into the hands of the local doctor in bali until the samples had been examined it was impossible to say what was required but if the matter should be serious in any way his master would consider the health of el amin to be as important as his own and much more so if that should be the case he was sure that his master would say that a specialist should be engaged in europe and should fly to bali to be in attendance upon el amin for as long as was required he did not think that his master would like a local doctor to attend el amin we left the matter so i had already had a good deal of experience of how these fierce proud arabs who led simple and ascetic lives themselves could handle the unlimited money that was at their command in any cause that touched on their religion people who would lend a man like me sixty thousand pounds merely to keep the business that employed el amin free from usury would not hesitate to pay a man from harley street ten thousand pounds to drop everything and fly to bali and stay there a month to suggest that they would do otherwise would be offensive to them as suggesting that they put their riches before their religious beliefs i did not see connie until late that night or not to talk to i went back to den pasar and did my business with the hotel and packed my bag and took a car back to pekendang i got there about midday and madй jasmi came to me as soon as i arrived and asked by signs if i wanted to eat i ate what she brought me and then as connie had not turned up i managed to make her understand that she was to take a bowl of rice and curry to the hangar and she went off carrying the bowl wrapped in a cloth and a basket of fruit connie came back about the middle of the afternoon and went straight to his charpoy he did not appear till half an hour before sunset when he went over to the strip again to meet the arabs for then prayers i sat in a deckchair and waited for them to come back and presently gujar singh appeared strolling through the village and i called him and he came and talked to me an hour after sunset connie came back to the village walking slowly and flopped down in a deckchair outside his house i got up and went over to him gujar slipped away i sat down on the wooden step that led up to connies house the place where madй usually sat tired i asked he said a bit it takes it out of you talking to these people youve got to be right so exactly right the whole of the time i nodded well all be gone tomorrow i said then you can rest for a week if you want to he was silent for a time and then he said did that doctor tell you anything i shook my head so far as i know he didnt find anything the matter with you hes going to have those samples analysed he said he found something all right i glanced up at him quickly what did he find i dont know nothing that you can put your finger on perhaps but hes good that chapand cagey too hed never say a word to anyone till he was certain he thinks theres something wrong with me and hes got an idea in his head of what it is i couldnt make him tell me though i was disturbed he didnt give us that impression perhaps he found he could fox you more easily than me what sort of thing does he think wrong with you i dont know with a man like that no one will know until hes certain of his facts i didnt pursue the subject because i didnt want to turn his mind to sickness instead i asked about the tramp and got his report she was all ready to go first thing next morning he said he thought the sunrise prayer would take half an hour or so then we could put the old sheikh straight into the aircraft and get started up madй came with food but he ate very little i said presently nadezna was coming down with me this time connie but then she decided not to you wouldnt mind her coming down here if she wants a holiday id like to have her here he said itld be good for her to get away from the gulf for a bit and then he said you will give her my message in my own time and when i think she wants to hear it i said yes ill give it her nothing more happened that evening he was evidently very tired indeed and that i put down to the fatigue of his religious ministrations to the sheikh he only pecked at his food and ate half an orange and very soon he went into his hut and lay down on the bed we were all up before dawn as usual but early as i was connie was earlier he had already gone down to the strip when i came out madй jesmi brought me coffee and fruit as a breakfast and i packed my small bag and waved the farewell that i could not say to the villagers and walked down to the airstrip the sun was just coming up when i got there and the arabs and connie were at their devotions in the marked out square beside the hangar with the imam leading in the rakats the tramp had been drawn out of the hangar and parked in front of it and as i walked across the strip i could see gujar already in the cockpit busying himself with the preliminaries of flight prayers lasted for about half an hour as connie had said they would and then we were ready to go while hosein made out the flight plan and went through the formalities in the control office gujar and i helped the old sheikh up the duralumin ladder into the cabin of the tramp and saw his retinue install him comfortably on the divan bed then gujar and connie went up into the cockpit and started up the engines in that climate motors dont take very long to warm up and in five minutes they were running through the cockpit drill the runup over they stopped both motors again and waited for hosein to come and while we were waiting connie came down and sat crosslegged on the floor talking quietly to the sheikh sitting on his divan then hosein came and got into the aircraft and went past up to the cockpit his hands full of documents and log books connie got up and glanced at me and i nodded and said ready to go now he turned to the sheikh and said quietly in arabic may god strengthen you and the old man said alaikum as salam which means on you be peace then connie got down on to the strip and put up the ladder to us from the ground and i closed the door and tarik stowed the ladder i went forward and got up into the cockpit and sat at the navigators table and gujar in the pilots seat with hosein at his side started the motors and we taxied down the sunbaked turf to the end of the runway and took off that journey was just one of many journeys that i made along that route and i cannot now remember much about it i think we stopped at penang and at allahabad but for the life of me i cant remember and it doesnt matter anyway i know we got to karachi about midday after a dawn start and as we hoped to get the old sheikh back to bahrein that night for him to sleep in comfort in the sheikh muhammads palace wazir hussein put dr khaled in a car with his samples and told him to drive quickly to the city hospital and leave his samples to be analysed and come back immediately so that we could take off karachi civil airport is about fifteen miles out of the city and it was an hour and a half before he came back and we were able to get under way again we were all of us in a hurry to get on because none of us were particularly happy about the condition of the sheikh it was obvious that the long journey to bali and the excitement there and the strange accommodation and the long journey back had tired him very much there is an insidious sort of fatigue in travelling in an unsoundproofed aeroplane after the first few minutes you dont notice the noise at all and you think nothing of it but at the end of the day you may find yourself too tired to eat too tired to sleep without a drug the pilots knew all about this of course and none of us ever flew in my machines without our ears being stuffed with cottonwool which makes all the difference gujar had tried to get the old man to use cottonwool on the flight out and i tried on the way back to make him use it but although he did make some effort to cooperate he never kept it in for very longpartly i think because his ears were full of hairs and the wool worried him because of this he was very very tired on the last leg of the journey home he sat or lay propped up with cushions on his divan and he no longer wanted to look at the maps or hear where we were or any of the details of the flight he did not talk to anyone and he refused all food though now and again he took a few sips of water i know before we reached karachi dr khaled had suggested to him that we should stop there for the night or possibly for more nights than one but he had got a bottle from the old sheikh who was only anxious now to get back to the places and the people that he knew he wanted to be back in his palace at baraka even if it killed him we made a night landing at bahrein at about halfpast eight local time i had been talking to them on the radio for the last hour and telling them to ring through to sheikh muhammads wazir to tell him that the sheikh of khulal would be arriving at the aerodrome at eightthirty very tired by his long journey and to ask for cars to be on the tarmac for the party without fail to meet us when we landed one of my pals from the chummery a bloke called alec scott was in the control room and i didnt scruple to call him every ten minutes in the last hundred and fifty miles to make sure that he had passed on all my messages so when we taxied to a standstill before our hangar in the floodlit darkness and stopped the engines the maroon hudson was alongside the machine before we could get the steps down we were able to get the old man down on to the ground and into the car within five minutes he could hardly stand alone and drove away with one of his servants sitting on each side of him on the broad rear seat to hold him erect in case he should fall sideways on a corner he was as bad as that there were other cars there for the rest of the party and their luggage and in ten minutes or so they too were gone i stood with gujar singh and watched the last car disappear into the darkness we were all tired too well thank the lord weve got him home safely i said heavily i wouldnt have liked it if hed died on the way home i was afraid of that said gujar it would have made great trouble if he had died in india a hindu country i do not think he could have been buried there if that had happened i would have suggested that we just flew on as quickly as we could and brought him home we couldnt have done that i said not for two days in heat like this we could have flown high above the freezing level wed never have got him through the customs at karachi i said but anyway he didnt die on us so thats all right but i was only partially correct because in fact the old man never left his palace again he died a few months later hed known that he was near the end of course before he started on his journey to see connie it was a disappointment to me that nadezna was not there to meet us i didnt look forward to the prospect of telling her that i had failed to make connie consider marrying madй jasmi but i had looked forward to meeting her all the same i went into the office and found my desk completely empty and bare not a paper on it except one little note which read dear mr cutter i know youll be tired when you get in so ive taken the in basket away and locked it up theres nothing urgent in it i hope youll take the hint and go to bed best wishes nadezna i grinned and took the hint and went to bed i was in the office bright and early next morning but nadezna was there before me and my desk was stacked with correspondence invoices receipts release notes official pamphlets and all the other paper clutter that a business can accumulate in a fortnight before beginning upon this i told her about connie and the girl i didnt cut any ice at all i said i dont think hes got any intention of marrying no she replied i dont think he has it was a chance though tell me is she nice shes a very nice girl i told her shes just a village girl of courseshe cant read or write hed have to make his life there if he married her but there are worse places to live than that they live simply and eat well her mother must be fortyfive at least and shes a beautiful woman still a man who was prepared to settle down and live there quietly could have a very happy life i thought it was like that she said but thats not connies way she paused and then she said oh well thats over then how was he in himself you mean his health she nodded i thought for a minute before replying i did not want to alarm her unduly hes very very thin i said at last he seems to get tired easily too i think hes quite all right though dr khaled examined him i told her about what was going on at karachi she wanted to know a lot of things then how he was eating how he was sleepingall the usual enquiries i had one or two to make of her has he ever had anything like this before i asked any sort of illness she shook her head not that i know of hes always been thin and hes always lived a great deal on his nerves i mean ive seen him get very tired sometimes when hes been talking a lot but i dont ever remember him being in the doctors hands at all its probably nothing i said he may need something with his diet down therecod liver oil and malt or something like that i settled down then to pick up the threads of my business and i worked with nadezna on the papers for the whole of that day johnson came on the telephone in the middle of the morning wanting to know the earliest date for the tramp to leave again for bali and for the maclean dakota to meet it there having given up a trip to the sheikh of khulal the arabiasumatra company had an accumulation of scientific equipment and staff wanting to go through to the east alligator river oil field as soon as possible i checked the work on the machine with chai tai foong and came back to the office and rang through to johnson and told him the machine could take off at dawn the day after tomorrow i got a cable off to maclean airways and then i sent for arjan singh and warned him for the trip with kadhim as second pilot i got up before dawn that morning to see the tramp loaded and to have a final word to the two pilots before they went i always think it helps if the boss shows up on an early morning show like that especially if its the start of a long flight there was really no need for me to be there of course arjan had done the trip several times before and though kadhim was new hed got over a thousand hours in with the iraqi air force and iraqi airways on the baghdadmosul route i said to arjan tell shak lin we got the old sheikh back all right hes still in bed thoughi think hes pretty sick shak lins sure to want to know how he is he nodded gravely i will tell him everything in the first light of dawn the tramp taxied down to the far end of the runway and took off over the sea and swept round in a great lefthand turn to get on course and vanished into the sunrise i went back to the chummery and had breakfast and shaved and went to the office i had a proctor booked to take a couple of surveyors out to a place called marib in the desert later in the day and i intended to take them myself since i should be fairly clear of office work at about halfpast eight half an hour before the surveyors were due the maroon hudson passed my office window with dr khaled and wazir hussein in it and swung round to park i was dictating to nadezna at the time christ i said look pack up this nip out and see if you can find gujar singh and tell him id like him to take this proctor to marib because im tied up here after all and looktell dunu to go over to the restaurant and order us three cups of coffeeturkish i got up to meet my visitors as they came in this is a great honour i said probably they had come to talk about connie but one had to let them start it in their own time i hope the sheikh of khulal was not too tired by the journey they said something or other and we made the usual polite conversation till the coffee came when dunu had gone out the wazir came to the point we have received the report about el amin from karachi he said it is not good oh i replied what does it say he spoke to khaled who produced a white printed form filled in with a few words of typescript the wazir handed it to me it was in english there are spaces for sputum and for urine and opposite each of these was typed the one word negative there was a space for blood and here was typed red cells million white cells with immature cells present there was a further space at the bottom for remarks and here it said chronic myelogenous leukaemia indicated by the blood count figures above from the number of primitive white cells present the disease would seem to be entering an acute phase that with a signature was all there was i looked up at hussein well this doesnt mean a thing to me i said what is myelogenous leukaemia ive never heard of it dr khaled tells us that it is a disease of the blood he said it is a very bad disease how bad i asked whats the treatment he turned and spoke to the doctor in arabic it was evidently the continuation of a discussion that had perhaps been gone over many times the doctor spoke emphatically with some gesticulation but he spoke arabic with a strange accent to me and he spoke quickly so that i could not get very much of what he said the wazir turned back to me it is a long and complicated treatment he said it needs xrays to cure it and very modern things that are not found in many cities of asia it would be better that shak lin should go to europe dr khaled says he can arrange treatment in paris i see i said i sat in thought for a few minutes there was no question of expense in my mind or of the work connies job at bali was a sinecure that could be done by any good reliable engineer if this thing was serious he must come straight back to bahrein and go on to paris or to london for his treatment i could get him back to england from bahrein in a couple of days i raised my head and spoke to the wazir he shall certainly go to europe for his treatment if hes really got this thing i said if we get him back to karachi for a start could we have him properly investigated at the hospital there in the light of this report to get a second opinion dr khaled said that could be done the next thing i said to wazir hussein is just this will he come he will come if you say that he must come the wazir said i think that you are right he would not change his way of life or travel to europe for his health for himself alone but if you say he must do that for reasons of your business i think he may agree i bit my lip i wasnt a bit sure myself connie was so much a part of the east that it was difficult to visualise him as a patient in a hospital ward in london or in paris in countries where he had no friends at all where nobody had any reverence for him i think the first thing to do is to get him back to karachi for a proper examination i said at last dr khaled spoke quickly to the wazir as i had thought he could understand english all right though he was reluctant to try to speak it the wazir turned to me my master wishes to spare no expense he said if he is to come to karachi for examination it would be better that a specialist should come from paris or from london to examine him at karachi in the hospital my master insists that he should have the best advice he paused and then he said this has been a great trouble to my master this news of el amin i said it is a great trouble to me too i sat in thought for a moment its bad luck that the tramp left this morning for bali i said it will be back here in nine days and going down againi glanced at the calendaron the fourteenth to get him back here on this trip means i must try and explain the situation to him in a telegram and persuade him to come back to hospital at karachi thats not going to be very easy wazir hussein asked if he came by the next trip when would he reach karachi on the twentysecond or the twentythird i said it means he wouldnt reach karachi for about three weeks from now we discussed this for a time if he could be induced by skilfully worded telegrams to come back to karachi with the present trip he could be there in about seven days time it was doubtful if the arabs with all the power of their wealth could get a specialist from europe there so soon as that they would have to write to their agents in london and the letter would take three days the man then had to be found and induced to leave his work in london or paris to fly to karachi no specialist of any repute would leave his other patients in midair and unattended whatever the fee paid it seemed to us that such a man would need at least a week to settle his affairs before coming out to karachi and then the flight would take at least two days it would be a fortnight at the earliest before he could be there dr khaled pressed by the wazir said that he did not think that el amins physical state would alter very greatly in a fortnight the disease was probably getting worse and if unattended death might well occur in a year or eighteen months since the specialist could hardly reach karachi for at least a fortnight if connie came on the next trip the greatest time that would be lost would be one week we decided that that would be the best course that he should come back upon the following trip wazir hussein said will you write him a letter yes i said slowly ill write to him by air mail i thought quickly it can go by orient airways tomorrow to karachi and ill get the pilot to see that it gets on to the klm for batavia there i knew that any letter for shak lin would get whatever special treatment was required wazir i said would your master the sheikh of khulal write a letter to el amin too we shall have difficulty in persuading him to leave his work and come to karachi to hospital i know a letter from your master would have weight with him he nodded gravely it shall be done i shall bring it here tomorrow after sunrise so that it can go with yours dr khaled said something and the wazir turned to me after a brief exchange it would be well that we should be certain that el amin will come to karachi he said perhaps it would be better that the specialist should go direct tobali but bali had no technical facilities such as karachi hospital had we talked about that for a time i tell you what ill do i said ill take the next trip down to bali myself as pilot if his sister wants to come ill take her too then well bring him back with us to karachi and meet the specialist there that settled that and they went away and i walked over to the hangar not because i had anything to do there but because i wanted to get out of the office for a few minutes to think over how i was to tell this to nadezna i went back presently and called her in from the other office and when she came i said bit of bad news nadezna they did a blood count at karachi it seems that connies got a thing they call leukaemia and then i told her all about it she took it amazingly well asiatics do take these things well of course they never show their grief by any extravagant display of emotion all she said was thats fatal isnt it hes going to die i was from the west and perhaps we kid ourselves more than they do oh its not as bad as that i said hell have to go into hospital for some sort of treatment possibly in europe hell be all right she shook her head i think this is the end of it she said ive heard about this thing what have you heard i asked theres no cure for it at all she said quietly they may take you into hospital and mess you about but once youve got it you die just the same i cant believe thats true i said i think it is i turned the subject and told her about the letter i was going to write she agreed that connie ought to come up to karachi and be properly examined and she said that she would write as well and then i said look nadezna i think ill go down to bali myself again on the next trip probably with hosein as second pilot i think it may take a bit of arguing to get him to come will you come with me this time i hesitated its not the holiday i wanted it to be but i think itld help if you came and then we can take him straight back to the hospital at karachi she said quietly you cant go away again so soon tom youve only just come back theres nothing for me to do here i said the business runs all right without me does it she asked i dont believe it does and then she said i sometimes wonder who this business is supposed to benefit you or connie i make money out of it i said she smiled no you dont ive never seen you spend a penny except on other people you could live in a big house with plenty of servants and run a bentley but you dont you go on living in the chummery and the sergeants mess and you drive a station wagon you dont make money at all tom you make aeroplanes thats what you do every penny that you make goes back into the business what if it does i asked i like aeroplanes i wouldnt want a bentley anyway i suppose youll tell me next that youre going down to bali again because you like flying in the tramp i laughed many a true word and then i said will you come with me for a joyride she said dear tom youve never quite got used to having me around have you no i said i dont suppose i ever shall its a fresh wonder every day i come into the office to find you here she smiled and smiling she was very lovely all right tom ill come to bali with you and well do what we can for connie after that our life at bahrein went on smoothly for a few days i saw wazir hussein again and heard of the energetic steps that he was taking to get a specialist out to karachi these efforts finally resulted in them getting a frenchman called m serilaud who seemed to be the authority on leukaemia in europe dr khaled said that he had worked in new york and in london and spoke english fluently which was a help the earliest that we could get him to karachi was the twentyseventh which gave us a good margin of time to get connie there to meet him i rang up captain morrison and he came to see me one evening and i told him everything that was going on he was friendly and helpful and said that if i wanted to bring connie back to bahrein there would be no difficulty from their end at all he indicated that he personally would welcome his return as a gesture that would help to heal the breach that had arisen with the sheikh of khulal inevitably the news got round in the souk that shak lin was ill and was coming to karachi for examination i dont know how these things get out in asiatic places i didnt tell anyone and i dont suppose the arabs in the sheikhs retinue did much talking though they may have done in any case it was all known in the town within a day and nadezna told me that wherever she went in the streets in the market in her house there were continuous enquiries after a day of this she had to give up going out in the streets and i sent the station wagon down to pick her up each morning and drive her home in the evening on the ninth of the month the tramp arrived back from bali dead on schedule it came in and landed about three oclock in the afternoon i walked out on to the tarmac to meet it when it came in the five passengers got out and were met by a young man from the oil company and then arjan came out and walked across to me he said that they had had a good trip with no special incidents there had been bad weather over sumatra which had delayed them half a day on the outward journey but on the homeward trip they had got through the intertropical front without much trouble and then he said i have letters for you from the governor and from shak lin i will fetch them and bring them to the office okay i said and i went back to the office myself because it was hot out on the tarmac arjan singh appeared in the office in a few minutes and laid them on my desk and then he went through into the other room perhaps to speak to nadezna or dunu i opened the first letter it was from the dutch governor in bali it ran dear sir it is with regret that i write to say that the continued residence of your engineer shak lin in bali is no longer acceptable to the royal netherlands government of indonesia i must demand that this man is removed from bali very soon and should be replaced by another engineer with neutral religious associations b hausmann governor i bit my lip and read it through again then i opened the one from connie he said that by that time i should have received a letter from the governor ordering him out of bali he was sorry that this had happened and that it was not due to any action on his part but due to circumstances out of his control that arjan singh could tell me about he thought that it would be better now that he should leave my service and he suggested that i should send down another engineer to work with phinit by the next machine he himself would leave on the same aircraft and he proposed to make his way to bangkok at the time he wrote that letter of course he hadnt received our air mail letters to him about leukaemia i got up heavily and went into the other office arjan singh was there talking to nadezna she had an open letter in her hand from her face i guessed that she had had the same news i did not want to talk about it in front of dunu i told arjan and nadezna to come into my office and when the door was shut and they were sitting down i asked whats all this about arjan this trouble down at bali he said two dakotaloads of pilgrims what he said three days after you left bali a dakota came to bali from bangkok it was chartered from the thaicambodia air line by a party of about thirty ground engineers from don muang most of them were engineers but some i think were from the siamese air force they came to visit shak lin and to pray with him they went away after one day then another dakota came with indians from allahabad and calcutta the dutch administrators were angry and they say that you should not have sent a man with a religious following to bali they do not encourage missionaries in bali they prefer that the people should continue in their own religion the governor gave me that letter to give you he paused that is all i know i was silent for a time then i said did you hear of any other machines going to bali with pilgrims he replied i heard talk at karachi airport that a dakota was leaving very soon with pilgrims i told them that it was forbidden but they said that shak lin was ill i think they mean to go they mustnt go i said when did you hear this last nightand this morning in favourable conditions usually late at night we could get karachi from bahrein on the radio telephone in a case such as this alec scott would probably let me speak to karachi myself i might be able to stop that machine from leaving who pays for all this i asked it must cost somebody a packet arjan said i asked that also the machine from bangkok was provided by the thaicambodia for a nominal charge onlyone hundred rupees somebody said the engineers at bangkok had agreed that each would work ten hours on the machine without pay in the next month so that the servicing and life of the aircraft should not suffer the pilots flew without pay of course being pilgrims themselves the engineers serviced the machine upon the flight without pay all the expenses to be met were petrol and oil and insurance and landing fees they say that each man had to pay two hundred and fifty rupees some of them had not got the money and their companies advanced wages to them so that they could join the flight and they would work the time off later so much in each week to repay the loan two hundred and fifty rupees is about twenty pounds it was a big sum for an asiatic engineer but it was by no means prohibitory and if the air line companies were prepared to help their men to go off on a trip like this by allowing them to work the advanced pay off over several months it might be that many such journeys would take place i already had abundant evidence that shak lins teachings had spread widely through the east and had resulted in a marked upgrading in the quality of aircraft maintenance if the employees of an air line wanted to go off on such a pilgrimage a worthwhile manager would encourage the project and make it easy for them to go knowing that such a religious experience would encourage the men and lower his maintenance costs if my own people had come up with such a proposition i should probably have taken that line myself there was no telling now where this thing would end what started this arjan i asked at last what put the idea into their heads weve never had anything like this happen before he said it was the sheikh of khulals pilgrimage i see they saw that trip go through and thought theyd do the same also he said the word got around by radio that shak lin is dying by my side nadezna stirred and then was quiet again i do not know if that report is true or not arjan went on but it is all over the east now that shak lin is a dying man and so on all the aerodromes engineers who work according to his teaching but have never seen him such men desire more than any earthly thing that they should see shak lin before he dies and hear his voice and hear his blessing on their work this is a thing that many men want more than anything else in the world so were likely to get a good many more dakotas going to bali i said thoughtfully i do not think that they will be able to go now he said i think the dutch will stop them it is too far for a dakota to fly from singapore to bali without landing for fuel and when they land at palembang or at batavia or sourabaya i think the dutch will stop them i do not think that such machines will get clearance from singapore now any more to fly to indonesia that seemed likely enough though whether the authorities at singapore would have the power or the will to raise a hornets nest by standing between dakotaloads of resolute pilgrims and their religious goal seemed to me to be doubtful arjan singh was obviously tired with his eight days flying and i let him go soon after that telling him that i was going to take the next trip down myself with hosein as copilot he was pleased to hear that i was going down myself again i think that is very good he said i think it will be good that you should be with the teacher at this time for a few days how is he taking it all arjan i asked is he very much upset he said a little pityingly was he upset when he left here mr cutter he is not like ordinary men nothing that is written for him can cause him to grieve only the errors of mankind do that he paused and then he said more practically there is a woman there who serves him madй jasmi she sees that he lacks nothing does not grow too tired i think she will attain a great advancement in the life to come he went away to eat and rest and i was left alone in the office with nadezna she said poor old connieto be kicked out of a second place for his religion and when weve just written to him about leaving and telling him about the blood count its too bad tom i know i said he doesnt have much luck and then i said hes going through a bad patch now of course but hell get through all right i suppose it was a mistake sending him to bali though it didnt seem like it at the time after hes got rid of this leukaemia thing well see if we can find a place for him where theyll like his religion somewhere in burma or siam would suit him best i think a buddhist country she smiled faintly but tom hes not in your employment any more hes resigned i said quickly he cant do that to me after being with me all this time im going to send him a cable now to say i wont accept his resignation you wont accept the fact that hes dying either will you she asked no i said i wont i wont accept that any more than ill accept his resignation hes going to get well she came over to where i was sitting and bent down and kissed me i stood up and held her in my arms for a minute its going to be all right i said there are times when things are a bit of a battle and this is one of them but its going to be all right we broke away presently and i sat down and wrote a cable to connie i said wont accept your resignation now or ever coming down myself next trip with nadezna to take you to karachi specialist arrives karachi th after treatment have new job for you in siam cutter nadezna stared at this what is this new job in siam she asked i havent thought it out yet i said frankly ill have it cut and dried before i see him weve got to give him something to look forward to and hang on to but you dont operate in siam at all tom i didnt operate in indonesia six months ago i said i took her down to the souk myself in the old dodge that night it was not possible to get the car up to her house so i stopped it at the end of the narrow alley and walked with her to the flight of steps that led up to her room then i went back and got into the station wagon again and on an impulse i drove out to the residency compound at jufair and went to call on captain morrison the liaison officer was out but he was somewhere not very far away his boy offered to go and tell him that i was waiting to see him and his bearer brought me a whisky and the paper morrison came in about five minutes and apologised for keeping me waiting in his shy diffident way ive come about shak lin i said hes been chucked out of bali and i told him all i knew he took it very seriously the bloody fools he said bitterly theyve done just the same as we did here i dont see that we can blame them for that i said no i suppose that down in bali theyre right out of things they couldnt know how fast this shak lin cult is spreading its up in baghdad now he glanced at me i suppose you know about that i nodded its in teheran too and its all through india from lahore to trincomalee he said its gone right through the eastso far only with one limited class of people on the aerodromes you cant say that its a very strong cult yet it hasnt touched the peasants or the politicians or the intellectuals but its strong enough already to rouse vast resentment if we europeans take to kicking shak lin out of every place he tries to settle in i agreed with him its just not got to happen again i said for one thing hes a sick man now after hes got rid of this thing i think a buddhist country would be best for him im thinking of siam hes always been very well thought of in bangkok hed be all right there hed be all right here said morrison the foreign office are quite aware that a mistake was made you dont think he could come back here again i doubt if hed want to i said i think he feels that hes done all he can in this part of the world you see hes much more of a religious teacher now than a chief engineer and as the cult grows he goes further that way every day id like to see him back in the hangar on the airstrip here running the maintenance of my aeroplanes but you cant put back the clock no he said you cant do that when you make a mistake sometimes its made for good he stood in silence for a moment staring out into the night do what you can to get him back here for a little while cutter he said even if its only for a visit for a week we made a blunder over this and theres no doubt that its affected british prestige in the persian gulf people may call the sheikh of khulal an old fuddyduddy but hes an important man in these parts if you could get shak lin back here if only for a visit so that we could make amends i think it might be very helpful just bear that in mind ill do that certainly i said ill get him back here for a little if i can but everything depends upon his health this treatment at karachi or in paris must come first i went back to the aerodrome for dinner in the restaurant alec scott was in the control tower i went up and talked to him about karachi radio telephone connections werenot very good at the moment and he said they would get better as the night went on i went back at about midnight and karachi was coming through as clear as a local call i asked to speak to the controller and i had luck there because it was khalil the chap that i had spoken to once before who was himself a follower of shak lin i asked him to deter any aircraft that might be taking off for bali with pilgrims and make it clear to them that they would almost certainly be stopped upon the way i told him that i should be going down in two days time myself and bringing shak lin back to hospital in karachi there was no point in any pilgrims going anywhere since shak lin would himself be in karachi in a fortnight and they could see him there he thanked me for the message and said he would explain what i had said to the engineers i only just got through to him in time because the dakota was already chartered and was to take off at dawn we left two days later in the tramp i made hosein chief pilot and went as second pilot myself and i put nadezna on the manifest as navigator and she travelled in the navigators seat most of the way we had eleven passengers for various destinations on the route all oil men of course and about two and a half tons of miscellaneous machinery and stores so we had a pretty good load up we passed through karachi in the early afternoon wazir hussein had arranged for his agent to meet us on the aerodrome and this chap turned up the hospital bed was all arranged and everything laid on i took his name and address and promised to send him a cable to tell him our exact time of arrival back with shak lin so that he could meet us with a car upon the tarmac i made these arrangements with some difficulty because hosein was up in the control office with the paper work and nadezna and i were beset with continuous enquiries from the engineers about shak lin finally a pakistani customs officer in uniform came to our assistance and got a couple of the aerodrome police to keep the people off us and to explain to newcomers what we had already told them many times we took off presently for ahmedabad and spent the night there next day we flew on to calcutta and rangoon and then in the evening light up to yenanyaung landing just at dusk we set down some of our passengers there and took on others spent the night in the oil companys rest house and went on next day down the kra isthmus i had cleared the machine that morning from rangoon for kallang airport at singapore because when making a long journey i always like to get a good long stage done in the early part of the day and a short one in the afternoon its less tiring doing it that way than the other wayabout we were passing the siaramalaya border about noon and beginning to think about lunch i was flying the machine with nadezna by me in the copilots seat and hosein was down organising the lunch baskets when nadezna said are we going to land at penang i didnt think for a moment i said nosingapore and then i said why of courseyou were brought up in penang it doesnt matteri can go in there and fuel just as well would you like to i can get upon the blower she said oh no id just like to see it well go past i said go past between penang and butterworth you can see the harbour and the town that way ill drop off height and come down to a thousand feet or so i throttled back a bit and retrimmed the machine how long did you live there only till i was five she said remember anything about it she smiled oh yes i used to go to a convent school i remember the nuns very well they were so kind there was a rockinghorse there and a swing i tell you what well do i said well nightstop there on the way back with connie i often do that then you can get a rickshaw and go down and see the school she said oh tom that would be fun i brought the machine down on a long descent and hosein came up from the cabin to see what was going on and i told him nadezna was born here and he grinned and went down again to reassure the passengers we passed georgetown on penang island quite close and nadezna looked up flushed and excited and said oh tom i believe i can see the street we lived in and i said bunkum you were only five years old and she said im sure i did well come back this way and spend a night i promised her it was a grand day that spent flying the tramp in fine weather down the coast of malaya with nadezna by my side i made her fly it while i ate my lunch touching the wheel now and then to bring the machine back level when i thought the passengers would be dying of heart failure hosein kept bobbing up to see what was going on and once he asked me why i didnt use the automatic pilot i said i am and indicated nadezna i think he went down and told the passengers that i was in love and theyd all probably be killed we had a fine time up in the cockpit that afternoon we put down at kallang for an hour to refuel and then went on over the linga archipelago and banka straight down to diento it was a lovely evening the sea blue and green around the coral atolls the coastlines with their massive forests dim on the horizon nadezna and i were in the pilots seats as before and now a new problem was right upon me not altogether unpleasant connie had ordered me to give his sister a message and i hadnt given it to her i should be meeting him the next day and he might ask me about it he was quite capable of asking her it seemed to me that id better see about delivering it and diento was as good a place as any they had customs at diento since our flights had become regular so we didnt have to waste time by putting down at palembang we landed just at sunset and were met as usual by cars from the oil company it was dark by the time we had refuelled the tramp and got her shut up for the night the others had gone on and nadezna hosein and i drove the five miles through the scented tropic night in an open car to the refinery club there was a great full moon just coming up she said oh tomthis is a marvellous place its everything the tropics ought to be and arent it was that night the dutchmen had arranged bedrooms for us in the club as usual but because we came there so frequently now they had given up the effort of entertaining us and the routine now was that they just turned us loose to swim in their swimming pool eat their food and drink their liquor and dance to their dance band with the shorthand typists of the refinery we did all that that night hosein had a girl friend there and he went off with her and nadezna and i swam and changed and dined and danced in that lovely place beside the tropical river i couldnt have staged a better evening for her if id taken her to the south of france we had flown all day down from yenanyaung over ten hours in the air we were both tired and by eleven oclock we both felt like packing up and going up to bed we lingered a little on the terrace by the river bright in the moonlight sampans moved about on it with little lanterns going upstream with the tide she said its been a marvellous evening tom thank you so much i squeezed her arm a little why say that you know ive enjoyed every minute being with you she raised her face and smiled and i kissed it she said oh tom think of all the dutchmen theyve probably got a rule against that i said well get chucked out of the club but nobody seemed to have noticed us so we moved into a bit of black shadow and did it again i had a message for you from connie that ive never given you i said presently would you like to hear it now i dont want to hear anything about connie just now she said not tonight i raised her face to mine and stroked her cheek i think youd better have it i said quietly we shall be seeing him tomorrow and its kind of relevant he came back at me when i told him that it would make you very happy if he married madй he seemed to think that was a bit of lip he said that it would make him very happy if you married me i paused and then i said he said i was to tell you she stood quiet in my arms he isnt very practical she said youre english tom and im an asiatic you wouldnt want a quarter chinese baby if it was yours id want about a dozen of them i replied thats a fine way to propose to a girl she said i ought to push you in the river you can do that if youll marry me i said will you she stood silent for a time and then she said not just like that like what then i caressed her shoulder she said were such very different people tom i know you like the east and for an englishman you get on wonderfully well with asiatics thats probably why you want to marry me because you think of us as people like yourself not different but we are different all the same youre english and im asiatic does that matter she said it might not but it might ruin everything i wouldnt want to marry without children tom and i wouldnt want to marry and try and raise a family in the persian gulfthered be no joy in that youre english and some day youll want to go back and live in england all your roots are there not in a place like this the sampans moved on the dark water at our feet over our heads the flying foxes wheeled under the full moon suppose we went to live in england i look chinese now and i may look more so when im older suppose someone said something about us in the subway or a restaurant or something i couldnt bear that tom id have to get out of england if that happened and where would we be then i was silent theres the children too she said i couldnt bear it if the others called your children chinks at school look i said all these are serious things nadezna i think youre worrying too much about them making too much of them but still i know theyre there i wouldnt want to live anywhere where my wife would be insulted in the street or my kids have a bad time in school just because they were yours but theres lots of places where those things dont happen we could live in one of those there arent so many white countries where those things dont happen she said i know she turned in my arms and put her face up to me i do want to marry you tom she said if we got half a chance i could make you very happy but im not going to marry you till i can see things a bit clearer than they are just now some day if you ask me again ill probably say yes you wouldnt like to say it now not now all im going to say now is goodnight she got kissed goodnight and it took about ten minutes and then we broke it up and went to bed i really hadnt expected anything much different i suppose and perhaps as you get older you get philosophical about these things and dont go off the deep end as you do when you are young you get to count your blessings and my blessing that night was that nadezna loved me and that there was a very good chance shed marry me one day we went on in the tramp in the morning stopped at sourabaya for fuel and put down at den pasar airstrip in the middle of the afternoon connie was there to meet us with phinit i got out of the machine with nadezna and left the work to phinit and hosein for the moment and walked with connie and his sister into the shade of the hangar one damn thing after another i said first leukaemia and then pilgrims he smiled i told you that that arab doctor had found something wrong i know you did i said the crafty little mugger he never said a thing to me till he got his samples reported on from karachi nadezna said were going to take you back to hospital in karachi she told him about the specialist from paris and the arrangements that had been made its going to be much better if you have it all done there he smiled if ive got to get out of bali i might as well go there the only thing is this and its quite definite im not going to europe nadezna said it may be that the best treatment is there connie theres something about xray therapy he said they can keep it i belong in these countries not in france or england there didnt seem to be much point in arguing about it there and then in any case i said the first thing is karachi will you be all ready to start tomorrow morning he nodded im all ready now okay i said now look about these ruddy pilgrims ill have to go into town and see the governor and smooth things over with him connie i heard about two dakotas coming here has anything else happened three he said it was two when arjan singh was down here ten days ago one came in from bangalore after that it had a lot of people from the hindustan aircraft company any more coming not that i know of he said but then i didnt know those were coming either i dont suppose that therell be any more i said they wont clear pilgrim aircraft at kallang because the dutch dont like it i left them to get on with the refuelling and transfer of the load after warning connie not to do any physical work himself and i drove into den pasar to see the dutch authorities i went first to see bergen he was quite polite though somewhat distant he said that the policy in indonesia was to interfere as little as possible with the indigenous religion of the peoples in dutch territory and that they had naturally assumed that this policy was known to me and that they would have my cooperation they had nothing against shak lin except that he appeared to represent a new creed of some sort and that aeroplane loads of people from all over the east had started coming to see him it was quite impossible for that to be allowed they understood that this man had been expelled from british territory in the persian gulf for similar activities and they considered it a little underhand of me to have introduced him into bali without disclosing his record in any case i must remove him now and i must understand that no activities of a religious nature by my staff would be tolerated in the future there was nothing to be gained by quarrelling with them i said i was exceedingly sorry this had happened it seemed to me that this was hardly a religious matter shak lin had done no missionary work among the natives and had not in fact infected any balinese men or women with his ideas all that had happened was that visitors had come to see him from considerable distances and had left again without troubling anybody or making any contact with the balinese i told him that shak lin in any case was a sick man and would have to be removed to hospital immediately outside dutch territory i proposed to promote phinit to be chief in his place and send down a young chinese called pak sza san to work with him i said that i hoped there would be no further trouble we went in to see the governor then and bergen explained all this to him in dutch and he delivered a rocket in dutch which bergen translated to me and then we all smiled and shook hands and it was over i said goodbye to bergen and went out to my taxi to drive back to the airstrip the young dutchman andel was waiting for me by the car he was the man who had first taken us to pekendang in the jeep he said is it true that shak lin has to go i suppose he was too junior in the administration to have been told i said yes hes a sick man anyway i shall be sending down a young chinese to work with phinit he said quietly i am very very sorry mr cutter it may not be my place to say so but i think it is a great mistake i wrinkled my forehead why do you say that i think he is a very great man he said simply perhaps the greatest that has ever visited bali and then he said i am interested in all that has to do with aeroplanes i served in the war with the raf in bomber command i was the rear gunner in a halifax i have been to pekendang several evenings to be with shak lin and to listen to him talking he is the greatest man that i have ever known it was nearly dark when i got back to the airstrip the dakota had come in and both lots of passengers had gone up to the bali hotel refuelling was just finished but the loads had not been changed we would do that in the morning i knocked everybody off for the night because i knew that if anybody worked late on the aircraft connie would insist on working too and i wasnt going to have that we shut up the machines when the bowser had driven away and then i asked connie if there was room for us at pekendang i think so he replied theres only threeyou and hosein and nadezna thats right i said hosein usually goes with phinit theres the hut you had beforethats ready for you are you sleeping with nadezna yet she was in hearing but i didnt dare to look at her no im not i said we havent got as far as that pity he said well she can come in with me weve shared a room often enough before we all walked over to the village carrying our small overnight bags it was dark and shadowy when we got there a friendly darkness with brown people moving about in it and welcoming us in the light of a few coconut oil wicks and a hurricane lamp or two connie took nadezna to his room and sent madй jasmi to organise an extra bed i dropped my haversack down in the hut that i had occupied before and went to find phinit to talk over the new organisation with him i sat with him on the steps of his house in the dim light telling him what i wanted him to do he knew pak sza san and said he would fit in all right in bali i had chosen pak sza san because he came from singapore and so his home was geographically close to indonesia and he might be expected to know the customs and the ways of the balinese by hearsay anyway better than say an iraqi engineer from basra we sat there talking for about a quarter of an hour and then a girl bare to the waist came up and spoke to him i peered at her in the dim light and it was madй jasmi phinit said in english she wants to ask you something mr cutter of course i said ask her what i can do for her there was an exchange in balinese she says is it true that shak lin has to go away to a hospital in a far country tell her im afraid thats true enough they spoke again she says may she go with him to the hospital to cook his food and wash his clothes i sat in silence for a minute thats usual in rural hospitals in the east of course a mans wife always goes with him to hospital and sleeps on the floor beside him they think it is a very cruel custom of the west to separate husband and wife when one is ill they think that in the great distress of a bad illness husband and wife need each other most tell her i said gently that she cant do that shes not his wife they spoke she says that shak lin has no wife and he will never have one she says that he will be unhappy if he is alone and that she knows what he likes to eat and when and she knows all his clothes and how he likes them washed she says he cannot look after himself when he is tired and ill i replied tell her that he is going to a fine large hospital larger than the bali hotel a hospital such as europeans go to when they are ill tell her that every person there has two or three servants that the hospital provides and these are taught to do everything in the way the doctor says tell her that it is better that those servants should look after him because he will get well more quickly because they know everything about this illness she said something a little scornfully she says if they know everything about this illness then they know that he is going to die i didnt know what to say to that one presently she said something again and all the scorn was gone out of her voice she says shak lin will not stay in hospital for very long because he is only going there to please you and his sister she says that presently he will become too weak to travel and he will go then to a quiet place beside an airstrip and live there until he dies she says when he goes to that quiet place may she get into your aeroplane to go to him to be with him to cook his food and wash his clothes she had a simple faith apparently that my aircraft would always fly direct from bali to shak lin wherever he might be yes i said tell her she may do that his speech is a burning fire with his lips he travaileth in his heart is a blind desire in his eyes foreknowledged of death he weaves and is clothed with derision sows and he shall not reap his life is a watch or a vision between a sleep and a sleep a c swinburne for a number of reasons i worked to a slower schedule than normal on the homeward night work upon the aircraft was not finished for one thing so that a dawn start was out of the question and for another i had promised nadezna that she and connie should revisit the scenes of their childhood in penang so that i planned to get there early in the afternoon and stop there for the night accordingly we took off from ball about ten oclock in the morning and made a short day of it to diento arriving there about three oclock in the afternoon and stopping over for the night next morning we went on at dawn and stopped for the night at penang at about midday to the surprise and delight of our passengers who had no objection to an afternoon in penang at their companys expense i had sent a cable from diento to reserve accommodation for my passengers and crew and since the passengers were all european i had reserved it at the best hotel in the town the european and oriental penang is a bit of a holiday place that planters come to when their isolation becomes unbearable and everything in this hotel was of the best it suited my passengers down to the ground but it didnt suit connie or nadezna half so well and i was out of tune with its luxury myself they were going down to the chinese quarter together they suggested that i should join them down there later for a chinese meal and after some discussion about meeting we settled that i should meet them as six oclock at the convent school that nadezna had been to as a child the convent of the sacred heart i found it was a big place with a school and an orphanage attached to it down in the lower and less fashionable part of the town children played in the crowded streets all round it and the telephone wires overhead were tangled with their kites and the streets were full of young women in flowered cotton pyjamas and old women in black pyjamas and young men in vests and shorts the door was opened to me by an old sister in a coarse white cotton habit who showed me into a bare waitingroom embarrassingly clean and scantily furnished nadezna and connie came very soon and with them was the mother superior and a couple more sisters connie introduced the mother to me who was evidently irish and then they were saying goodbye to her she wished connie a good recovery from his illness to nadezna she said remember that we deal in orphans here if at any time you feel you have no home come back and see us she said thats very kind of you mother when we were out in the street i asked her did they remember you she nodded they remembered us both the one you saw mother mary immaculate she used to teach me in the kindergarten she looks just the same as she did then connie sometimes used to come to take me home she knew both our names before i told her she paused theyre so stable those sisters she said quietly whatever else may change whatever gets upset you feel that theyll be going on there just the same taking in orphans and bringing them up and putting them out into the world teaching the children i told my passengers when i got back to the hotel that night that i wasnt going to tire shak lin by flying very long stages we took off at about nine oclock next morning and stopped for the night at calcutta on the following evening we landed at karachi as usual when we landed there a crowd of engineers was waiting on the tarmac to see connie i kept him in the aircraft and got out myself to find out what arrangements had been made there was an ambulance from the hospital waiting for us i got this backed up to the aircraft and got him into it and away while hosein held the crowd off and answered questions nadezna stayed in karachi to be near her brother in the hospital and i went on with the tramp next morning to bahrein the specialist from paris m serilaud got to karachi about the time that the tramp went through again on its way down to bali some days later i had sent arjan singh this time and i told him to nightstop at karachi and go into town to see nadezna and then write me by air mail before flying on to tell me what he thought about it all his letter came a couple of days later and in the same mail there was one from nadezna and it wasnt very good news there is no known cure for leukaemia only palliative treatments and none of these are of great value the disease is a sort of cancer of the bloodforming organs and once youve got it medical science cant do a lot for you medical science of course is reluctant to admit this the disease is a rare one and human guinea pigs with it are not so plentiful so that medical science has plenty of new suggestions for treatment when a case appears there is not much evidence that anybodys life has been prolonged by such experiments and no record of a cure nadezna said as much to me in her letter she said that connie had agreed to a short course of xray therapy not because he had any faith in it but because it would take a few days that he would have to spend in karachi anyway he wanted to come to bahrein to see me and he proposed to leave the hospital and travel to bahrein on the tramp with arjan singh on his return from bali nadezna said that she had come to the conclusion that his time was limited and as he had things on his mind that he wanted very badly to do it would be best to let him do them arjan singhs letter was to the same effect he made the point that a firstclass ground engineer accustomed to diagnosing the ailments of the most complicated aircraft engines and instruments from an examination of the symptoms had little difficulty in mastering the functions of so crude and inefficient a mechanism as the human body he said that the teacher knew all about the prospect before him and he was not distressed he wanted very much to come back to bahrein for a short time and arjan proposed to bring him back on his return from bali in the meantime the teacher was quite happy to rest in hospital and let the doctors have their fun i saw captain morrison with these letters he was pleased that connie was willing to come back for a short time and he sat down there and then and wrote a short personal letter to him to welcome him back to bahrein we got that off to him that night by air mail as i was going away he said let me know when you expect him to arrive cutter id like to come out to the aerodrome and meet the machine i smiled a little bitterly shall i see if i can find a bit of red carpet we all make mistakes he said quietly id like to come and meet him if youd let me know i was sorry then that id said that because after all the mistake had not been his the tramp came in late one afternoon i had got gujar singh to fix up connie and nadezna in the same rooms that they had occupied before in the house of mutluq bin aamir the silk merchant nadezna had retained her room i think but someone had to be turned out of connies which was done with great despatch this of course put the news that he was coming back to bahrein all around the souk and when the tramp landed there were close on a thousand people waiting by the hangar to see it touch down morrison knew about this and he had laid on a few policemen to keep the crowd behind the rope barrier that i had set up and when the tramp taxied to a standstill morrison went forward to meet connie as he got out of the machine connie was bareheaded and dressed in khaki shirt and stained khaki drill slacks and morrison shook hands with him in front of all the crowd it was good of him to do that connie wasnt very tired though i think he was paler than when i had seen him a fortnight before he wanted to join in the sunset rakats and as there was half an hour to go i took him round the hangar with tai foong and showed him what was going on in the shop when it was time for prayer he went out to the vacant ground with the imam and the crowd trooped on to it when we took away the rope and the engineers formed a solid phalanx around connie so that he would not be crowded then the imam stood up in front of them and called on allah and i went over to the office with nadezna and gave her a cup of tea after the prayers were over connie came into the office i said i expect youd better get down to thesouk and rest and i got out my keys and began putting the papers away and locking up my desk because i was to drive him in the station wagon he sat down on a chair and said one thing tom if youve got a minute i came back here because i wanted to see you i stopped bustling around of course i said whats on your mind i want an aeroplane he said i havent got any money for it but i was wondering if you could let me have a proctor for a month or two i had two old proctors i had paid six hundred pounds for one and four hundred and fifty for the other they were a fleabite in the total value of my aeroplanes and both of them were pretty well written down in the accounts of course i said you can have a proctor for as long as you like what do you want to do with it im going to die of this thing he said practically they seem to think ive got about a year and i shant be a lot of good after the first six months well thats all right most of us dont get so much notice ive always said what i believed in in the hangar anywhere and now ive started something i dont know if what ive started will endure or not but if it does endure i think its quite a useful thing to have done so many people now in so many countries on sa many aerodromes are talking about what ive said quite casually at some time and repeating it and writing it all down and sometimes its just hearsaytheyre putting down things that i never said at all well thats not right if this things going to die out with me it doesnt matter but if its going to endure id like it to be right i smiled i see if i had a proctor he said i could go round all these airfields and spend a day or two on each just talking to the chaps i want to do that i want them to see me as a real man not as a kind of god i sweat like they do eat like they do i get tired and hungry and sleepy as they do and ill perhaps when i tell them what i think about things i want to tell them as a firstclass ge not as a bloody preacher i want to go into each shop and hangar and tell them what i think of their routines and their inspection schedules so that theyll remember me as someone who was good at their own job then if they like to pay attention to the things that i believe in theyll be doing it on grounds of solid competence and fact not just emotion if youre going to go round all the airfields in the east where men are talking about you i said its going to take you all your time there must be a hundred at leastmore than that i want to go on till ive got to stop he said well you can have the proctor i thought for a minute youd better have yoke unclethe engines got about three hundred hours to go in that that ought to see you through if you want any more time bring it in and swap it for nan oboe whos going to fly it for you he said arjan singh has offered to do that hes coming in to see you in the morning he wants you to give him leave without pay i nodded slowly i knew that arjan was a believer in shak lin and he was unmarried he could probably work without pay for a time he was a good man for the job too because sikhs are known and somewhat feared all over india arjan singh in his best clothes was both an imposing and a ferocious figure it would be a bold bengali or madrasi who would try conclusions with him with arjan singh to run the practical affairs of life connie would be in good hands there would be no trouble about maintenance of the proctor at every aerodrome willing hands would seek to gain merit by servicing the teachers aircraft youll have to have some money connie i said at last i dont think you need bother about insuranceits very little and it can go on under the existing cover spareswe can fit you up with anything youll need from the stores but youll have to pay for petrol and oil or someone will theres a chap called noshirvan who lives in bombay he said a parsee hes a motor agent in a fairly big way he came up to see me in karachi he wants to pay for the petrol and oil i said id let him know if i could get the aircraft and hell take out a shell carnet wed better get a cable off to him tonight i said next day i took yoke uncle off the list of operational aircraft and allocated her to connie he started in at once to do the fiftyhour maintenance schedules on her working with tarik arjan singh came to see me and i fixed him up with unpaid leave for as long as he liked i told him id be glad to see him back in the business whenever he was able to come he said he did not know when that would be as long as the teacher wanted a pilot he said he would like to serve him in that way he said that he had no home ties that would prevent him from devoting his life to religion he told me then a thing that i had not heard before in all the three years he had been with me that as a young man he had been married and that his wife and son had died of fever while he was in the royal indian air force since then he had been unmarried it takes an asiatic a long time to get around to talking of his private life to a european arjan and connie got their proctor going a couple of days later and flew it over to baraka to see the old sheikh who now seldom left his bed they came back on the following day stayed the night and left for abadan nadezna and i stood in the shade of the hangar watching the thin line of the proctor wing as it vanished into the haze to the north most of the other staff stood there with us watching till it was out of sight im glad you let arjan go tom she said as we turned back to the office i think hes about the best man to look after connie hes so very practical i nodded i told him to let me know at once by cable if he gets seriously ill she smiled i did that too nothing much happened after that for a couple of months when connie and arjan had been gone for about a fortnight they appeared again from the north and stayed one night they had been to abadan baghdad mosul teheran basra and kuwait and now they were on their way eastwards to pakistan and india connie was lired but not more than one would have expected from such a strenuous journey they went on to spend a night at sharjah and from there to jiwani and karachi about six weeks after they had gone through wazir hussein came to my office in the maroon hudson one afternoon i got up to meet him and ordered coffee and presently he came to the point my master feels that he is near his end he said before he dies he wishes to speak to the majlis he has sent me to invite you to be present and the sister and captain morrison he has matters of importance to tell you it was a very unusual summons but everything about my relations with the sheikh of khulal was a bit unusual of course i said i should be very glad to come when does your master wish to summon the majlis if it is possible tomorrow he said i have seen captain morrison and he is able to come tomorrow he said that perhaps you would fly him over with the sister i fixed that up and fixed the time that we would take off in the morning and rang up morrison to let him know hussein would come with us and as there were to be four people i took one of the airtrucks the wazir did not say what it was all about and i didnt care to question him nadezna had no idea but thought it had to do with connie as we were getting into the machine next morning i drew morrison aside and asked if he knew anything its his will he said hes calling the full majlis cant be anything else we landed at baraka an hour later and drove to the palace in the packard that came to the airstrip here we were shown into the same bare anteroom with the hard gilt chairs that i had been in before this room was full of welldressed arabs minor sheikhs and people of that sort some of whom i knew from having met them in the desert or their villages in the course of various flights there must have been about twenty of them we waited with them in silence for a quarter of an hour and then we were all led upstairs to the sheikhs bedchamber this was a big wellproportioned room with little furniture in it except the one great bed the old man lay propped up on this he was much smaller and frailer than when i had seen him last dr khaled was at his side huddled in a corner were several women all heavily veiled in black burqas so that nothing was visible of them except their hands we all grouped ourselves standing in a circle round the bed and wazir hussein went forward and said in arabic that everything was ready and that everyone was there the old mans voice was worse than ever and i could only follow about half of what he said morrison gave it me in full that evening first he said his salaam to the sister of the teacher who was the only woman in the place unveiled he then gave his salaam to me and to the various sheikhs assembled in the room mentioning them all by name and lastly to morrison he seemed tired then and rested asd the doctor gave him something from a medicine glass to drink pale pink in colour the old sheikh revived after a few minutes and began to speak again he said that his eldest son fahad would inherit the sheikhdom and would rule in his place after his death and he would inherit all the incomes of the sheikhdom including the oil royalties all the old mans personal possessions including his flocks and his herds and one half of all his moneys in the various banks were to be divided between his wives and his children in accordance with the teaching of the koran and in this division was to be reckoned the sums owed by his debtors but these debtors were not to be pressed to repay more quickly than had been agreed he rested again then for a minute or two and then he went on he said that it was fitting when a wealthy man died that he should provide for his family against all possible chance of want any money that there might be over should not be spent in idle luxuries but should be given to further the work of god he had given much thought to this matter and had talked about it to the imam many times they were agreed that the stranger shak lin el amin had done more than anyone in recent years to draw men back to god in these modern times of machinery and inventions men who served such things and more men served them every year were tempted to abandon god to their own utter destruction el amin brought up to machinery himself and honoured in his calling had shown them the folly of these ways and had shown that only by turning back to god can men attain to heaven his teaching was a firm rock to which men could cling in a changing world because it was the teaching of god it did not seem to him important that el amin shared his teaching with men of other creeds with buddhists and with hindus and sikhs his teaching was of god and god knew best he therefore directed that the second half of all his moneys in the banks should be given to el amin absolutely since it would be used to bring men back to god through all the temptations of the new world of machinery this was a legacy for a religious purpose in accordance with the fourth surah and must not be disputed he called everybody to witness that he was sane in mind and not subject to the influence of anybody in this bequest which was made after due consideration for the furtherance of the works of god he was obviously very very tired after all that he rested again and after a time he said god go with you and we all trooped out there was nothing then to stay for and no more to be learned we flew back to bahrein at once and went down to morrisons house for a talk about it nadezna and i he said it was a perfectly valid will and it was quite unlikely that anybody would attempt to upset it if the foreign office should question it he would have to testify that it was made strictly in accordance with moslem law i asked him how much do you think is involved i simply havent an idea he said id only be guessing if i told you a figure but its a very large sum of money nadezna said but connie wont live to use it its given for his religious work and hes a dying man morrison bit his lip i know he said thats just the hell of it its going to pass practically straight into other hands there was nothing to be done about it and we went on with our work as usual we heard of connie from time to time as he ranged through the east never staying longer than two days in any place we heard once that he was in patiala in the north of india and three weeks later he was at ratmalana airport at colombo and again he was at hyderabad and again at chittagong he went to chiengmai and to songkhla in siam and down to singapore where he spent several days it went on like that for about six weeks longer and still the old sheikh lingered on in his palace at baraka he must have been very tough but then one day the inevitable happened and morrison rang me up to say that the old man had died during the night what happens now i asked he said well the burial will be today and then theres three days of official mourning usually i imagine we shall hear something from wazir hussein about the end of the week he didnt but i did the hudson came to my office a few days later while i was dictating to nadezna we packed that up and i went out to meet them the wazir had a youngish man with him richly dressed in arab clothes and speaking perfect english this was fahad the eldest son the new sheikh who had been educated at shrewsbury and balliol he was then a man of about thirty i should say i ordered coffee for them but fahad was of the new school and did not wait till we had sipped our coffee before starting on the business that had brought him to my office i am sure you know what we are here for mr cutter he said my father who died recently left a bequest to shak lin as of course you know it is now a matter of implementing his wishes i nodded i was very sorry indeed to hear of your fathers death i said he was a great man and a very good one he bowed and i went on the sister of shak lin is in the next room do you wish her to come in he said if you please i went and called nadezna and she left her typewriter and the two arab noblemen got up and bowed to her unusual in the east i told her briefly what had happened and gave her a chair then fahad said where is el amin now mr cutter i dont know exactly i replied hes travelling from aerodrome to aerodrome staying no more than two days in each place he has been in malaya and in siam but when we last heard about ten days ago he was making his way back through burma and east pakistan to india again i expect we could find out quite quickly where he is by the radio and air traffic control wazir hussein asked does he know that my late master gave a legacy into his care for the work of god i havent told him i turned to nadezna she shook her head and said i thought it better not to i think that probably he knows nothing about it i said i have told nobody i dont suppose captain morrison talked about it either fahad said it seems probable that he knows nothing about it then the coffee came at that point and he waited till dunu had put it on the table and gone out and shut the door behind him and then he said in that case i should like to go to see him with wazir hussein to tell him that this thing is done because it was my fathers wish and mine also that he should have this money to be used for god can you provide an aeroplane for us to travel to him in of course i said i can fix up that how many will there be he said if possible i think the sister should be present nadezna said i should be glad to come sheikh i said would you like me to come thats just as you wish i can send gujar singh to pilot the machine or if you wish ill pilot it myself just as you like fahad said if you can spare the time i should like you to come too mr cutter the sum involved is a large one and it would be well that witnesses to the majlis of my father should be present and you are a completely independent witness which perhaps was why my father asked for you i said i can come and then i said how much money is involved in this legacy i dont want to ask impertinent questions but if it is a very large sum it may need some thought because as you know shak lin is a sick man fahad said i know that mr cutter that has been in our minds too but my fathers will must first be carried out before we think of anything else as regards the sum it seems to be about five hundred and twenty lakhs five hundred and twenty lakhs i repeated a lakh of rupees is a hundred thousand rupees i calculated quickly in my headfiftytwo million rupees you mean about four million pounds probably a little less said fahad just under four million pounds i think it may have been tactless before moslems but i said christ its always a bit of a shock when the fairy tale comes true and though i had heard for years that the old sheikh had an income from the oil royalties that was a good deal more than half a million pounds a year i had never believed it i knew of course that he was wealthy but sums such as that are bordering on fantasy and one assumes instinctively that there is gross exaggeration somewhere however here it was and it was true the old man had just under eight million pounds in his various bank accounts all in current accounts because of his hatred of usury and by his will one half of that sum was now due to connie fahad and hussein were quite phlegmatic about parting with this vast sum as well they might be because the half that the family retained was free of any sort of tax or death duty the income from the oil royalties was so vastly in excess of the requirements of their modest and ascetic way of life that the accumulated savings represented nothing but a burden and a responsibility the old sheikh had no idea of using money in the modern way it was beyond his mental power to visualise the construction of roads schools hospitals or sewage schemes as free gifts to his people he would have thought that pampering them and leading them away from god into a life of sinful ease fahad of course had plenty of modern ideas but he was new to the sheikhdom and had much prejudice to contend with it would be many years before he could spend even the annual income from the royalties i really think that they were happy and relieved that the old man had discovered a means of letting down the pressure in the treasury for the service of god through el amin we talked about this for a time and then it became imperative to organise the journey to see connie there was a tendency for the party to grow on the arab side a cook was necessary to free the sheikh from worries over eating unclean food a servant or two was very desirable and so on i decided to take the carrier as being bigger and more suitable than one of the little old airtrucks still doing yeoman service and i warned gujar singh that i should want him to come with me on the flight starting the day after tomorrow i took the arabs up to the control office then conditions were fairly good and alec scott was in touch with karachi by radio telephone we got them to relay an enquiry to air traffic control at calcutta and within a quarter of an hour we had our information the proctor had left patna that morning for benares it was believed to be going on to cawnpore agra and delhi we caught up with them at agra five days later agra of course is where the taj mahal is the incredibly lovely and enormous tomb erected by a moslem king to his beloved wife to us agra meant something different to that it has a huge threerunway aerodrome with a long range of hangars and workshops it is one of the principal bases of the indian air force there must have been thirty dakotas parked there when we joined the circuit and a mass of other aircraft gujar was chief pilot for the flight and was flying the carrier in for the landing as we went round i scanned this mass of aircraft from the copilots window to see if i could see the proctor and then i saw it it was parked on the tarmac between two dakotas and there was a great crowd of people round it looking carefully i could see a figure standing on the wing beside the fuselage i went quickly through into the cabin and pointed the machine out to nadezna and the arabs then we landed and taxied round the perimeter track to the control tower and stopped engines on the tarmac i knew that connie and arjan singh would have seen and recognised the carrier as it came in and they were expecting us because i had got a message to them at cawnpore it did not seem to be a very good thing to break in on their religious meeting and so we cleared the necessary formalities regarding the aircraft and telephoned for rooms at a hotel and laid on two taxis and then sat and waited until connie and arjan singh turned up they came about half an hour later driven by two officers of the indian air force in a jeep and followed on foot by a great crowd of enlisted men all indian of course i had not seen connie for some months nor had nadezna but we were both shocked at the change in him with our intellects of course we had known that there must be a change but i hadnt visualised it he was thinner than ever and obviously weak when we saw him first too he was very tired because he had been speaking for over an hour he was much paler than i remembered him and he had lost a good deal of his hair so that he looked ten years older sudden movements seemed to hurt him in his chest and abdomen he was very glad to see us all i think he realised what the presence of the arabs meant because after a formal salutation in arabic he said at once to fahad is your father the sheikh of khulal well the arab said my father is with god i broke in at that point and insisted that we all went down to the hotel the taxis were waiting and i didnt like the look of connie a bit to start on a discussion of the legacy standing on the tarmac out in the heat of the sun with all sorts of people listening seemed very unwise so we drove down to the grand hotel and found it a big spacious building in the grand style now sliding into shabbiness and neglect since the departure of the british in the vast place there were only two or three other guests and we got a row of rooms in a ground floor arcade that opened on to a garden connie and arjan singh shared a room as they were accustomed to do it was only later that i came to know how much arjan had done for connie in those months how good a nurse this robber baron with his great black beard had been i got hold of arjan singh while connie was having his bath and had a talk with him in my room he said that connie had never been actually ill in the sense that he had been unable to travel or to speak to his religious meetings but he agreed that it was very near the time when he would have to give it up he said that he slept very little but rested a great deal arjan encouraged this and kept him lying on the charpoy for as much as seventeen or eighteen hours in the day only allowing him up to travel or to visit the aerodromes he said that recently connie had suffered a good deal from pains in his bones i asked if they were in money difficulties if their travelling way of life could be made easier for connie if they had more money he said that money would make no difference they were very seldom allowed to pay for anything accommodation taxis or gharries and food were invariably provided for them free or paid for by the generosity of aircraft operators on the aerodromes landing fees were always remitted wherever they went except in malaya which was british territory apparently the british civil servants didnt view religious travellers in quite the same way as asiatics he said that after nearly six months travelling they had spent no more than about four hundred rupees between them and they had ample for their needs i asked him when it would be convenient for connie to meet the arabs and he said that after dinner would be the best time he said that connie ate very little now but that his evening meal was the best of the day usually curry and rice and some fruit after that he was alert and at his best and arjan suggested that the arabs might come along at about eight oclock or so to connies room and we could all talk there in that way it would be possible for him to recline on the bed if he felt like it i went and told wazir hussein this proposal and then i went to tell nadezna but she was in with connie i dined alone in the hotel diningroom that night because thearabs ate privately in their own rooms food prepared by their own cook after dinner we all met in connies room there werent enough chairs so we sent the hotel boys to get some more and presently we were all sitting in a row on hard upright cane chairs in the bedroom while connie sat upon the bed the mosquito net turned back over his head wazir hussein told the story to begin with he said that his late master the sheikh abd el kadir had been greatly troubled in his mind in his last years about the disposal of his money after much thought he had decided that one half of his cash savings should be given to god and they were then puzzled as to how this was to be done baraka was a small town that had a very good mosque already and his master fejt that if great sums of money were spent in the district the people of the country would become debauched they decided that the money must be spent outside baraka and at one time they had played with the idea of spending two or three million pounds upon the erection of a vast new mosque in bahrein then shak lin had appeared the new teacher whose ideas were refreshing and bringing uptodate the old tenets of islam without in any way destroying their original purity his master had become convinced that this new teaching would spread through the asiatic world and bring men back to god and that if the spiritual power of el amin were supported by the more material power of a great legacy to be devoted to religious purposes then the new teaching would be placed upon a firm foundation to the greater glory of god before the full majlis with some other witnesses he had therefore left one half of his cash savings to el amin absolutely and this cash amounted to about five hundred and twenty lakhs of rupees fahad the new sheikh spoke then he said that his father had made this decision after talking to him privately and that he had agreed that this legacy was a fitting and a proper use for the money he was entirely in agreement with his fathers wishes and he awaited a lead as to the disposal of the money i said a very few words then i said that the late sheikh had invited me to be present at the majlis which was a most unusual honour for an englishman captain morrison had been there too the old man was undoubtedly in full possession of all his faculties and i had no doubt that this legacy was the result of careful and prolonged thought upon his part captain morrison had told me afterwards that in his view the legacy was valid and completely legal and that if any question were raised he would advise the british foreign office so connie said then i am very conscious of the honour that my old friend the sheikh abd el kadir has paid me let me think for a few minutes he sat silent on the bed before us his eyes on the floor then he got up and went to the door and pushed aside the netted frame and went out into the garden there was a moon and as we sat there in the bedroom we could see him through the netted door walking up and down upon the lawn in the moonlight we sat there talking in low tones about unimportant things i would have liked to smoke but in that company of religious nonsmokers that was hardly possible there was a bowl of grapes upon the table and we ate a few of these he must have been away for nearly an hour at last he came in from the garden and sat down upon the bed again he was calm and thoughtful when he spoke my teaching has no need of temples he said my temples are the fitters shop the tool room and the hangar on the aerodrome nor do i need priests for what i teach because each man who finds god in his daily work by working in a shop with other men he is a priest for me he paused the sheikh of khulal was my friend he said in the last years it has been one of the great pleasures of my life to visit him and talk to him about the ways of god with man because he was kind and thoughtful and compassionate to humble men and wise beyond all belief i knew that he intended this legacy he told me when i visited him four months ago for the last time i did not worry him in his last days by refusing his great kindness even though i knew that it must be refused if i did wrong in that i ask your pardon fahad cleared his throat it was not for temples or for priests alone that my father intended this money he said i think he meant it for a pension fund in part that men who turn to god in daily work and yet fall into illhealth or distress should be assisted by this money to regain their powers or to die in peace also he thought that men who followed your way of teaching should be helped to travel to far countries where by their lives and work they would draw other men to god by their example connie smiled a little men who follow my teaching become good workmen he said because good work and right thinking are as one such men need no money to help them travel for if such a one should wish to leave his country and work say in hong kong to teach my ways he will find there is a manager who will agree to pay his fare because he wants him in the shop as for the old and the sick you have provision for them in the koran of the blessed prophet if this money is for them it would be better that the imam should dispose of it not me there was silence in the bedroom presently he spoke again i have no possessions he said only the clothes i wear my kit of fine tools and micrometers and three or four hundred rupees these things should go to my sister after i am dead because i have nothing of value nothing of responsibility nothing but the memory of my words will remain that is the way i want it gujar singh spoke up teacher he said i know that what you say is true yet all the older creeds have found a use for money and in some cases a good use in penang and many other places the christians the roman catholics and other christian sects maintain large buildings as schools and as homes for orphan children such deeds are good deeds but the buildings have to be paid for in that case the power of money has been used to do good things in the name of jesus may not the power of this money be used to do good things in your name too connie said drily i hope youre not comparing me with jesus gujar said defiantly i know that it is not the same he was a woodworker connie smiled okay he said have it your own way but jesus didnt need five hundred lakhs to spread his word he was silent again but presently he said this money is power great money is great power but power has no place in what i teach i do not teach men to be managers i teach them to do good work and so serve god whether they sit at the managers desk or whether they sweep the floor of the hangar is one to me i shall die very soon if i should receive this money someone must administer it after me and power corrupts many evils spring from power he said even from the power to do good all power corrupts and the intention to do good has little influence on the corruption either my words will last after me and be believed by men or else they wont yet if one thing were required to kill them certainly it is that my words should be spread after my death by the power of money no teaching could survive a campaign of paid advertising there was a long silence i cannot take this money he said at last let there be schools and orphanages and let my name be on the schools and orphanages if you wish as one who loved sheikh abd el kadir but let these schools and orphanages be in baraka let baraka be a centre for learning and security in the persian gulf so that no child from abadan to muscat shall need a home and not find one and let there be a school for engineers and an airstrip with hangars where men can learn my calling and my way of life and find their way to god by doing firstclass work but let all these things be in baraka and khulal to the honour of sheikh abd el kadir and his friend he got up from the bed and said god go with you in dismissal and we all went out into the arcade leaving nadezna alone with him the arabs did not seem disconcerted at the refusal of the legacy perhaps they had expected something of the sort they did not discuss the matter then but said goodnight with friendliness and courtesy and went to their rooms i think fahad had some cause for satisfaction from the doings of the evening money meant nothing to him as i have said it would be years before he could spend even the income of the oil royalties but an explicit direction from el amin such as he had now received to set up schools and orphanages for the whole of the persian gulf in khulal was a help to him in dealing with the prejudice and reaction that was hindering the reforms he wished to make a start was made on buildings for the orphanage and for the elementary school within three months of his return to baraka i was left in the arcade with gujar and arjan for a time we walked up and down upon the stone flags in the moonlight everything has now been renounced gujar said at last no more temptations can be left this was the final one the temptation of power to do good neither arjan nor i had anything to say to that and we walked for a time in silence the two sikhs and i each busy with our own thoughts at last i said what comes next arjan he cant go on like this for very much longer do you know what he wants to do when the end gets near he said i know that he wants to go back to where it all began to a place called damrey phong i have never been there but he says that you and gujar know it is it in cambodia thats right i said its a very rural little village with one tarmac strip about twelve hundred yards i should think its about two hundred and fifty miles southeast from bangkok ten or twelve miles in from the coast on a river thats where he wants to go to is it that is where he wants to go to live until he dies he said he has told me that if he should become ill suddenly wherever we may be i am to put him in the proctor and fly quickly to damrey phong i see i thought for a minute its not on the map i said i think the village may be shown but there was no airstrip marked on my map i can pencil it in for you in the morning its not difficult to find though when youre two hundred miles out from bangkok start looking for a peninsula like a hammer with a little island off the south head of the hammer go on about fifteen miles and youll find the mouth of the river the strip is about ten or twelve miles up the river on the west side between the river and a ruddy great mountain about two thousand feet high you want to watch it when youre on the circuit its a place rather like penang is there a good house there he asked a house where i can care for him until he dies i bit my lip i shouldnt think there is there were two european houses by the strip but thats three years ago i shouldnt think theyd be much good by now and the hangar had already fallen down he definitely wants to go there does he arjan singh nodded that is where he wants to go to die we walked a few paces in silence ill see if i can get something organised there then i said with five hundred and twenty lakhs going spare theres no reason why he shouldnt die in comfort i put the matter to fahad in the morning theres so little we can do for him sheikh i said he will take nothing for himself but if he goes to this place damrey phong for his last few months he ought to have a house suitable for a sick man and a friend or two and perhaps a doctor and i think there should be a hangar for his aeroplane in such a place he ought to have an aeroplane to keep in contact with bangkok moreover aeroplanes are his lifes work i can provide the aeroplane and a spare engine for it and arjan singh wishes to stay with el amin till he dies so there will be a pilot will you provide the house and the hangar i do not think that it can cost so much as one lakh he said i will do that gladly we talked about it for a little time surely he said something should be done at once because the matter is now urgent within a month he will be wanting to go there to die i know i said where is this place damrey phong he said is it possible for us to fly there now and engage men to start the buildings we could do that i said it would take us about two days to get there by way of calcutta and bangkok let us ask el amin if he will allow us to do that we went to see connie with the wazir arjan and nadezna were in his room so we were all together he was resting on the bed look connie i said weve been talking about what happens next and then i told him what we proposed he was pleased at the idea i want to go back there he said if youre going to do any building keep it small and simple so that simple people will come and see me id like a bedroom with a veranda facing on the strip and the hangar at right angles to the house so that if im in bed on the veranda i can see into the hangar and the aircraft landing and taking off on the strip and everything thats going m okay i said well have it like that now connie theres another thing madй jasmi down in balishe wanted to come and cook for you and wash your clothes when you had to stop travelling would you like to have her there or shall we give that a miss id like to have her he said shed be all right there its not so very different to her own place if i hadnt been such a fool i should have married her ill see that she gets there i said will you see that she gets back again to bali after my death he asked she wouldnt be happy knocking around the world in towns or cities no i said ill see that she gets back there right away there was one more thing connie i said were going on to damrey phong from here but none of us speak a word of cambodian or siamese can we make contact with anybody in bangkok who can come with us to damrey and act as an agent tan khoon prasit he said hes in bangkok and hes a friend of mine hell fix you up with everything you want ill give you a letter to him we all left agra that afternoon connie and arjan singh went on to delhi in the proctor and the arabs and nadezna and gujar and i went to calcutta in the carrier we stopped the night there and took off at dawn next day for bangkok and got there about midday after a sixhour night i had sent a telegram to tan khoon prasit and he was on the aerodrome to meet us a small smiling siamese who spoke good english he was in the treasury and he had something to do with the governments air line siamese airways with the pull he had at don muang airport everything was made very easy for us and we were driving down to the city with him within half an hour of landing he took us to his house a villa on the outskirts of the town he had chinese tea for us served ceremonially in little cups without handles somewhat in the manner of turkish coffee in the persian gulf and then we settled down to tell him our story and what we wanted it soon appeared that he himself was a follower of shak lin he said that his teaching had influenced aircraft maintenance in bangkok very much both in the air line and in the air force he had been a passenger on the dakota that had gone from bangkok to bali to pay homage to the teacher and he remarked that he had noticed then how ill he looked he was practical and helpful over damrey phong he said that the district was still held by the viet minh forces but no fighting had taken place there ever or was likely to do so so far as he knew the airstrip had not been used since dwight schafter had left it he had never heard of anybody going there he could supply an interpreter to go with us to damrey if we liked and to negotiate any settlement that might be necessary with the local authorities before we started to build on the airstrip he did not think there would be any difficulty at all he suggested that he might make contact with the buddhist hierarchy in bangkok who thought so highly of shak lin and of his teaching and who might wish to send a priest with us to smooth out any points that might arise on the religious side we left next day with a young siamese on board called khun phra sanid and a buddhist monk in a yellow robe whose name was boonchuey which means helped by merit we came to damrey phong about an hour and a half later and i circled it at about five hundred feet a couple of times it all looked much the same the two european houses were still there and apparently occupied but the roof of one of them had been thatched with palm leaves which didnt look so good the strip looked all right still but i brought the carrier down and flew ten feet up along the length of it while gujar singh and i studied the surface from our windows it was crumbling somewhat at the edges and paddy melons were encroaching on it in parts and spreading over the hot tarmac but we saw no holes i took her up again and made a circuit and came in on a long straight approach and put her down she came to a standstill opposite the houses i stopped engines and left her where she was nobody else was likely to want the runway we all got out and the two siamese began talking to the people who came out from the houses and from the town they remembered the carrier and they remembered gujar singh and me from our visit to the place three years before they said that no aeroplane had visited damrey since then they asked at once about connie the two houses werent too bad one of them needed a new roof and most of the glass windows had been broken but although white ants had been at them a bit there was nothing that a few carpenters could not put right fahad told khun phra sanid to buy them right away and we flew back to bangkok in the evening that night the arabs chartered the carrier from me for an indefinite period with gujar singh to fly it all the building materials and labour that were required could be obtained in bangkok and flown to damrey in the carrier with hospital equipment and linen and everything necessary for a sick man nadezna stayed with them to organise that part of it they got corrugated iron sheets too and steel angles for the framework of the hangar and cement for the floor all these things were to go to damrey in the carrier in repeated trips i could do nothing much to help all these arrangements and my business in bahrein required me urgently i left all this to go ahead and flew to mergui in a fairchild argus of siamese airways having cabled to hosein to pick me up there on his way back from bali in the tramp he arrived a day later and two days after that i was back in bahrein telling captain morrison about it and tackling the huge pile of paper on my desk a fortnight after that madй jasmi got to damrey phong i sent a letter down to phinit at pekendang and told him to explain to her that the time had now come when she could go to shak lin in the quiet place beside the airstrip that she knew about before any of us to cook his food and wash his clothes she put on her jacket as a concession to foreign ways and took a small rush basket with a few things in it and got into the great aircraft with hosein and his passengers and went off as nonchalantly as the most seasoned traveller hosein put down at mergui in tenasserim as he had done for me and nadezna met her with the argus there and flew her to damrey phong by way of bangkok fahad was a good organiser and he got the buildings up and ready in a very short time he got the hospital equipment that he needed in bangkok because it was all simple stuff then gujar singh suggested that there ought to be electric light which meant a motor generator set and if they had electricity they might as well have a radio telephony equipment that would enable them to keep in contact with bangkok they appealed to me for these things and i flew to cairo in an airtruck and got them there and sent them down to mergui on the next tramp flight and gujar picked them up from there and took them to damrey phong i sent a spare engine for the proctor too because it seemed to me that connies engine must be near its time and with it i sent down a kit of spares and tools in case he wanted to do the overhaul of the old engine there himself i had a hunch that possibly it was the kind of job that he might like to potter about with on days when he was feeling well enough to work about six weeks after we had met him at agra his tour came to an end he was talking from the wing of the proctor to a crowd of engineers and pilots at vizagapatam when he had some kind of a stroke and was unable to go on talking and he might have fallen but for the fact that arjan singh was up there on the wing behind him probably with that in mind he was deaf on his left side after that and the sight of his left eye was somewhat dimmed and he decided to give up arjan singh put him in the back seat of the proctor where he could lie at ease and flew him in two days to damrey phong by way of calcutta akyab rangoon and bangkok nadezna told me that he was pathetically glad to see the balinese girl madй jasmi waiting for him there she said that he could hardly take his eyes off her on the first day ill though he was he hadnt been there a week before the first dakotaload of pilgrims came they were buddhists from rangoon gujar had brought the arab party back to bahrein the day before but arjan singh was there and the buddhist priest boonchuey there were about forty pilgrims and when the dakota taxied to a standstill they got out and came and sat down in rows in front of the houses patient and orderly waiting for a sight of the teacher in spite of the protests of nadezna and madй and the siamese nurse connie got up from his bed and went and sat on the veranda steps and talked to them for an hour mostly about maintenance schedules on the dakota aircraft the buddha was still in the same position at the edge of the airstrip getting a bit weatherbeaten now and in the evening he went there with boonchuey and knelt with the pilgrim engineers while the buddhist monk held some kind of a service that was all right perhaps but there was no provision for feeding and housing forty pilgrims on the airstrip they slept in the aircraft and in the hangar and all over the place and ate the small village out of all its food supplies that was no matter because damrey phong is in a ricegrowing district and the pilgrims paid for their meals the villagers made money out of them and looked for the next aircraft eagerly it came a few days later this time from calcutta and with it came news of others on the way arjan singh paid the villagers with money left with him by wazir hussein to build an atap dormitory hut a simple affair that consisted of little but a board floor raised two feet above the ground a thatched roof and a lot of charpoys or string beds the hindus behaved well but they were troubled by the buddha and they came to arjan in a body before leaving and asked if there might be a hindu shrine or temple there as weh he said that the teacher would welcome it and that hindus might put up what they liked provided that it was well back from the runway and generally in the line of the other buildings arjan singh wrote letters about all this to wazir hussein to account for the money he was spending and nadezna wrote to me every week the wazir turned up in my office one day rather concerned about what was going on because it seemed that two or three dakotas full of moslems had been there and there was no mosque at damrey phong there was a little buddhist temple which the villagers were building up themselves out of the profits of the catering and urged on by boonchuey and a bengali jute merchant had provided three lakhs of rupees for quite an imposing hindu temple the wazir said that his young master was distressed to hear that there was no mosque on the strip and no imam and that he proposed to make good these deficiencies immediately i said of course i thought that it would be a very good thing connie had been there for over four months before i was able to free myself from my business in bahrein for long enough to go down there again to see himand nadezna i had replaced her in the office by an iraqi shorthand typist but he wasnt really any help to me he could never act upon his own initiative to relieve me as nadezna had done every day there came a time however when i realised that unless i went to damrey soon i might not see connie again and so i called in gujar singh and told him to get on with it and cabled arjan to meet me with the proctor at mergui and went down on the tramp with hosein arjan told me when i met him that a load of pilgrims came in almost every day and sometimes two in one day in fact we got to damrey phong about the same time as a dakota from ceylon and had to make another circuit while it landed ahead of us and got off the runway they had got into the swing of handling the pilgrims by that time he told me that they had never had any sort of trouble even when moslems and hindus had arrived together this was probably because being technicians they were all fairly welleducated men made more broadminded too by travel to prevent any risk of clashes however he had had separate dormitory huts put up for each of the three main religions and these stood each behind its own temple in an orderly array with all these buildings from the air damrey phong was starting to look quite a place i found connie in bed on the veranda he was looking very frail and white it did not seem to me that he had very long to go he no longer got up a speak to the pilgrims nor did he pay much attention to them while i was there the routine was that they went to prayer at their own temple and there the resident priest explained to them that they must not expect much from the teacher who was now a dying man then they would come and sit down on the ground in front of the house where they could see connie in his bed and he went on talking to whoever happened to be with him or dozing paying little or no attention to them in the evening they were called to prayer again and ate and slept and took off again in their aircraft in the morning i sat with him on the veranda in the days that i was there for long periods watched by all these pilgrims seated on the ground before the house after a time one forgot about them and took no notice he was very pleased to see me and grateful for everything that had been done to help him madй jasmi sat all day on the veranda steps when she was not cooking or washing for him making her palm leaf offerings in the balinese way the hindu priest had made a special little shrine to shiva for her in the temple and she used to put them there and pray when pilgrims were about she wore her jacket but at other times she usually left it off for coolness when the buddhist priest boonchuey came to talk to connie which he did frequently madй was banished to the back quarters with the other women connie liked to talk about the earliest days when we had met in cobhams circus when we had done the gretna green act together in the old ford when we had been bombed by the crazyflying moths and avros with little paper bags of flour and rolls of toilet paper and my skirt always got torn off he could still laugh at the recollection of the fun that we had had together even though it hurt him to laugh now youve come a long way since those days tom he said once you never thought that youd end up by running an air line half across the world and owning all the assets of the business i smiled you never thought that pilgrims would be coming from five thousand miles away to watch you talking to me and to pray beside your house no he said thoughtfully no id never have thought of that its funny the way things turn out another time he said i didnt want to end up with this sort of reputation tom all i ever wanted to be was an absolutely firstclass ground engineer the best in the world and because the best teacher is the chap whos only one jump ahead of the pupil i thought i could teach others to be firstclass chaps but the truth of it is you cant do any job really well unless youre really good yourself the perfect job demands a perfect man and you cant separate the two i didnt understand that when i started it wasnt until i came out to the east and learned something about religious ideas here that i began to cotton on to what it was all about and another time he said theyre making legends about me already tom try and tone that down theyre paying far too much attention to what that english pongyi u set tahn has been saying you mean about you being born in tibet or somewhere he nodded its completely wrong i was born in penang and im a british subject ive got a birth certificate to prove it he hesitated my father married my mother up at barkul true enough but i was born in penang so that prophecy cant possibly apply to me i wasnt quite so sure about that though i didnt argue the point some asiatic countries have a different definition of when a man is born another thing he said u set tahn and the rangoon buddhists say that the new teachers ministry will last for four years and twentythree days theyre trying to pin that one on me too i know i said well when did i start teaching anybody anything he asked triumphantly i dont know myself i simply havent a clue when did you first come to damrey phong i asked four years ago last thursday he said i worked it out but i never taught anybody anything while i was here so that ones all wrong too because i was here three months and i dont suppose im going to live that long try and put a stopper on this sort of thing tom if you can i want people to remember me as a good ground engineer with both feet on the ground not as a legendary mystic or anything like that ill do my best i said and as i sat there i wondered if he knew when he had been teaching or if in those early days his teaching had been largely unconscious u myin and chai tai foong had both been with him at damrey phong and they were among the most devout of connies followers that evening i walked out with nadezna to the runway in the bright moon and we walked up and down it for a time talking of connie and presently at the far end where nobody could see us i took both her hands and i said what about us after this is all over and it must be soon im afraidafter that will you marry me she said i wanted to tell you about that tom she hesitated im not going to marry anybody ever i said quietly i dont think thats a very good idea she smiled im sure you dont but its what im going to do i held her a little closer not because of your chinese father i asked its not reasonable to let that worry you it doesnt worry me you know it doesnt we can work that out together i dont want to go and live in england all my work and all my interests are out here nadezna but it wont be any fun unless youre with me she freed herself a little and i knew that i had failed its not that tom she said im not worried about that now i know that if i married you wed get over the mixed marriage side of it all right but wed be letting such an awful lot of people down i was puzzled who would we be letting down i asked she did not answer me directly ive learned a great deal since ive been here with connie she said you cant help being influenced by it tomall these aeroplanes that come here every day at such expense full of people who believe in him people who have spent all their savings just to make this journey because connie is a man that they can pin their faith to all they want to do is just to hear him say a few words or if thats not possible then just to see him or touch something that he has touched itsits like the bible tom like people that were wanting to see jesus they believe in him they havent been doing any worshipping have they i asked not like as if he was a god she shook her head they havent been like that they know that hes a man and that hes dying gods dont die but they know too or they think they know that he is such a man as they will never see again and they go away feeling that just to look at him and touch what he has touched has done them good and has made their lives complete and justified spending all their savings to come all this way they dont think that hes a god but if you asked me if they thought that he was a man who had attained perfection as gautama attained itwell i think a lot of them do think of him like that they do you mean as an example i suggested i think thats it she said they venerate him as an example of what any man can attain to if he can be as wise and thoughtful and selfsacrificing and as good as connie we stood together in the moonlight for a little on the runway over against the strip the mountain loomed above us scented in the warm night air hes my brother tom she said simply one never thinks ones brother can be anything particular i thought he was just nuts about religion and it was all because hed never had a girl in the united states because he was an asiatic who was out of place its not easy when youre brought up as an englishman or an american but youre really asiatic tom i know i thought that connie was just an ordinary brother just like any girl might have i thought that up till the time i came here but now im not sure i was silent perhaps i wasnt quite so sure myself these people that come here to see him she said presently they think hes a man but a man touched by the hand of god whichever form of god they happen to believe in and because thats what they think it does them good and gives them something to hang on to because it means that god still cares about the world and cares for them thats why they come here tom they come to see the evidence that god still cares that he has shown that care in making of one man a perfect example to show everyone the way to live their lives out in the modern world she turned to me its bad luck on us she said but im not going to spoil it for them if i connies sister married and had children and lived just a normal womans life going out shopping in the morning going to the movies in the evening while you worked up a bigger business every year and we made moneyitld detract from it maybe theyd get to feel that connie couldnt have been something after all if his sister wasnt anything if they thought that theyd lose the faith they have and with that theyd lose everything that he has worked to give them its in my hands now tom whether what hes started goes ahead or flops at least i think it is and its not going to flop i cleared my throat what are you going to do its bad luck on you tom she repeated you deserve a better deal than this but if connie could give up love to help along the things that he believes in so can i i dont have to give up children though im going to go back to penang tom where i came from im going to go to mother mary immaculate and ask if i can start in at the bottom working in the orphanage thats where i came from and i reckon thatll be the best thing i can do i asked her may i come and see you there sometimes she said pleaseplease dont do that tom and please dont write i started on my journey to bahrein next day because i couldnt stay away too long connie lived for a month after that gradually growing weaker then he went into a coma that lasted about thirty hours he died just before dawn and the cremation took place on the same day according to the custom in the east only the road and the dawn the sun the wind and the rain and the watch fire under stars and sleep and the road again john masefield damrey phong has grown a bit since then but the proctor still stands in the same tin hangar with the engine that connie took out of it when he put in the new one standing beside it on an overhaul trestle he changed the engines before he got too ill to work and got the old one stripped down for overhaul with the sump off and the cylinder heads cylinders valves valve gear and pistons laid out neatly on a table in rows all washed and clean and resting on a blanket he had to give up then and he never worked again and so the job remains just as he left it the pilgrims file past every day and look at the proctor and these engine parts laid out behind the wooden railing and most of them kneel down and say a prayer or two according to their creed its not quite the same of course sheikh fahad went there at a very early stage and had a sort of temple roof a temple with no walls except the roof posts built over the whole lot to protect it from the rains so that the two little european houses and the corrugated iron hangar with the proctor in it and the very lovely shrine that he set up to hold the casket of ashes are all under the same wide roof and safe for a considerable time the house that connie died in is kept just the same with his bed and his few clothes laid out all very simple in the other house there is a small museum and here his tools are displayed he had quite a lot of fine precision tools and measuring instruments micrometers inside micrometers feelers thread gauges callipers vernier gaugesall that sort of thing these are exposed to view and may be touched and handled reverently by the pilgrims if they wish and they are kept so carefully cleaned and greased that they are as bright and new as when he bought them in another room there are five pictures and nothing else fahad as a moslem will have nothing to do with pictures of course though i have been there with him and noticed that he spent a quarter of an hour in that room with them mr ghosh a bengal jute merchant commissioned evan stanley to come out from england to paint them and a committee of the three priests on the airstrip decided that they should be of connie shak lin himself taken from photographs and of the four people he loved best so there is a very good picture of connie in his stained khaki shorts and shirt grave and intent working on the engine of his proctor which stands in the background of the hangar behind him there is one of arjan singh seated in the pilots seat of the proctor they chose that because so many people had seen arjan in that six months with connie and had seen how carefully he cared for him on that last journey there is one of nadezna a very good one i can hardly bear to look at it there is one of madй jasmi very sweet but not quite natural because she has her jacket on and there is one of me which oughtnt to be there at all things are a bit different at bahrein too on the aerodrome there was a considerable demand from the people backed by sheikh fahad that a mosque should be built on the bit of vacant land beside the hangar that connie had first used for prayers and that the hangar should continue to be used for civil aviation so that the moslem engineers should have the mosque available for prayer right by the hangar this meant that the raf would have to move away and leave that area undisturbed although it is right on the edge of their camp they have been exceptionally understanding and farsighted about all this and have accepted the considerable inconvenience that must result to them their new hangars are going up at the south end of the northsouth runway nearly a mile away from their camp the mosque is going up beside the civil aviation hangar a fair number of pilgrim aircraft come to bahrein perhaps one a week most of these are from egypt or iraq places relatively near at hand and most of these pilgrims are people who cant afford the long journey to damrey phong damrey is the main centre for pilgrimages of course since it was here that connies ministry began and finished but its a long way and an expensive journey for them however much one tries to cut the rates i have two new tramps on order now specially fitted for pilgrims and i hope to get the fares down to about sixty per cent of what one has to charge for a dakota fare but its still an awful lot of money for an engineer to save and yet they do it some of them perhaps one or two machines a month go further still right down to bali where phinit shows them the hangar and the huts in pekendang where connie lived and madй jasmi still sits quietly weaving her lamaks on the steps oblivious of the brown people from far lands who have come to see the relics of which she is one i told her through phinit when i took her back to bali that her service to connie had been an episode of her youth tender and lovely to look back upon now i said she ought to marry a young man of her people and have children like a normal girl i told her that but so far there is no indication at all that she intends to follow my advice nadezna is in penang living in the convent and working with the orphans she came to some working arrangement with the mother superior and the bishop that allows her to stay there although she is far from being a catholic or anything else as yet the bishop seems to have agreed with her desire to be taken out of circulation gujar singh and arjan go to see her from time to time when a machine nightstops at penang and they tell me she is well and happy in her work but i have not seen her myself since i left damrey phong before connie died and it may be that i shall never see her again i had several long conferences with sheikh fahad and wazir hussein in the months that followed connies death i was lonely and troubled and at first there didnt seem to be much point in going on with anything i was very tired and i didnt known what to do i thought of selling out my business to airservice perhaps and going to live at damrey phong for a time anyway its quiet there and one can think about things but after a time i got settled down and then it seemed to me that it would be a better thing to carry on the business and run it in the way that connie liked so that in a materialistic world my airline should be an example running through asia to show that men can keep the aircraft safe by serving god in connies way and yet keep on the black side of the ledger id go so far as to say from my experience that only by serving god in this way can you keep out of the red so we go on as we did before sheikh fahad is very anxious to do everything he can to help the pilgrims and after one or two talks he asked me if i could find and operate some very economical machines equipped solely for the job i borrowed from him as i had borrowed from his father the capital to order two new tramps shortrange machines with rather longer fuselages equipped solely for the pilgrim traffic and i hope to get these out to the persian gulf next month i think at some time in the future i shall move my main base to baraka these technical alterations have meant that the delivery time of the two tramps has been extended to three months i have taken that time in england as a holiday leaving gujar singh in charge because it was nearly three years since i had been home and i was stale and tired and nervy before i left sheikh fahad told me of his new project the six books i think the six books are a very good idea already people are beginning to say that connie was divine and legends are already growing up about him they are inventing quite fictitious miracles which he is supposed to have performed although he never did anything of the sort sheikh fahads idea is that the people who had most to do with connie should write down what they know about him in a book now while the memory is still fresh and before these stupid legends have had time to grow in that way proper evidence of what he was and what he did will be set down by people who knew him at first hand sheikh fahad has engaged three scribes who between them speak english and arabic and burmese and siamese and balinese to help those who arent very handy at writing to get their evidence down on paper in a coherent form and to edit all six books when they are all done the sheikh is gopg to have them translated into several asiatic languages and possibly into english also so that men who maintain aircraft and believe in connie may know exactly what he said and did so first there is to be the book of the sister which will tell us about connies early life and about his private life in bahrein and about his last months at damrey phong next there is the book of myin which will tell about his first period at damrey phong under dwight schafter when his ministry began the third book is the book of tarik which is a very detailed record of his sayings in the hangar at bahrein there is good material for this because tarik was in the habit of writing down everything he could in penny exercise books in arabic and there are about thirty of these books for the scribes to consult the fourth book is the book of phinit which is an account of connies life in bali and of madй jasmi and her love for him the fifth book is the book of arjan which deals with everything that happened on the six months tour they made together in the proctor u which they visited so many aerodromes while connie gradually grew weaker the sixth and last book is this one the book of cutter its obviously right that anybody who can put down on paper any firsthand knowledge of connies life should do so but fahad asked me to go further than that and put down anything about my own life which i thought would make the picture complete and explain to future generations why i did the things i did which ultimately reacted upon connie so i have put down everything that i could think of that would make the story a complete one and if fahads editors find any part of it unnecessary they can cut it out i have been glad to have this three months at home in england in our little house in southampton between the gas works and the docks dad goes out to work each day of course and mum is busy about the house and in the kitchen and i have been able to write quietly all day in the back bedroom that we all slept in as boys its a good thing to get out of the east for a job like this because you can look back and see what happened in perspective and that helps mum and dad want me to stay in england now and find a job here they dont think the east has done me any good and thatsrather sad because i think its done me all the good in the world i know that i dont think about things now in quite the same way as i used to and that in england people think me a bit queer i know that in the aircraft industry theres a good deal of talk about my operations based upon the garbled tales that have got through to england people are saying that ive been out in the east too long and ive gone round the bend maybe i have but then i think that being round the bend is the best place to be so i shall go back to bahrein as soon as these two tramps are ready for delivery and now at the conclusion of this book i still dont know what to think about connie to me he was always an ordinary person a good friend from my youth a very fine engineer a very good man hes still that to mei think but as i have sat here for the last three months in our back bedroom writing down everything that i can remember about him and meditating am beginning to wonder if i have been right so many men of so many races are now turning to the memory of him moulding their lives upon his example praying that they may be made as he was could any human man exert such influence after his death what makes a man divine i cant answer my own questions i still think connie was a human man a very very good onebut a man i have been wrong in my judgments many times before if now i am ignorant and blind im sorry but its no new thing if that should be the case though it means that i have had great privileges in my life perhaps more so than any man alive today because it means that on the fields and farms of england on the airstrips of the desert and the jungle in the hangars of the persian gulf and on the tarmacs of the southern islands i have walked and talked with god
