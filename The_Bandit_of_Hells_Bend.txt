the bandit of hells bend the bandit of hells bend edgar rice burroughs chapter i tough luck a halfdozen men sprawled comfortably in backtilted chairs against the side of the bar y bunkhouse at the home ranch they were young men lithe of limb tanned of face and clear of eye their skins shone from recent ablutions and their slicked hair was still damp for they had but just come from the evening meal and meals at the home ranch required a toilet one of them was singing in the shade of a tree we two sat him an me where the haegler hills slope to the raft while our ponies browsed round reins adraggin the ground then he looks at me funny an laft most anyone would interrupted a listener shut up admonished another i aint only heered this three hundred an sixtyfive times in the las year do you think i want to miss anything unabashed the sweet singer continued do you see thet there town he inquires pintin down to some shacks sprawlin round in the heat i opined thet i did an he shifted his quid after drowndin a tumblebug neat then he looks at me square theres a guy waitin there thet the sheepmen have hired to git me are you game to come down to thet jerkwater town jest to see what in hell you will see one of the group rose and stretched yawning he was a tall dark man perhaps in his expression there was something a bit sinister he seldom smiled and when not in liquor rarely spoke he was foremanhad been foreman for over a year and except for a couple of sprees during which he had playfully and harmlessly shot up the adjoining town he had been a good foreman for he was a thorough horseman knew the range understood cattle was a hard worker and knew how to get work out of others it had been six months since he had been drunk though he had taken a drink now and then if one of the boys chanced to bring a flask back from town his abstinence might have been accounted for by the fact that elias henders his boss had threatened to break him the next time he fell from grace you see bull the old man had said were the biggest outfit in this part of the country an it dont look good to see the foreman of the bar y shootin up the town like some kid tenderfoot thats been slapped in the face with a barrag you gotta quit it bull i aint agoin to tell you again and bull knew the old man wouldnt tell him again so he had stayed good for six long months perhaps it was not entirely a desire to cling to the foremans job that kept him in the straight and narrow path perhaps diana henders opinion had had more weight with him than that of her father im ashamed of you bull she had said and she refused to ride with him for more than a week that had been bad enough but as if to make it worse she had ridden several times with a new hand who had drifted in from the north a short time before and been taken on by bull to fill a vacancy at first bull had not liked the new man hes too damned pretty to be a puncher one of the older hands had remarked and it is possible that the newcomers rather extreme good looks had antagonized them all a little at first but he had proven a good man and so the others had come to accept hal colby in spite of his wealth of waving black hair his perfect profile gleaming teeth and laughing eyes so i told him id go fer i liked thet there bo and id see thet the shootin was fair but says he it is just to see who starts it fust thet i wants anyone to be there im going to turn in remarked bull hal colby rose same here he said and followed the foreman into the bunkhouse a moment later he turned where he stood beside his bunk and looked at bull who was sitting on the edge of his removing his spurs the handsome lips were curved in a pleasant smile lookee here bull he whispered and as the other turned toward him he reached a hand beneath the bag of clothes that constituted his pillow and drew forth a pint flask wet your whistle he inquired dont care if i do replied the foreman crossing the room to colbys bunk through the open window floated the drawling notes of texas petes perennial rhapsody when the jedge says who drew his gun fust him or you then i wants a straight guy on my side fer thet poor puddin head why hes already dead with a fortyfive hole in his hide heres lookin at you said bull drink hearty replied colby taint so bad at that remarked the foreman wiping his lips on the cuff of his shirt and handing the flask back to the other not so worse for rotgut agreed colby have another the foreman shook his head t wont hurt you any colby assured him its pretty good stuff sang texas pete and thet wasnt jest jawwhen it come to a draw this here guy was like lightnin turned loose then we rolls us a smoke an not neither one spoke til he said climb aboard your cayuse then we reined down the hill each apuffin his pill to the town neath its shimmer o heat an heads up to the shack thats aleanin its back gainst the side o the cowboys retreat bull took another drinka longer one this time and rolling a cigarette sat down on the edge of colbys bunk and commenced to talkwhiskey always broke the bonds of his taciturnity his voice was low and not unpleasant he spoke of the days work and the plans for tomorrow and hal colby encouraged him perhaps he liked him perhaps like others he felt that it paid to be on friendly terms with the foreman while from outside it is slewfoots good luck where they hand you out chuck thet is mostly sowbelly an beans says he bub lets us feedim afeelin the need o more substance than air in my jeans so of slewfoot was there all red freckles an hair an we lined our insides with his grub says bill then show your gaitlets be pullin our freight fer im rarin to go says he bub inside the bunkhouse bull rose to his feet thats damn good stuff hal he said the two had emptied the flask wait a minute said the other i got another flask and reached again beneath his bag no demurred the foreman i guess i got enough oh hell you aint had none yet insisted colby the song of texas pete suffered many interruptions due to various arguments in which he felt compelled to take sides but whenever there was a lull in the conversation he resumed his efforts to which no one paid any attention further than as they elicited an occasional word of banter the sweet singer never stopped except at the end of a stanza and no matter how long the interruption even though days might elapse he always began again with the succeeding stanza without the slightest hesitation or repetition and so now as bull and colby drank he sang on now well sashay next door to thet hardticker store where his nibs is most likely to be an then you goes in first an starts drowdin your thirst but akeepin your eyes peeled fer me bull the foreman rose to his feet he stood as steady as a rock but colby saw that he was drunk after six months of almost total abstinence he had just consumed considerably more than a pint of cheap and fiery whiskey in less than a half hour goin to bed asked colby bed hell replied the other im goin to townits my night to howl comin no said colby i think ill turn in have a good time i sure will the foreman walked to his bunk and strapped his guns about his hips resumed the single spur he had removed tied a fresh black silk handkerchief about his neck clapped his sombrero over his shock of straight black hair and strode out of the bunkhouse fer i wants you to see thet its him draws on me so the jedge he caint make me the goat so i heads fer that dump an a queer little lump starts awrigglin aroun in my throat say where in hells bull goin this time o night pete interrupted himself hes headin fer the horse crel stated another acts like he was full said a third didje hear him hummin a tune as he went out thats always a sign with him the stuff sort o

hell when theres shootin whose blood will be spilt there he goes now said one of the men as the figure of a rider shown dimly in the starlight loped easily away toward the south an hes goin toward town i wonder said texas pete if he knows the old man is in town tonight jest inside o the door with one foot on the floor an the other hist up on the rail stands a big rawboned guy with the ornriest eye thet i ever seen outen a jail by gollies im goin after bull i doan blieve heall knows thet the of mans in town and leaping to his feet he walked off toward the horse corral still singing an beside him a girl thet sure looked like a pearl thet the bible guy cast before swine was apleadin with him her eyes teary an dim as i highsign the barkeep fer mine he caught up one of the loose horses in the corral rammed a great silvermounted spade bit between its jaws threw a heavy carved saddle upon the animals back stepped one foot into a trailing tapaderaed stirrup and was off in a swirl of dust texas pete never rode other than in a swirl of dust unless it happened to be raining then he rode in a shower of mud his speed tonight was therefore not necessarily an indication of haste he would have ridden at the same pace to either a funeral or a wedding or home from either but any who knew texas pete could have guessed that he was in considerate haste for he rode without his woolly sheepskin chaps one of the prides of his existence if he had been in too much of a hurry to don them he must have been in a great hurry indeed texas pete might be without a job with not more than twobits between himself and starvation but he was never without a fine pair of sheepskin chaps a silverencrusted bit a heavy bridle garnished with the same precious metal an ornate saddle of hand carved leather and silver conchas a stetson two good sixguns with their belt and holsters and a vivid silk neckerchief possibly his pony cost no more than ten dollars his boots were worn and his trousers blue denim overalls greasy and frayed yet texas pete otherwise was a thing of beauty and a joy forever the rowels of his silverinlaid mexican spurs dragged the ground when he walked and the dumbbells depending from their hubs tinkled merrily a gay accompaniment to his boyish heart beating beneath ragged underclothing texas pete galloped along the dusty road toward the small cattletown that served the simple needs of that frontier community with its general store its restaurant its chinese laundry blacksmith shop hotel newspaper office and five saloons and as he galloped he sang then the door swings agin an my pal he steps in an the light in his eye it was bad an the rawboned guy wheels an the girl there she squeals o fer gawds sake dont shoot bill its dad a mile ahead of pete another pony tore through the dust toward towna blazedface chestnut with two white hind feet blazes the pride of the foremans heart in the deep saddle centaurlike sat the horseman hendersville tinkled softly in the quiet of early evening later gaining momentum it would speed up a bit under his own power at present it reposed in the partial lethargy of digestive functioningsit was barely first drink time after supper its tinkling was the tinkling of spurs chips and only very occasional glassware suddenly its repose was shattered by a wild whoop from without the clatter of swift hoofs and the rapid crack crack crack of a sixgun gum smith sheriff rose from behind the faro layout and cocked an attentive ear gum guided the destinies of the most lucrative thirst emporium in hendersville being sheriff flattered his vanity and attracted business but it had its drawbacks the noises from without sounded like one of them and gum was pained it was at times such as this that he almost wished that someone else was sheriff but a quick glance at the shiny badge pinned to the left hand pocket of his vest reassured him quickly on that point and he glanced swiftly about the room at its other occupants and sighed in reliefthere were at least a dozen husky young punchers there across the street in the office of the hendersville tribune elias henders sat visiting with ye editor as the shouting and the shots broke the quiet of the evening the two men looked up and outward toward the street boys will be boys remarked the editor a bullet crashed through the glass at the top of the window with a single movement the editor extinguished the lamp that burned on the desk before them and both men with a celerity that spoke habit crouched quickly behind that piece of furniture sometimes theyre damn careless though replied elias henders down the road texas pete galloped and sang for the thing she had saw was bill reach for to draw when the guy she called dad drawed on bill in the door was my pal with his eyes on the gal an his hand on his gunstandin still from the distance ahead came thinly the sound of shots by gollies exclaimed texas pete the darned sonofagun the men lolling about the barroom of gums placeliquors and cigarslooked up at the sound of the shots and grinned an instant later a horses unshod hoofs pounded on the rough boards of the covered porch in front of gums place the swinging doors burst in and blazes was brought to his haunches in the center of the floor with a wild whoop from his rider who waved a smoking gun above his head bull the bar y foreman let his gaze run quickly about the room when his steelgrey eyes alighted upon the sheriff they remained there gum smith appeared to wilt behind the faro table he shook a wavering finger at the bar y foreman yo alls undah arrest he piped in a high thin voice and turning toward the men seated about the neighboring tables he pointed first at one and then at another ah depatize yo ah depatize yo ah depatize yo he announced to each as he covered them in turn with his swiftly moving index finger seize him men no one moved gum smith waxed excited seize him yoall ahm sheriff o this yere county ef ah depatize yoall yoalls got to be depatized my mother was a wild cat my father was a bear announced bull i picks my teeth with barbwire with cactus combs my hair and i craves drinkpronto yoalls undah arrest seize him men shrilled gum bull fired into the floor at the foot of the faro table and gum smith disappeared behind it the men all laughed bull turned his attention toward the barkeep and fired into the back bar the barkeep grinned be keerful bull he admonished i got a bad heart my doctor tells me as how i should avoid excitement the front doors swung in again and bull wheeled with ready sixgun to cover the newcomer but at sight of the man who entered the room the muzzle of his gun dropped and he was sobered in the instant oh said elias henders so its you agin bull eh the two men stood looking at one another in silence for a moment what was passing in their minds no one might have guessed it was the older man who spoke again first i reckon ill not be needin you any more bull he said and then after a momentsreflection unless you want a job as a handafter you sober up he turned and left the building and as he stepped down into the dust of the road texas pete swung from his pony and brushed past him inside bull sat his horse at one side of the large room near the bar behind him gum smith was slowly emerging from the concealment of the faro table when he saw the man he feared sitting with his back toward him a crafty look came into the eyes of the sheriff he glanced quickly about the room the men were all looking at bull no one seemed to be noticing gum he drew his gun and levelled it at the back of the exforeman of the bar y instantly there was a flash from the doorway the crack of a shot and the sheriffs gun dropped from his hand all eyes turned in the direction of the entrance there stood texas pete his shooting iron smoking in his hand you damn polecat he exclaimed his eyes on gum come on bull this aint no place for quiet young fellers like us bull wheeled blazes and rode slowly through the doorway with never a glance toward the sheriff nor could he better have shown his utter contempt for the man there had always been bad blood between them smith had been elected by the lawless element of the community and at the time of the campaign bull had worked diligently for the opposing candidate who had been backed by the better element consisting largely of the cattle owners headed by elias henders what bulls position would have been had he not been foreman for henders at the time was rather an open question among the voters of hendersville but the fact remained that he had been foreman and that he had worked to such good purpose for the candidate of the reform element that he had not only almost succeeded in electing him but had so exposed the rottenness of the gang back of smiths candidacy that their power was generally considered to be on the wane itll be bull for sheriff next election was considered a safe prophecy and even a foregone conclusion by some gum smith picked up his gun and examined it texas petes shot had struck the barrel just in front of the cylinder the man looked angrily around at the other occupants of the room ah wants yoall to remember that ahm sheriff here he cried an when ah depatizes yoall its plum legal an yoall gotta do what ah tell yo to oh shut up gum admonished one of the men outside texas pete had mounted his pony and was moving along slowly stirrup to stirrup with bull who was now apparently as sober as though he had never had a drink in his life its a good thing fer us he didnt have his gang there tonight remarked pete bull shrugged but said nothing in reply texas pete resigned himself to song then thet damned rawboned guy with the ornery eye up an shoots my pal dead in the door but im here to opine with this bazoo o mine thet he wont shoot no hombres no more what was you doin up to town texas inquired bull oh i jest thought as how id ride up an see what was doinmaybe you didnt know the old man was there tonightreckon i was a bit late eh yes thanks just the samei wont ferget it tough luck howd you know the old man was goin to be in town tonight why i reckon as how everybody exceptin you knew it bull did colby know it why i recken as how he must of they rode on for some time in silence which texas finally broke jest a moment an where theyd been five o us there we hed suddenly dwindled to three the barkeep he was onethe darned sonofagunan the others a orphan an me when bull and texas entered the bunkhouse most of the men were asleep but hal colby rolled over on his bunk and smiled at bull as the latter lighted a lamp have a good time bull he inquired the old man was there said bull an i aint foreman no more touch luck sympathized colby chapter ii the holdup after breakfast the following morning the men were saddlingup listlessly for the days work there was no foreman now and they were hanging about waiting for the boss bull sat on the top rail of the corral idle he was out of a job his fellows paid little or no attention to him but whether from motives of consideration for his feelings or because they were not interested in him or his troubles a casual observer could not have deduced from their manner unquestionably he had friends among them but he was a taciturn man and like all such did not make friends quickly undemonstrative himself he aroused no show of demonstration in others his straight black hair and rather high cheek bones coupled with a tanned skin gave him something the appearance of an indian a similarity that was further heightened by his natural reserve while a long red scar across his jaw accentuated a suggestion of grimness that his countenance possessed in repose texas pete saddling his pony directly below him in the corral was starting the day with a new song i stood at the bar at the spread eagle bar adrinkin a drink whilst i smoked a seegar quittin bull he inquired looking up at the exforeman reckon so came the reply when in walks a gent thet i aint never see an he lets out a beller an then says says he texas pete swung easily into his saddle reckon as how ill be pullin my freight too he announced i been aimin to do thet for quite a spell wherell we head fer bulls eyes wandered to the front of the ranch house and as they did so they beheld the old man emerging from the office behind him came his daughter diana and hal colby the latter were laughing and talking gaily bull could not but notice how close the man leaned toward the girls face what an easy way colby had with peopleespecially women well demanded texas pete if youre comin why dont you saddle up reckon ive changed my mind texas pete glanced toward the ranch house following the direction of the others eyes and shrugged his shoulders o well he said this aint a bad place reckon as how ill stay on too fer a spell elias henders and hal colby were walking slowly in the direction of the horse corral the girl had turned and reentered the house the two men entered the corral and as they did so bull descended from the fence and approached henders you dont happen to need no hands do you he asked the older man i can use you bull replied henders with a faint smile thirtyfive a month and found the former foreman nodded in acceptance of the terms and walking toward the bunch of horses huddled at one side of the corral whistled instantly blazes head came up above those of the other animals with uppricked ears he regarded his owner for a moment and then shouldering his way through the bunch he walked directly to him elias henders stopped in the center of the corral and attracted the attention of the men colby here he announced is the new foreman that was all there was a moments embarrassed silence and then the men resumed their preparations for the work of the day or if they were ready lolled in their saddles rolling cigarettes colby went among them assigning the various duties for the daypretty much routine work with which all were familiar and you bull he said when he reached the exforeman i wish youd ride up to the head of cottonwood canyon and see if you can see anything of that bunch of crazy j cowsi aint seen nothin of em for a week or more it was the longest hardest assignment of the day but if bull was dissatisfied with it he gave no indication as a matter of fact he probably was content for he was a hard rider and he liked to be off alone a trait that had always been a matter for comment and some conjecture more than one had asked himself or a neighbor what bull found to do that took him off by himself so often there are those who cannot conceive that a man can find pleasure in his own company or in that of a good horse and the open the mouth of cottonwood canyon lay a good twenty miles from the ranch and the head of it five miles of rough going farther it was ten oclock when bull suddenly drew rein beside the lone cottonwood that marked the entrance to the canyon and gave it its name he sat motionless listening intently faintly from far up the canyon came the staccato of rifle shots how far it was difficult to judge for the walls of a winding canyon quickly absorb sound once convincedof the direction of their origin however the man urged his pony into a gallop turning his head up the canyon as the last of the cow hands loped away from the ranch upon the business of the day elias henders turned back toward the office while hal colby caught up two ponies which he saddled and bridled humming meanwhile a gay little tune mounting one he rode toward the ranch house leading the other just as diana henders emerged from the interior making it apparent for whom the led horse was intended taking the reins from colby the girl swung into the saddle like a man and she sat her horse like a man too and yet though she could ride with the best of them and shoot with the best of them there was nothing coarse or common about her some of the older hands had known her since childhood yet even that fact coupled with the proverbial freedom of the eighties in arizona never permitted them the same freedom with diana henders that most of the few girls in that wild country either overlooked or accepted as a matter of course men did not curse in dianas presence nor did they throw an arm across her slim shoulders or slap her upon the back in good fellowship and yet they all worshipped her and most of them had been violently in love with her something within her inherently fine and noble kept them at a distance or rather in their places for only those men who were hopelessly bashful ever remained at a distance from diana where there was the slightest chance to be near her the men often spoke of her as a thoroughbred sensing perhaps the fine breeding that made her what she was elias henders was one of the henders of kentucky and like all the males of his line for generations held a degree from oxford which he had entered after graduation from the beloved alma mater of his native state for the very excellent reason that old sir john henders who had established the american branch of the family had been an oxford man and had seen his son and his grandson follow his footsteps twentyfive years before elias henders had come west with john manill a classmate and neighbor of kentucky and the two young men had entered the cattle business their combined capital managed to keep them from the embarrassments and annoyances of a sheriffs sale for some three years but what with raiding apaches poor rail facilities and a distant market coupled with inexperience they were at last upon the very brink of bankruptcy when henders discovered gold on their property two years later they were rich men henders returned to kentucky and married manills sister and shortly afterwards moved to new york as it was decided that the best interests of the partnership required an eastern representative manill remained in arizona diana henders was born in new york city and when she was about five years old her mother contracted tuberculosis of the lungs physicians advising a dry climate henders and manill changed places henders taking his family to arizona and manill removing to new york with his wife and little daughter he had married beneath him and unhappily with the result that being both a proud and rather reserved man he had confided nothing to his sister the wife of his partner and best friend when diana was fifteen her mother had died and the girl refusing to leave her father had abandoned the idea of finishing her education in an eastern college and elias henders loath to give her up had acquiesced in her decision qualified by education as he was to instruct her dianas training had been carried on under the tutorage of her father so that at nineteen though essentially a frontier girl unversed in many of the finer artificialities of social usage she was yet a young woman of culture and refinement her music which was the delight of her father she owed to the careful training of her mother as well as to the possession of a grand piano that had come over raton pass behind an ox team in the seventies her father her books her music and her horses constituted the life of this young girl her social companions the young vaqueros who rode for her father and without at least one of whom she was not permitted to ride abroad since the apaches were still a menace in the arizona of that day and so it was that this morning she rode out with the new foreman they walked their horses in silence for a few minutes the mans stirrup just behind that of the girl where he might let his eyes rest upon her profile without detection the heavylashed eye the short straight nose the patrician mouth and chin held the adoring gaze of the young foreman in mute worship but it was he who at length broke the silence you aint congratulated me yet di he said or maybe you didnt know yes i knew she replied and i do congratulate you but i cannot forget that your fortune means another mans sorrow its his own fault a man that cant keep sober cant be trusted with a job like this he was a good foreman maybe soi aint sayin nothin about a man thats down it seems to me you set a lot of store by him though and what do you know about him you cant be too careful di theres lots of bad uns in these parts and when a feller never talks none like him its probably because hes got something on his mind he dont want to talk about i thought he was your friend said the girl colby flushed he is my friend i set a lot of store by bull but its you im thinkin ofnot him or me i wouldnt want nothin to happen that youd have to be sorry about i dont understand you hal he flecked the leg of his chaps with the lash of his quirt oh pshaw di he parried i dont want to say nothin about a friend i only want to put you on your guard thats all you know there aint nothin i wouldnt do for youno not even if it cost me all the friends i got he passed his reins to his right hand and reaching across laid his left across one of hers which she quickly withdrew please dont she begged i love you di he blurted suddenly the girl laughed gaily though not in derision all the men think they do its because im the only girl within miles and miles youre the only girl in the worldfor me she turned and looked at him quizzically he was very handsome that and his boyish laughing manner had attracted her to him from the first there had seemed a frankness and openness about him that appealed to her and of all the men she knew only excepting her father he alone possessed anything approximating poise and selfconfidence in his intercourse with women the others were either shy and blundering or loud and coarse or taciturn sticks like bull who seemed to be the only man on the ranch who was not desperately in love with her well talk about something else she announced isnt there any hope for me he asked why yes she assured him i hope you will keep on loving me i love to have people love me but i dont want to do all the loving he insisted dont worryyoure not even the cook is writing poems about me of all the foolish men i ever heard of dad has certainly succeeded in corraling the prize bunch i dont care a hang about that redheaded old fool of a cook he snapped what i want is for you to love me oh well thats a horse of another color now we will have to change the subject please di im in earnest he pleaded wont you give me a little to hope for you never can tell about a girl hal she said her voice was tender and her eyes suddenly soft and that was as near a promise as he could get as bull urged blazes up the rough trail of cottonwood canyon the continued crack of rifles kept the man apprised of the direction of the origin of the sounds and approximately of their ever lessening distance ahead presently he drew rein and pulling his rifle from its boot dismounted dropping the reins upon the ground stand he whispered to blazes and crept forward stealthily the shooting was close ahead now just around the brushcovered shoulder of a rocky hill the detonations were less frequent bull guessed that by now both hunters and hunted were under cover and thus able to take only occasional pot shots at one anothers refuse to come upon them directly up the trail in the bottom of the canyon would have been to expose himself to the fire of one side and possibly of both for in this untamed country it was easily conceivable that both sides of the controversy might represent interests inimical to those of his employer with this idea in mind the exforeman of the bar y ranch clambered cautiously up the steep side of the hill that hid from his view that part of the canyon lying just beyond from the varying qualities of the detonations the man had deduced that five and possibly six rifles were participating in the affair how they were divided he could not even guess he would have a look over the crest of the hogback and if the affair was none of his business he would let the participants fight it out by themselves bull sober was not a man to seek trouble climbing as noiselessly as possible and keeping the muzzle of his rifle ahead of him he came presently to the crest of the narrow ridge where he pushed his way cautiously through the brush toward the opposite side passing around an occasional huge outcropping of rock that barred his progress presently the brush grew thinner he could see the opposite wall of the canyon a sharp report sounded close below him just over the brow of the ridge in front of him a huge outcropping reared its weatherworn surface twenty feet above the brush toward this he crept until he lay concealed behind it then warily he peered around the upcanyon edge discovering that his hiding place rested upon tire very edge of a steep declivity that dropped perpendicularly into the bottom of the canyon almost below him five apaches were hiding among the rocks arid boulders that filled the bottom of the canyon u ion the opposite side a single man lay sprawled upon his belly behind another bull could not see his face hidden as it was beneath a huge sombrero but he saw that he was garbed after the fashion of a vaquerohe might be either an american or a mexican that made no difference now however for there were five against him and the five were indians bull watched for a moment he saw that the indians were doing all the firing and he wondered if the man lying across the canyon was already dead he did not move cautiously one of the indians crept from cover as the other four fired rapidly at their victims position then another followed him and the three remaining continued firing covering the advance of their fellows bull smiled that grim saturnine smile of his there were some redskins in the vicinity that were dike for the surprise of their lives the two were working their way across the cangora taking advantage of every particle of cover they were quite close to the hiding place of the prone ran nowin another moment the three upon bulls side of the canyon would cease firing and the two would rush their unconscious quarry and finish him bull raised his rifle to his shoulder there followed two reports so close together that it was almost inconceivable that they had come from the same weapon and the two who had already risen for the final attack crumpled among the rocks beneath the blazing sun instantly apprehending their danger the other three apaches leaped to their feet and scurried up the canyon searching new cover as they ran but it was difficult to find cover from a rifle holding the commanding position that bulls held it spoke again and the foremost indian threw his hands above his head spun completely around and lunged forward upon his face the other two dropped behind large boulders bull glanced across the canyon he saw that the man had raised his head and was attempting to look around the edge of his cover having evidently become aware that a new voice had entered the grim chorus of the rifles hit shouted bull the man looked in the direction of the voice no he replied then why in hell dont you shoot theres only two of them lefttheyre up canyon on this side out of ammunition replied the other well you were in a hell of a fix mused bull as he watched the concealment of the two indians any more of em than this bunch he called across to the man no for a long time there was silencethe quiet and peace that had lain upon this ageold canyon since the creationand that would lie upon it forever except as man the disturber came occasionally to shatter it i cant lie here all day mused bull he crawled forward and looked over the edge of the cliff there was a sheer drop of forty feet he shook his head there was a sharp report and a bullet tore up the dirt beneath him it was followed instantly by another report from across the canyon bull kept his eyes on the cover of the indians not a sign of them showed one of them had caught him nappingthat was alland ducked back out of sight after firing but how was the man across the canyon firing without ammunition i got one then came the mans voice as though in answer but you better lie lowhe come near getting you thought you didnt have no ammunition bull called across i crawled out and got the rifle of one of these you potted bull had worked his way back to his cover and to the brush behind it and now he started up along the ridge in an attempt to get behind the remaining indian a minute or two later he crawled again to the edge of the ridge and there below him and in plain sight the last of the redskins crouched behind a great boulder bull fired and missed and then the apache was up and gone racing for his pony tethered further up the canyon the white man shrugged rose to his feet and sought an easy way down into the bed of the canyon the other man had seen his action which betokened that the fight was overand as bull reached the bottom of the cliff he was walking forward to meet him a peculiar light entered the eyes of each other as they came face to face ah exclaimed the one it is senor bull he spoke now in spanish gregorio said bull howd they git you in this fix i camped just above here last night replied the other and this morning i walked down with my rifle on the chance of getting an antelope for breakfast they come on me from above and there you are they been shootin at me since early this morning he spoke english with scarce the slightest accent you have saved my life senor bull and gregorio will not forget that you havent happened to see a bunch of crazy j cows hereabouts have you inquired bull ignoring the others expression of gratitude no senor i have not replied gregorio well ill go get my horse and have a look up toward the head of the canyon anyway and bull turned and walked down to get blazes fifteen minutes later riding up again he passed gregorio coming down the latter having found his pony and his belongings intact at his camp a dios senor called gregorio in passing so long returned the american at the head of the canyon where it narrowed to the proportions of a gorge bull examined the ground carefully and saw that no cattle had passed that way in many daysthen he turned back and rode down the canyon meanwhile entering cottonwood from below jim weller looking for lost horses passed gregorio coming out and recognizing him loosened his gun in its holster and kept one eye on the mexican until he had passed out of sight around the shoulder of the hill that flanked the east side of the entrance to the canyon for gregorio bore an unsavory reputation in that part of the country he was an outlaw with a price upon his head howsumever mused weller i aint lost no outlawsits hosses im lookin for and he rode on with a sigh of relief that there was a solid hill between him and gregorios deadly aim ten minutes later he met bull coming down from the head of cottonwood the two men drew rein with a nod weller asked about horses learning from bull that there was no stock above them in cottonwood but he did not mention having met gregorio it was obvious to him that the two men could not have been in cottonwood together without having met and if bull did not want to mention it it was evident that he had some good reason for not doing so it was not the custom of the country to pry into the affairs of others bull did not mention gregorio nor did he speak of their brush with the apaches but that was because he was an uncommunicative man i think ill have a look up sinkhole canyon for them hosses remarked weller sinkhole was the next canyon west keep your eyes peeled for them crazy j cows said bull and ill ride up belters and if i see your horses ill run em down onto the flat they separated at the mouth of cottonwood weller riding toward the west while bull made his way eastwardly toward belters canyon which lay in the direction of the home ranch three hours later the semiweekly stage careening down the north pass trail drew up in a cloud of dust at the junction of the henders mine road at a signal from one of two men sitting in a buckboard as the stage slowed down one of the men leaped to the ground and as it came to a stop clambered to the top and took a seat beside the driver who had greeted him with a gruff jest the new passenger carried a heavy sack which he deposited between his feet he also carried a sawedoff shot gun across his knees the saints be praised exclaimed a fat lady with a rich brogue who occupied a seat inside the coach sure an i thought we were after bein held up an old gentleman with white whiskers down which a trickle of tobacco juice had cascaded its siennahued way reassured her no mum he said thets the messinger from the mine with a bag o bullion this here stage aint been held up fer three weeks no mum times aint what they uset to be with all these newfangled ideas about reform what are spilin the country the fat lady looked at him sideways disdainfully and gathered her skirts closer about her the stage lurched on the horses at a brisk gallop and as it swung around the next curve the fat lady skidded into the old gentlemans lap her bonnet tilting over one eye rakishly be off wid ye she exclaimed glaring at the little old gentleman as though the fault were all his she had scarcely regained her own side of the seat when another and opposite turn in the road precipitated the old gentleman into her lap ye spalpeen she shrilled as placing two fat hands against him she thrust him violently from her sure an its a disgrace it is that a poor widdylady cant travel in pace without the loikes o ye takin advantage o her weak an unprotected state the little old gentleman though he had two huge guns strapped at his hips appeared thoroughly cowed and terrifiedso much so in fact that he dared not venture even a word of protest at the injustice of her insinuations from the corners of his weak and watery blue eyes he surveyed her surreptitiously wiped the back of his perspiring neck with a flamboyant bandana and shrank farther into the corner of his seat a halfhour later the stage swung through the gap at the foot of the pass before it lay the rolling uplands through which the road wound down past the bar y ranch house and the town of hendersville on the flat below the gap was narrow and winding and the road excruciatingly vile necessitating a much slower pace than the driver had been maintaining since passing the summit the horses were walking the coach lurching from one chuckhole to another while clouds of acrid dust arose in almost vapor lightness enveloping beasts vehicle and passengers through the nebulous curtain rising above the leaders the driver saw suddenly materialize the figures of two men halt stick em up the words snapped grimly from the taller of the two the messenger on the seat beside the driver made a single move to raise his sawedoff shot gun a sixgun barked and the messenger toppled forward falling upon the rump of the near wheelhorse the horse startled leaped forward into his collar the driver attempted to quiet him the two men moved up beside the stage one covering the driver and a passenger on top the other threatening the two inside the fat lady sat with her arms folded glaring at the bandit the little old gentlemans hands touched the top of the stage stick em up said the bandit to the fat lady she did not move sure an ill not stick em up an inch fer the loikes o yese she shrilled an lucky it is for ye ye dhirty spalpeen that mary donovan hasnt the bit ov a gun with heror that there aint a man along to protect a poor helpless widdy lady and she cast a withering glance of scorn in the direction of the little old gentleman who grew visibly red through the tan of his weatherworn countenance the other bandit stepped to the hub of the front wheel seized the messengers bag and stepped down again dont move or look back for five minutes he admonished them then pull yer freight the two then backed away up the road behind the stage keeping it covered with their guns the messenger lay in the road moaning the fat lady unfolded her arms opened the door and stepped out get back there you called one of the bandits go to the divil retorted mary donovan as she stooped beside the wounded messenger the man opened his eyes and looked about then he essayed to rise and with mary donovans help came to his feet jest a scratch me by she said in a motherly tone as she helped him to the stage yell be all right the mornin git a move on ye inside there ye ould woman with the artillery she yelled at the little old gentleman an give this by a hand in together they helped the wounded man to a seat the bandits were still in sight but they had not molested herdoubtless because she was a woman and unarmed but no more had she deposited the messenger upon the seat than she turned upon the old man and wrenched one of his guns from its holster drive like the divil bill she cried to the driver sticking her head out of the window and as he whipped up his team she turned back toward the two bandits and opened fire on them they returned the fire and the fusillade continued until the stage disappeared in a cloud of dust around a curve below the gap the old gentleman and the passenger on top now taking part in the shooting chapter iii suspicions as the stage swirled through the dusty street of hendersville an hour later and drew up before the donovan house the loiterers about the hotel and the saloons gathered about it for the news and the gossip from the outer world gum smith sheriff was among them stuck up again gum at the gap the driver called to him they bored mack mary donovan and the little old gentleman were assisting the messenger from the stage though he protested that he was all right and required no assistance as the womans eyes alighted upon the sheriff she turned upon him her arms akimbo sure yese a fine spicimin uv a sheriff gum smith that ye arenot she yelled in a voice that could be heard the length of the single street three holdups in the two months right under yer nose and all ye do is depatize an depatize an depatize why dont ye git out an git emye ould woman she concluded scornfully and then turned to the wounded man her voice instantly as soft as a lullaby get inside wid ye ye poor by an mary donovanll be after makin ye comfortable til we get hould uv the ould sawbones if hes sober which he aint or im no lady which i am come on now aisy like theres a good by and she put a motherly arm about the lad and helped him to the porch of the hotel just as diana henders appeared from the interior attracted by the sounds from without oh mrs donovan she exclaimed what has happened why its mack the black coyote again she guessed quickly shure an it was none other i seen him wid me own eyesthe black silk handkerchief about the neck uv him an another over his ugly face an his pardnersure now i couldnt be mishtaken wid the rollin walk uv himif it wasnt that dhirty greaser gregorio me names not mary donovan which it is together the two women helped the messenger into a bedroom where mary donovan despite the embarrassed protests of her patient undressed him and put him to bed while diana henders went to the kitchen for hot water and cloths mack had an ugly flesh wound in his side and this they had cleansed as best they could by the time the doctor arriveda drinkbroken old man who had drifted in from the east his knowledge and skill were of the first rank and hendersville boasted that it owned the best doctor in the territorywhen he was sober in gums placeliquors and cigarsthe male population was listening to the account of the holdup as expounded by the little old gentleman and the other passenger the latter being a stranger in the community it was he who had the floor at the moment i never laughed so much in my life he averred as when the old woman calls the old man here the ould woman with the artillery the little old gentleman was standing at the bar with a glass of whiskey in his hand apparently with a single movement so swift was he he dashed the glass and its contents in the face of the stranger whipped out both guns and commenced shooting a stream of lurid profanity accompanied his act yet through the flood of incoherent obscenity the nub of an idea occasionally appeared which was to the effect that no blankety blank tinhorn could git gay with wildcat bob almost instantly as if a magician had waved his wand the room that had been comfortably filled with men became deserted as far as human eye could discern except for the little old gentleman with the tobaccodewed whiskers the front door had accommodated some while heavy pieces of furniture and the bar accounted for the restall but the stranger with the illdirected sense of humor he had gone through the back window and taken the sash with him the shooting over the company reappeared grinning most of them knew wildcat bob it had been the strangers misfortune that he had not id orter a bored him the dinged polecat growled the little old gentleman filling a fresh glass but i guess i larnt him his lesson the idear of him aspeakin of mrs donovan disrespectfullike like thatcallin her the old woman why shes the finest lady ever drew breath an says she to me says she mister bob says she its such a relief to have a man like you along when theres danger says she but she cant stand bloodshed bein that timid and shrinkin and she begged me not to start shootin at the varmints otherwise than which i shore would of messed them up somethin awful interspersed with which were quite two oaths or obscenities to each word the shooting over and quiet restored gum smith made his belated appearance at sight of the little old gentleman he smiled affably doggone my hide if it aint bob he exclaimed crossing the room with extended hand have a drink on the house bob wildcat bob ignored the proffered hand i got the dust to cover my own drinks mister sheriff he replied an instid of loafin around here buyin drinks why aint youall out scoutin after that there black coyote hombre youre shore a hell of a sheriff you are gum smith dont git excited bob urged the sheriff flushing give a man time ah got to git me a posse aint ah thets jest what ah was allowin to do right now an ahll start by depatizin yo youll deputize mehell you will gum smith returned the old man with a snort of disgust i ben out with youall before when you thinks dangers north you heads south i had all the travelin i wants today the sheriff mumbled something beneath his breath and turned away some halfhour later he rode out of town with a posse consisting of half a dozen of his cronies and leisurely took his way toward the gap in mrs donovans sitting room mary donovan sat rocking comfortably and chatting with diana renders mack had been made as comfortable as circumstances permitted the doctor had assured them that he was in no danger and had gone his wayback to gums placeliquors and cigars and what are you doin in town this day diana inquired mrs donovan i rode in with hal colby hes foreman now replied the girl i wanted to buy a few things while hal rode on over to the west ranch we have some horses over there he ought to be back any minute now so colbys foreman whats become of bullquit he got drunk again and dad broke him im so sorry for him dont be after wastin your pity on the loikes ov him advised mary donovan theres not the wan ov thims fit to black your boots darlin i dont understand bull continued the girl ignoring the interruption sometimes i think hes all right and then again im afraid of him hes so quiet and reserved that i feel as though no one could ever know him and when a mans like that as hal says you cant help but think that maybe hes done something that makes him afraid to talk for fear hell give himself away so hal colby was after sayin that well maybe hes right an maybe hes wrong its not mary donovan thatll be sayin as dont know but this i do be after knowintheyre both ov thim in love with ye and hush mrs donovan the boys all think theyre in love with me but i hate to hear anyone else say it seriously its perfectly silly theyd be just as much in love with any other girl if she chanced to be the only girl on the ranch as i am and pretty nearly the only girl in the county too theres hal now i must be going goodbye mrs donovan goodbye darlin an be after comin over again soon its that lonesome here you never could imagine an what wid that ould scoundrel back in town again to say nothin ov gum smith what old scoundrel inquired the girl sure no one else but wildcat bob the spalpeen diana henders laughed hes a very persistent suitor isnt he mrs donovan sure hes a very pestiferous shooter thats what he isthe ould fool actin like a wild broth ov a by an him sivinty if hes a day he ought to be ashamed of himself im sayin but at that hes better than gum smithsay that mans so crooked ye could pull corks wid him the girl was still laughing as she emerged from the hotel and mounted her pony hal colby sat his horse a few yards away talking with half a dozen men at sight of diana henders he reined about and joined her the boys were just telling me about the latest holdup in hells bend he said as they cantered stirrup to stirrup out of town hows mack the doctor says hell be all right replied diana just a bad flesh wound i dont see why something isnt done to put a stop to these holdups gum smith doesnt seem to care whether he gets the black coyote or not oh gums doin the best he can colby assured her goodnaturedly youre too easy hal you never like to say anything against a man and of course that is right too but the lives and property of all of us are under gum smiths protection to a greater or less extent and if he was the right sort hed realize his responsibility and make a determined effort to run down this fellow he went out after him with a possethe boys just told me so what more can he do it was half an hour or more after the stage pulled in before gum started she retorted does he or anyone else imagine that those two scoundrels are going to wait around the gap until gum gets there and hell be back with his posse right after dark hell say he lost the trail and thatll be the end of it until next time the man made no reply and the two rode on in silence for a few minutes it was the girl who spoke again first i wonder she said who this black coyote really is everybody seems pretty sure it was the black coyote remarked colby how did they know the black silk handkerchief he uses for a mask and the other ode about his neck she explained it must be the same man everyone has noticed these handkerchiefs on one of the men in every holdup in hells bend pass during the last six months there is scarce any one that isnt positive that the second man is the mexican gregorio but no one seems to have recognized the principal i got my own opinion said colby what do you mean do you know who the black coyote really is i wouldnt want to say that i know exactly but i got my own opinion well she urged i wouldnt want to mention no namesuntil i was shore but after a pause id like to see his cayuse no one ever sees either his or his pardners they keep em hid out in the brush alongside the trail but i got a guess that if anyone ever seed the black coyotes pony wed all know for shore who the black coyote is she did not insist further when she saw that he was apparently shielding the name of some man whom they both knew and whom he suspicioned it was only right that he do this she thought and she admired him the more for it so they talked of other things as they jogged along the dusty road toward home the man riding a stiff ups width behind that he might feast his eyes upon the profile of his companion as they neared the ranch they saw the figure of a solitary horseman approaching from the north looks like blazes remarked the girl it is said the man i sent bull up to cottonwood this morning i dont see what hes doin comin in from the north the cottonwood trails almost clue west he might have come back along the foothill trail suggested diana he might but its farther an i never seed a puncher yet thatd ride any farther than you told him to bulls different she replied simply if you sent him out for any purpose hed accomplish it no matter how far he had to ride hes always been a good hand a moment later the exforeman joined them where the two trails met he accorded the girl the customary howdy miss of the times and nodded to colby his mount was streaked with sweat and dust it was evident that he had been ridden hard did you find them cows asked the foreman bull nodded in cottonwood no belters diana henders glanced at the foreman as much as to say i told you so then glancing back at bull she noticed a reddish brown stain on the side of his shirt and gave a little exclamation of concern oh bull she cried youve been hurtthats blood isnt it how did it happen oh that aint nothin miss just a little scratch and he closed up like a clam spurring ahead of them neither colby nor the girl spoke but both were thinking of the same thingsthat bull wore a black silk handkerchief about his neck and that mary donovan had fired back upon the black coyote and his confederate following the holdup in hells bend earlier in the afternoon mrs donovan her hands on her hips stood just inside the dining room door as her guests filed in for supper that evening and seated themselves at the long deal table covered with its clean red and white cloth she had a goodnatured word for each of them until her eyes alighted upon wildcat bob attempting to sneak in unnoticed behind the broad figure of jim weller soo she exclaimed scornfully ye ould foolyer drunk again taake off thim guns an give thim to me i havent had a drink mary expostulated the old man dont mary me ye ould reprobate an be after givin me thim guns quick meekly he unbuckled his belt and passed it over to her i was just bringin em in to you mamrs donovan he assured her yed better be now go an sit down ill feed you this night but dont you iver step foot into mary donovans dining room again in liquor i tell you i aint had a drink he insisted phaat the word reeked with disbelief only just a drop to settle the dust after we pulled in he qualified his original statement ye must uv been that dusty then she exclaimed scornfully i was dont talk back and did ye find yer horses jim weller she inquired of the big man behind whom wildcat bob had made his unimpressive entrance weller shook his head negatively his mouth being full of baked beans patches probably run em off suggested bill gatlin the stage driver what with renegades and holdups this country aint safe to live in no more remarked mrs donovan if some of these here wouldbe badmen would git out an shoot up the bandits and the injuns instid of shootin up saloons she stated meaningly casting a baneful look at wildcat bob hadnt orter be hard to find em least wise one of em stated weller when every sonofagun in the county knows who he is meanin inquired the stage driver gregorio in course said weller i seen him comin out o cottonwood not three hours before the stage was stuck up an he was headin towards hells bendhim an that bar y bull feller you mean them two was together asked gatlin well they warnt exactly together gregorio comes out fust an about five minutes later i meets bull acomin down the canyon but they couldnt have both been up there without tother knowin it i dont believe bull would be doin it said mary donovan you cant never tell nothin about them quiet fellers remarked gatlin sententiously there was a pounding of hoofs without the creaking of leather as men dismounted and a moment later the sheriff and some of his posse entered the dining room i suppose ye got em gum smith said mrs donovan with sarcasm or ye wouldnt be back this soon ah aint no cat mrs donovan said the sheriff on the defensive to see in the dark yese aint no sheriff nayther she shot back wildcat bob succeeded in calling attention to derisive laughter by pretending to hide it gum smith looked at his rival angrily immediately discovering that he was unarmed whats the matter with the old woman with the artilleryis she chokin he inquired sweetly wildcat bob went red to the verge of apoplexy seized a heavy cup halffilled with coffee and started to rise sit down wid ye roared the stentorian voice of mary donovan i started wildcat bob shut up an sit down the wildcat did both simultaneously its a shaame that it is that a respictable widdy lady should be redjuced to fadin the likes o yese fer a livin wailed mrs donovan sniffing as she dabbed at her eyes with the corner of her apron all alone and unproticted as i am sure an if poor tim was here hed wipe the ground wid the both ov yese wildcat bob very red and uncomfortable ate diligently his eyes glued to the plate well did mary donovan know how to handle this terror of an earlier day whose short temper and quick guns still held the respect and admiration of the roughest characters of the great empire of the southwest but whose heart could be dissolved by a single tear as for gum smith he was only too glad to be relieved of the embarrassment of the wildcats further attentions and he too gave himself willingly over to peace and supper for the balance of the meal however conversation languished at the bar y ranch the men sat smoking after the evening meal bull was silently puffing upon a cigarette hal colby always goodnatured and laughing told stories during the silences texas pete strove diligently to recall the halfforgotten verses of the bad hombre but over all there hovered an atmosphere of restraint no one could have put his finger upon the cause yet all sensed it things were not as they had been yesterday or for many days before perhaps there was a feeling that an older man should have been chosen to replace bull for colby was one of the newer hands without volition and unconsciously the men were taking sides some mostly the men who had worked longest for henders drew imperceptibly nearer bull texas pete was one of them the others laughed a little louder now at colbys stories by gollies exclaimed pete i remember some more of it i am the original bad un i am i eats em alive an i dont give a damn fer how fast they come er how many they beof all the bad hombres the wust one is me sang texas pete good night fellers im goin to turn in chapter iv i love you diana henders was troubled ever since the holdup several days before she had not been able to expunge from her thoughts a recollection of the sinister circumstances that pointed an accusing finger at bull there had always been a deepseated loyalty existing between the henders and their employees and this alone would have been sufficient to have brought the girl to arms in the defense of the reputation of any of her fathers boys in the case of bull there were added reasons why she could not bear to foster a suspicion of his guilt not only had he been a trusted foreman but there was something in the man himself or rather in his influence upon the imagination of the girl that made it almost impossible for her to believe that he had shot mack harber another employee and stolen the bullion from her fathers mine he had always been reticent and almost shy in her presence he had never presumed to even the slight familiarity of addressing her by her given namea customary procedure among the other men many of whom had seen her grow so gradually from a little girl to a young lady that they scarce yet discerned the change yet she knew that he liked to be with her though she was far from being sure that she cared for his company he was quiet to taciturnity and far from being the pleasant companion that she found in hal colby there was something however that she felt when in his company to a much greater degree than when she was with other menabsolute confidence in his integrity and his ability to protect her now she was sorry for him since his reduction from a post of responsibility and her loyalty aroused by the inward suspicions she had permitted herself to entertain to the end that she was moved by something akin to remorse to make some sort of overtures of friendship that he might know that the daughter of his employer still had confidence in him it was a quiet sunday morning the men were lazily occupying themselves with the overhauling of their outfits replacing worn latigo and stirrup leather lacings repairing hackamores and bridles polishing silver and guns cleaning boots with bacon grease and lampblack shaving or haircutting down past the bunkhouse toward the corrals came diana henders presently she would pause near the men and ask one of them to catch up a horse for her the lucky fellow whom she asked would ride with her it was a custom of long standing but she was earlier than usual this sunday morning and several of the men worked frantically to complete the jobs they were engaged upon before she should arrive within speaking distance two or three affected attitudes of careless idleness indicative of perfect readiness to meet any call upon their time or services texas pete was cutting the hair of another puncher he had reached a point where his victim was entirely shorn upon one side the other displaying a crop of thick brown hair four or five inches long when he looked up and saw diana approaching pete tossed the shears and comb into the lap of the victim youall dont need a haircut nohow he announced strolling away with what he believed to be a remarkable display of nonchalance along a line that would quite by accident of course intercept dianas course to the corrals the deserted and disfigured puncher wheeled upon him with a loud yell come back here you knockkneed bowlegged sonofa then his eyes too alighted upon diana his fountain of speech dried at the source his tanned face assumed a purple cast and in two jumps he had reached the seclusion of the bunkhouse hal colby walked deliberately forward to meet the girl a pleasant smile of greeting upon his handsome face as he raised his wide sombrero in salutation had he been on trial for his life at that moment the entire outfit would have voted unanimously to hang him on the spot but gosh how they envied him bull sat apparently unmoved with his back against a cottonwood tree running a wiping rag through the barrel of a revolver he did not even look up though he had seen diana henders from the moment that she left the house bull realized that after the affair in town that had caused his downfall there was no chance for him to ride with her again for many long dayspossibly forever going for a ride di asked colby confidently as the girl came abreast of the men why yes i was thinking of it she replied sweetly i was just going to ask bull if he wouldnt catch up captain for methe rest of you all seem so busy colby appeared abashed but not defeated i havent a thingto do he assured her but ive made you ride with me so much lately hal she insisted id rather ride with you than eat he whispered texas pete had made a feeble pretense of searching for something on the ground apparently given it up in despair and was passing them on his way back to the bunkhouse i dont think you oughter ride withwith him nohow continued colby the girl drew herself up slightly dont be nasty hal she said you know i hate to say that he assured her i set a heap of store by bull hes one of my best friends but after whats happenedyou cant blame me di i think your dad would say the same thing if he knew bull was halfway to the corrals ill have the bosses up in a jiffy miss he called back over his shoulder goodbye hal laughed the girl teasingly youll have plenty of time to lay out the work for tomorrowa foremans always busy you know and she walked away briskly after bull as colby turned back toward the men he saw broad grins adorning the faces of most of them texas pete just approaching the bunkhouse door halted removed his hat with a flourish bowing low goin to git your hair cut hal he inquired sweetly you know id rather cut your hair than eat a loud roar of laughter acknowledged this sally colby flushing crimson beat a hasty retreat toward the office which way asked bull when the two had mounted im going to town to see how mack is getting along replied the girl watching his face i seen wildcat bob yesterday he said he was getting along fine nothing but a flesh wound neither his voice nor his expression betrayed more than ordinary concern have you seen mack since he was shot she inquired aint had time colby keeps me pretty busy mack was a dinged fool fer gettin creased anyhow he observed when a fellers got the drop on you stick em up they aint nothin else to do mack orter known better than to make any funny gunplay with them two hombres coverin him it was mighty brave of him said diana hes no cowardand he was loyal to dad i dont see nothin brave about it he replied it was just plumb foolishness why he didnt have a chanct on earth thats what made his act so courageous she insisted then the feller what commits suicide must be a regular hero he rejoined smiling i never looked at it that way i reckon mack must have been aimin to commit suicide youre horrid bull i believe you havent any heart at all i shore have leastways i did have one until he hesitated looked at her in a peculiar way then let his eyes drop to his saddle horn oh shucks whats the use he exclaimed there was silence for a brief interval the spirit of coquetry that is strong in every normal girl prompted her to urge him on but a natural kindliness coupled with the knowledge that it would be unfair to him kept her silent it was the man who spoke again first i was sorry mack got hurt he said defensively but he was lucky he wasnt killed that black coyote feller must have been a friend of hisn the brute she exclaimed he ought to be strung up to the highest tree in the county yes he agreed and then with another of his rare smiles lets speak to gum smith about it when we get to town gum smith were it possible to snort gum smith she had accomplished it if an honest vote had been taken for the worst man for sheriff gum smith would have been elected unanimously why gums a good sheriff he teased fer tin horns and bandits she did not reply her thoughts were upon the man at her side nothing that he had said had exactly tended to weaken her faith in him yet it had not materially strengthened it either his apparent callous indifference to macks suffering might have been attributed with equal fairness to the bravado of the guilty desperado or to the conditions and the times in which they lived which placed shootings and sudden death in the category of the commonplace his suggestion that the black coyote must have been a friend of macks as an explanation of a flesh wound rather than a mortal one appeared a trifle sinister though it was amenable to other interpretations on the whole however diana henders was not wholly pleased with the result of her probing at the donovan house they found mack sufficiently recovered to be able to sit upon the veranda where there were gathered a number of mrs donovans other guests including wildcat bob and the sheriff mary donovan stood in the doorway one hand on a hip and the other the fist doubled emphasizing some forceful statement she was delivering as diana henders and bull appeared suddenly before them the argument which had been progressing merrily lapsed into an embarrassed silence it would have been evident to the most obtuse that one or the other of the newcomers had been the subject of the conversation and neither bull nor diana was obtuse the result being that they shared the embarrassment of the others the silence which really lasted but a brief moment was broken by mary donovans hearty greeting to diana followed by a cordial word to bull which was seconded by wildcat bob the others however spoke only to diana henders appearing not to be aware of the presence of her escort come now cried mary donovan into the house wid ye an have a bit o cake an a cup o tay but diana henders did not dismount no thank you mrs donovan she replied we just rode down to see how mack was getting along and to ask if there was anything we could do for him she turned her glance toward the wounded man im all right miss he replied twasnt nothin but a scratch ill be back at the mine in a couple o daysan guardin the bullion shipments too same as usual he looked straight at bull as he made this final statement well exclaimed diana hastily im glad youre so much better mack and if there isnt anything we can do for you well start back for the ranch she sensed the sullen attitude of most of the men there the scowls they cast at bull and she knew that it would require little to precipitate a direct accusation which would have been almost certain to have been followed by gunplay come bull she said and reined her pony about they had ridden well out of town when she looked casually into the mans face it bore a troubled expression and he must have guessed that she noted it i wonder what was eatin them fellers he remarked no one only wildcat bob even spoke to me an mack seemed goshalmighty sore about somethin well they aint none of em got their brand on me if i did shoot up gum smiths joint it aint no hair offen none of them the girl wondered if he really was ignorant of the suspicions directed against him or if he took this means to make her believe that the cause of the altered attitude toward him was his drunken gunplay in the sheriffs saloon i was right sorry about that miss he blurted suddenly i never aimed for to do it i wasnt goin to drink too much no more after what id promised you im right sorry do you think that maybe youyou might forgive meand give me another chance his voice was pleading and he was very much in earnest the girl knew how difficult it was for a rough man like bull to say what he had just said and she felt a sudden compassion for him it made me sorry too bull she said i trusted you and i hated to be so disappointed in you please dont say you dont trust me miss he begged i want you to trust me moren anything else i want to trust you bull and then impulsively i do trust you he reached across the interval between them and laid his rough hand upon her soft one i love you diana he said very simply and with a quiet dignity that was unmarred by any hesitancy or embarrassment she started to speak but he silenced her with a gesture dont say anything about it please he urged i dont expect you to love me but theres nothing wrong about my loving you i just wanted you to know it so that youd always know where i stood and that you could always call on me for anything with yer dad an all the other men around that loves you there isnt much likelihood that youll ever need me moren another but it makes me feel better to know that you know now we wont talk about it no more miss we both understand its the reason i didnt quit when yer dad busted me im glad you told me bull she said its the greatest honor that any man can bestow upon a girl i dont love any man bull that way but if ever i do hell know it without my telling him ill do something that will prove ita girl always does some times though the men are awfully blind they say i wouldnt be blind said bull id know it i think if a girl loved me the right one will some day she assured him he shook his head i hope so miss she flushed sensing the unintentional double entendre he had caught in her words she wondered why she flushed they rode on in silence she was sorry that bull loved her but she was glad that loving her he had told her of his love he was just a common cowhand unlettered rough and occasionally uncouth but of these things she did not think for she had known no other sort except her father and an occasional visitor from the east since childhood had she cared for him she would not have been ashamed she looked up at him with a smile dont call me miss bull pleasei hate it you want me to call you by your first name he inquired the other men do she said and you did a moment ago it slipped out that time he grinned sheepishly i like it all right miss he said the girl laughed aloud joyishly all right diana i mean lie corrected himself thats better so diana henders who was really a very sensible girl instead of merely playing with fire made a big one of a little one all very unintentionally for how was she to know that to bull the calling of her diana instead of miss was almost as provocative to his love as would have been the personal contact of a kiss to an ordinary man as they approached the ranch house at the end of their ride they saw a buckboard to which two bronchos were harnessed hitched to the tie rail beneath the cottonwoods outside the office door whose outfit is that asked diana i never saw it before the wainrights from the north side o the hills i seen em in town about a week ago oh yes ive heard of them theyre from the east mr wainright dont like the country north of the mountains hes lookin fer range on this side said bull like as not thats what lies here fer now they aint enough water fer no more outfits though nor enough feed neither they drew rein at the corral and dismounted thanks bull said the girl as she passed him her bridle reins weve had a lovely ride thanksdiana that was all he said but the way he spoke her name was different from the way any other man had ever spoken it she was sorry now that she had asked him to call her diana as she was passing the office to go to her room her father called to her come in di i want you to meet some new neighbors and when she had entered my daughter mr wainright diana extended her hand to a fat man with closeset eyes and then her father presented the younger wainright mr jefferson wainright jr diana he said the son was a wellgroomedappearing nicelooking young fellow of twentyone or twentytwo perhaps his costume was a trifle too exaggerated to be in good taste but he had only fallen into the same mistake that many another wealthy young easterner has done before and since upon his advent to the cowcountry from silverbanded sombrero to silverencrusted spurs there was no detail lacking by gollies he looks like a christmas tree had been texas petes observation the first time that he had seen him all they forgot was the candles you live north of the mountains inquired diana politely yep replied the elder wainright but we dont calclate to stay there were from masschusettsworcesterblanketsmade a fortune in emmade em for the goverment mostly jeff got it in his head he wanted to go into the cattle businesscome by it natchral i allow i used to be in the livery stable business before i bought the millsso when he graduated from harvard a year ago we come out heredont like it tother side the mountainsso i calclates to come over here i was just explaining to mr wainright that there is scarcely enough feed or water for another big outfit on this side interjected mr henders dont make any differenceset your pricebut set it right ill buy you out i cd buy half this territory i calclateif i had a mind tobut the prices got to be right ol jeff wainrights got a name for bein a pretty shrewd traderfairn honest thoughfairn honest just name your pricehow much for the whole shebangbuildins land cattleeverything elias henders laughed goodnaturedly im afraid theyre not for sale mr wainright tut tut ill get emyoull sellof jeff wainrights always got everything he went after well son i calclate wed better be goin youll have dinner with us first of course insisted diana it must be almost ready now well i dont mind if we do returned the elder wainright and so they stayed for the noonday meal diana found the younger wainright a pleasant affable companion he was the first educated man near her own age that she had ever met and his conversation and his ways so different from those of the rough vaqueros of her little world made a profound impression upon her he could talk interestingly from the standpoint of personal experience of countless things of which she had only secondhand knowledge acquired from books and newspapers those first two hours with him thrilled her with excitementthey opened a new world of wondrous realities that she had hitherto thought of more as unattainable dreams than things which she herself might some day experience if he had inherited something of his fathers egotism she forgot it in the contemplation of his finer qualities and in the pleasure she derived from association with one somewhere near her own social status in life that the elder wainright was impossible she had sensed from the first but the son seemed of different fiber and no matter what his antecedents he must have acquired something of permanent polish through his college associations the disquieting effect of the wainrights visit was apparent elsewhere than at the ranch house there was gloom at the bunkhouse doggone his hide exclaimed texas pete whose inquired shorty my of mans if he hadnt gone an got hung he mighta sent me to havaad what chanct has a feller got agin one o them papercollared crackerfed dudes anyway chapter v the roundup i had a letter from wainright in the mail today di said elias henders to his daughter about a week later he is after me again to put a price on the whole shebang we could go east and live then couldnt we asked the girl henders looked at her keenly there had been just the tiniest trace of wistfulness in her tone he crossed the room and put an arm about her youd like to go east and live he asked i love it here dad but there is so much there that we can never have here i should like to see how other people live i should tike to go to a big hotel and to the theaters and opera and meet educated people of my own age i should like to go to parties where no one got drunk and shot the lights out she concluded with a laugh we dont have to sell out to go back he told her i am afraid i have been selfish because i never wanted to back after your mamma left us i forgot that you had a right to the same advantages that she and i enjoyed the ranch seemed enoughthe ranch and you but thered be no one to manage things if you went away she insisted oh that could be arranged i thought you felt that we couldnt afford to go unless we sold it would be nice if you were relieved of all responsibility she said if you sold the ranch and the brand you wouldnt have to worry about how things were going here old wainright wouldnt pay what they are worth even if i was ready to sell he explained ill tell you what ill doill make him a price if he takes it ill sell out and anyway whether he does or not well go east to stay if you like it what price are you going to ask seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the ranch and the brand they might bring more if i wanted to make an effort to get more but that will show a fair profit for us and i know will be satisfactory to john he has asked me a dozen times in his letters why i didnt sell the cattle end of the business and come east yes i know uncle john has always wanted us to come back she said but old wainright really doesnt want the ranch and cattle at all said her father what he wants is the mine he has offered me a million dollars for all our holdings in the county including the mine he mentions the fact that the workings have pretty nearly petered out and hes right and he thinks ill grab at it to unload i suspect hes had a man up there for the past six monthsthe new bookkeeper that corson sent out while your uncle john manill was in europeand he thinks hes discovered something that i dont knowbut i do for years di weve been paralleling a much richer vein than the one weve been working ive known it for the past two years but john and i figured wed work out the old one firstweve all the money we need anyway the mine alone is worth ten or twenty millions uncle john knows it there wouldnt be any danger that someone might trick him into a deal not a chance and of course as you know he wouldnt do anything without consulting me ours is rather a peculiar partnership di but its a very safe one for both of us there isnt the scratch of a pen between us as far as any written agreement is concerned but he trusts me and i trust him why before either of us married the only precautions we took to safeguard our interests was to make our willsi left everything to him and he left everything to me after we married we made new wills that was all if i die first everything goes to him and when he dies it is all divided equally between our surviving heirs or just the other way around if he dies first each of us felt that we could thus best safeguard the interests of our respective families since we both had implicit confidence in the others honesty and integrity oh lets not talk about it exclaimed the girl neither one of you is ever going to die all right di laughed her father just as you sayyouve always had your own way now well plan that eastern trip cant very well go until after the spring roundup and in the meantime we can be sizing up colby if he takes hold all right we couldnt do better than to leave him in charge i never did like the idea of importing a new man as superintendent if you could possibly use one of your own men what do you think of him di i dont know yet dad she replied i like him immensely and i think hes honest and loyal but he dont know stock nor the range as well as bull bull is out of the question replied her father i could never trust him again i know how you feel i feel the same way and yet there is something about him dadi cant explain it but when i am with him i cannot doubt him hes got you hypnotized i hope he hasnt been making love to you he concluded seriously oh they all do she cried laughing but bull least of all i suppose youll have to be marrying one of these days and if you were going to live here id rather you married a western boy but if you are going east you mustnt fall in love yet for you are sure to find a great difference between the boys you have known and the boys back there dont worry dad i havent fallen in love yet but if i do soon im afraid its going to be either hal colby or jefferson wainright senior he asked oh isnt he funnyand impossible she cried hes all of that and more too replied her father what do you mean i mean that i wouldnt trust him as far as i could throw a bull by the tail hes one of those bluebellied yankees who considers any means as honest that keep him on the right side of a jail door but the boy appears to be a much more decent sort he is delightful and wonderful said diana the days passed lovely sunshiny days during which diana spent long hours dreaming of the coming eastern trip she rode much as usual sometimes with one man again with another but more often with her father or hal colby bulls assignments usually took him too far afield for her to accompany him if he thought that colby had some such purpose in mind when he laid out the work from day to day he said nothing of it but he could not have failed to notice that following each of the few occasions upon which diana accompanied him usually a sunday he was given work the next day that kept him in the saddle until late at night and upon several occasions away from the ranch for two days or more at last the time of the spring rodeo arrived riders from other outfits commenced straggling in some from a hundred miles away until the bar y ranch commenced to take on the appearance of an army camp the chuck wagon was overhauled and outfitted the cavvy was brought over from west ranchwild halfbroken horses with a sprinkling of colts that had never felt leatherand assigned to the riders there were enough to give each man a string of eight horses with the others came jefferson wainright jr arrayed like solomon at first the men had a lot of fun with him but when he took it goodnaturedly they let up a bit and after a few evenings during which he sang and told stories they accepted him almost as one of them he was much with diana henders with the result that he found himself with four unbroken bronchos in his string the bar y hands grinned when colby picked them for him and everyone was present when he first essayed to ride one of them diana was there too she chanced to be standing near bull when the first of the four having been roped thrown and hogtied was finally saddled bridled and let up it was a ewenecked walleyed romannosed pinto and its back was humped like a camels he shore looks mean remarked bull to the girl they ought not to let mr wainright ride him she replied hes not used to bad horses and he may be killed i reckon thats just about how hal figgered it said bull i didnt think it of him its a shame she exclaimed some one ought to top that horse for mr wainrightsome one who can ridelike you bull she added flatteringly you want me to he asked i dont want to see the poor man killed bull stepped forward and climbed into the corral wainright was standing several feet from the pinto watching several men who were trying to readjust the blind over the brutes eyes bull saw that the man was afraid want me to top him for you young feller he asked dont you think hes safe asked wainright oh yes hes safelike a kansas cyclone wainright grinned a sickly grin id appreciate it he said if youd try him first id be glad to pay you for your trouble bull approached the men with the horse lead him out he said when i rides one like that i wants elbow room they ran the pony bucking out of the corral bull stepped to the animals side what you doin demanded colby who had been standing too far away to overhear the conversation toppin this one for the dude replied bull no youre not snapped colby his voice was angry youll ride the hosses i tells you to and so will he im ridin this one replied bull he had grasped the cheek strap with his left hand his right was on the horn of the saddle carefully he placed his left foot in the stirrup then he nodded to a man standing at the horses head the blind was snatched away and the man leaped aide the horse reared wheeled and struck at bull but bull was not therehe was in the saddle the animal lunged forward awkwardly once then he gathered himself stuck his nose between his front feet and went to pitching scientifically and in earnest and as he pitched he lunged first to the right and then to the left twisting his body squealing and kicking bull waved his sombrero and slapped the beast on neck and rump with it and the pinto bucked the harder finding that these tactics failed to unseat the rider he commenced suddenly to turn end for end in air at each jump yet still the man stuck until the beast frantic with combined terror and rage stopped in his tracks and turned savagely to bite at bulls legs just a moment of this until he felt the sting of the quirt and then he reared quickly and threw himself over backward in an effort to crush his rider nor did he miss him by a matter of more than inches there are those who will tell you just how you should throw yourself safely to one side when a horse falls but any man who has had a horse fall with him or deliberately throw himself backward knows that it is five parts chance and the rest luck if he isnt caught and so it was just luck that bull fell clear diana henders felt a sudden lump in her throat and then she saw the horse scramble to his feet and the rider too just in time to throw a leg across the saddle and come up with a firm seat and both feet in the stirrups the quirt fell sharply first on one flank and then on the other the pinto took a dozen running jumps and then settled down to a smooth run across the open five minutes later he came loping back blowing and sweaty still trembling and frightened but with the hump out of his back you kin ride him now said bull to young wainright as he dismounted carefully and stood stroking the animals neck hal colby came forward angrily but bull had dismounted close to where diana henders stood and it was she who spoke to him first and colby approaching heard her words thank you ever so much bull she said i was sorry afterwards that i asked you to ride him for i thought you were going to be hurt when he threw himselfi should never have forgiven myself shucks said bull it wasnt nothin colby walked off in another direction if there had been bad blood between the two men in the past it had never been given outward expression but from that moment colby made little or no effort to hide the fact that he had no use for bull while the latter in many little ways showed his contempt for the foreman better friendships than had ever existed between these two have been shattered because of a woman but there were other exciting causes here that colby had gotten bulls job might have been enough to cause a break while the foremans evident suspicion that bull knew a great deal too much about the holdups in hells bend and the shooting of mack harber would have turned even more generous natures than hal colbys against the exforeman in spite of herself diana henders could not deny a feeling of chagrin that jefferson wainright had permitted another man to top a bad horse for him although it had been she who had arranged it perhaps she was a trifle cool to the young easterner that evening but she thawed gradually beneath the geniality of his affable ways and entertaining conversation and in the weeks that followed during which she accompanied the outfit throughout the roundup she was with him much of the time to the great discomfiture of hal colby and others the bar y foreman had however after the day that bull rode the pinto for wainright left the latter severely alone for the following morning elias renders had come to the corral and selected a new string of horses for the dude and spoken a few words into the ear of his foreman the long hard days in the saddle left them all ready to turn in to their blankets soon after supper a smoke a little gossip and rough banter and the men jingled away through the darkness in search of their bedrolls to the accompaniment of their tinkling spurs i seen injun signs today remarked a tall thin texan one evening bout a dozen of em been campin over yender a piece in them hills signs warnt over four hour old they mought be peaceable injuns on pass from the reservation suggested another more likely theyre renegades said shorty anyhow i aint atakin no chances on no injuns i shoots fust an axes for their pass later you aint never seed a hostyle injun shorty said texas pete a lot you know about it you sawedoff hammereddown squinteyed horse thief retorted shorty courteously im a bad man with injuns by gollies exclaimed pete thet reminds me of another verse so bring on yore bad men yore killers an sich an send out some greasers to dig me a ditch fer when i gits through ef i takes any pains youll need a big hole fer to plant the remains on the opposite side of the chuck wagon where a tent had been pitched for diana henders a little group surrounded her fire beside the girl there were her father hal colby and jefferson wainright jr the two young men always gravitated in dianas direction when off duty colby had been quick to realize the advantage that the others education gave him and bright enough to remain a silent observer of his manners and conversation inwardly he held the easterner in vast contempt yet he cultivated him and often rode with him that he might learn from him something of those refinements which he guessed constituted the basis of dianas evident liking for wainright he asked him many questions got him to talk about books and made mental note of various titles with the determination to procure and read the books that he had heard the man discuss with diana bull on his part kept away from the henders fire in the evening and in the day time colby saw to it that his assignments sent him far afield from where there was much likelihood of diana being with the result that he saw less of her than was usual at home the exforemans natural reserve had degenerated almost to sullenness he spoke seldom and never smiled but he rode hard and did his work well until he came to be acknowledged as the best allround man in the outfit there was no horse that he wouldnt ride no risk that he wouldnt take no work that he would ever refuse no matter how unfair the assignment with the result that the men respected him though there were none who seemed to like his company with the exception of texas pete well boys said elias henders rising i guess wed better be turning in tomorrows going to be a hard day the two younger men rose colby stretching and yawning i reckon youre right mr henders he agreed but waiting for wainright to make the first move to leave the latter paused to roll a cigarette an accomplishment that he had only recently brought to a state even approximating perfection he used both hands and was rather slow colby eyed him guessing that he was merely fighting for time in order to force the foreman to go first slowly the latter withdrew his own pouch of tobacco from his shirt pocket reckon ill roll a smoke by the light of your fire di before i do he remarked he creased the paper poured in a little tobacco and as he drew the pouch closed with his teeth and left hand deftly rolled the cigarette with his right bending it slightly in the center to keep it from opening up wainright realized that if he hada conversational advantage over colby there were other activities in which the foreman greatly outshone him rolling a smoke was one of them and that was doubtless why colby had chosen to roll one at a moment that odious comparison might be made wainright lighted his and shifted to the other foot would colby never leave colby permitted three matches to burn out before he finally succeeded in getting a light thus gaining a considerable advantage in time over wainright elias henders had repaired to his blankets just beyond dianas tent and out of sight the girl realized the game that the two men were playing and could scarce repress an inclination to laughter she wondered which would win or if she would have to call it a draw and send them both about their business wainright decided the matter come on colby he said throwing an arm about the others shoulders were keeping miss henders up good night miss henders and raising his hat he moved off taking colby with him they had taken about twenty steps when wainright halted and wheeled about oh i say miss henders he called theres something i wanted to ask you and he started back dont wait for me colby he threw over his shoulder ill be along in a moment colby glared at the others retreating back through the darkness hurled his cigarette to the ground and stamped away outgenerated ill get him yet he mumbled he may be pretty slick at them parlor tricks but they aint many parlors in arizona the damn dude wainright rejoined diana by the fire its too beautiful an evening to go to bed he said and i havent had half a chance to talk with you colby hangs around as though he had a mortgage on your time and was going to foreclose he sort of puts a damper on conversation unless it revolves about cowsthats all he can talk about its a subject that is always of interest to us out here replied the girl loyally cows are really our lives you know oh thats all right for men but there are other things in life for a girl like you miss henders you deserve something better than cowsand cowboys you love music and books and you cant deny that you like to talk about them you belong eastyou belong back in boston were going back not to boston but to new york after the roundupdad and i she told him no really how funny ive got to go back too maybe we could all go together that would be fine she agreed wouldnt you like to stay back there he asked almost excitedly and then quite unexpectedly he took her hand miss henders he exclaimed diana wouldnt you like to stay there always id make a home for you thereid make you happyi love you diana we could be married before we left wouldnt it be wonderful going back there together on our honeymoon and then to europe we could travel everywhere money would mean nothing i dont have to tell you how rich we are no she replied i have heard your father mention it and withdrew her hand from his he did not seem to notice the allusion to his fathers boastfulness tell me that you love me he insisted tell me that you will marry me but i dont know that i do love you she replied why i scarcely know you and you certainly dont know me well enough to know that you would want to live with me all the rest of your life oh yes i do he exclaimed if there was only some way to prove it words are so futilethey cannot express my love diana why i worship you there is no sacrifice that i would not willingly and gladly make for you or yours i would die for you dear girl and thank god for the chance but i dont want you to die for me i want you to go to bed and give me a chance to think i have never been in love possibly i love you and do not know it there is no need for haste anyway i will give you my answer before i go east now run along like a good boy but tell me darling that i may hope he begged you will do that anyway if you love me she told him laughingly as she turned and entered her tent good night chapter vi the renegades the next morning colby took wainright with him deep in the foremans heart was a determination to ride hard over the roughest country he could find and if the dude got killed it wouldnt be colbys faultnor would it be colbys fault if he didnt but the foremans plans were upset at the last moment by elias henders and diana who elected to accompany him you and wainright ride ahead hal directed henders and di and i will trail along behind the foreman nodded silently and put spurs to his pony and in silence wainright loped at his side the arrangement suited neither and each was busy concocting schemes whereby the other might be paired off with elias henders though under ordinary circumstances either would have been highly elated at the prospect of spending a whole day in company with the old man glorious morning ejaculated henders to his daughter god may have forgotten arizona in some respects but he certainly remembered to give her the most wonderful mornings in the world dont they fill one with the most exquisite sensations she exclaimed almost as intoxicating as wine he agreed and then by the way bulls been doing fine hasnt he i dont believe hes touched a drop since that night at gums hes working hard too said the girl he always did thathes the best cowhand i ever saw and a hog for work there isnt a man in seven counties that can commence to touch him when it comes to riding roping parting calling brands judging ages or weights or handling cattle with judgment under any conditions nor one that knows the range within a hundred miles like he does why the day before yesterday he had to give a fellow from the red butte country some pointers about the fellows own rangebull knew it better than he did hes wonderful said diana i love to see him in the saddle and anywhere in the cowcountry he fits into the picture im always proud that bull is one of our men oh i hope he dont ever drink again elias henders shook his head im afraid hell never quit he said a mans got to have something to quit for and bull has no incentive to stoponly just his job and when did a little thing like a job keep a man from drinking especially the best cowhand in the territory there isnt an outfit anywhere that wouldnt hire him drunk or sober he dont seem to be hanging around you much lately di and im glad of that id hate to see you interested in a man like bull i dont take much to garrulous people but neither do i want em as tightmouthed as bull im afraid hes got something to hide that makes him afraid to talk for fear hell let it out what do you suppose happened last night dad asked diana suddenly i dont know im surewhat he asked jefferson wainright proposed to me no what did you tell him what should i have told him that depends upon how much or little you think of him replied her father would you like him for a soninlaw if you choose him i shall like himi should like the devil if you chose to marry him well he isnt quite as bad as all that is he she cried laughing i didnt mean it that way he seems to be a nice boy he could give you everything and he could take you among the sort of people that you belong among and you wouldnt have to be ashamed of him but i dont like his father his father is something of an embarrassment she assented do you love the boy di he asked i dont know and i told him so he wants me to marry him before we go east and all go together what a lovely ideataking your fathers on a honeymoon you can count me out and anyway if some other man is going to take you east i wont have to go at all well i havent gone with him yet i told him id give him his answer before we left that would be a good ideaif he is goinghe might want a few minutes notice he bantered but how about hal i thought you leaned a little in that direction i do laughed the girl when im with one i like that one best and when im with the other i like him and when they are both with you at the same timepossibly you can find your answer there i have thought of that because then i always compare the twoand hal always suffers by the comparison that is when we are sitting talkingbut when they are in the saddle it is the other way around people cant spend their married lives in the saddle he reminded her she sighed i am terribly perplexed of only one thing am i sure and that is that i shall marry either hal colby or jefferson wainright or someone else he suggested no no one else she stated emphatically it was past noon and they had turned back gathering up the little bunches of cattle that they had driven down out of canyon and coulee onto the flat below elias henders and diana were riding quite apart from the foreman and wainright when henders turned back to ride to the summit of a low elevation for a final survey of the country for any straggling bunch that might have escaped their notice diana was a few yards in rear of him as he drew rein on top of the hillock it was very quiet the cattle were at a distance from them moving slowly off down the valley there was only the sound of her horses unshod hoofs in the soft dirt and the subdued noise of a wellworn saddle as she urged her mount toward the side of her father suddenly there was the crack of a rifle and elias henders horse dropped in its tracks henders fell clear and whipped out his revolver get out of here di he called to the girl its indians youve got time if you keep behind this butte and ride like hell she turned and looked toward the two men a quarter of a mile awaycolby and wainright she saw them wheel their horses and look toward the point from which the shot had come and from their position she guessed that they could see the indians though she could not then she saw hal colby put spurs and quirt to his mount until the wiry beast fairly flew over the ground toward her wainright hesitated looked toward the indians and then back down the valley in the direction of the camp fifteen miles away suddenly he wheeled his horse and dashed off to her mind flashed the impassioned words that he had poured into her ears only the night before i worship you there is no sacrifice that i would not willingly and gladly make for you or yours i would die for you dear girl and thank god for the chance her lip curled and her eyes shot a single scornful glance in the direction of the retreating figure of jefferson wainright before she turned them back toward colby how magnificent he was he had drawn one of his sixguns and was riding not for the hill but straight for the indians and just as he passed out of her sight behind the hillock he opened fire she could hear the crack of his gun mingling with those of the indians and then her father pausing in his fire turned to her again my god di havent you gone he cried hurry there is time yet hal has got em on the run now but theyll be back again there must be a dozen of them ride back to camp for help mr wainright has already gone dad she told him we have always been together all my life dad and it dont take two to get help we need all the guns here we can get until the boys come and she dismounted and crawled to his side despite his protests over the crest of the hill she could see colby galloping toward them while the indians a quarter of a mile beyond him were just circling back in pursuit in the foreground a dead indian lay sprawled in the open to the right a riderless pony was loping away to join its fellows diana lay a few feet from her father both in readiness to cover colbys retreat when the indians came within revolver range wish we had a couple of rifles remarked elias henders if i had a thirtythirty i could hold em off alone until the boys get here we ought to be able to hold out for an hour dad the boys should be here in that time well do the best we can but di he paused a little catch in his voicedont let them get you dear the boys might not get here in time wainright is not much of a riderhe wont make the time that one of our boys would theyd kill the horse but theyd get there and then there may not be anyone in camp but the cook that time of daythats what im really most afraid of well do the best we can likely as not well pull through but if we dont why remember what i said dont let em get yousave one shot you understand i understand dad colby his horse stretched to quirt and spur swung around to their side of the hill threw his horse to its haunches as he reined in close to them and leaped from the saddle without a word he dragged the blowing halfwinded animal directly in front of them raised his sixshooter to its forehead and shot it between the eyes diana henders voiced a little gasp of dismay and then she saw the man turn toward her own pony but she only covered her eyes with her palms and bit her lip to stifle a sob a moment later there was a shot and the sound of a falling body crawl behind that cayuse of mine di said colby he was tugging at the body of the girls pony to drag it closer to the others in order to form a rude triangle with the other two dead horses henders rose to his knees and gave colby a hand while di opened fire upon the approaching braves reckon we orter hold out here till the boys come remarked the foreman he was cool and selfpossessedjust as cool and selfpossessed as jefferson wainright would have been in a boston drawingroom even as she took careful aim at a halfnaked yelling buck and missed him diana henders mind was considering this fact she fired again and this time the buck ceased to yell grasped his stomach with both hands and toppled headlong to the ground hal colby might learn to be cool and selfpossessed in a boston drawingroom but could jefferson wainright ever learn to be cool and selfpossessed inside a yelling circle of painted savages thirsting for his lifes blood the indians were now riding a wide circle entirely about the hillock firing as they rode naturally their aim was execrable and the three were in danger only of a chance hit after the warrior fell to dianas bullet the circle widened to still greater proportions and a few minutes later the indians withdrew out of effective revolver range and gathered in a compact group where the three on the hillock could see them gesticulating and talking excitedly theyre up to some new devilment said renders i hope they dont charge from different directions before the boys git here remarked colby if they do we might as well kiss ourselves goodbye i wish you wasnt here di damn that whitelivered dudes hide ef he hadnt turned tail you could have gone you could ride rings about that slabsided maverick an besides youd have been safe look theyre separatin now yes theyre riding to surround us again said diana if they charge hal said henders wait until they get close and then stand up and let them have it di you lie as close to the ground as you can dont move just watch us acid when you see were both down youll know its all up and you must do what i told you to hal colby looked at the beautiful girl at his side and scowled for he guessed without being told what her father meant damn that dude he muttered mebby i hadnt orter shot all the hosses he said presently mebby di could have got away no henders assured him you did just right hal di wouldnt go i told her to but she wouldnt it was too late then anyway i figgered it was too late said colby but mebby it wasnt i wish i had thet damn dude here theyre coming cried diana from four sides the indians were racing toward them their savage cries breaking hideously the silence of the sunparched valley the three crouched waiting no word was spoken until the nearest of the redskins was no more than twentyfive yards away then now said henders leaping to his feet colby was up simultaneously firing as he rose diana henders far from lying close to the ground as she had been directed was on her feet almost as quickly as the men get down di commanded her father but her only reply was a shot that brought down a warriors pony twenty paces from them colby and henders had each shot an indian and there was another pony down in front of colby the renegades were close now and presented splendid targets for the three whites all of whom were excellent revolver shots at each report of their weapons a hit was scored now a pony screamed and wheeled away bearing its rider in headlong flight down the gentle declivity of the hillside another stumbled and crumpled to the ground sprawling its painted master in the dust a warrior wounded veered to one side and raced off to safety or again one slumped silently to earth never to charge again two of the unhorsed warriors sprang into close quarters clubbing their empty rifles one was leaping toward diana the other for colby at the same instant elias henders lifted both hands above his head his gun slipped from nerveless fingers and he lunged forward across the body of his dead horse colby put a shot through the stomach of the buck leaping upon him then turned toward diana he saw the painted face of a tall chief just beyond dianas he saw the rifle swinging to brain her as she pulled the trigger of her colt with the muzzle almost against the sweatstreaked body there was no answering report and then colby leaping between them seized the upraised rifle and tore it from the hand of the red man the two clinched the indian reaching for his knife while the white who had emptied both guns and had no time to reload strove to brain his antagonist with one of them struggling they fell diana henders reloading her own weapon looked hurriedly about the other warriors momentarily dispersed had rallied and were returning with wild triumphant yells for they saw that the battle was already theirs elias henders raised himself weakly on one elbow and looked about instantly his gaze took in the situation di he cried my little girl quick dont wait shoot yourself before they get you not yet she cried and turned toward the two men the red and the white battling at her feet stooping she held the muzzle of her weapon close to the rolling tossing men waiting an opportunity to put a bullet in the chief when she could do so without endangering colby from behind her the returning braves were approaching rapidly the racing hoofs of their ponies pounding a dull tattoo on the powdery earth they were almost upon her when colbys fingers found the chiefs throat and the latters head was pushed momentarily away from that of the white man it was the instant that diana had awaited she stepped in closer there was the sound of a shot and the renegade collapsed limply in colbys grasp simultaneously a wild yell arose from below them in the valley the remaining indians almost upon them were riding in a close mass from the opposite side what could it bemore indians colby had hurled the dead chief aside and was on his feet beside the girl they both looked in the direction of the new sound to see two horsemen racing madly toward them its bull its bull cried diana henders bull and texas pete the ponies of the oncoming men were racing neck and neck the riders were howling like demons the indians heard paused in their charge and wheeled to one sidethere were five of them left the reinforcements were too much for them and with a parting volley they galloped off but bull and texas pete were of no mind to let them go so easily for a mile or more they pursued them until they realized that their already almost spent horses could not outdistance the mounts of the indians then they turned and loped slowly back toward the three upon the hillock instantly the immediate necessity of defense had passed diana henders kneeled beside her father and lifted his head in her arms colby stepped to the opposite side of the prostrate man to help her suddenly she looked up into his yes an expression of horror in hers oh hal hal hes gone she cried and burying her face in her arms burst into tears the man unaccustomed to a womans tears or a sorrow such as this was at a loss for words yet almost mechanically his arms went about her and drew her close to him so that she stood with her face buried in the hollow of his shoulder as bull and texas pete rode up the hill and dismounted beside them they took in the pitiful scene at a glance but they saw more in it than the death of the old man whom they both lovedat least bull did in the attitude of diana and colby he read the death knell of whatever faint hope he might have entertained of ultimate happiness it was a hurt and bitter man that lifted the dead body of his employer in strong arms and laid it across the saddle of his horse you ride petes hors miss he said gently colby you walk ahead with her pete an ill come along with the old man they all did as he bid without question there was something about the man that demanded obedience even if he was no longer foreman it was always that way with bull wherever he was he was the leader even though men mistrusted or disliked him and many did they involuntarily obeyed him possibly because he was a strong man who thought quickly and accurately and was almost invariably right in his decisionit was certainly not because a large proportion of them loved him for they did not there was that something lacking in bullthat quality which attracted the love of his fellows after diana and colby had gone ahead bull and pete roped the body of elias henders securely to the saddle and presently the sorrowful little cortege took its slow way back toward camp chapter vii exit wainright a week or ten days after elias henders funeral the wainright buckboard drew into the bar y ranch yard and the wainrights senior and junior alighted and approached the house they found diana in the office working on the books which she had kept for her father when they were without a bookkeeper which was the case at present she greeted them politely but without marked cordiality it was the first time that she had encountered either of them since her fathers death having refused to see the younger man on her return to the camp with elias henders body we been calclatin to drive ever for several days past miss henders said the elder man thought mebby you might want some advice or suthin anything we can do were at both at your service thats very kind of you indeed im sure replied the girl but really i have so many good friends here that i couldnt think of inconveniencing you everyone has been so kind and considerate well they aint no harm in offerin he continued anything we can do you know if its a little matter of money to tide you over till the estates settled why just call on jefferson wainrighthes got a lot and he aint stingy either there is nothing thank you she said with just the faintest tinge of asperity he rose slowly from his chair and shoved his fat hands into his pockets i reckon ill walk around a bit he said i calclate that you young folks got suthin to say to one another and he winked ponderously at them as he waddled through the doorway there was a strained silence for several minutes after he left jefferson wainright jr finally after clearing his throat two or three times broke it the governor means all right he said wed really like to be of service to you and after thethe talk we had that last night beforebefore your father was killedyou knowwhy i hoped i might have the right to help you diana she drew herself up very straight and stiff i think we had better forget that mr wainright she said but you promised me an answer he insisted after what happened i should think you would know what the answer must be without being subjected to the humiliation of being told in words do you mean that you are blaming me too like the men did for going for help you would all have been killed if i hadnt i think i did just the sensible thing he concluded halfdefiantly yes i suppose so she replied icily and hal colby did a very silly thing staying and risking his life for dad and me i think youre mighty unfair diana he insisted and the way it turned out only goes to prove that i was right i met bull and that texas person less than halfway to camp and got them there in time if they had been as sensible as you they would have gone on to camp for more reinforcements as you did but like most of our boys out here mr wainright they havent much sense and so they nearly rode their horses down to get to usonly two of them remember after you had told them that we were surrounded by a hundred indians oh pshaw i think you might be reasonable and make some allowance for a fellow he begged ill admit i was a little excited and maybe i did do the wrong thing but its all new to me out here id never seen a wild indian before and i thought i was doing right to go for help cant you forgive me diana and give me another chance if youll marry me ill take you away from this godforsaken country back where there are no indians mr wainright i have no wish to offend you but you might as well know once for all that if you were the last man on earth i would never marry youi could not marry such a coward and you are a coward you would be just as much of a coward back east if danger threatened some of our boys are from the easthal colby was born in vermontand the day that you ran away was his first experience too with hostile indians and if you want another reason why i couldnt marry youthe first and biggest reasonill give it to you her voice was low and level like her fathers had been on the rare occasions that he had been moved by anger but the tone was keenedged and cutting i feel now and i shall always feel as long as i live that had you remained instead of running away we might have held them off and dad would not have been uselessly sacrificed she had risen while she spoke and he rose too standing silently for a moment after she had concluded then he turned and walked toward the door at the threshold he paused and turned toward her i hope you will never regret your decision he said the tone seemed to carry a threat i assure you that i shall never good day mr wainright after he had gone the girl shuddered and sank down into a chair she wished hal colby was there she wanted someone to comfort her and to give her that sense of safety under masculine protection that her fathers presence had always afforded why couldnt all men be like hal and bull when she thought of brave men she always thought of bull too how wonderful they had all been that dayhal and bull and pete rough uncouth they often were worn and soiled and careless their apparel afraid of nothing man beast or the devil risking their lives joyously joking with death and yet they had been as gentle as women when they took her back to camp and all during the long terrible journey home when one of the three had always been within call every minute of the days and nights of the three bull had surprised her most for previously he had always seemed the hardest and most calloused and possessing fewer of the finer sensibilities of sympathy and tenderness but of them all he had been the most thoughtful and considerate it had been he who had sent her ahead with colby that she might not see them lash her fathers body to the horse it had been he who had covered all that remained of elias henders with the slickers from his saddle and petes that she might not be shocked by the sight of her fathers body rocking from side to side with the swaying motion of the horse and it was bull who had ridden all night to faraway ranches and brought back two buckboards early the next morning to carry her dad and her more comfortably on the homeward journey he had spoken kindly to her in an altered softened voice and he had insisted that she eat and keep her strength when she had wanted to forget food but the funeral over she had seen nothing more of him for he had been sent back to the roundup to ride with it for the last few remaining days while hal colby remained at the ranch to help her to plan for the future and gather together the stray ends that are left flying when even the most methodical of masters releases his grip for the last time she sat musing after wainright left the room the clock upon the wall above her fathers desk ticking as it had for years just as though this terrible thing had not happened just as though her father were still sitting in his accustomed chair instead of lying out there in the sandy desolate little graveyard above hendersville where the rocks that protected the scattered sleepers from the coyotes offered sanctuary to the lizard and the rattlesnake her revery was disturbed by the fall of heavy feet upon the veranda and she raised her eyes just as the elder wainright entered the room he was not smiling now nor was his manner so suave as usual we got to be goin now miss henders he said brusquely but i wanted a mite of a word with you before we left o course you dont know nothin about it but afore your father died we was negotiatin a deal he wanted to get out from under now that the mines runnin out an i wanted to git a range on this side o the mountains wed jest about got it all fixed up when this accident happened now heres what i wanted to say to you of course the mines no account and the ranges bout all fed off and they aint scarce enough water fer the number o stock i was calclatin to put on but jefferson wainrights a man o his word an when i says to your father that id give him two hundred and fifty thousand dollars fer his holdins i wont back down now even if i dont think they be worth so much as that ill get all the papers ready sos ye wont have to go to no expense fer a lawyer and then ye can have the money an go back east to live like ye always wanted to an like yer paw was fixin fer ye the deeper he got into the subject the faster he talked and the more he relapsed into the vernacular of his earlier days finally he paused what do ye say he concluded the ranch is not for sale mr wainright she replied he opened his little eyes and his big mouth simultaneously in surprise whats thetnot for sale why you must be crazy child you dont know what youre talkin about i know exactly what i am talking about she told him father talked this all over with me and showed me your offer of a million dollars for our holdings the ranch is not for sale for a million dollars or any other price to you mr wainright and be careful that you do not stumble over that stool as you go out the mans fat face became suddenly empurpled with rage and for a moment he was inarticulate as backing toward the doorway he sought for words adequately to express his outraged feelings he was not humiliatedthere are certain types of men whose thick skin serves them as an invulnerable armor against humiliation he was just plain madmad all the way through to think that he had been caught at his trickery exposed and thwarted by a chit of a girl and like the type he represented naturally would be he was mad at her rather than at himself as he reached the doorway he found his voice youll be sorry for this youll besorry for this he cried shaking a fist at her and mark you ill get this property yet jefferson wainright can buy and sell you twenty times over and he always gets what he goes after the figure of a tall man loomed suddenly behind him calloused and ungentle fingers seized him roughly by the collar of his coat a low voice spoke softly in his ear dont you know bettern to shake your fist in a ladys face you potbellied buzzard it inquired and the elder wainright was jerked unceremoniously through the doorway whirled about and projected violently from the veranda his speed simultaneously accelerated by the toe of a highheeled cowboy boot i reckon youd better make yourself damned scarce around here continued the low tones of the speaker wainright scrambled to his feet and turned upon the owner of the voice he shook both fists now and fairly danced up and down in his fury ill get you he screamed ill get you dont you know who i amwhy i could buy and sell you a hundred thousand times overim jefferson wainright i am ill get youlayin your hands on meyou low down thirtyfivedollar cowpuncher vamoose said the man and do it pronto he emphasized his injunction with a shot the bullet kicking up a little spurt of dust between wainrights feet the fat man started on a run for his buckboard which the younger wainright had driven down to the corrals the man on the veranda fired again and again the dust rose about the fleeing feet of the terrified easterner diana henders had come to the doorway where she stood leaning against the frame smiling dont hurt him bull she said the man cast a quick smile over his shoulder i aint aaimin to hurt him he said im just aaimin to eddicate him them cornfed easterners aint got no eddication nohow what they need is someone to lam em manners as he spoke he kept on firing at the fleeing wainright and every shot kicked up a puff of dust close to the fat mans feet until he reached the corner of the bunkhouse and disappeared behind it the shots had called out the cook and the few men who were about with the result that a small yet highly appreciative audience witnessed wainrights discomfiture a part of it was texas pete who rocked to and fro in unholy glee by gollies did you see him he yelled he never hit nothin but the high spots ill bet he busted all the worlds records between the office and the bunkhouse why he done it in nothin flat an you could have played checkers on his coattails he shore stepped high wide an handsome on the veranda of the ranch house bull had shoved his gun back into its holster the smile had left his face i thought you were still out with the outfit bull said the girl we finished up last night he told her and i come in ahead he looked down at his feet in evident embarrassment i come in ahead for my time miss your time why bull youre not goin to quit i reckon i better he replied i been aimin to move on fer some spell the girls eyes were wide and almost noticeably moist and there was a surprised hurt look in them that he caught as he chanced to glance up at her you see miss he hastened to explain things aint been very pleasant for me here i aint complainin but there are those that dont like me an i figgered id quit before i was let out as long as your paw was alive it was different an i dont need to tell you that id be powerful proud to work for you always if there wasnt no one else but there is i reckon you got a good man an it will be pleasanter all around if i aint here no more at the mere thought of his going a lump rose in diana henders throat and she realized how much she had come to depend on him just the mere fact that she had known bull was around had given her a feeling of greater securityhe had become in the nature of a habit and it was going to be hard to break the habit oh bull she cried i cant let you go nowi cant spare both you and dad at the same time youre like a brother bull and i need a brother mighty badly right now you dont have to go do you you dont really want to no miss i dont have to an i dont want toif you want me to stay then you will stay he nodded but i reckon youd better tell colby he said for i expect hes aimin to give me my time oh no im sure hes not she cried hal likes you bull he told me you were one of his best friends and he was so sorry about your losing the job as foreman he said he hated to take it bull made no comment and whatever his thoughts his face did not betray them presently he jerked his head in the general direction of the corrals where the wainrights having hastily clambered into their buckboard were preparing to depart say the word he told her and ill run them short sports so far outta the country they wont never find their way back no she replied smiling let them go theyll never come back here im sure i reckon the old gent figgers he aint very popular round these diggins said bull with the faintest trace of a smile but i dont know so much about how thet young dude stands he looked questioningly at diana about deuce high bull she replied i saw enough of him to last me a couple of lifetimes the day the renegades jumped us i reckoned as much miss knowin you as i do scenery an the gift o gab aint everything but sometimes they fool wimmen folkseven the brightest of em he was awfully good company she admitted when they warnt no injuns around bull completed the sentence for her the old feller seemed all het up over somethin about the time i happened along i heered him say he was set on gettin this property is that what they come over fer yes he offered me a quarter of what hed offered dad for it and his offer to dad was only about twenty per cent of what its worth you see bull what they want is the mine they are just using the range and the cattle as an excuse to get hold of the mine because they think we dont know the real value of the diggings but dad did know theres another vein there that has never been tapped that is richer than the old one dad knew about it and somehow wainright learned of it too the old skunk muttered bull the wainrights were driving out of the ranch yard and heading toward hendersville the older man was still breathing hard and swearing to himself the younger was silent and glum they were going to town for dinner before starting on the long drive back to their ranch approaching them along the trail at a little distance ahead was a horseman young wainright recognized the rider first thats colby he said he hasnt any use for that fellow bull they are both stuck on the girl it might not be a bad plan to cultivate himif you want to get even with bull as they came nearer it appeared evident that colby was going by them with nothing more than a nod he did not like either of themespecially the younger but when they drew rein and the older man called to him he turned about and rode up to the side of the vehicle youre still foreman here aint ye asked wainright senior colby nodded why he inquired well i jest wanted to tell ye that some of your men aint got a very pleasant way of treatin neighbors hows that well i was jest aleavin after a social call when one of yer men starts shootin at me thet aint no way to treat friends an neighbors suppose we was to shoot up your men when they came over our way who was it demanded colby bull said the younger wainright i suppose he was drunk again though they say he always goes to shooting whenever he gets drunk when we left he was up at the house making love to miss henders he added i shouldnt think shed feel safe with a fellow like that around colby scowled thanks fer tellin me he said i reckon ill have to fix that feller hes gettin too damn fresh well i thought yed orter know said wainright senior well so long an if ye ever git over our way drop in giddap said jefferson wainright jr and the two rolled away through the deep dust of the parched road colby rode on at a brisk gallop and as he swung from his saddle cast a glance in the direction of the house where he saw bull just descending the steps from the veranda where diana henders stood colby bit his lip and the frown on his face became deeper dragging saddle and bridle from his pony he turned the animal into the corral with a final slap on the rumpa none too gentle slap which reflected the state of his feelingsthen he headed straight for the bunkhouse which he reached just in time to intercept bull at the entrance look here bull said colby without any preamble this business of drinkin an shootin things up has gone about far enough i aint agoin to have it around here no more i reckon youd better ask fer your time all right said bull you go an git it fer me while im packin my warbag colby rather surprised and at the same time relieved that bull took the matter so philosophically started for the office while the latter entered the bunkhouse where shorty texas pete and a couple of others who had overhead the conversation outside the door looked up questioningly by gollies exclaimed texas pete im agoin to quit im agoin after my time right now pronto and he arose and started for the doorway wait a minute old hoss advised bull i aint went yet but didnt colby jest let you out inquired pete he might change his mind explained bull up at the house colby was entering the office hello di he cried got your checkbook handy yes why bulls quittin quitting why he just promised me that hed stay on i dont understand he just promised you that hed stay on you mean you asked him to yes replied diana he came up here to quit said he thought he wasnt wanted any more and i made him promise he wouldnt leave i tell you hal we could never replace him are you sure he was in earnest about quitting send him up here and ill make him stay well like as not i was mistaken said colby i reckon bull was jest akiddin ill ask him again and if he is plumb set on leavin ill send him up when he entered the bunkhouse a few minutes later he nodded at bull you kin stay on if you want to he said ive changed my mind bull winked at texas pete who was vainly endeavoring to remember another verse of the seem ingly endless selfglorification of the bad hombre by gollies he exclaimed i believe i got another he twirls two big guns an he shoots out a light the fellows adrinkin there ducks out o sight he shoots through a bottle thet stands on the bar an shoots the of ashes plumb off my seegar but it seems like id left out somethin thet orter agone before nobodyd git sore if you left it all out shorty assured him the trouble with you uneddicated cowpunchers texas pete told him is thet you are too allfired ignorant to appreciate my efforts to elivate youall by means of good poetry it shore is hell to be the only litry gent in a bunch of roughnecks come set up the bottles you gol darned galoot says he to the boss fore i opens yore snoot with one o these yere little babies o mine an shoots out the no in the no credit sign chapter viii you dont dare the stage lurched down the steep and tortuous gradient of hells bend pass bumped through the rutty gap at the bottom and swung onto the left fork just beyond the right fork was the regular stage route to hendersville the left hand road led to town too but over bar y property and past the home ranch the driver never came this way unless he had passengers express or important messages for the ranch though the distance was no greater and the road usually in better repair today he had a telegram for diana henders there was a brief pause as he drew up his sweating team in the road before the ranch house yelled to attract the attention of a ranchhand working about the corrals tossed the envelope into the road and then with a crack of his long whip was off again at a run leaving billowing clouds of powdery dust in his wake the man working in the corrals walked leisurely into the road picked up the envelope and after scrutinizing the superscription and deciphering it laboriously carried the message to the office where diana henders was working over the books telegram for ye miss announced the man crossing the room to hand it to her she thanked him and laid the envelope on the desk beside her as she completed an interrupted footing the arrival of telegrams was no uncommon occurrence even on that faraway ranch and as they always pertained to business they caused diana no flurry of excitement buyers often wired while uncle john manill used the comparatively new telegraph facilities upon the slightest pretext the footing finally checked to her satisfaction diana picked up the envelope opened it and drew forth the message at first she glanced at it casually then she read it over again with knit brows as though unable fully to grasp the purport of its contents finally she sat staring at it with wide strained eyes until apparently crushed she lowered her head upon her arms and broke into sobs for this is what she had read miss diana henders bar y ranch hendersville via aldea arizona mr manill died suddenly last night miss manill and i leave for ranch soon as possible after funeral maurice b corson for a long time diana henders sat with her face buried in her arms gradually her sobs subsided as she gained control of herself stunning though the effect of this new blow was yet she grasped enough of what it meant to her to be almost crushed by it though she had not seen her uncle john manill since childhood he had nevertheless constituted a very real and potent force in her existence her mother had adored him her only brother and elias henders had never ceased to proclaim him as the finest type of honorable gentleman that nature might produce his eastern connections his reputation for integrity and his fine business acumen had all been potent factors in the success of the henders and manill partnership with the death of her father the girl had felt keenly only her personal lossfor uncle john manill loomed as a rock of gibraltar to protect her in all matters of business but now she was absolutely alone there was no one to whom she might turn for counsel or advice now that these two were gone hal colby she realized keenly was at best only a good cowmanin matters requiring executive ability or large financial experience he was untried of corson manills attorney she knew nothing but she was reasonably sure that even though he proved honest and possessed of an excellent understanding of matters pertaining to the eastern office he would not be competent to direct the affairs of ranch and mine at the sources of production that she might have carried on herself under the guidance of john manill she had never doubted since she could always have turned to him for advice in matters of moment where she was doubtful of her own judgment but without him she questioned her ability to direct the destinies of this great business with all its numerous ramifications suddenly she arose and replaced the books in the office safe dabbed at her teardimmed eyes with her handkerchief and putting on her sombrero walked fromthe office adjusting her wavy hair beneath the stiff band of her heavy hat straight toward the corrals she made her way she would saddle captain and ride out into the sunshine and the fresh air where of all other places she knew she might find surcease of sorrow and an opportunity to think out her problems more clearly as she entered the corral hal colby came running up from the bunkhouse he had seen her pass and followed her ridin di he asked she nodded affirmatively she was not sure that she wanted companynot even that of hal colbytoday when she desired to be alone with her grief you werent goin alone were you you know it aint safe di your dad wouldnt have let you an i certainly wont she made no reply she knew that he was right it was not safe for her to ride alone but today she felt that she did not care what happened to her fate had been cruelthere was little more that it could do to harm her in a way she half resented hals new air of proprietorship and yet there was something about it that carried a suggestion of relief from responsibility here there was at least someone who caredsomeone upon whose broad shoulders she might shift a portion of her burden and so she did not follow her first impulse to send him back together they rode from the corral turning down the road toward town and neither spoke for several minutes after the manner of people accustomed to being much together in the saddle the man as was usual with him when they rode watched her profile as a lover of art might gloat over a beautiful portrait and as he looked at her he realized the change that had come over her face and noted the reddened lids whats the matter di he asked presently you look like youd been cryin whats happened i just got a telegram from new york hal she replied uncle john is deadhe died night before last the stage just brought the message in from aldea shucks he said at a loss for the proper words and then thats shore too bad di it leaves me all alone now hal she continued and i dont know what im going to do you aint all alone di there aint anything i wouldnt do for you you know i love you di wont you marry me it would make it easier all around for you if we was married theres them thats always tryin to take advantage of a girl or a woman whats left alone but if you got a husband you got someone to look out for you an your rights i got a little money saved up i have plenty of money hal i know it i wish you didnt have none it makes me feel like you thought that was what i was after but it aint wont you di together we could run the ranch just like your dad was here i dont know hal i dont know what to do i think i love you but i dont know i dont even know that i know what love is youd learn to love me he told her and you wouldnt have to worry no more id look after everything say yes wont you the temptation was greatgreater even than the man himself realizedto have a place to lay her tired head to have a strong man to carry the burden and the responsibilities for her to have the arm of love about her as it had been all her life until her father had been taken away she looked up at him with a faint smile i wont say yesyet she said wait a while halwait until after mr corson and my cousin come and we see how things are going to turn out and thenthen i think that i shall say yes he leaned toward her impulsively and put an arm about her drawing her toward him with the evident intention of kissing her but she pushed him away not yet hal she told him wait until i have said yes a week later a group of boarders were lounging on the veranda of the donovan house in hendersville it was almost supper time of a stage day and the stage had not yet arrived mack harber whose wound had given more trouble than the doctor had expected was still there convalescing and mary donovan was as usual standing in the doorway joining in the gossip and the banter bill aint niver late less somethins wrong said mrs donovan like as not hes been held up again suggested mack id like to be sheriff o this yere county fer bout a week stated wildcat bob sure an phawt would ye be after doin inquired mary donovan acidly wildcat bob subsided mumbling in his stained beard for the moment he had forgotten that mrs donovan was among those present here they come announced mack with the clank of chain the creaking of springs and the rapid pounding of galloping hoofs the stage swung into the single street of hendersville in a cloud of dust and with a final shrieking of protesting brakes pulled up before the donovan house wheres gum smith demanded bill gatlin from the drivers seat dunno held up agin asked one of the loungers yes snapped gatlin mack harber had risen from his chair and advanced to the edge of the veranda the black coyote he asked gatlin nodded wheres thet damn sheriff he demanded again he aint here an he wouldnt be no good if he was replied wildcat bob we dont need no sheriff fer what we oughter do announced mack harber angrily hows thet asked wildcat you dont need no sheriff fer a necktie party said mack grimly no but you gotta get yer man fust thets plumb easy how come inquired wildcat we all know who the black coyote is stated mack all we gotta do is get a rope an go get him meanin get who insisted the little old man why gosh all hemlock you know as well as i do thet its bull replied mack i dunno nothin o the kind young feller said wildcat bob ner neither do you ef ye got proof of what ye say im with ye ef ye aint got proof im agin ye dont bull always

when it comes to stringin up gregorio or any other greaser im with ye go out an git him mack an ill help ye string him up a general grin ran around the table for of all the known badmen in the country the mexican gregorio was by far the worst to have gone out looking for him and to have found him would have been equivalent to suicide for most men and though there were many men in the county who would not have hesitated had necessity demanded the fact remained that his hiding place was unknown and that that fact alone would have rendered an attempt to get him a failure thars only one way to git them sonny continued wildcat bob an thet is to put a man on the stage with the bullion stid o a kid mack flushed you was there when they got me he fired back you was there with two big sixguns an what did you doeh what did you do i wasnt hired to guard no bullion an i wasnt sittin on the box with no sawedoff shotgun crost my knees neither i was aridin inside with a lady what could i adone he looked around at the others at the table for vindication ye couldnt done nothin ye said mary donovan widout a quart o barbedwire inside ye an some poor innocent tenderfoot to shoot the heels offen him wildcat bob fidgeted uneasily and applied himself to his supper pouring his tea into his saucer blowing noisily upon it to cool it and then sucking it through his whiskers with an accompanying sound not unlike snoring but later he was both mollified and surprised by a second generous helping of dessert when word of the latest holdup reached the bar y ranch it caused the usual flurry of profanity and speculation it was brought by a belated puncher who had ridden in from the west ranch by way of hendersville the men were gathered at the evening meal and of a sudden a silence fell upon them as they realized apparently simultaneously and for the first time that there was a single absentee the meal progressed in almost utter silence then until they had reached the pudding when bull walked in dark and taciturn and with the brief nod that was his usual greeting to his fellows the meal continued in silence for a few minutes until the men who had finished began pushing back their plates preparatory to rising i reckon you know the stage was held up again bull an the bullion stolen remarked hal colby selecting a toothpick from the glassful on the table how should i know it asked bull aint i ben up sinkhole canyon all day i aint seen no one since i left the ranch this morning well it was said colby the same two slick gents done it too did they git much asked bull it was a big shipment said colby it always is they dont never touch nothin else an they seem to know when were shippin moren ordinary looks suspicious did you just discover that inquired bull no i discovered it a long time ago an it may help me to find out whos doin it well i wish you luck and bull resumed his meal colby having finished rose from the table and made his way to the house in the cozy sitting room he found diana at the piano her fingers moving dreamily over the ivory keys some more bad news di he announced she turned wearily toward him what now the black coyote againhe got the bullion shipment was anyone hurt no he assured her i am glad of that the gold is nothingi would rather lose it all than have one of the boys killed i have told them all just as dad did to take no chances if they could get him without danger to themselves i should be glad but i could not bear to have one of our boys hurt for all the gold in the mine i think the black coyote knows that he said and thats what makes him so allfired nervy hes one of our own men dicant you see it he knows when the shipments are big an dont never touch a little one an he knows your dads orders about not takin no chances ive hated to think it but there aint no other two ways about itits one o our menan i wouldnt have to walk around the world to put my finger on him neither i dont believe it she cried i dont believe that one of my men would do it you dont want to believe it thats all you know just as well as i do whos doin it down in the bottom of your heart i dont like to believe it no moren you do di but i aint blind an i hate to see you bein made a fool of an robbed into the bargain i dont believe youd believe it though if i caught him in the act i think i know whom you suspect hal she replied but i am sure you are wrong will you give me a chance to prove it how send him up to the mine to guard the bullion until mack gits well an then keep mack off the job fer a month he explained ill bet my shirt thet either there aint no holdups fer a month or else theys only one man pulls em off instead o two will you do it it isnt fair i dont even suspect him everybody else does an thet makes it fair fer it gives him a chance to prove it if he aint guilty it wouldnt prove anything except that there were no holdups while he was on duty it would prove something to my mind if they started up again pretty soon after he was taken off the job he retorted wellit might but i dont think id ever believe it of him unless i saw him with my own eyes pshaw the trouble with you is youre soft on himyou dont care if your gold is stole if he gits it she drew herself to her full height i do not care to discuss the matter further she said good night he grabbed his hat viciously from the piano and stamped toward the doorway there he turned about and confronted her again for a parting shot before he strode out into the night you dont dare try it he flung at her you dont dare after he had gone she sat biting her lip half in anger and half in mortification but after the brief tempest of emotion had subsided she commenced to question her own motives impartially was she afraid was it true that she did not dare and long after she had gone to bed and sleep would not come she continued thus to catechize herself as hal colby burst into the bunkhouse and slammed the door behind him the sudden draft thus created nearly extinguished the single lamp that burned upon an improvised table at which four men sat at poker bull and shorty texas pete and one called idaho sat in the game i raise you ten dollars remarked idaho softly as the lamp resumed functioning after emitting a thin protesting spiral of black soot i see that an raise you my pile said bull shoving several small stacks of silver toward the center of the table how much you got there inquired idaho the others having dropped out bull counted theres your ten he said an heres ten fifteen twentyfive he continued counting in a monotone ninetysix he announced i raise you ninetysix dollars idaho i aint got ninetysix dollars said idaho i only got eight you got a saddle aint you inquired bull sweetly an a shirt suggested texas pete my saddles worth three hundred an fifty dollars if its worth a cent proclaimed idaho no one aint never said it was worth a cent shorty reminded him ill cover it an call you announced bull i dont want your shirt idaho its full o holes what are you coverin it with asked idaho i dont see nothin bull rose from the table wait a second he said and stepped to his blankets where he rummaged for a moment in his warbag when he returned to the table he tossed a small buckskin bag among his silver theys five hundred dollars worth of dust in that he said if you win we kin weigh out whats comin to you over at the office tomorrow mornin hal colby looked onan interested spectator the others fell silent texas pete knit his brows in perplexity lets see it demanded idaho bull picked up the bag opened it and poured a stream of yellow particles into his palm satisfied he inquired idaho nodded what you got demanded bull idaho laid four kings on the table smiling broadly four aces said bull and raked in the pot why didnt you raise him demanded shorty i just told you i didnt want his shirt said bull an i dont want your saddle neither kid ill keep the moneyit aint good fer kids like you to have too much moneybut you keep the saddle im goin to turn in said shorty pushing back and rising youd all better turn in an give someone else a chance to sleep said the foreman what with your damn game an petes singin a feller aint got no more chance to sleep around here than a jackrabbit why dont you fellers crawl in crawl in crawl in exclaimed texas pete crawl in crawl out by gollies i got another verse the boss he crawls out then all shaky an white from under the bar where hes ben sittin tight now set out the pizen right pronto you coot the stranger remarks or i shore starts to shoot i only ben practicin so far says he a barkeep er two dont mean nothin to me most allus i has one fer breakfast each day i dont mean no harmits jest only my way chapter ix lillianmanill you sent fer me miss asked bull as he stepped into the office the following morning his hat in his hand his chaps loosebuckled about his trim hips his two big sixguns a trifle forward against the need for quick action the black silk handkerchief falling over the blue shirt that stretched to his deep chest and his thick black hair pushed back inan unconscious half pompadour from silvermounted spurs to heavy hat band he was typical of the west of his day there was no item of his clothing or equipment the possession of which was not prompted by utilitarian considerations there was ornamentation but it was obviously secondary to the strict needs of his calling nothing that he wore was shabby yet it all showed use to an extent that made each article seem a part of the man as though he had been molded into them nothing protruded with stiff awkwardnesseven the heavy guns appeared to fit into accustomed hollows and became a part of the man the girl swinging about in her chair to face him felt a suggestion of stricture in her throat and she felt mean and small and contemptible as she looked into the eyes of the man she knew loved her and contemplated the thing she was about to do yet she did not hesitate now that she had after a night of sleepless deliberation committed herself to it yes i sent for you bull she replied the stage was held up again yesterday as you know mack wont be fit for work again for a long time and ive got to have someone to guard the bullion shipmentsthe fellow who came down with it yesterday has quit he said he was too young to commit suicide yesm said bull i dont want you to take any chances bulli would rather lose the gold than haveyou hurt i wont get hurt miss you dont mind doing it she asked o course im a puncher he said but i dont mind doin itnot fer you i told you once thet id do anything fer you miss an i wasnt jest talkin through my hat you dont do everything i ask you to bull she said smiling what dont i do he demanded you still call me miss and i hate it youre more like a brother bull and miss sounds so formal it must have been a woman who first discovered the art of making fire a shadow of pain crossed his dark countenance dont ask too much of me miss he said quietly as he turned on his heel and started for the doorway i go up to the mine today i suppose he threw back over his shoulder yes today she said and he was gone for a long time diana henders was troubled the assignment she had given bull troubled her for it was a tacit admission that she gave credence to colbys suspicions the pain that she had seen reflected in bulls face troubled her as did his parting words and the quiet refusal to call her diana she wondered if these had been prompted by a feeling of pique that his love was not returned or compunction because of a guilty knowledge that he had betrayed her and her father hal colby had told her that morning of the bag of gold dust bull had displayed in the poker game the night before and that troubled her too for it seemed to bear out more than anything else the suspicions that were forming around himsuspicions that she could see in the light of bits of circumstantial evidence were far from groundless i wont believe it she said half aloud i wont believe it and then she went for a ride all the men had left but hal colby and texas pete when she reached the corrals but she did not feel like riding with hal colby that morning and so she rode with texas pete much to that young mans surprise and rapture the days dragged along and became weeks the stage made its two trips a week the bullion shipments came through regularly and safely and there were no holdups and then one day maurice b corson and lillian manill arrived the stage took the bar y road that day and pulled up before the gate of the ranch house just as diana henders and hal colby were returning from a trip to the west ranch diana saw lillian manill for the first time in her life the eastern girl was seated between bill gatlin the driver and bull all three were laughing evidently they had been enjoying one anothers company diana could not but notice it because it was rarely that bull laughed it was bull who stepped to the wheel and helped her to alight maurice b corson emerged from the inside of the coach through the windows of which diana could see three other passengers two of whom she recognized as the wainrights and then she dismounted and ran forward to greet her cousin a handsome darkhaired girl of about her own age bull still smiling raised his hat to diana she nodded to him briefly for some reason she was vexed with him but why she did not know bull and colby ran to the boot and dragged off the corsonmanill baggage while lillian presented corson to diana corson was a young mana typical new yorkerin his early thirties git a move on there bull shouted gatlin or theyll think i ben held up agin i reckon the black coyotes gone out o business fer a while said colby shooting a quick look at diana instantly the girls loyalty was in arms hes afraid to try it while bulls guarding the gold she said how much longer you goin to keep me on the job asked bull as he clambered to the seat of the already moving coach mack looks pretty allfired healthy to me just another week or two bull diana shouted after him as the stage careened away at full gallop isnt he wonderful exclaimed miss manill a real cowboy and the first one i ever talked to oh there are lots of them here saiddiana just as nice as bull so i see replied lillian manill smiling frankly at hal colby but bull as you call him is the only one ive met pardon me exclaimed diana this is mr colby miss manill oh youre the foremanmr bull told mehow exciting ill bet he didnt tell you nothin good about me said colby he told me about your heroic defense of diana and my poor uncle explained lillian colby flushed if it hadnt ben fer bull wed all a ben killed he said ashamed why he didnt tell me that exclaimed the girl he never said he was in the battle at all that is just like bull said diana they were walking toward the house diana and colby leading their ponies and the two easterners looking interestedly at the various buildings and corrals over which hung the glamour of that irresistible romance which the west and a cattleranch always hold for the uninitiatedand for the initiated too if the truth were but known it is just too wonderful mr colby lillian confided to the big foreman walking at her side but doesnt it get awful lonesome we dont notice it he replied you know we keep pretty busy all day with a big outfit like this and when night comes around were ready to turn inwe dont have no time to git lonesome is this a very big outfit as you call it she asked i reckon they aint none much bigger in the territory he replied and to think that you are foreman of it what a wonderful man you must be oh it aint nothin he assured her but he was vastly pleased here indeed was a young lady of discernment you big men of the great outdoors are always so modest she told him a statement for which he could find no reply as a matter of fact though he had never thought of it before he realized the justice of her assertion and fully agreed with her she was looking now at the trim figure of her cousin walking ahead of them with corson how becoming that costume is to diana she remarked and i suppose she rides wonderfully she shore doesan then some he assured her oh how i wish i could ride do you suppose i could learn easy miss it aint nothin oncet you know how do you suppose someone would teach me she looked up at him archly id be mighty proud to larn you miss oh would you how wonderful can we start right away tomorrow you bet we can but you cant ride in them things he added looking ruefully at her new york traveling costume she laughed gaily oh my i didnt expect to she cried i am not such a silly as that i brought my habit with me of course well i suppose its all right he said politely but you dont have to bring no habits to arizony from nowhereswe mostly have enough right here such as they begood an bad again her laugh rang out you big funny man she cried you are poking fun at me just because you think i am a tendershoetrying to make me believe that you dont know what a riding habit is arent you ashamed of yourselfteasing poor little me they were passing the bunkhouse at the time where the boys having scrubbed for supper were squatting about on their heels watching the newcomers with frank curiosity after they had passed shorty gave texas pete a shove that sent him sprawling on the ground say he said did you see them pants i shore did replied pete but you dont have no call to knock me down an git my ridin habit all dusty you goshdinged tendershoe jest because a guy blows in with funny pants on did you see the mug on colby inquired idaho he dont know a ridin habit from the cigarette habit i reckon he thought she was confessin a sin said texas pete oh them pants them pants moaned shorty rocking to and fro on his heels his long arms wound around his knees shorty was sixfeetthree and thought kansas city was on the atlantic seaboard corsons keen quick eyes were taking in the salient features of their immediate surroundings as he walked at dianas side toward the twostory adobe ranch house on two sides of which a broad covered veranda had been built within recent years he saw the orderly wellkept appearance not only of the main buildings but of the corrals fences and outbuildings as well everything bespoke system and excellent management it was evidently a wellordered plant in smooth running condition he thought of it in terms of eastern factories and found it good you keep things up well here he said to diana henders i want to compliment you thank you she replied it was something that dad always insisted upon and of course i have carried out all his policies since his death what are these buildingsthey look like cement but of course you wouldnt have that out here the freight on it would make the cost prohibitive they are adobe she explained just big clay bricks dried in the sun he nodded in understanding nothing much very fancy about the architecture he commented laughing the only attempt at ornamentation is that sort of parapet on the roof of the house with the loopholes in it and that doesnt add much to the looks of the place diana thought that his criticisms were in rather poor taste and there was something about them that vaguely suggested the air of a man viewing for the first time a property that he had only recently acquiredsomething proprietorial that she inwardly resented outwardly she was polite you would think that it added a lot to the place she told him if you should ever chance to be here when the apaches stage a raidit was never intended to be ornamental he sucked in his breath with a whistling sound you dont mean he exclaimed that they are so bad you have to live in a fortress they havent been on the warpath in any considerable numbers for a long time she assured him but that parapet has been used more than once since the house was built and there is always the chance that it may come in handy again it may not be beautiful from this side but i can tell you that it looks mighty good from the other side when there are sneaking apaches skulking behind every outhouse i know because ive viewed it under those conditions you think there is any great danger he asked her looking about nervously there is always danger she replied for she saw that he was afraid and a spirit of mischief prompted her to avenge his indelicate criticisms of the home she loved it is only a matter of weeks you know she reminded him since dad was killed by apaches corson appeared worried and his further scrutiny of the house as they approached it was influenced by other than artistic architectural considerations i see you have heavy shutters at all the windows he said i suppose you have them closed and fastened every night oh my no she cried laughing we never close them except for dust storms and indians but suppose they come unexpectedly then we stand a chance of getting dust or indians in the house i think you had better have them closed nights while miss manill is here he said im afraid she will be very nervous oh your rooms are on the second floor she replied and you can lock them all up tightpossibly youll get enough air from the patio the nights are always cool you know but id feel stuffy with all the shutters closed well see was all he said but there was something about the way he said it that she did not like in fact diana henders was sure that she was not going to like mr maurice b corson at all as they sat down to supper an hour later lillian manill looked inquiringly at her cousin where is mr colby she asked over at the cookhouse eating his supper i suppose replied diana dont he eat with us he seems such a nice fellow he is a nice fellow replied diana but the boys would rather eat by themselves women folks would take away their appetites you have no idea how we terrify some of them but mr colby seemed very much at ease insisted lillian hal is different but the very fact that he is foreman makes it necessary for him to eat with the other menit is customary mr bull seemed at ease too after i got him started continued lillian he isnt much of a talker but he didnt seem a bit afraid of me bull is not afraid of anything diana assured her but if you got him to talk at all you must exercise a wonderful power over men i can scarcely ever get a dozen words out of him well i guess ive got a way with men said lillian complacently im afraid that you will find that bull is not very susceptible said diana with just the vaguest hint of tartness oh i dont know replied the other he has promised to teach me to ride and shoot diana ate in silence for several minutes she was wondering already if she were going to like her cousin but then of course she washow silly of her to think she was not she concluded i met an old friend on the stage today remarked corson presently diana raised her eyebrows politely how nice she said yes it was havent seen him for a couple of years nice chap jefferson wainright fraternity brother of course i was years ahead of him but i used to see him when id go down to cambridge for the games his governors a nice old chap too and got a wad of the long green so he has told us said diana oh you know them they didnt mention it i have met them mr wainright tried to buy the ranch oh yes i believe he did mention something of the kind why didnt you sell it to him his offer was too low for one reason and the other is that i do not care to sell my interest corson and miss manill exchanged a quick glance that escaped diana how much did he offer you asked corson two hundred and fifty thousand dollars why that seems a very fair price said corson it is ridiculous mr corson replied diana and if you are at all familiar with mr manills business you know it as well as i i am very familiar with it replied the new yorker in fact from your remarks i imagine that i am much more familiar with it than you then you know that the cattle interests alone are worth three times that amount without considering the mine at all corson shook his head im afraid that way out here you are too far from the financial center of the country to have a very comprehensive grasp of values now as a matter of fact the bottom has dropped out of the livestock market well be lucky if we make expenses for the next year or so and it probably never will come back to what it was and as for the mine that of course is about done it wont pay to work it a year from now if we could get two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this business wed be mighty lucky but i doubt if old wainright would renew that offerhes too shrewd a business man diana henders made no reply she was wondering just how much maurice b corson did know about the livestock market and the mine she was inclined to believe that he knew a great deal more than his remarks concerning them would indicate at the same hour mary donovans boarders were gathered about her table she had other guests this evening in addition to her regular clientele there were the wainrights and bull was there for supper and breakfast as was usual when the bullion came down from the mine it was not a gay company mack harber and jim welter looked with suspicion on bull an attitude that would have blossomed into open and active hostility could they have gained the support of gum smith but gum was not searching for trouble he glowered at his plate and hated bull wildcat bob inhaled soup and hated gum smith the wainrights scarcely raised their eyes from the business of eating for fear of the embarrassment of meeting those of the man who had run the elder wainright off the bar y ranch an occurrence which rankled horribly in the breasts of both bull taciturn as usual ate in silence with something of the mien of a lion feeding among jackals mary donovan hovered in the doorway bull laid down his spoon drank a glass of water and rose from the table sure an wont ye have another helpin o puddin now bull urged mary no thanks mrs donovan he replied im plumb full he walked past her into the kitchen and out the back door an almost audible sigh of relief rose from the remaining guests i reckon he thinks he owns the shack commented jim weller apropos of bulls exit through the sacred precincts of mary donovans kitchen sure he could have it fer the askin the fine by he is shot back mary him agoin out to fetch in wood fer me while the loikes o ye jim weller what aint fit to black his boots sits here and makes remarks about him ye lazy whelp mr weller subsided the meal over the guests departed with the exception of mack harber jim weller and the wainrights who had congregated on the veranda you dont seem to like the fellow they call bull remarked the younger wainright to weller i didnt say i didnt like him an i didnt say i did replied weller noncommittally well i dont like him said mack vehemently i wouldnt like my grandmother if she shot me in the belly you mean that he shot you asked wainright the black coyote shot me an if bull aint the black coyote my names mcginnis you really think that he has been pulling off these holdups demanded the elder wainright i aint the only one what thinks so replied mack everyone most thinks so an ef we had a decent sheriff that fellerd be behind the bars where he belongs er strung up to a cottonwood in hells bend pears to me like gum was either in on the deal er afeard of bull gums afeard of every one said weller well remarked jefferson wainright senior when we come over on this side o the hills i calclate as how things air goin to be a heap sight different there wont be no more o this here funny gunplay stuff im agoin to run all o these wouldbe badmen out o the country you figgerin on cumin over here asked mack i certainly am im agoin to buy the whole bar y outfit the hell you is exclaimed mack i heard that miss di wouldnt sell it to you she aint got nothin to say about it im agoin to buy it from the man thats runnin that outfit now an hes a mighty good business man too whos thatcolby no colby nothinits mr corson of noo york hes handlin all o john manills interests an he just come here today with manills daughter we come over on the stage with them i was tellin corson of the fine airs that chit of a henders girl puts on but things is goin to be different now corsons goin to close out the estate an the holdins here is as good as sold to me already chapter x wildcat bob goes courting bull sat in a corner of the chicago saloon watching the play at the faro table it was too early to go to bed and he was not a man who read much nor cared to read even had there been anything to read which there was not he had skimmed the latest eastern papers that had come in on the stage and his reading was over until the next shipment of gold from the mine brought him again into contact with a newspaper then he would read the livestock market reports glance over the headlines and throw the paper aside satisfied his literary requirements were few a man who had drunk not wisely but too well lurched up to him have a drink stranger he commanded it was not an invitation aint drinkin replied bull quietly oh yes you be announced the hospitable one when i says drink you drinks see im a badman i am whoopee and drawing a sixshooter he commenced firing into the floor at bulls feet suddenly a large man enveloped him from the rear held his gun hand aloft and dragged him away into an opposite corner where to the accompaniment of a deluge of lurid profanity he counselled him to a greater discretion why you blankety blank blank blank he cried you tryin to commit sewerside dont you know who that is you blitherin idjit then he whispered something in the others ear the effect was electrical the man seemed sobered instantly with staring eyes he looked across the room at bull im goin to git out o here he said he might change his mind i caint see yit why he didnt bore ye agreed his friend you better go an apologize slowly the pseudo badman crossed the room toward bull who had not moved sufficiently to have changed his position since the man had first accosted him the man halted in front of bull a sickly grin on his bloated countenance no offense pardner jest had a drop too much no offense intended jest jokinthet was all jest jokin bull eyed him intently for a moment oh yes he said presently i remember you nowyoure the flannel mouth that got gay with of wildcat a coupla months ago did you ever return that window sash you took with you i hearn gum was powerful cut up about that window sash not the shadow of a smile crossed bulls face i warnt there but i hearn all about it the other flushed attempted some witty repartee that fell fiat and finally managed to make his escape amid a roar of laughter from the nearer card players and spectators who had overheard the brief dialogue bull rose coin asked an acquaintance i reckon so good night good night bull the man stepped out into the clear starlit night involuntarily he turned and looked toward the northeast in the direction of the bar y ranch diana was there for a long time he stood motionless gazing out across the arid moonbathed level that stretched away to her loved feet what emotions played behind the inscrutable mask of his face who may say as he stood there silently he heard voices coming from between the chicago saloon and gums placeliquors and cigars hes in there now said one i kin see him if there werent so tarnation many fellers at the bar i cd git him from here youd better come along afore you git in more trouble than you got the capacity to handle urged a second voice thas all right i know what im doin there caint no dried up of buffalo chip like thet run me out o no mans saloon an get away with it an thas all they is to thet well im goin home stated the second voice i know when im well off you go home after i shoot the ears offen this wildcat bob party im comin home too you go to shootin any ears offen wildcat bob an you wont need no blankets where youre goin thasso well here goesyou better stay an see the fun im goin now while i got the chanct said the other and bull heard him coming from the side of the building the former stepped quickly back into the doorway of the chicago saloon and an instant later he saw the large man who had dragged his friend from him a few minutes before passup the street at a rapid walk then bull looked from his place of concealment just in time to see another figure emerge from between the buildings and enter gums place bull was close behind him the door was open a crack he saw that the other had advanced into the room a few feet and was standing behind one of the rough columns that supported the second story across the room at the far end wildcat bob had just set down his whiskey glass upon the bar wiped his beard on his sleeve and turned away toward the tables where the gambling was in progress for a moment he would be alone with only the rough rear wall behind him bull saw the stranger raise his sixgun to take deliberate aim he was too far away to reach him before he pulled the trigger and it would do no good towarn the wildcat there was but a single alternative to standing supinely by and watching old wildcat being shot down in cold blood by a cowardly murderer it was this alternative that bull adopted as the smoke rose from the muzzle of his gun the stranger threw his hands above his head his weapon clattered to the floor and he wheeled about his eyes alighted upon bull standing there grimfaced and silent the smoking sixgun in his hand suddenly the wounded man gave voice toa shrill scream he done it he cried pointing at bull he done it the black coyote done it hes killed me and with these last words the body slumped to the floor bull stood facing them all in silence for just a moment the whole roomful of men and women was staring at him then he slipped his gun into its holster and advanced into the room a faint smile on his lips he walked toward wildcat bob that hombre was after you bob he said he was drunk but i couldnt stop him no other way hes the feller you chased through the window that time gum smith hurried to the rear of the bar then he leaned over it and pointed a finger at bull yoalls undah arrest he cried yoalls undah arrest fo murder go kick yourself through a knothole advised bull ef i hadnt got that hombre hed agot bob they wasnt nothin else to do yoall hearn what he called him didnt yo yelled gum he pointed at first one and then another ah depatize yo ah depatize yo he cried arrest him men no one moved except wildcat bob he came and stood beside bull and he drew both his long heavy guns with their heavily notched grips anyone whats aimin to take this boy why let him step up said wildcat bob and his watery blue eye was fixed terribly upon the sheriff ah want yoall to know thet when ah depatizes yo yoalls depatized shrilled gum yo hearn what the corpse called him aint that enough do yo duty men one or two of the men friends of gums moved restlessly bull sensing trouble had drawn both his weapons and now he stood beside the wildcat his steady gray eyes alert for the first hostile move dont none o you gents go fer to start nothin he advised you all seen what happened you know i couldnt adone nothin else an as fer what thet drunken bum called me ef gum thinks im the coyote why dont he step up an take me i aint a honin fer trouble but i dont aim to be the subject o no postmortem neither do yoall surrendah then demanded gum dont try to be no more of a damn fool than the lord made yuh gum advised wildcat bob you know thet if this here boy aint the black coyote you dont want him an ef he is the black coyote you wouldnt never git outen behind thet bar ef you was to try to take him fer my part i dont believe he is an i got two of peashooters here what thinks the same as i does what do you think gum well said the sheriff after a moments deliberation ah reckon as mebby the corpse was mistook hev a drink on the house gents as bull and wildcat bob entered the office of the donovan house mary donovan espied them through the open doorway of her sitting room and called to them come in an have a drop o tay wid me before yese go to bed she invited and as they entered she scrutinized wildcat bob with a stern eye evidently satisfied her face softened i know they aint run out o whiskey in hendersville she said so i reckon ye must o run out o money wildcat the little old gentleman reached into his pocket and drew forth a handful of silver which he displayed with virtuous satisfaction the saints be praised exclaimed mary donovan yeve money in yer pocket an yer home airly an sober be ye sick wildcat bob ive reformed maryi aint never goin to tech another drop he assured her solemnly yeve not had a drink the avenin she demanded well he hesitated you see yis i see she snapped scornfully but mary i only had one little oneyou wouldnt begrudge an old man one little nightcap well she consented relenting wan little one wouldnt do no harrm i wouldnt moind one mesilf wildcat bob reached for his hip pocket i was thinking that same thing mary and thats why i brung one home fer yuh and he drew forth a pint flask the divil fly away wid ye wildcat bob she cried but she was smiling as she reached for the flask bull rose laughing good night he said im going to turn in have a drop wid us before ye go invited mary no thanks ive quit replied bull a moment later they heard him mounting the stairs to his room hes a good by said mary wiping her lips and replacing the cork in the bottle he is that mary agreed wildcat reaching for it there was a period of contented silence its a lonesome life fer a widdylady that it is remarked mary with a deep sigh wildcat bob moved his chair closer flushed at his own boldness and fell to examining the toe of his boot mary rocked diligently her red hands folded in her ample lap keeping an eye cocked on the wildcat there was another long silence that was broken at last by mrs donovan sure she saidan its funny ye never married bob bob essayed reply but a mouthful of tobacco juice prevented rising he walked into the office crossed that room opened the front door and spat copiously without returning to the room he hitched his chair closer to marys apparently by accident as he resumed his seat i he started but it was evidently a false start since he commenced all over again i again he paused you what inquired mary donovan with soft encouragement you said wildcat bob and stuck again inward excitement evidently stimulated his salivary glands with the result that he was again forced to cross to the outer door when he returned he hunched his chair a bit closer to marys as ye was about to remark prodded mary ii yes said mary go on bob i was just agoin to say that i dont think itll rain tonight he ended lamely mary donovan placed her hands upon her hips pressed her lips together and

muttered mary donovan rain in arizony this time o year sure an ye mane ye thought it wouldnt shnow didnt ye she demanded wildcat bob emitted only a gurgle and again silence reigned unbroken for long minutes except by the creaking of marys rocker suddenly she turned upon him gimme that flask she said he handed it over and she took a long drink wiping the mouth of the bottle with the palm of her hand she returned it to him then wildcat bob took a drink and the silence continued the evening wore on the flask emptied and midnight came with it came gum smith reeling bedward they watched him stagger across the office floor and heard him stumbling up the stairs mary donovan arose be off to bed wid ye she said i cant be sittin here all night gossipin wid ye he too arose good night mary he said its been a pleasant evenin yis said mary donovan as wildcat bob climbed the stairs toward his room he was mumbling in his beard doggone my hide he said ef id jest had a coupla drinks i mout adone it sure soliloquized mary donovan as she closed the door of her bedroom its not so dum funny after all that the ould fool nivir was married chapter xi ride him cowboy lillian manill awoke early and viewed the brilliant light of the new day through the patio windows of her roomthe outer windows were securely shuttered against indians she stretched languorously and turned over for another nap but suddenly changed her mind threw off the covers and arose it was a hideously early hour for lillian manill to arise but she had recalled that there was to be a riding lesson after breakfast and diana had explained to her that the breakfast hour was an early one dressing she selected a tailored walking suitshe would change into her riding habit after breakfastfor she wanted to stroll about the yard a bit before breakfast and she knew that this new walking suit was extremely fetching a few minutes later as she stepped into the yard she saw signs of activity in the direction of the horse corrals and thither she bent her steps texas pete who was helping the chore boy with the morning feeding saw her coming and looked for an avenue of escape being in no sense a ladys man and fully aware of the fact but he was too latethere was no avenue left lillian manill being already between him and the bunkhouse so he applied himself vigorously to the pitchfork he was wielding and pretended not to see her a pretense that made no impression whatever upon lillian manill she paused outside the bars and looked in good morning she said texas pete pretended that he had not heard mornin replied pete pulling at the brim of his hat and immediately resuming the fork he wished she would move on the horses were fed and there was no other excuse for him to remain in the corral but in order to reach the bunkhouse he must pass directly by this disconcerting person diana he did not mindhe was used to diana and aside from the fact that he was madly in love with her she caused him little embarrassment or concern except upon those few occasions when he had attempted to maintain an extended conversation with her dr johnson would have found nothing in petes conversational attainments to have aroused his envy pete continued feeding the horses he fed them twice as much as they could eat in a day notwithstanding the fact that he knew perfectly well they were to be fed again that evening but finally he realized that he could defer the embarrassing moment no longer and that the girl had not left he stuck the fork viciously into the haystack and crossed the corral he tried to appear unconcerned and to pass her by without looking at her but in both he failedfirst because he was very much concerned and second because she placed herself directly in his path and smiled sweetly at him i dont believe i had the pleasure of meeting you last night she said i am miss manillmiss renders cousin yesm said pete and i suppose you are one of the cowgentlemen she added pete turned suddenly and violently purple a choking sound issued from his throat but quickly he gained control of himself something in that remark of hers removed instantly all of texas petes embarrassment he found himself at once upon an even footing with her nom he said i haint one o the cowgentlemenim ony a tendershoe im sure you dont look it she told him with those leather trousers with the fleece on but you ride dont you she added quickly i aint lamed yit he assured her oh isnt that too bad i thought of course you were a wonderful equestrian and i was going to ask you to teach me to ride but youd better come along after breakfast and well get mr colby to teach us both i reckon he wouldnt like it explained pete you see im in his afternoon ridin class he dont take nothin but ladies in the mornin oh does he teach riding regularly my yes thats what hes here fer hes larnin us all to ride sos we kin go out on hosses an catch the cows stid o havin to hoofit i thought he was foreman she said yesm but thats one of his jobslarnin cowgentlemen to ride how interesting ive learned so much already and ive only been in arizona since day before yesterday mr bull was so kind and patient answering all my silly little questions i reckon bull could answer most any question he told her yes indeed but then hes been here in arizona so long and had so much to do with the development of the country why do you know he planted all the willows along that funny little river we followed for so long yesterdaymiles and miles of them did he tell you that inquired texas pete yes isnt it wonderful i think it shows such an artistic temperament theres more to bull than i ever suspected murmured texas pete reverently a sudden clamorous metallic din shattered the quiet of the cool arizona morning the girl gave a little scream and sprang for texas pete throwing both arms about his neck ooh she cried what is itindians nom said pete striving to disengage himself for he saw the malevolent eyes of several unholy cowgentlemen gloating upon the scene from the doorway of the bunkhouse nom that aint injunsthats the breakfast bell how silly of me she explained now i suppose i must be going im so glad to have met you mr my names texas pete mr pete and i do hope you learn to ride quickly i am sure we could have some lovely excursions picnicking among the beautiful hills oh wouldnt it be divine just you and i mr pete and she let her great lovely eyes hang for a moment on his in a fashion that had turned more sophisticated heads than texas petes when she had gone and pete was making his way toward the cookhouse he ran his fingers through his shock of hair by gollies he muttered the outside o her heads all right anyway as he entered the cookhouse shorty seized him and threw both arms about his neck kiss me darlin he cried i aint had a single kiss before breakfast shet up you longlegged walrus replied pete grinning as he shoved the other aside he ate in silence despite the gibes of his companions who quickly desisted realizing the futility of attempting to arouse texas petes ire by raillery he was quick enough of temper and quicker still with his guns when occasion warranted but no one could arouse his anger so long as their thrusts were shod with fun lookee here cook he called promptly to that individual youre the best eddicated bloke in this bunch o longhornswhats a questreen somethin you puts soup in replied the cook texas pete scratched his head i thought all along that i didnt like her he muttered an now i knows it diana henders greeted her guests with a cheery smile and a word of welcome as they entered the dining room for breakfast i hope you slept well she said oh i did exclaimed lillian manill i never knew a thing from the time my head touched the pillow until broad daylight this morning i had a perfectly wonderful night i didnt said corson and diana noticed then that he looked tired and haggard what happened last night he asked why nothing that i know of replied diana why do you ask have you seen any of your men this morningor any of the neighbors he continued i have seen a couple of the men to talk withwe have no neighbors how many women are there on this place he went on just lillian and i well something terrible happened last night said corson i never spent such a hideous night in my life its funny you didnt hear it hear what asked diana that womanmy god i can hear her screams yet oh maurice what do you mean cried miss manill it was about midnight he explained i had been rather restless just dozing a littlewhen all of a sudden the dogs commenced to bark and then a woman screamedit was the most awful longdrawn agonized wail i ever heardsome one must have been torturing her ill bet the indians were out last night and the first thing you know youll hear about a terrible massacre well it stopped all of a sudden and pretty soon the dogs commenced to yap againthere must have been fifty of emand then that woman shrieked againill hear that to my dying day i dont think you ought to let any of the men go away today until you find out just what happened last night the indians may just be waiting for em to go and then theyll rush down on us and kill us all a faint smile had slowly curved dianas lips and brought little wrinkles to the corners of her eyes what are you smiling about miss henders demanded corson if youd heard that woman you wouldnt feel like smilingnot for a long time that wasnt a woman you heard mr corsonthey were coyotes he looked at her blankly are you sure he asked presently of course im sure she told him corson breathed a sigh of relief id like to believe it he said id sleep better tonight well you can believe it for that is what you heard id hate to be caught out after dark by em he said a pack of fifty or a hundred such as there was last night would tear a fellow to pieces in no time they are perfectly harmless diana assured him and the chances are that there were no more than two or three of thempossibly only one i guess i heard em he insisted they have a way of sounding like a whole lot more than they really are he shook his head i guess i know what i heard illhave to show that cook of yours how to make coffee remarked corson a few minutes later diana flushed i suppose we dont get the best coffee out here she said but we are accustomed to it and learn to like it first rate i think wong does the best he can with what he has to do with well it wont hurt him any to learn how to make coffee said corson he has been with us a great many years and is very faithful i think he would be terribly hurt if a stranger criticized his coffee said diana maurice is very particular about his food said miss manill it is really an education to hear him order a dinner at delmonicos and the way he does flay the waiters if everything isnt just so i always get such a thrillyou can see people at the nearby tables listening to him whispering to one another i can imagine said diana sweetly but she did not say just what she could imagine corson swelled visibly call the chink in miss henders he said and ill give him a lesson nowyou might learn something yourself way out here so far from new york you dont get much chance of course theres really nothing quite like the refining influences of the east to take the rough edges off of people i think i prefer to speak to wong privately and in person if i find it necessary said diana well just so i get some decent coffee hereafter said corson magnanimously lillian manill having finished her breakfast rose from the table im going to put on my riding habit now maurice she said go out and tell mr colby to wait for me diana henders bit her lip but said nothing as corson rose and walked toward the door he was garbed in a new york tailors idea of the latest english riding mode and again diana bit her lip but not in anger corson setting his hat jauntily over one eve stalked into the open and down toward the corrals where the men were saddling up for the days work he lighted a big black cigar and puffed contentedly as he hove in sight work in the corral ceased spontaneously my gawd moaned texas pete who left the bars down inquired idaho shut up cautioned colby that fellers likely to be boss around here he wont never boss me said shorty not with thet funny hat on i wonder could i crease it and he reached for his gun dont git funny shorty theys friends o miss itenders whispered colby itd only make her feel bad he could not have hit upon a stronger appeal to these men shorty lowered his hand from the butt of his gun and almost at once work was resumed when corson joined them he could not have guessed that he was the object either of ridicule or pity though he was of both say colby he said saddle up a couple of safe horses for miss manill and me and wait around until she comes out i want you to give her a few lessons in riding did miss henders say that it would be all right lie asked you know the work is pretty well laid out an we aint got none too many hands h thats all right my man corson assured him youll be safe to do anything that i say im handling miss manills interests and looking after everything in general until the estate is closed just trot along and saddle up a couple of horses and see to it that they are gentle i havent ridden for a number of years although i was pretty good at it when i was a boy hal colby eyed mr maurice b corson for a long minute what was transpiring in his mind it would have been difficult to guess from the expression on his face though what should have been going on within the convolutions of his brain the other men knew full well and so they lolled around their faces immobile waiting for the fun to begin but they were doomed to disappointment for there was no gunplaycolby they thought might have at least made the dude dance instead he turned away without a word to corson gave some final directions for the days work swung into the saddle and rode toward the office utterly ignoring the easterners instructions corson flushed angrily here you one of you men he snapped turning toward the punchers most of whom had already mounted their ponies i want two horses saddled immediately one for miss manill and one for me silently ignoring him as completely as though he had not existed the riders filed out of the corral past him at a little distance they drew rein waiting for colby ive saw gall before remarked texas pete in an undertone but thet there dude tenderfoots got moren a brass monkey if he dont cral thet jaw o his pronto growled shorty i aint agoin to be responsible fer what happens i caint hold myself much longer i wouldnt atook what colby did said idaho some blokesll take a lot to hold their jobs said shorty they cn hev mine right now stated texas pete ef i gotta take thet dudes lip here comes the boss now said idaho shell settle things dum her pretty little hide he added affectionately diana had stopped just below the house to listen to colby whom the men could see was talking earnestly to her look here di he sas saying i want to know ef i gotta take orders from thet tinhorn lawyer feller is he boss round these diggins or is you why i supposed i was hal she replied though i must admit there appears to be a suspicion of doubt on the subject in mr corsons mind what has he said to you colby told her repeating corsons words as nearly as he could and the girl could not suppress a laugh oh i reckon its funny all right he said testily but i dont see the jokehevin a papercollared crackerfed dude like thatun callin me my man an orderin me to saddle up a hoss fer him right in front o all the boys trot along he says an saddle up a couple o hosses an see to it thet theyre plumb gentle my gawd di you dont expect me to take thet sort o jaw do you diana by this time was frankly in tears from laughter and finally colby himself was unable to longer repress a smile dont mind him hal she said finally he is just one of those arrogant conceited provincial new yorkers they are mighty narrow and disagreeable but weve got to put up with him for a short time and we might as well make the best of it go and ask willie to saddle up two horses for them and be sure that the one for miss manill is plumb gentle she accompanied her last instructions with the faintest trace of a wink colby wheeled his pony and loped off to the corral where he imparted the bosss orders to the chore boy willie lank rawboned and pimply willie who always thought of himself as wild bill swaggered off to catch up the two ponies grinning inwardly as he roped gimlet for mr maurice b corson corson seeing diana approaching had gone to meet her he was still red and angry look here miss henders he exclaimed youve got to tell those fellows who i am i asked them to saddle up a couple of horses and they absolutely ignored me you tell them that when i give orders they are to be obeyed i think it will be less confusing if the orders come from me mr corson she replied it is never well to have too many bosses and then you see these men are peculiar they are unlike the sort of men you have apparently been accustomed to dealing with you cannot talk to them as you would to a delmonico waiterunless you are tired of life mr corson they are accustomed to mewe are friendsand they will take orders from me without question so i think that it will be better all around if you will explain your wants to me in the future colby told me what you wanted just now and the horses are being saddled he started to speak and then evidently reconsidering caught himself with a palpable effort very well he said presently well let it pass this time together they walked toward the corral where willie was saddling a quiet old horse for miss manill beside him stood gimlet with drooping head and dejected mien which one is for me sonny demanded corson wild bill glanced up in sullen scorn eyed mr corson for a brief moment and then jerked a soiled thumb in the direction of gimlet what that old crowbait exclaimed the new yorker you said you wanted a gentle hoss explained colby lolling in his saddle nearby an gimlet wont pitch i dont want to ride a skate growled corson when im on a horse i want to know im on something youll know youre on gimlet colby assured him sweetly he aint so dumb as he looks jest stick your spurs into him an hell act quite lively all right said corson glumly tell him to hurryi see miss manill coming now there were others who saw her coming too texas pete was only one of them by gollies he exclaimed look whats got loose lillian manill was approaching jauntily clothed in a black riding habit with a long voluminous skirt a mans collar and tie and black silk hat with a flowing veil wound around it shorty eyed her for a long minute then he let his gaze wander to mr corson it wouldnt never be safe fer me to go to new york he confided to idaho id shore laugh myself to death by the time miss manill joined the group the two horses were saddled and willie had led them out of the corral mercy exclaimed miss manill havent you a sidesaddle i could never ride one of those horrid things im sorry said diana but we havent one i doubt if there is a sidesaddle in the county i think you can work it though if you will put your leg around the horn next time ill fix you up with a skirt like mine and then you can ride astride are you sure the horse is perfectly safe inquired lillian ill have to have a few lessons before i can ride one of those bouncing ones oh mr colby good morning here i am all ready for my first lesson her eyes took in the punchers grouped a few yards away i see you are going to have quite a class this morning mr pete told me though that you taught the cowgentlemen in the afternoon colby shot a quick glance at pete who had just been overcome by a violent fit of coughing and knowing texas pete as he did grasped the situation at once oh i had to give up the afternoon class he told her after i found they was a few like mr pete who wouldnt never larn to ride isnt that too bad she said politely then she turned toward corson i think youd better try it first maurice ill watch how you do it all right said he its been a long time since i have ridden but i guess itll come back to me quick enough i might be able to give you a few pointers at that he walked up to gimlets off side and took hold of the saddlehorn neglecting the reins which willie still held gimlet eyed him sadly when he essayed to place a foot in the stirrup the pony sidestepped rapidly in the opposite direction youd better mount from the other side mr corson advised diana these horses are not broken to work with from the off side i knew all along he was a damn injun remarked idaho an you better take the reins you may need em supplemented willie who at bottom had a kind heart and shrank from bloodshed corson walked to the near side of gimlet gathered the reins loosely in his right hand stuck a foot into the stirrup took hold of the horn with both hands and pulled himself laboriously into the saddle gimlet stood quietly giddap said mr corson but gimlet moved not throw the hooks into him shouted willie gleefully why dont the old skate go demanded corson shaking the reins use your spurs called one of the cowboys thats what you bought em fer aint it mr corson used his spurs the result was electrical galvanizing gimlet into instant and surprising actionaction which glowingly elucidated the derivation of his name he wheeled dizzily round and round upon the same spot and with lightning rapidity mr corsons funny hat flew off he clawed at the horn in intervals that he was not clawing at the loose reins in a mad effort to gather them then gimlet stopped and commenced wheeling again mr corson lost a stirrup then he let go both reins and seized the horn with two hands stop him he yelled stop him whoa whoa rip him open shrieked willie spur him in the eyes ride him cowboy yelled idaho again gimlet bolted and this time mr corson commenced to slip dangerously to one side a hundredyard sprint back to where he had started and gimlet paused to wheel once more it was the end mr corson spun off alighting on his back he rolled over with surprising agility and on his hands and knees crawled rapidly away from this man eater that he was sure was pursuing him but gimlet was only standing dejectedly with drooping ears corson came to his feet the men about himrough fellows with none of the finer sensibilities of new yorkerswere laughing rudely it was a putup job he spluttered it was a putup job youll suffer for this colby you told me that animal was gentle i told you he wouldnt pitch mister snapped colby an he didnt pitch miss manill had started back toward the house i think ill not ride this morning she said chapter xii corson speaks come here he yells then to the rest o us boys step up to the funral an dont make no noise the while we inter all the barbwire whats here after which well dispose o the seegars an beer sang texas pete hello see whos came bull entered the bunkhouse with a grin and a nod still singin i see pete he said aint you finished thet one yit two weeks had slipped by since the arrival of corson and miss manill bull had just been relieved from duty as bullion guard and was only now returning to the home ranch in the weeks that he had brought the gold down from the mine there had been no holdupthe black coyote or gregorio had not once been seen hows everything asked bull soso replied texas pete wheres colby i gotta report to him up at the househe eats there now bull made no comment he thought he understood why hal colby ate at the house one day soon doubtless he would sleep there too as master this manill heifer got stuck on him an insists on his eatin there explained pete things aint been the same since them two shorthorns hit the diggins the boss she looks tired and worried all the time an sadlike i reckon she aint got no more use fer em than the rest o us is colby gone on this manill girl asked bull i dunno sometimes i reckons he is an sometimes i reckons he aint looks like as if he werent quite sure which side his bread was buttered on an hes waitin to find out bull busied himself arranging his blankets on his old bunk working in silence texas pete eyed him surreptitiously there was a troubled look in petes eyes presently he coughed nervously the two men were alone in the bunkhouse say bull pete finally broke the silence you an mes ben good pals bull looked up from the work of folding his tarpaulin who said we aint he inquired nobody aint said we aint pete assured him then whats eatin you its only just what everybodys sayin bull said pete i thort youd better know about it what thet you an the black coyote air the same feller not thet it makes any difference with me i aint askin whether you air or whether you aint im just atellin you fer your own good bull smiled one of his slow smiles if i wasnt id say so wouldnt i he asked i reckon you would an if i was id say i wasnt wouldnt i i reckon you would assented pete then what the hells the use o sayin anything he demanded and specially when i dont give a damn what they think pete shook his head i dunno he said bull started for the doorway im goin up to the house to report to colby he said look out thet manill heifer dont git her grubhooks on you cautioned pete in the office he found diana henders writing a letter she looked up with a little start as she heard his voice oh bull she cried im so glad youre back thanks miss i come up to report to colby but i see he aint here hes in the livingroom with mr corson and miss manill she told him i reckon ill see him later then he started to leave dont go bull she said i want to talk with you please sit down he walked toward her and lowered himself into the big easy chair that had been her fathers his movements were like those of a lionsilent powerful and yet without stealth for the first time in weeks the sense of loneliness that had constantly oppressed her vanished bull was back it was as if a big brother had come home after a long absencethat was why she was so glad to see him her heart forgot the thing that her reason had been practically convinced ofthat bull was the bandit of hells bendthat it was bull who had been robbing her father and her for monthsthat it was bull who had shot mack harber she only knew that she felt relief and safety when bull was near nearly everyone feared himmany hated him could they all be wrong could she alone be right in believing in himas her heart did against the wise counseling of reason yes miss he said interrogatively the wainrights are trying to buy the ranch again bull she said and mr corson seems to favor the idea do you want to sell he asked no i do not but the worst of it is the price they want to accepttwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars for all our holdingranch cattle and mine they are bringing all kinds of pressure to bear on me mr corson says i must either buy them out or agree to the sale i havent the cash to buy them out and they wont take my notes dont sell miss at that price an dont sell at all if you dont want tothey cant force you to sell but they make it so unpleasant for me and mr corson is always telling me that the bottom has fallen out of the livestock business and that the new vein in the mine doesnt exist the livestock business is all right miss it wasnt never better an as fer the new vein thats all right too i was scratchin around a little bit myself while i was up there these past six weeks the golds there all right the trouble is that you aint got the right man up therethat new superintendent looks to me like a sharper did you know the wainrights was up there often no really yes an that superintendent is thick as thieves with em he has no business to permit them on the property he does though said bull but he raised thunder when he found id been snootin around the workings i dont like that hombre miss everybody seems to be against me bull and its so hard to know what to do now that dads gone mr corson and my cousin are nagging at me all the time to agree to sell sometimes i am almost determined to just to get rid of them if you want to get rid o them miss thats easy said bull all you gotta do is say so an ill run em off the ranch an outta the county i wouldnt like nothin better i thought you had taken quite a fancy to my cousin coming in on the stage said diana the only rope she could ever have on me miss is that shes your cousin replied bull and she knew that he meant it if you want me to run em out of the country say the word an ill start em in ten minutesan keep em on the jump too im afraid that wouldnt do bull she said smiling i dont see why not he replied just then hal colby entered the room he nodded to bull you back bull took no notice of a question so obviously foolish how long you ben back continued colby bout half an hour why didnt you report colby was vexed the easy familiarity of bulls attitude stretched comfortably as he was in mr henders chair and in pleasant converse with diana galled him aint you got eyes inquired bull caint you see me sittin here reportin to my boss youre supposed to report to me snapped colby im apt to do lots of things i aint supposed to do bull told him softly i reckon most everybody knows that too said colby meaningly come cried diana dont you boys quarreli have troubles enough now bull was looking for you to report when he came up here she told colby he asked for you why didnt he say so then i got some work for him an i ben expectin him all day well im here said bull what do you want me to do his voice unlike colbys carried no trace of anger if he felt any cramer wants off a few days an i want you to go over to the west ranch an look after the hosses til he comes back theys some colts over there that needs to be ridcramerll tell you all there is to do when do you want me to go tonightthatll give cramer a chance to git an early start in the mornin all right said bull rising good night miss good night bull i may ride over while youre at the west ranch ive been intending to look the place over for a month or more cramer said we needed some new corrals he nodded and left the room i dont see how you kin be decent to a feller whats ben robbin you an your dad fer months said colby after bull had left er mebby you dont believe it even now i know it looks suspicious hal but its so hard to believe it of bull i hate to believe it i almost dont believe it you are hard on him because you dont like him didnt i tell you he was one of my best friendsyou know thattil i got wise to his game i aint awantin no rattlesnake like thet as no friend o mine diana sighed and rose wearily from her chair im going to wash up for supper she said she had been gone but a moment when corson entered the office well he asked has she changed her mind i didnt say nothing about the matter to her replied colby it wouldnt have done no good after what i hears bull atellin her just afore i come in the room what was that demanded corson he was atellin her not to sell an furthermore he offers to run you an miss manill outta the country if she gives the word what did she say to that corsons voice showed indications of nervousness oh she wouldnt stand fer that o course but hes a dangerous feller to have around her hes got too damn much influence over her i wish we could get rid of him said corson it seems funny that he isnt arrested when everyone knows hes the black coyote hell run his neck into a noose one o these days replied colby but in the meantime he may spoil this deal with wainright said corson and ive got my heard set on that i want to get out of this damned country it gives me the willies too many indians and coyotes and irresponsible kids with firearmsit isnt safe i dont see why you are so anxious to sell now said colby you can get more if you half try that would mean going back to new york there isnt any capital out here wainright is a find pure and simple i cant chance taking the time to arrange a deal back easti dont know what miss henders would be up to out here what miss manill wants to do is get some ready money out of it quick and get out i guess theres only one thing to do and thats to spring my last card on the girl id rather have done it an easier way but shes so damn stubborn shes forcing me to it to what asked colby corson leaned close to him and whispered for several minutes into his ear when he was through colby leaned back in his chair and whistled you dont mean it he exclaimed wainright is coming over to hendersville on the stage tomorrow and i want to get this matter settled with the henders girl so that i can have something definite to say to him i think shes coming around all right now that she is commencing to realize that the mines about played out and that the cattle business isnt much better of course it dont make much difference what she thinks about it except that she could make it mighty unpleasant around here if she wanted to she shore could make if unpleasant fer you and wainright ef she wanted to agreed colby an dont fool yourself that she thinks the business aint worth nothin ef you had her thinkin so today bulls give her something new to think about since he was here hows that demanded corson i learn him tellin her hed been diggin round in the mine while he was up there an that he knows the new veins rich as all getout an he told her the cattle business was all right too i reckon shell believe him afore she will you corson bit his lip that settles it he exclaimed ive fooled around long enough im going to tell her tonight outside the bunkhouse some of the men were washing for supper inside bull was rolling and roping his bed preparatory to moving to the west ranch after the evening meal what yuh doin demanded texas pete yuh aint quit goin over to the west ranchcramers gettin off fer a spell explained bull looks like they werent crazy fer your company here remarked pete bull shrugged his shoulders and went on with the business of halfhitches to the final knot after which he tossed the bedroll onto his bunk i shouldnt think youd stay on bull said texas pete lets pull our freight i aint never ben to calyfornyhev you the exforeman shook his head i got my own reasons fer stayin on a spell yet pete he said pete said nothing more on the subject bulls answer to his suggestion that they leave the country troubled him however it was not diana henders who was keeping bull of that pete was certain because hal colby had long since as much admitted that he colby was engaged to marry the dainty boss it wasnt because of any love he had for the job eithertexas pete knew thatfor colby had never made bulls job any too easy since the former had become foreman and bull was not staying because he loved colby it was true that he never spoke a derogatory word concerning him nor once had he criticized his methods as foreman but texas pete knew as well as though bull had told him that the latter had no use for the foreman what was it then that was keeping bull texas petes loyalty to his friend made it difficult for him to harbor the only answer that his knowledge of events permitted him to entertain but that answer to the question persisted in obtruding itself upon his consciousness if bull was after all the black coyote he could not work to better advantage as a bandit than while in the employ of the bar y outfit where he could easily obtain firsthand knowledge of every important bullion shipment by gollies soliloquized texas pete i dont give a durn ef he be but ill be durned ef i believe it yit at the house hal colby was talking earnestly to lillian manill in the sitting room supper had not yet been served carson had gone to his room to clean up and diana had not yet come down look here lill colby was saying i dont like the way corsons treatin di i think a heap o thet little girl an i dont want to see her git the worst of it lillian manill reached up and encircled his neck with her arms i thought you were all over that hal she said youve been telling me how much you love me but how do you expect me to believe it if youre always thinking of her and not ever considering my interests you want her to have all the property and you dont want me to have any you dont love me yes i do lillim crazy about you he insisted then act like it she advised him and quit siding with her all the time im going to be a rich girl hal and we can have a mighty good time after were married if you dont go and make a fool of yourself and try to keep me out of what rightly belongs to me i aint always so durned sure youre goin to marry me he said gloomily youve ben pretty thick with thet feller corson an hes sweet on youenny fool cd tell thet oh pshaw exclaimed lillian manill laughing lightly why maurice is only like a big brother to me now give me a kiss and tell me that you wont let diana or anyone else steal all our money she drew his face down to hers and their lips met in a long kiss when they separated colby was panting heavily gawd he exclaimed huskily id commit murder fer you in the shadows of the hall stood maurice b corson scowling darkly upon them through the partially opened doorway presently he coughed discreetly and a moment later entered the room where he found lillian idly turning sheets of music at the piano while colby was industriously studying a picture that hung against the wall corson accosted them with a pleasant word and a jovial smile and a minute later diana henders entered the room and the four went in to supper the meal like its predecessors for some weeks was marked by noticeable constraint the bulk of the conversation revolved about the weather about the only thing that these four seemed to have in common that might be openly discussed and as arizona summer weather does not offer a wide field for discussion the meals were not conspicuous for the conversational heights attained nor was this one any exception to the rule when it was nearly over carson cleared his throat as is the habit of many when about to open an unpleasant subject after long deliberation miss henders he commenced hal colby arose i gotta see bull before he leaves he announced hastily and left the room corson started again miss henders he repeated i have a painful duty to perform i have tried to work in harmony with you but i have never met with any cooperation on your part and so i am forced to reveal a fact that we might successfully have gotten around had you been willing to abide by my judgment in the matter of the sale of the property and what fact is that asked diana politely we will get to it presently he told her now my dear young lady your fathers death has left you in very unfortunate circumstances but of course as is natural miss manill wants to do what she can for you i am afraid that i do not understand said diana lillian and i have suffered equally in the loss of our fathers and uncles and together we have inherited the responsibilities of a rather large and sometimes cumbersome business i am sure that we wish to help one another as much as possiblei as much as she i am afraid that you do not understand miss henders said corson solemnly by the terms of your uncles will everything would have gone to your father had he survived mr manill but he did not your father made a similar will leaving everything to your uncle so you see miss henders corson spread his palms and raised his brows in a gesture of helplessness i must be very dense said diana for i am sure i do not know even yet what you are driving at mr corson it is just this he explained your father left everything to your uncleyour uncle left everything to his daughter it is very sad miss hendersmiss manill has grieved over it a great deal but the law is clearit leaves you penniless but it is not what was intended and there must be another will exclaimed diana uncle john and dad both wished that when they were gone the estate should be divided equally between their lawful heirshalf and half dad left such a will and it was his understanding that uncle john had done likewiseand i know he must have for he was the soul of honor their wills were identicaldad has told me so more than once they had such implicit confidence in one another that each left everything to the other with the distinct understanding that eventually it all was to go to the heirs of both as i have explained i do not doubt that your father left such a will if you say he did but the fact remains that mr manill did not said mr corson emphatically but you shall not want miss henders your cousin will see to that she has already authorized me to arrange for an annuity that will keep you from want until you are marriedwe thought best not to continue it beyond that time for obvious reasons you mean asked diana dully that i have nothing that i am a pauperthat even this roof under which i have lived nearly all my life does not belong even in part to methat i have no right here oh please dont say that dear exclaimed lillian manill you shall stay here just as long as you wish you will always be welcome in my home my home diana suppressed a sob that was partially grief and partially rage the injustice of it to take advantage of a technicality to rob her of all that rightly belonged to her she was glad though that they had come out into the open at lastwhy had they not done so before of course said corson as miss manill says you are welcome to remain here as long as the property is in her hands but as you know we have received an advantageous offer for it and so it is only fair to tell you that you might as well make your plans accordingly you are going to sell to wainright for two hundred and fifty thousand asked diana corson nodded diana rose and walked the length of the room then she turned and faced them no you are not going to sell mr corson if there is any way in which i can prevent it you are not going to steal my property so easily why have you been attempting all these weeks to persuade me to agree to a sale if you knew all along that i had no interest whatsoever in the property she demanded suddenly that was solely due to a desire on our part to make it as easy as possible for you he explained suavely your cousin would have given you half the purchase price rather than have had to tell you the truth miss henders but you have forced it upon us she desires to sell it is her property you alone stood in the way you have been your own worst enemy miss henders you might have had one hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars had you not been stubbornnow you must be content with whatever miss manill sees fit to allow you in the way of annuity diana squared her shoulders as she faced them miss manill shall give me nothingi will not accept as a gratuity what rightfully belongs to me if you think mr corson that you are going to take my property away from me without a fight you are mistaken and she wheeled about and started for the doorway wait a moment miss henders cried the new yorker i am a lawyer and i know how expensive litigation is such a case as you contemplate and i take it for granted that you purpose taking the matter to court when you say fight might drag on for years wasting the entire property in attorneys fees and legal expense so that neither of you would get anythingi have seen such things happen scores of times now let us rather compromise we were willing to make you a gift of half the purchase price immediately on the consummation of the sale to mr wainright that offer is still open it is extremely fair and generous and if you will take my advice you will accept it never snapped diana corson and lillian sat in silence listening to dianas footfalls as she ascended the stairs presently they heard her door close then the girl turned upon corson you poor sucker you she exclaimed what do you think you are offering her a hundred and twentyfive thousand when we dont have to give her a cent dont be a hog lill advised the man well get enough and if we can save a lot of trouble wed better let her have the hundred and twentyfive you cant tell what these people out herell do take that bull fellow for instancehes already offered to run us out of the country if she says to look what he did to old man wainright for instance why say there are a lot of her friends here that would think no more of shooting us full of holes than they would of eating their sunday dinners if she just so much as hinted that she thought we were trying to do her out of anything and well be getting plenty anywayyou and i get a third and wainright gets the other thirdand that mine is worth millions why we could afford to give her the whole two hundred and fifty thousand dollars if shed agree to the sale im not so keen as you on giving my money away replied lillian your money hell he replied you wouldnt have anything if it wasnt for me and as for that measly little hundred and twentyfive thousand why itll cost us all of that to square these people around here before we get through with itive promised colby ten thousand already and say speaking of colby i saw you two in the sitting room before supper you got to lay off that businessyoure getting too thick with that fellow to suit me you belong to me he added suddenly and fiercely oh come on maurice dont be silly replied lillian you told me to get him on our side how did you suppose i was going to do itby making faces at him well you dont have to go too far i heard you telling him what you two would do after you were married you may be a good little actress lill but that kiss you gave him looked too damn realistic to suit me im not going to have you running off with him after you get your mitts on a little money say you dont think id marry that rube do you and lillian manill burst into peals of laughter colby found bull in the bunkhouse bull he said i wish youd ride up belters tomorrer an see how the waters holdin out listen bull said texas pete i got the rest of it an so we lines up at the bar twelve or more the boss tries to smile but he caint hes so sore the stranger says pronto youdum little runt jest then we hears someone come in at the front an turnin to look we

you ornry old buzzard she says you come here he give us a smile thet was knockkneed an lame an yes dear im comin he says an he came chapter xiii the necktie party when diana henders left the dining room after hearing corsons explanation of her status as an heir to the estate of her father and uncle she definitely severed relations with the two whom she now firmly believed had entered into a conspiracy to rob her of her all the following day she ate her meals in the kitchen with wong to whom she confided her troubles the old chinaman listened intently until she was through then he arose and crossed the kitchen to a cupboard a crafty smile playing over his wrinkled yellow countenance me fixeeme no likum he said as he returned with a phial of white powder in his hand o wong no no cried the girl grasping instantly the faithful servitors intent you mustnt do anything so horrible as that promise me that you wont all lightee jest samee you say he replied with a shrug and returned the phial to the cupboard im going away tonight wong she told him and i want you to promise me that nothing like that will happen while i am away and that you will stay until i return there is no one else

wont make no money fightin em well i wont accept it and im surprised that youd advise me to its only fer your own good di he assured her it aint lillians fault that your uncle done your dad outen the property you caint blame her fer wantin what was left to her an i think it was mighty pretty of her to offer to split with you i dont she replied and i think there is something behind that offer that is not apparent on the face of it i am going to find out too im going to kansas city to hire a lawyer and ill want the buckboard and one of the men to drive me to town after supper tonight im plumb sorry di but corson an lillian have took the buckboard to town already then ill go on captain she said please have him saddled for me right after supper she packed her traveling dress and other necessary articles in a small bag that could be tied to a saddle leaving on her buckskin skirt and blouse for the ride to town and after supper made her way to the corral after waiting a few minutes for captain to be brought to the house and rather wondering why hal had neglected to do sir to her surprise she discovered that captain had not even been saddled and was as a matter of fact still running in the pasture a mile from the house she went to the bunkhouse to get one of the men to catch him up but found it deserted prom there she walked to the cookhouse where she found only the cook setting bread for the morrow where are all the men she asked theys a dance to johnsons tonight an some of em went there he told her the rest went to town idaho shorty an pete went to the dance wheres hal i reckon he went to towni aint seen him since this arternoon some time did willie go too nom hes here sommershey willie you willie willie appeared from the outer dusk oh willie said diana wont you please catch captain up for me and saddle him you aint goin to ride tonight all alone be you he asked ive got to get to town willie and hal forgot to tell anyone to ride with me she explained well ill go along with you said willie ill have the hosses saddled pronto and off he ran ten minutes later they were in the saddle and loping through the rapidly falling night toward town i cant understand how hal happened to let all the boys go at the same time she said half musingly it was never done before and it isnt safe bull wouldnt never have done it said willie bull was a topnotch foreman you like bull she asked you bet i do declared willie emphatically dont you i like all the boys she replied bull wouldnt never have left you here alone at night he set a heap o store by you miss willie was emboldened to speak freely because of the darkness that would cover any sudden embarrassment he might feel if he went too far the same darkness covered dianas flusha flush of contrition that she harbored a belief in bulls villainy before they entered hendersville they became aware that something unusual was going on in town they could hear the hum of excited voices above which rose an occasional shout and as they rode into the single street they saw a hundred figures surging to and fro before gums place a man stood on the veranda of the saloon haranguing the crowd this business has gone fer enough he was saying as diana and willie paused at the outskirts of the crowd its high time we put a end to it you all knows whos ajoin it as well as i do what we orter do is ride out n git him tonighttheys a bunch o cottonwoods where he is right handy an we got plenty o ropes in the cowcountry whos with me two score voices yelled in savage assurance of their owners hearty cooperation then git your bronchs cried the speaker an well go after him an git him diana saw that the orator was hal colby she turned to one of the men who was remaining as the majority of the others hastened after their ponies what is it all about she asked what has happened the man looked up at her and as he recognized her pulled off his hat awkwardly oh its you miss henders well you see the stage was held up agin today an mack harber was kiltit was his first trip since he was wounded that time it was the first trip too since bull quit guardin the gold an a lot o the fellers has got it in their heads thet its bull as done it taint no sech thing cried a little old man nearby taint bull the speaker was wildcat bob i dont like to think so neither said the first man but it shore looks bad fer himthe fellers is all bet up there aint one in thet crowd but what would lynch his grinmaw ef he had another drink an they sure hev had plentygums bee settin em up in there fer a couple hours on the house never did see gum so plumb liberal hes aimin to get someone else to go after the black coyote said wildcat bob or he wouldnt be so doggone liberal with his rotguthe couldnt git up enough nerve ef he drunk a whole distillery you think they really intend to lynch bull asked the girl they aint no two ways about it miss said the man she had first accosted theyre aimin to do it an i reckon they will you see theyre pretty sore mack tried to put up a little fight an this black coyote feller bored him plumb between the eyes then he takes the gold cuts all the bosses loose from the stage an vamooses thets why we didnt hear oil it til just a bit ago cause they didnt have no way to git to town only hoofin it already the avenging mob was gathering i hey came whooping reeling in their saddles not one of them sober would have gone out after the exforeman of the bar y but drunk they forget heir fear of him and diana knew that they would carry out their purpose they were going to lynch bull it seemed incredible and yet could she blame there knowing him as she did she had herself half admitted the truth of the rumor of his guilt before this the latest outrage that seemed to fix the responsibility beyond peradventure of a doubt for the six weeks that bull had guarded the bullion there had been no holdup and now on the very first stage day after he had been relieved the depredations had been renewed she recalled the fact that he had been seen with gregorio on the very afternoon of a previous holdup she recalled the blood upon his shirt that same daythe day that mary donovan had fired upon the bandits she thought of the bag of gold dust that he had displayed at the bunkhouse there seemed no possible avenue of escape from a belief in his guilt the yelling avengers were milling around in a circle in front of gums place firing off their guns cursing shouting the sheriff appeared on the veranda and raised his hand for silence ahm sheriff yere he said an as an ahm of the law ah caint permit yoall to go fen to lynch nobody but ah can an do invite yoall in to hev a drink on the house befo yo go there was a wild shout of approval and a scramble for room at the tie rail those who lost out rode their ponies into the saloon and as the last of them disappeared diana who had lost sight of willie in the jostle and excitement of the past few minutes turned her pony about and rode back in the direction from which she had come just beyond the last house she turned abruptly to the leftthe bar y ranch lay to the righturged captain into a lope and started off through the darkness toward the west presently she struck a welldefined trail and then with a word and a touch of her spurs she sent captain into a run swiftly the wiry animal sprang through the night while the beating of his mistresss heart kept time to the rapid fall of his unshod hoofs what was she doing was she mad a dozen times diana henders repeated those questions to herself but the only answer was a monotonous cadence that beat upon her brain reasonless to the accompaniment of captains flying hoofs they shall not kill him they shall not kill him they shall not kill him constantly she listened for sounds of the coming of the lynching party though she knew that she had sufficient start to outdistance them completely even had captain not been the fleetand powerful runner that he was it was ten miles to the west ranch from hendersville and captain made it in thirty minutes that night diana threw herself from the saddle at the gate and crawled through the bars leaving captain on widestretched feet and with nose to ground blowing after his hard run knowing that he would not move from the spot for some time she hastened to the darkened cabin and pounded on the door bull she cried bull but there was no answer then she opened the door and entered fumbling around for a table she found it and matches striking one the cabin a oneroom affair was empty her ride for nothing bull was away but they would hide in the brush and wait for him to come back and then they would shoot him down in cold blood and he would never have a chance for his life if she only knew where he had gone she might ride out and meet him but she did not know wait there was one chance if he was the black coyote he would doubtless come in from the north or the northeast for in the latter direction lay hells bend the scene of his many holdups but it wasnt bullit couldnt be bullbull of all the men in the world could never have robbed her or killed her messenger slowly she returned to captain standing with heaving sides and dilated nostrils the animal staggered a bit as she mounted but at a touch of the rein he turned and walked out into the sagebrush toward the north she rode for a quarter of a mile and then she reined in her mount and called the mans name aloud there was no reply and she turned to the east and rode in that direction for a while now and then calling bull her voice sounding strange and uncanny in her own ears in the distance a coyote yapped and wailed she turned and rode west to a point beyond the cabin and then back again establishing a beat where she might hope to intercept the returning bull before he reached the danger of the ambush at intervals she called his name aloud and presently she halted frequently to listen for the coming of the lynchers it was a matchless arizona night the myriad stars blazing in the blueblack vault of infinite space cast their radiance softly upon vale and height relieving the darkness with a gentle luminosity that rendered distant objects discernible in mass if not in form and because of it diana saw the black bulk of the approaching horsemen while they were yet a considerable distance away and seeing them dared not call bulls name aloud again the mob rode silently nowa grim and terrible shadow creeping through the darkness to lay bloody hands upon its prey a quarter of a mile from the cabin it halted while its members dismounted and leaving a few to hold the horses the balance crept stealthily forward on foot diana too had dismounted knowing that she would be less conspicuous thus and was leading captain over a circuitous trail toward the north and east the girl knelt and placed an ear to the ground faintly as though at a great distance she heard the rhythmic pounding of a horses hoofs he was comingloping through the night bull was comingall unconscious of what awaited him there in the darkness he was riding to his death she hastened forward a short distance and listened again if the sounds should be plainer now she would be sure that he was coming from the northeast the selfappointed posse crept toward the cabin and according to a general plan imparted to them by colby separated into two sections and surrounded it finally worming their way close in on hands and knees taking advantage of the cover of the sage to shield them from the sight of the man they believed to be there then colby arose and walked boldly to the door knocking he called bulls name aloud there was no response hey bull cried colby again in a friendly voice its hal still no reply colby pushed the door open and entered of all the motley crew that followed him he alone had the courage to do the thing that he was doing now he struck a match and lighted a candle that stood on the rude table embedded in its own grease in the cover of a baking powder can a brief survey of the interior showed him that it was untenanted he extinguished the light and returned to his party where word was passed around that they were to remain quietly in hiding where they were until the quarry carte in the meantime a lone horseman had thrown himself from a halfspent pony in the bar y ranch yard and seeing a light in the cookhouse had burst in upon the astonished cook what in all tarnations the matter of ye wildcat bob he demanded wheres bull asked the little old man reckon hes over at the west ranchleastways theres where hes supposed to be why warnt they a gang o the boys jest here lookin for him no a burst of lurid profanity filled the room as wildcat bob explained j ust how he felt and what he thought of himself they set out to lynch bull he explained finally an i supposin o course thet he was here got away ahead o em an now dingbust my ornery of carcabs like as not they already got him over at the west ranch wheres the rest o the boys wheres texas pete you dont reckon thet critters with colby do you not by a long shot replied the cook hed stick up fer bull ef he massacreed the whole durn county sod shorty an idaho but they aint none o em heretheys all down to johnsons to a dance well said wildcat bob i done my best which same aint no good ef i hed a hoss instead o a hunk o coyote fodder id try to git to the west ranch in time but i reckon they aint no chanct now howsumever ill do the best i kin solong and he was gone a halfhour later his horse fell dead a mile north of hendersville while his rider was taking a short cut straight across country for the west ranch it was a warm and lurid wildcat bob who plodded through the dust of hendersvilles lone thoroughfare and stopped at the veranda of the donovan house some time later to be accosted by one of a group gathered there in semisilent expectancy the saints be praised exclaimed mary donovan is it a banchee or is it not its worse said bill gatlin the stage driver its wildcat bobwalkin did they git the poor by demanded mary whereat the little old gentleman burst forth anew with such a weird variety of oaths that mr jefferson wainright jr could feel the hot flush that mounted to his ears fairly scorching his skin ef i ever gits ahold o the blankety blank blank thet loaned me that blankety blank blank ewenecked ringboned spavined excuse fer a cayuse ill cut his heart out announced wildcat bob in a high falsetto finally mary donovan inveigled the facts from him ye done well bob thet ye did she assured him shure an how was yese to know thet he wasnt at the home ranch i shouldnt think youd care if they did hang a bandit and murderer declared mr jefferson wainright jr who in the hell told you to think you durn dude screamed wildcat bob reaching for his gun mr wainright sought the greater safety of the office tipping over his chair and almost upsetting mary donovan in his haste dont shoot he cried dont shoot i meant no offense wildcat bob would have followed him within but mary donovan caught him around the waist and pushed him into a chair be cam robert she soothed him as diana arose to her feet after listening close to the ground for the second time she was assured by the increased loudness of the sounds she had heard that the lone rider was rapidly approaching from the northeast and in that direction she again led captain intending to mount once more as soon as she had reached what she considered a safe distance from the cabin and the hidden watchers encircling it she had forged ahead for about five minutes when the way dipped into a shallow swale in which the sagebrush grew to greater size here would be a good place to remount and with this intention crystallized she wound downward among the scattered brush toward the bottom when rounding a particularly high bush she came suddenly face to face with a man leading a horse stick em up whispered the man in a low voice presenting an evillooking sixgun at the pit of her stomach oh bull she cried in low tones for she would have known his voice among thousands you he cried my gawd miss what are you doin here they have come to lynch you bull she told him there are forty or fifty of them lying in the brush around your cabin now they say that you held up the stage and killed mack harber today and you came to warn me his voice sounded far away as though groping for a truth he could not grasp he spoke half to himself you must go away bull she told him you must leave the country he paid no attention to her words i seen a light flash fer a minute in the shack he said an so i reckoned id hev a look around before i come too close thet was why i was walkin when i hearn you i was just agoin to leave blazes here an go ahead an scout aroun a bit mount up now an ill take you home no she said you get away i can get home all rightonly i have to go to town im stopping at marys tonight ill ride with you he insisted she knew him well enough to know that he would never let her ride to town alone through the night and so she mounted as he did and together they followed the swale which ran in the general direction of hendersville you say youre stoppin at marys he asked just for tonight im taking the stage for aldea in the morning im going to kansas city to consult a lawyer they are trying to take the property away from me bull and then she told him all that had transpired since yesterday you dont need a lawyer miss he told her what you need is a twogun man only you dont need him cause you got one already you go back to the ranch an come mornin there wont be airy dude or dudess to try to put their brand on nothin that belongs to you oh bull dont you understand that you mustnt do anything like that she cried it would only make things worse than they are now wong wanted to poison them good of wong interjected bull but we cant make murderers of ourselves just because they are wicked it aint murder to kill a rattlesnake he reminded her but promise me that you wont she urged i wouldnt do nothin you didnt want done miss he said they were nearing town now and could see the lights plainly shining through the windows and doorways youd better go now bull she said not til i get you in town safe he replied but im safe nowit is only a little way and im afraid they might get you if you came in shucks they wont git me now thet i know theyre after me he replied say miss he exclaimed suddenly you aint asked me ef it was me kilt mack she drew herself up proudly ill never ask you bull she said but you wouldnt hev come out to warn me ef youd thought it he suggested she was silent for a moment and then yes i would bull she said in a very little voice he shrugged his shoulders as i told pete ef i had done it or ef i hadnt done it id say i hadnt so whats the use o wastin breath but i shore appreciates what youve done miss and you will go away she asked nom ill stay here i reckon you need me miss from what youve told me so ill hang around a spell ill ride over to the ranch o nights now an then ef you happen to hear a meadowlark settin up late after dark youll know its me but im afraid theyll get you bull if you stay in the country theyre terribly angry she warned him they wont be so keen to find me after theyre sobered up a bit he said with a smile colbys the only one thets got the nerve to go agin guns singlehanded i dont see why he hates you so she said i used to think that he liked you then all i got to say miss is thet you must be plumb blind said bull diana was evidently not so blind as he thought her for she flushed deliciously now you must turn back she said they were almost in town i will because they mustnt see you ridin in with me he replied she reined in her horse and held out her hand to him goodbye bull she said he took her slim hand in his and pressed it strongly goodbyediana said bull she spoke to captain and moved off toward the little town and the man sat there in the darkness watching her retreating form until it was hidden behind a corner of the donovan house chapter xiv bull sees colby bull turned blazes head toward the northeast and rode off slowly in the direction of coyote canyon near the head of which there was a wild and almost inaccessible country just east of hells bend pass there was water there and game for himself with year round pasture for blazes as he rode he hummed a gay little air quite unlike the grim taciturn bull that his acquaintances knew for bull was happyhappier than he had been for months an to think he mused thet she rode out there all alone to warn me an once she said to me bull says she i dont love any man bull thet way but if ever i do hell know it without my tellin him ill do something thet will prove ita girl always does thets what she saysthems her very words i aint never fergot em an i aint never goin toeven ef i dont believe it it was just her good heart that sent her out to warn meshed adone as much fer any of the boys when diana reined in before those assembled on the veranda of the donovan house she was greeted by a gasp of astonishment from mary donovan diana henders child she exclaimed what are ye doin here this time o night sure an l thought ye had gone back to the ranch after hearin ye was in town airlier in the avnin diana dismounted without making any reply and tied captain to the rail in front of the hotel as she mounted the steps to the veranda the younger wainright rose politely corson and the elder wainright nodded the latter grunting gruffly lillian manill pretended that she did not see her i am going to stop here tonight mrs donovan said diana to the proprietress that is if you have room for me an if i didnt id be after makin it replied the latter i wonder if youd mind putting captain up for me bob said diana turning to the wildcat and as the old man stepped from the veranda to comply with her request diana turned and entered the office followed by mary donovan may i have a cup of tea mrs donovan asked the girl i feel all fagged out this evening has been like a terrible nightmare you mane about poor bull asked mary diana nodded they aint back yit said mary but i suppose they got him bad cess to em diana came close to the older woman and whispered they didnt get him i just saw himhe brought me to the edge of town now the lord be praised for that ejaculated mary donovan for shure an if its guilty he is ill not be after belavin it at all at all it looks pretty bad for him mrs donovan said diana but even so i cant believe it of him eitheri wont believe it an no more dont yese darlin advised mary donovan an now make yersilf comfortable an ill have ye a cup o tay in no time as her hostess left the sitting room by one doorway jefferson wainright jr appeared in the other which opened from the office his hat in his hand may i have just a word with you miss henders he asked the girl nodded her assent though none too cordially and wainright entered the little sitting room i cant begin to tell you miss henders he commenced after clearing his throat how badly i feel over this matter that mr corson has explained to us there isnt any question of course about the unfairness and injustice of it but the fact remains that the law is the law and i dont see how you are going to get around it by fighting them it is a matter mr wainright that i do not care to discuss with you said diana rising wait a minute miss henders he begged that wasnt exactly what i wanted to discuss with you though it has a bearing on it there is a way out for you and it was that i wanted to talk over yourfather was a wealthy manyou have been accustomed to everything that money could buy in this country to drop from affluence to penury in a single day is going to be mighty hard for you and it is that i want to save you from it is very kind of you i am sure she told him but i cannot see how you of all people can help me for your own father is a party to this whole transaction i think you are a bit hard on him he said you surely cannot blame him for wanting to drive as good a bargain as possible he is first and last a business man diana only shrugged her shoulders now as i said continued mr wainright there is a way for you to continue to have not only the luxuries you have been accustomed to but many more and at the same time to retain the bar y ranch she looked up at him questioningly yes she said and how by marrying me miss henders you know i love you you know there is nothing i would not do for you there is no sacrifice that i would not willingly and gladly make for you i would die for you dear girl and thank god for the chance diana henders lip curled in scorn it seems to me that i heard you make that very assertion once before mr wainright and in those selfsame wordsthe night before you ran away like the coward you are and left us at the mercy of the apaches if you had half the courage that you have effrontery the lion would appear a mouse by comparison please never mention the subject to me again nor is there any reason why you should ever address me upon any subject good night youll regret this he cried as he was leaving the room youll see if you dont you might have had one friend and a good one on your sidenow you havent any well strip you to the last cent for this and then youll marry some ignorant unwashed cowpuncher and raise brats in a tumbledown shack for the rest of your lifethats what youll do an do yuh know what youll do demanded a squeaky voice behind him jefferson wainright jr turned to see wildcat bob glaring at him from the center of the office floor the young man turned a sickly hue and glanced hurriedly for an avenue of escape but the wildcat was between him and the outer doorway and was reaching for one of his terrible guns with a halfstifled cry wainright sprang into the sitting room and ran to diana seizing her he whirled the girl about so that she was between him and the wildcats weapon my god miss henders dont let him shoot me im unarmedit would be murder save me save me his screams brought his father corson lillian manill and mary donovan to the room where they saw the younger wainright kneeling in abject terror behind dianas skirts whats the meanin of all this yelled the elder wainright your son insulted mehe asked me to marry him said diana let him go bob she directed the wildcat goshamighty miss exclaimed the old man in an aggrieved tone yuh dont mean it do yuh why i just ben honin fer a chanct to clean up this here whole bunch o tinhorns an now that i got an excuse it dont seem right to let it pass by cracky it aint right taint moral thats what it aint please bobive got trouble enoughlet him go slowly wildcat bob returned his gun to its holster shaking his head mournfully and jefferson wainright jr arose and sneaked out of the room as his party returned to the veranda the young mans father was growling and spluttering in an undertone but wildcat bob caught the words law and sheriff whats thet he demanded in his high falsetto the elder wainright cringed and stepped rapidly through the doorway nothin he assured the wildcat i didnt calclate to say nothin at all it was almost morning when the weary and now sobered members of the necktie party returned to town gum smith and several others among whom was wildcat bob met them in the street git him demanded the sheriff no replied colby an i dont savvy it neithersomeone must o put him wise but i got some evidence and he drew a worn leather pouch from his shirt heres one o the bullion bags that was took from the stage yesterdayi found it under his blankets he may o ben there an saw us comin but thet aint likely cause we snuck up mighty keerfulsomeone must o put him wise ah wondeh whoall it could o ben wondered gum smith as the crowd was dispersing wildcat bob caught sight of willie among them hey thar you he called what was you doin with thet bunchi thought you claimed to be a friend o bulls course i am maintained willie stoutly but i haint never seed no one hanged a few hours later diana henders left on the stage for aldea and after she had departed cot son and lillian manill rode back to the ranch taking the wainrights with them while hal colby trotted along beside them he had not seer diana before she left nor had he made any effort to do so we might save a right smart o rouble if we could get everything fixed up before she gets back corson the elder wainright was saying the government patent to the land as well as manills will are in the new york office replied corson ive sent for them they ought to be along now any time i rather expected them on yesterdays stagethey certainly must come in on the next and i imagine she wont get back for a week at leastthat will give us three days then well all go to aldea have the papers drawn up there you turn the money over to us and miss manill and i can get away for new york on the train that nightive had all of this damn country i want hal colby fortunately for his peace of mind did not overhear the conversation it outlined an entirely different plan from that which lillian manill had explained to him only the preceding daya plan which included a hasty wedding and a long honeymoon during which the bar y foreman would taste the sweets of world travel in company with a charming and affectionate bride youre goin to leave me here to run all the risk eh demanded wainright senior oh theres no risk now that that bull fellow is out of the way corson assured him i wish i was sure he was out o the way said wainright dubiously i dont like that fellow a little bit hell never show up again said corson confidently and anyway just as soon as i get to new york ill look up a good man to represent me here and im going to pick the toughest one i can find in new york too im afraid im buyin a heap o trouble with that onethird interest of mine said wainright scratching his head but look what youre going to get out of it corson reminded him ill bet we take a million out of that mine in the next year back at the ranch colby was met by a scowling trio texas pete shorty and idaho wheres bull demanded texas how should i know replied colby gruffly when was i elected his nursegirl you went out after him with a bunch o drunken shorthorns last night accused shorty you know whether you got him or not they didnt git him said colby shortly its a good thing fer you colby thet they didnt said texas pete an another thing we wants our time we aint aaimin to work under no polecat no more i reckon we kin git along without you retorted colby ignoring the insult you kin come back here in a week fer your checksthe boss aint here then well stay til she is said pete suit yerselves replied colby as he turned and walked away the routine of the ranch moved in its accustomed grooves as the days passed though there was noticeably absent the spirit of goodfellowship that marks the daily life of a wellordered cow outfit a little coterie headed by texas pete herded by itself in the vernacular of the west while the remaining punchers grouped themselves about the foreman mealtimes ordinarily noisy with rough but goodnatured badinage had become silent moments to be gotten through as rapidly as possible there was a decorous restraint that was far too decorous among these rough men to augur aught of good it revealed rather than veiled the proximity of open hostilities there was one topic of conversation that was eschewed particularly it would have been the steel to the flint of prejudice which lay embedded in the powder of partisanship bulls name was never mentioned when the factions were together the stage came again to hendersville on the third day after dianas departure it brought mail for the ranch but the vaquero who had been sent from the bar y for it tarried longer at gums placeliquors and cigarsthan he had intended with the result that it was well after supper and quite dark before he delivered it to the office as he approached the yellow rectangle of the open office door it may have been the light shining in his eyes that prevented him seeing the figure of a man beneath the darkness of the cottonwoods that surround the house or the horse standing as silently as its master fifty feet awaya blazedface chestnut with two white hind feet the vaquero entered the office where corson was sitting in conversation with the two wainrights and laid the mail upon the table the new yorker picked it up and ran through it there was a bulky letter addressed to him which he opened heres what weve been waiting for he said glancing quickly through two enclosures and laying them aside to peruse the accompanying letter the man beneath the shadows of the cottonwoods moved closer to the open office doorway keeping well out of the yellow shaft of the lamplight bull had not come down to the bar y from his hiding place in coyote canyon for the purpose of spying upon corson he had hoped against hope that diana might return on the days stage for he wanted a word with her he knew that she could not have made the trip to kansas city and return in so short a time but then she might have changed her mind at aldea and given up the trip it was on this chance that he had come down out of the mountains tonight diana had not returnedhe had convinced himself of thisbut still he tarried these were her enemies it could do no harm to keep an eye on them he did not like the proprietorial airs of corson sitting there in the old mans easy chair and as for the wainrights they too seemed much more at home than suited bull his hand caressed the butt of a sixgun affectionately hell exclaimed corson explosively the addlebrained idiot whats the matter inquired the elder wainright corson was in the midst of the letter he shook it violently and angrily in lieu of anything more closely representative of its writer the chump has dug up some papers that we dont wantwe dont want em in arizona at all hes a new man i thought he had good sense and discretion but he hasnt either hes sendin em out here by registered mail if anything happens to them if they fall into the henders girls hands our goose is cooked he says they put a new aspect on the situation and that he knows ill be delighted to have them they surely will put a new aspect on the situation but i dont want emnot here if id had any sense id have destroyed them before i left new york but whod have thought that they werent safe right in my own office id be delighted to have himby the neck lord suppose theyre lost now they should have been here with this other mail if its registered stuff it may have been delayed just enough to miss the stage at aldea by one train suggested wainright if that is the case itll be along by the next stage what were the papers demanded the elder wainright suspiciously corson hesitated he realized that he had been surprised by his anger into saying too much perhaps i overestimate their value he said they might not do any harm after all what were they insisted mr wainright oh they were reports that show the tremendous value of the new vein in the mine lied corson glibly wainright sank back in his chair with a sigh of relief oh if thats all they was we dont need to worry none about them he said we as good as got the place now well drive over to aldea tomorrer and fix things up eh i think ill wait for the next mail said corson those reports might not do any harm but id rather be here when they come and see that no one else gets hold of them mebby youre right assented wainright he arose yawning and stretched i calclate to go to bed he said i think ill do the same said his son i hope miss manill is feeling better by morning oh shell be all right said corson just a little headache good night im coming along too they lighted lamps blew out the one in the office and departed for their rooms the man in the shadows turned slowly toward his horse but he had taken only a few steps when he halted listening someone was approaching he glanced through the darkness in the direction of the sounds which came out of the night along the pathway from the bunkhouse stepping quickly behind the bole of a large tree bull waited in silence presently he saw dimly the figure of a man and as it came nearer the starlight revealed its identity it was colby like himself colby waited in the shadows of the treeswaited silently watching the dead black of the office windows the silence was tangible it was so absolutely dominant reigning supreme in a world of darkness bull wondered that the other did not hear his breathing he marvelled at the quietness of blazeseven the roller in his bit lay silent but it could not last much longerthe horse was sure to move in a moment and colby would investigate the result was a foregone conclusion there would be shooting bull did not want to shoot colbynot now there were two reasons one however would have been enoughthat diana henders was thinking of marrying the man and then the silence was broken very slightly only was it broken a suspicion of a sound came from the interior of the house and following it a dim light wavering mysteriously upon the office walls growing steadily brighter until the room was suddenly illuminated from where he now stood bull could not see the interior of the office but he knew that someone carrying a lamp had come down the stairway along the hall and entered the office then he saw colby move forward and step lightly to the veranda and an instant later the office door swung open revealing lillian manill in a diaphanous negligee bull saw colby seize the girl strain her to him and cover her lips with kisses then the girl drew her lover into the room and closed the door with a grimace of disgust bull walked to blazes mounted him and rode slowly away now there was only one reason why he could not kill colby yet chapter xv now go it was wednesday again four horses sweat streaked toiled laboriously to drag the heavy coach up the north side of hells bend pass it was a tough pull even with a light loadone that really demanded six horses and would have had six in the old daysand today the load was light there was but a single passenger she sat on the drivers box with bill gatlin with whom she was in earnest discussion i tell you i dont believe he did it she was saying ill never believe that he did it and im mighty glad that he got away gatlin shook his head there aint no one got a better right to say that than you has miss he said fer twas your gold as was stole an your messenger as was shot up but nevertheless an howsumever i got my own private opinion what im keepin to myself thet it was bull all right as done it id just like to see this black coyote once said the girl id know if it was bull or not they aint no chanct today miss gatlin told her they aint no gold shipment today unless im mighty mistook dont he ever make a mistake asked the girl never haint yet miss diana relapsed into silence her thoughts reverting to her interview with the kansas city attorney he had not held out very roseate hopes by means of litigationlong and expensiveshe might after a number of years get a small portion of her fathers share of the business she had better take a cash settlement if she could get one he thought a hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars in the hand would be much better in his opinion than a long drawnout suit that could be nothing better than an expensive gamble with the odds against her but i wont i wont i wont be robbed she ejaculated beneath her breath hows that miss inquired bill gatlin was you speakin to me i must have been thinking aloud she said smiling what a long pull this is bill were nigh to the summit he replied pulling in his team to breathe them for a moment on the shoulder of wagon mountain overlooking the south stretch of hells bend pass road two men sat their horses amidst a clump of chaparral that effectually hid them from the road though they could see nearly its entire length from the summit to the gap at the bottom presently one of them spoke here it comes he said he was a swarthy powerfully built mexican somewhere in his thirties gregorio the bandit his companion was adjusting a black silk handkerchief across his face in such a way as to entirely hide his features there were two small holes cut in the handkerchief opposite its wearers eyes which through them were fixed upon the stage as it topped the pass and started downward upon its rapid and careening descent toward the gap and hendersville come said gregorio and wheeled his horse about his companions mount moved suddenly before the handkerchief was finally adjusted and as the man reached for his reins the thing fell away from his face revealing it it was bull a second attempt was more successful and then the men rode down the sheer mountainside keeping just below the crest upon the south side and hidden from the view of the driver and the passenger upon the stage their horses moved with extreme care and without haste for the way was precarious occasionally requiring that the horses sit upon their haunches and slide for short distances until they found footing again further down the riders seemed unperturbed either by the dangers of the descent or fear of being late at their rendezvous suggesting habitude with the work in hand in a dense growth of scrub just above the gap they tied their horses continuing on foot the stage lumbered downward rocking from side to side diana held tight and said nothing she had ridden with bill gatlin before many times he glanced at her out of the corner of his eye this aint nothin he said as though in answer to a remonstrance on her part diana knew what was coming she had heard it many times no siree continued bill this aint nothin why youd orter ben with me one night when i was on the denver run in the ol days afore the railroads spoiled the country the trail crossed plumb over the top of a mountain twarnt no road twarnt nothin but a trail i hed the of stage plumb full an passengers ahangin onto the boot it was pitch darkthe doggonest darkest night i ever see couldnt see airy wheelhorse only ways i knowed i hed any horses was when their shoes struck fire on the stony parts o the road jest afore we struck the top o the mountain they was the worst cloudbust i ever did see them horses had to swim the last hundred rods to the top o thet mountain an the of stage was bobbin aroun so on the waves thet eight of the passengers got seasick but thet want nothin when we come to the top i found the roadd ben all washed away they want no more road n a jackrabbit but i was acarryin the mail jest like i be now an i hed to git through it was a high mountain an tolably steep but not no trees so i see there want only one thing to do an thet was to go down road or no road so right there on the top o thet mountain i threw the leather into em an headed em fer denver an down we goes fastern ever i rid afore or since the wheelers a jumpin to keep out o the way o the stage an the leaders a jumpin to keep out o the way o the wheelers well sir we was agoin so fast thet the fust thing i knowed the friction hed melted the nut offen the nigh front wheel an away went thet wheel hellbentferelection down the mountain but it couldnt keep up with the stage an purty soon it was left behind but the stage was agoin so fast thet it never missed thet wheel at all an purty soon off came the off rear wheel an thet wheel couldnt keep up though i could see it was doin its best outen the corner o my eye well sir twant long afore tother hind wheel came off but we was goin about twict as fast now as when the fust wheel came off an that of stage jest skimmed along on one wheel a dinged sight smoother an it ever done on four when we were about to the bottom off come the last wheel an then thinks i fer sure we gotta quit an we aint to denver yit but wed got so much momentum by this time thet the last wheel didnt make no more difference then the others them horses jest drug thet stage out behind them like a comet does its tail an on we went streakin down thet mountain an five mile out onto the flat afore the stage hit the ground an then o course we hed to stop it was too bad i tell you i felt plumb sore i hadnt never ben off schedule sence i took the run then all of a suddint says one o the passengers look back yender bill says he look whats comin an i looked an there come them four wheels atearin across the flat straight fer us well to make a long story short they peters out right beside the stage an with the help o the passengers an some extra nuts we got em back on where they belonged an pulled into denver two hours ahead o time but i tell you miss thet was some ride id hate to hev to take it again why hands up put em up the stage had slowed down for the rough road through the gap when two men with muffled faces stepped before the leaders covering the driver and his lone passenger with wickedlooking sixguns diana henders sat as one turned to stone her eyes fixed upon the tall fine figure of the leading high wayman a little gust of wind moved the handkerchief that covered his face so that she saw or she thought she saw a scar upon the square chin she was not afraid it was not fearphysical fear that held her motionlessit was worse than that it was the paralyzing terror of the heart and soul was it bull could it be bill but dear god could she be mistaken in the familiar lines of that figureevery movement every gesture proclaimed the numbing truth he had not spoken she was glad of that for she wanted something upon which to hang a doubt the second man had given the brief commands that he was gregorio she had no doubt throw down the mail pouch he commanded and bill gatlin threw it down the taller man took it and went to the rear of the stage out of sight five minutes later gregorio commanded them to drive on that was all the thing had not consumed six minutes but in that brief time the structure of dianas life had been shaken to its foundations a new a terrible truth had engulfed hera truth that should have upborne her upon a wave of exaltation and happiness now dragged her down into the vortex of a whirlpool of selfloathing and misery they rode on in silence for a few minutes bill gatlin cracking his long whipabove the ears of the leaders galloping smoothly over a comparatively level road doggone he said presently its gettin too almighty reglar to suit me though i reckon as how i mought git lonesome if i wasnt held up oncet in a while but you hed your wish missyou got to see the black coyote all right and now what do you think is it or isnt it bull diana henders bit her lip of course it was not bull she said looked powerful like him to me said gatlin as they drew up in front of the donovan house the usual idlers came forth to learn what new element this their sole link to civilization had infused into their midst they greeted diana none the less cordially because she was the only passenger and the stage had brought no new interest to hendersville held up agin announced bill some on you better go an tell gumhe might want to deputize someone immediately the crowd was interested they asked many questions they want much to it said bill gatlin bein as how they want no gold he took the mail i reckon if you was lookin fer any letters you wont git them a man from the bar y spoke up thet new york feller up to the ranch was lookin fer a important piece o mail he said he sent me down special to git it hey whats this demanded another peering into the interior of the coach heres yer mail bag bill alyin right in here he dragged it out and exhibited to the others theys somethin wrong with itits ben cut open said another pointing to a slit in the leather then the postmaster came up and rescued the sack the crowd followed him to the general store in which the postoffice was conducted here the postmaster assisted by the crowd went through the contents of the sack course i caint tell whats missin he said only they aint no registered letter fer mr corson diana henders had gone immediately into the donovan house as quickly as she could clamber from the stage after it had come to a stop and mary donovan had taken her into the privacy of her sitting room for the cup o tay that diana had been looking forward to for the past couple of hours here she told the motherly irish woman the details of her trip to kansas city and the quandary she was in as to what procedure to follow in her future dealings with corson if i had anything to fight with id fight she exclaimed but im all aloneeven the law seems to be on their side against justice shure an its not all alone ye are mary donovan assured her what wid all the friends ye have that would fight fer ye at the drop o the hat faith theyd run thim tinhorns out o the country an ye give the word i know assented the girl and i appreciate what the boys would do for me but it cant be done that way dad always stood for law and order and it wouldnt do for me to sponsor illegal methods yeve got to fight the divil wid fire said mary diana made no reply she sat sipping her tea her expression one of troubled sadness but she was not thinking of those who would take her property from her nor of their unfair methods mary donovan was moving about the room tidying up diana set her empty cup upon the rickety center table which supported an oil lamp a bible a red plush photograph album and a gilded conch shell and sighed mrs donovan glanced at her out of the corner of her eye and guessed shrewdly that there was something more than new yorkers troubling her presently she came and stood in front of the girl what is it mavourneen she asked be after tellin mary donovan diana rose half turned her head away and bit her lower lip in an effort to hide or suppress a short quick intaking of the breath that was almost a gasp the stage was held up again today she said mastering herself and turning wideeyed toward the older woman i saw themi saw them both yis said mary donovan but it wasntit wasnt he it wasnt mary donovan and diana throwing herself upon the broad motherly bosom burst into tears through which she gasped an occasional it wasnt it wasnt shure now it wasnt soothed mary an the first wan thatll be after sayin it wasll wish hed nivir bin born an even if it was diana henders theres many a good mans gone wrong an come right again why look at that ould fool wildcat bob they do be sayin he was a road agent hisself thirty year ago an hes killed so many men hes lost count o em he has but now look at him a quiet an paceable ould man an a good citizen whin he aint full o barbwire which aint often diana dried her tears through a smile youre very fond of bob arent you she asked run along wid ye now exclaimed mary donovan smiling coyly i think bob would make you a good husband continued diana and you really need a man around here why dont you marry him i know hes anxious enough marry him indade sniffed mary the ould fools stricken dumb ivery time hes alone wid me if iver hes married it is its the girl thatll be havin to pop the question they were interrupted by a rap on the sitting room door it was the vaquero from the bar y who had come down for the mail bill gatlin told me you was here miss he said do you want me to tell colby to send the buckboard down for yore i left captain here thanks replied diana and as soon as i change my clothes ill ride back to the ranch shall i wait fer you he inquired no thanks i dont know how long ill be she told him but if pete is there you might ask him to ride out and meet me a halfhour later diana rode out of hendersville on captain along the winding dusty road bordered by interminable sage and greasewood that stretched off in undulating billows of rolling land to the near mountains on the north and away to the south as far as the eye could reach where the softened outlines of other mountains rose mysterious through the haze the low sun castlong shadows toward the east those of herself and her mount transformed into a weird creature of brobdingnagian proportions mincing along upon preposterous legs the inhabitants of a prairiedog village watched her approach with growing suspicions scampering at last to the safety of their catacombian retreat all but a single patriarch and two owls who watched her from the safe proximity of burrow mouths until she had passed drear and desolate the aspect of tie scene perhaps but t diana i was home and a tear came tip her eye as she thought that in a day or a week shy might be leaving it forever her home and they were driving her away from it stealing it from her her home that her father had built for her motherthat he had planned that diana should have after he had gone the wickedness of it the injustice that was what rankledthe injustice she dashed away the tear with an angry gesture she would not be dispossessed she would fight mary donovan was right it was no sin to light the devil with fire it was at this moment that she saw a horseman approaching her from the direction of the ranch her eyes long accustomed to keen observation and to vast expanses recognized the man minutes before his features were discernible and a little cloud crossed her brow it was not texas pete as she had hoped but hal colby perhaps it was for the best she would have to see him sometime and tell him as he approached her she saw that there was no welcoming smile on his face which wore a troubled expression but his greeting was cordial hello di he cried why didnt you let me know that you was comin today there was no way to let you know of course she replied you might have guessed that i would be back as soon as i could tom jest got in from town an told me you was comin i hurried out to head you off you dont want to come to the ranch now it wouldnt be no ways pleasant for you why she demanded the wainrights is there for one thing he said drawing rein in front of her she set her firm little jaw and rode around him i am going home she said i wouldnt be foolish di he insisted itll only make more trouble they as good as got the place now we cant fight em it wouldnt get us nowheres lemme see what i kin get em to do fer you theyre willin to give you enough to live decent on if youre reasonable an ill git the most i kin fer you but if you go to fightin em they wont give you nothin theyll never give me anything she cried id never accept anything from them but ill take and keep whats mine and my friends will help me youll only git yourself an your friends in a peck o trouble he told her listen hal she hesitated stumbling a little over the speech she had been rehearsing there is something i want to say to you you asked me to marry you i told you that if you would wait a little while i thought that i could say yes i cant say yes hal ever for i dont love you im sorry but the only fair thing to do was tell you he looked a bit crestfallen and disconcerted for though he had realized that it would be poor policy to press his suit now that she was penniless it injured his pride to be told that he could not have won her in any event and suddenly came the realization that money or no money he wanted her very much his infatuation for lillian manill was revealed in all its sordidnessit was not love all the money in the world all the clothes in new york would not make lillian manill as desirable as diana henders colby was a crude uneducated man yet he discerned in diana henders a certain quality far beyond his powers of analysis that placed her in a sphere to which lillian manill and her kind might never hope to aspire he knew now that he wanted diana henders for herself and lillian manill for her money and for that coarse feminine attraction that certain types of women have for coarse men he lived in a more or less lawless country and a more or less lawless age so it was not strange that there should have crept into his mind the thought that he might possess them both naturally it would be only the part of good business to possess lawfully the one with the money it was only the flash of a thought though and he quickly put it aside im plumb sorry dl he said but of course you know your own business that was all he said but he did a great deal of thinking and the more he thought the more he realized how much he wanted her now that she seemed least accessible his face wore an expression such as diana henders had never seen upon it beforehe was not the laughing goodnatured hal that she had liked very much and almost loved there was something almost sinister about him and she wondered if being disappointed in love had this effect upon men how is everything at the ranch since ive been away she asked presently soso he replied some o the hands want to quit theyre waitin til you come to git their checks who are they pete shorty an idaho he replied theyd aben the fust to be let out after the change come anyhow so it dont make no difference you planned to stay on as foreman she asked shore why not i got to work for someone dont i she made no reply and they rode on in silence toward the ranch he had given up trying to dissuade her let them do their own dirty work he thought as they neared the ranch a horseman emerged from the yard and came toward them at a run amidst a cloud of dust that obscured the ranch and ail else behind him it was texas pete he brought his horse to its haunches beside her and wheeled the animal about on its hind feet i jest got in miss he said an tom told me that you had sent word in that i was to meet you im plumb sorry i was late each man ignored the other as completely as though he had not existed i understand you want to quit pete said the girl you and shorty and idaho pete looked down shamefacedly we was aaimin to he said i wish youd come up to the office and bring shorty and idaho with you when we get home she said i want to talk with you all right miss the three finished the ride in silence diana dismounted with them at the corral and leaving her horse for pete to unsaddle walked toward the office as she approached the doorway she saw that there were several people ire the room and when she crossed the threshold found herself face to face with corson lillian manill and the two wainrights corson nodded and he and the younger wainright rose good evening miss henders said corson back safely i see she ignored his greeting and stood for a moment silently eying them through narrowed lids her widebrimmed sombrero sat straight and level above slightly contracted brows a tendril of hair waved softly over one temple where it had escaped the stiff confinement of the heavy hat but it did not tend to soften the light in those cold steady eyes reflecting the bitterness of her resentment toward these four about her hips a cartridgefilled belt supported a heavy gunno toy such as women sometimes effect but a grim and suggestive its grip was shiny with usage and the blue was worn from the steel in places i know little about law mr corson she said without prelude i have lived almost all my life a long way beyond either the protection or the menace of law we do not bother much about it out here but we understand moral rights perfectly we know what justice is and we have our own ways of enforcing it we have similar ways of protecting our just rights as well these means i intend to invoke against you all of you who have come here with the intention of robbing me of what is rightly mine though i owe you no consideration it is my duty to warn you that our methods in such matters are usually sudden and always unpleasant i shall give you mr corson and miss manill an hour to leave the premisesthe buckboard will be ready then mr wainright and his son have five minutes as they have no excuse whatsoever for being here now go chapter xvi common criminals an amused smile curled mr corsons unpleasant mouth mr wainright senior bobbed to his feet though through no belated urge of chivalry lillian manill rose languidly pretending to suppress a simulated yawn with the backs of her white fingers young mr wainright shuffled uneasily from one foot to the other i am afraid miss henders said corson that you do not quite grasp the situation you it is you who fail to grasp it mr corson snapped diana and please remember that you have only an hour in which to pack corson dropped his suavity see here he exclaimed ive fooled along with you as much as im going to youre the one whos going to get off this place you havent a right on earth here you dont own a stick or a stone a hoof or a tail the length or breadth of the bar y now you go and you go quick or youll land in jail where you belong for the threats youve made i imagine youll learn something about the law then how come inquired a voice from the doorway and simultaneously three figures appeared upon the veranda you sent for us miss and here we are continued texas pete an i reckon we arriv about the right time fer the party opined shorty i craves the first dance with that dude with the funny pants said idaho staring at corson boys said diana these people are trying to rob me of my ranch the mine and all the cattle i have given mr corson and miss manill an hour to leave the premises idaho i wish that you would see that they get away on time and drive them or better have willie drive them to town mr wainright and his son had five minutes in which to leave shorty they have wasted three of them can you help them to get away on schedule whee wheed shorty watch my smokeand their dust fan yerselves gents and he sprang into the room circling the wainrights to come upon them from the rear true to the instincts of the cowman the elder wainright had arguments upon his tongueyou could see them in his eye paradoxical as it may soundbut he permitted them to expire voiceless and took to his heels followed closely by his son jefferson wainright senior had been run off the bar y upon another occasion and he had not relished the experience he moved now with great rapidity and singleness of purpose in the direction of the corrals his son at his heels and shorty inconveniently close behind to mr wainrights partial relief shorty had as yet indulged in no target practice but it might come at any moment sympathetic perspiration streamed down the red face of wainright of worcester blankets he almost breathed a sigh of relief when he reached the corrals but a sudden thought froze him with terror they could not have more than a minute left it would be impossible to hook up their team in that time as he climbed through the bars he tried to explain that impossibility to shorty ride em then admonished their escort but we have no saddles expostulated the younger wainright no agreed shorty you aint got nothin but a minute an you wont have thet long i commences shootin when the minutes upan i aint agoin to shoot fer fun i ben awaitin fer this chanct fer months frantically the elder wainright dragged a reluctant broncho by the halter got him outside the corral and struggled to clamber to his back it was an utter failure then he seized the rope again and tugging and pulling started for the gate his son more successful had succeeded in mounting the other animal and as he trotted past his father he whacked that gentlemans unwilling companion on the rump with the bight of his halter rope the effects were thrilling and immediate the broncho leaped forward upset mr wainright galloped over him and dashed out the gate into the vast unfenced immensity five seconds announced shorty mr wainright scrambled to his feet and started after the broncho he passed through the bar y gate behind his son and heir with one second to spare disgusted shorty slipped his gun back into its holster now keep goin he told them an dont never nary one of you come back gosh ding it he soliloquized as he walked back toward the office i wisht shed only agave em four minutes he was suddenly confronted by colby running and out of wind what you ben loin demanded the foreman i jest seen the tail end of it from the cookhouse winder wot in ell do you mean by it anyhow eh shorty eyed him up and down insolently i aint got no time fer you colby he said im gettin my orders from the boss if she tells me to run any ornery critters offen the ranch im here to run em off sabe you mean miss henders told you to run the wainrights off demanded colby i reckon you aint deef and shorty continued his way toward the office colby followed him he found texas pete and idaho standing in the room diana was seated in her fathers easy chair whats the meaning of this business di demanded colby did you tell shorty to run the wainrights off i ran them off hal replied the girl i only asked shorty to see that they went i have told mr corson and miss manill to go too idaho will see that they get to town safely you must be crazy exclaimed colby theyll have the law on you i am not crazy hal i may have been a little blind but i am far from crazymy eyes are open now open wide enough for me to be able to recognize my friends from my enemies what do you mean he demanded noting the directly personal insinuation i mean hal that any of my men who would contemplate working for those people after they had robbed me cant work for me pete has your check he is acting foreman until bull returns her chin went up proudly as she made the statement colby was stunned he took the check in silence and turned toward the door where he stopped and faced her bull wont never come back he said less its with a halterround his neck the other three men looked toward diana for an intimation of her wishes but she only sat silently tapping the toe of a spurred boot upon the navajo rug at her feet colby turned once more and passed out into the gathering dusk a halfhour later wild bill otherwise and quite generally known as willie jogged dustily townward with maurice b corson lillian manill and their baggage halfway there they overtook the wainrights the elder riding the single horse which his son had given up to him while the younger plodded along in the powdery dust corson told willie to stop and take them both into the buckboard not on your life said willie i gits my orders from the boss an she didnt say nothin about pickin up no dudes giddap later that evening a select gathering occupied a table at one side of gums barroom there were the wainrights mr maurice b corson miss lillian manill hal colby and gum smith all but gum seemed out of sorts but then he was the only one of them who had not been run off a ranch we have the law on our side mr sheriff corson was saying and all we ask is your official backing i realize that the first thing to do is get rid of the ruffians in her employ and then we can easily bring her to terns the worst of them is this man bull but now that he is practically an outlaw it should be comparatively easy to get him i have arranged for an exceptionally large gold shipment from the mine on the next stage and i have taken pains not to keep the matter too secret the news is almost certain to reach him through the usual channels and should serve as an exceptional bait to lure him into another attempted holdup of the stage you can then be on hand in hiding with a posse and should you fail to get him alive it will be all the better for society at large if you get him dead do you understand me that aint no way to go about it interrupted colby you cant hide nowhere within five miles o the gap without them two hombres knowin it now you just forget that scheme an leave it to me you an your posse keep away from the gap just leave it to me ah think hals about right agreed gum smith yoall doan know them two they shore is foxy why jes look at all the times ahve ben after em yo jes leave it to hal here an he shorell git em all right said corson and then we can get the other three later some way lure them into town one by one an well i dont need to tell you gentlemen whats necessary only dont forget that theyre worth a thousand dollars apiece to meif they cant bother us any more worn out by the excitement of the day diana retired to her room shortly after the lonely evening meal she had been keyed up to a high pitch of nervous excitement for hours and now that she had been relaxed the reaction came leaving her tired and melancholy she was almost too tired to undress and so she threw herself into an easy chair and sat with her head thrown back and her eyes closed the window of her room overlooking the ranch yard toward the corrals was wide open to the cooling summer air the lamp burning on her reading table cast its golden light upon her loosened hair and regular profile outside a figure moved cautiously around the house until it stood among the trees beneath the windowthe figure of a man who looking up could just see the outlines of the girls face above the sill he watched her for a moment and then glanced carefully about as though to assure himself that there was none other near presently faintly the notes of a meadowlark rose softly upon the night air dianas eyes flashed open she listened intently a moment later the brief sweet song was repeated the girl rose to her feet gathered her hair quickly into a knot at the back of her head and ran down the stairway along the hall into the office she walked quickly her heart beating a trifle wildly to the door without hesitation she opened it and stepped out into the night below her stood a tall man with broad shoulders bull she exclaimed in a low whisper the man swept his broad sombrero from his head good evening senorita he said it is not senor bullit is gregorio diana henders stepped back she had removed her belt and gun so sure she had been that it was bull and such confidence she had in him that she had not given a thought to her unarmed condition what better protection could any girl demand than just bull what do you want here gregorio she demanded the mexican perceived the girls surprise saw her draw back and grinned it did not offend him that she might be afraid of him he had become what he was by inspiring fear in others and hoe was rather proud of itproud of being an outlaw proud of being hunted by the gringoes whom he knew held his courage and his gunhand if not himself in respect do not be afraid senorita he said i was sent to you by senor bull with a message he held out a long flat envelope you are to read it and hide it where the others will not find it he says that you will know how to make use of it she took the proffered parcel why did not senor bull come himself she asked how should i know senorita he replied perhaps he thought that you would not want the black coyote to come here he knew that you recognized him today he saw it in your eyes she was silent a moment as though weighing the wisdom of a reply to his statement but she made none is that all gregorio she asked that is all senorita then thank you and goodbye thank senor bull too and tell him that his job is waiting for himwhen he can come back gregorio swept his hat low and turned back into the shadows diana entered the office and closed the door going directly to her room she took a chair beneath the readinglamp and examined the outside of the envelope gregorio had given her it was addressed to maurice b corson how had bull come by it but of course she knewit was a piece of the mail that had come into his possession through the robbing of the stage the girl shuddered and held it away from her she saw that the envelope had been opened bull had done that she sat looking at the thing for a long time could she bring herself to read the contents it had not been meant for herto read it then would be to put herself on a par with the black coyote she would be as much a thief as he the only right and proper thing to do was to get the letter into corsons hands as quickly as possibleshe could not be a party to bulls crime she laid it almost threw it in fact upon the table as though it were an unclean thing and sat for a long time in deep thought occasionally her eyes returned to the letter the thing seemed to hold a malignant fascination for her what was in it it must concern her or bull would not have sent it to her she would send it to corson the first thing in the morning bull would not ask her to read something that did not concern her she rose and commenced to remove her clothing once or twice as she passed the table she stopped and looked at the envelope and at last in her night robe as she went to blow out the last lamp she stood for a full minute staring at the superscription again she argued that bull would not have sent it to her had it been wrong for her to read it then she extinguished the light and got into bed for an hour diana henders tossed about sleepless the envelope upon the reading table haunted her it had no business there it belonged to maurice b corson if it were to be found in her possession she could be held as guilty as the robber who took it from the united states mail pouch they could send her to jail somehow that thought did not frighten her at all what was in it it must be something concerning the property they were trying to steal rom her they were thieves one was almost justified in taking any steps to frustrate their dishonest plans suddenly she recalled what mary donovan had said youve got to fight the devil with fire and then diana henders flung the covers from her and swung her feet to the floor a moment later she had lighted the lamp there was no more hesitation she took up the envelope and extracted its contents which consisted of three papers the first she examined was a brief letter of transmission noting the enclosures and signed by a clerk in corsons office the second was john manills willthe later will that corson had told her did not exist she read it through carefully word for word it was a duplicate of the last will her father had made except for the substitution of elias henders name as beneficiary the clause leaving the property to their joint heirs in the event of her fathers prior death followed suddenly diana experienced a sensation of elation and freedom such as had not been hers since her fathers death she could fight them nowshe had something to fight with and lillian manill could claim only what was legally hers an even division would entail unpleasant complications of administration but at least they could not take tier share from her they might sell theirs they might and probably would sell it to the wainrights which would be horrible of course but she would stand her ground and get her rights no matter who owned the other half she laid the will aside and picked up the third paper it was a letter in her uncles familiar handwriting addressed to her father dear el in the event that i go first i want to ask you to lock after lillian for me at least until she is married since her mothers death she has no one but me and naturally i feel not only a certain responsibility for her but a real affection that is almost paternal since she was but a year old when i married her mother she has never known any other father her own having been killed before she was born although she knows the truth concerning her parentage i think she looks upon me as a father and if i am unable to do so i know that you will provide for her i did not mention her in my will because our understanding included only our legal heirs or i should say heir now since diana is the only one left and as she will inherit all our property eventually i hope that you will pass this request on to her which i shalt leave attached to my will affectionately john diana sat with staring eyes fixed upon the letter in her handand she had almost sent these papers back to corson she shuddered as she thought of the narrow escape she had had why they were no better than common criminals and she was sole heir to the bar y she did not think of the gold mine or the value of the great herds and the broad acres she thought only of the bar y as something that she lovedas home now no one could take it away from her and yet she was not happy there was a little rift within the lutebull was an outlaw and who else was there than bull upon whom she might depend for guidance and advice in the handling of her affairs he was a good cattlemanher father had always said that and had had confidence in his judgment and ability his one fault they had thought had been his drinking and this she felt intuitively he had overcome of his loyalty there had never been any doubt until the whisperings of the ugly rumors that had connected him with the robberies of the stage these she had consistently refused to believeeven to the point of denying the evidence of her own eyes but gregorio had definitely confounded the remnants of her hopes yet still she thought of bull as her sole resourceeven now she had confidence in him she could not fathom the mental processes that permitted her mind to dwell upon him without loathing or contemptbut after all was she being influenced by the dictates of her mind she shrank from contemplation of the alternative yet it persistently obtruded itself upon her reveries if her mind refused to fly to the defense of bull then it must be her heart that championed him what reason would not do love had accomplished she flushed at the thought and tried to put it aside for it was impossible it could not be that she diana henders could love an outlaw and a criminal no she must put bull out of her mind forever and with this resolve mingling with her tears she fell asleep chapter xvii the black coyote with the coming of morning diana henders mind had to some extent at least emerged from the chaos of conflicting emotions that had obstructed reasonable consideration of her plans for the immediate future it had been her intention to ride forthwith to hendersville and confront corson and lillian with the proofs of their perfidy but now saner reflection counseled more rational procedure the law now was all upon her side the proofs were all in her hands it was beyond their power to harm her she would continue in the even tenor of her ways directing the affairs of the ranch and mine as though they did not exist when they made a move she would be prepared to meet it she spent an hour before breakfast in the office writing diligently and then she sent for texas pete when he arrived she handed him an envelope take this to aldea pete she said and mail it on the first eastbound train i cant trust to the stageit is held up too oftenand pete i am sending you because i know that i can trust you to get to aldea as quickly as you can without letting anything interfere it means a great deal to me pete ill git it there said texas pete and she knew that he would ten minutes later she glanced through the doorway of the kitchen where she was talking with wong and saw a cloud of dust streaking swiftly northward toward hells bend pass across country in an airline roads and trails were not for such as texas pete when speed was paramount the day occupied by the normal duties of the ranch passed without unusual incident there was no word from corson the next day came brought texas pete back from aldea and went its way with the infinite procession of other yesterdays and still no word from corson by this time diana was about convinced that the new yorker appreciating what the theft of his letter must mean to him had abandoned his scheme and that doubtless the stage that arrived in hendersville today would carry him and his accomplice back to aldea and an eastbound train her mind was occupied with such satisfactory imaginings that morning when the office doorway was darkened by the figure of a man looking up she saw gum smith standing with hat in hand monin miss he greeted her diana nodded wondering what gum smith could be doing on the bar y a place where he had always been notoriously unwelcome ahve came on a mos onpleasant duty miss he explained as sheriff o this yere county it is mah duty to serve yoall with notice to vacate this property by noon tomorrer as the rightful an lawful owners wishes to occupy same you mean mr corson and miss manill inquired diana sweetly yes miss an they hopes they wont be no trouble theys willin to do the right thing by yo ef yo moves off peaceablelike an pronto would you mind taking a note to mr corson for me she asked i think i can convince him that he is making a mistake gum smith would be glad to accommodate her he said so but he also advised her as a friend of her father to make her preparations for early departure since mr corsons patience was exhausted and he had determined to take drastic action to possess himself of the ranch as miss manills agent when mr maurice b corson read that note an hour later he swore in a most unseemly manner he did not divulge its contents to the wainrights but he went into executive session with gum smith and hal colby from which he did not emerge for an hour a short time later the sheriff accompanied by a dozen deputies rode out of hendersville and some time thereafter corson lillian manill and the wainrights drove off in the latters buckboard which diana had sent in to them the morning after their hasty departure from the bar y the ranch was deserted that afternoon except for a couple of laborers the white cook at the cookhouse and wong at the residence texas pete and his vaqueros were spread over a vast principality occupied with the various duties of their calling idaho had been left at home in accordance with timehonored custom to act as body guard for diana should she wish to ride abroad which she had wished to do and they were both off to the southeast somewhere in the direction of the johnson ranch it was a lazy afternoon the air vibrated with heat but in one corner of the kitchen far from the stove which was now out there was a cool corner or rather one less like inferno here stood a long table that had once graced the dining room and upon it at full length supine lay wong asleep his long pipe with its tiny brass bowl still clutched in onedepending hand he was aroused by the sound of voices in the front of the house he opened his eyes sat up and listened there was a womans voice among those of men but it was not the voice of mlissee dli wong arose and walked toward the office he stopped where he could observe the interior without being observed his slanting oriental eyes narrowed at what they saw there were corson and miss manill the two wainrights and gum smith corson was going through elias henders desk as though it belonged to him presently after having examined many papers he evidently found what he wanted for there was a look of relief upon his face as he stuffed them into an inside pocket of his coat after a superficial glance the elder wainright was continually glancing through the doorway with an air of extreme nervousness you think it is perfectly safe sheriff he demanded of course it is wainright snapped corson weve got the law on our side i tell you and enough men out there to back it up as soon as her men find we mean business they wont bother us as long as she isnt here to egg them on and most of them would just as soon work for us anyway when they find colby is coming back as foremana lot of them are his friends i dont see why colby didnt come along with us now grumbled wainright he wanted to wait until we were settled in our ownership and then we could hire whom we pleased as foreman said corson i see how he feels about it and it will help to make him stronger with the men and with the neighbors if he hasnt taken any part in the eviction itll be better for us in the long run for we are going to need all the friends we can get in the county i am afraid we are agreed wainright i hope you will fire that texas pete and the ones they call shorty an idaho the very fast thing you do i dont like em thats about the first thing i intend doing as soon as they get in replied corson just now wed better look up that damned insolent chink and tell him how many are going to be here for dinner or supper or whatever they call it out here wong tiptoed silently and swiftly to the kitchen where lillian manill found him a moment later and imparted her orders to him an hour later texas pete rode into the ranch yard with his men he was met at the corrals by a fellow he recognized as an habitue of gums placeone ward by name evenin said ward evenin replied texas pete wotinell are you doin here ward they wants you shorty an idaho up to the office who wants us miss henders an the people shes sold out to sold out hell exclaimed pete go on up an ask em i shore will come on shorty idaho must be aroun the bunkhouse somewheres the two men started for the office at the bunkhouse they looked for idaho but he was not there so they went on without him as they approached the house they saw three men lolling on the veranda outside the office door they were not bar y men inside they saw corson sitting at the desk he motioned them to enter come in boys he said pleasantly as they entered the three men behind them rose and drew their sixguns and at the same instant three others just within the office covered them with theirs put em up they were advised and texas pete and shorty being men of discretion put them up while they had them up one of the gentlemen in their rear relieved them of their weapons now look here boys said corson not unpleasantly we have no quarrel with you and we dont want any but youre rather quick with your guns and we took this means of insuring an amicable interview mr wainright miss manill and i are now owners of the bar y ranch miss henders realizing that she had no claim has vacated the premises and turned them over to us we shall not need your services any longer we shall give you a months wages and escort you as far as town where your weapons will be turned over to you but i want to warn you that you are not to return to the bar y if you do i shall see that the law takes its full course with you wheres miss henders demanded texas pete she has left the ranch replied corson i do not know her exact plans but i think she went directly to aldea to take the train for the east i dont know her exact plans neither said texas pete but i know you are a damn liar you got the drop on me an shorty an we goes to town as you says but if the rest that you have told us aint straight were comin back agin an when we do its agoin to be goshalmighty onpleasant fer dudes in these parts sabe if you show your faces around here again youll be shot on sight said corson weve got the men and the money to run this ranch as we see fit and we mean business the old disgraceful lawless days are about over in this country and there wont be any place for badmen like you two no pete said shorty were did fer our times up they aint no more place fer us an a jackrabbit were agoin to hev a new brand o badmen nowthe kind they raise in noo york that wears funny pants an robs orphants take them to town boys said corson addressing his own men and then come back here youve all got jobs here on the bar y and one of the first duties you have is to shoot badmen on sight if they show up around the ranch texas pete and shorty turned and walked out with their escort and shortly after still under guard were loping away in the direction of hendersville the stage came down the pass with a load of passengers that day and among them was a lawyer from aldea imported by corson and wainright to draw up the papers that would make onethird the bar y property wainrights and place a hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars in the hands of corson and lillian manill at the mine it stopped and took on the messenger with the bullion then to the crack of bill gatlins whip it lurched onward toward the gap bill was discoursing to a tenderfoot who had remarked on the dry appearance of the country that he had seen stretching away as far as the eye could reach from the summit to the pass i should hate to be caught out there alone said the young man im afraid id starve to death why that wouldnt be nothin observed bill that wouldnt be nothin at all why back in the seventies when i was ridin fer the lazy h outfit in montana i was chasin a critter one day when my pony stepped in a badger hole an after turnin three complete somersaults lights plumb on his feet an starts across country scared stiff which would aben all right ef it hadnt aben that the last somersault shuck me clean outen the saddle an by cracky it was jest my durn luck that my foot caught in the stirrup an that ornery critter up an drags me he was so sceart that he never much moren slowed up fer three days yes sir he drug me fer three days an nights an all i hed to eat was when he drug me through a strawberry patch an all i hed to drink was when he drug me through a river no sir after thet it wouldnt seem bad at all to be left out nowheres in no country the tenderfoot looked at bill with deep and reverent awe but he said nothing the stage bumped over the uneven road lurching drunkenly around curves a masked man waited silently behind the boulders at the south end of the gap he appeared nervous turning often to glance back into the chapparal from which he had emerged a few moments before i wonder where in hell gregorio is he muttered half aloud he told me last night that he would be here before me the stage drew nearer bill gatlin reined his team to a walk at the first deep chuckhole at the entrance to the gap the horses moved slowly picking their way and sometimes stumbling in the deep dustfilled cavities that made this short stretch of scarce fifty yards the most notorious piece of road within a hundred miles the lone highwayman could wait no longer for his accomplice he must essay the thing alone he stepped forward to intercept the slowmoving stage and as he did so a noise behind him attracted his attention and a single backward glance revealed to him a masked man and the familiar habiliments of gregorio he breathed a quick sigh of relief motioned to his accomplice to hurry and moved forward with the second man now close at his heels bill gatlin and the messenger were not surprised when the two men stepped into the middle of the gap and held them up they would have been surprised under ordinary circumstances but today they had been forewarned that there would doubtless be an attempted holdup on account of the unusually valuable gold shipment which was being used as a lure to trap the black coyote and they had been warned to offer no resistance since hal colby had agreed to take the notorious robber if the matter was left entirely in his hands without any interference whatsoever all of which pleased bill gatlin and the messenger immensely since it relieved them both of most of the danger and all the responsibility not only did bill gatlin show no surprise at the appearance of the two masked figures but as a matter of fact he was already stopping his team as they appeared and had his hands in the air almost as soon as the command left the lips of the foremost of them as usual the mexican kept the driver and messenger covered while the black coyote approached the stage to obtain the gold but this time the second robber followed his principal more closely than had formerly been his custom the coyote menaced the passengers with his weapons seeing that they kept their hands elevated and then with gregorio on the watch behind him he slipped both his guns back into their holsters and reached up to take the bags of gold away from the messenger he had placed one foot on the hub of the front wheel to raise himself to a height that would enable him to reach the precious pouches when his confederate stepped quickly toward him shoved the muzzles of his guns into the black coyotes back and ordered him to put up his hands step down and put em up he said youre through durn my hide exclaimed bill gatlin hays pretty cute i thought he was gregorio all the time hes got bull to rights this time the black coyote stepped back from the stage with a growl you dirty greaser you he cried ill get you for this gregorio the latter nodded to the messenger get down and get his guns he said and when the man had done so now yank off his mask the messenger jerked the black silk handkerchief from the face of the black coyote with a single quick movement and then stepped back suddenly his eyes wide with surprise colby he ejaculated bill gatlin almost swallowed his quid of tobacco well ill be hornswaggled he exclaimed and then to the second robber an you was gregorio all the time an i mistook you fer colby the joke sure is on me an the drinks too they are agreed the second robber he shoved one of his guns into his holster and removed his own mask well now i will be hornswaggled murmured bill gatlinef it aint bull keep him covered said bull to the messenger while i get our horses colby glared sullenly at bull as the latter walked back up the road to get the horses but he said nothing he was still halfdazed from the surprise of seeing bull disguised as gregorio for even to the latters guns bull wore the entire outfit of the mexican and when bull returned riding gregorios and leading colbys animal the black coyote eyed him as though he still doubted his identity bull drew rein beside him and nodded toward colbys horse climb aboard he said colby mounted and bull tossed the noose of his reata around his prisoners neck drawing up the slack until the honda touched the collar of the mans shirt pull yer freight colby said bull and the two started off down the road toward hendersville a moment later the stage passed them want me to stay along with you in case you need any help called bill gatlin i wont want no help said bull as the stage grew away from them concealing itself in its own dust a swarthy rider galloped up to bull and colby reining in a blazedface chestnut beside them it was gregorio colby glared at the mexican youyou he shouted shut up colby bull interrupted him you got what was comin to you itll learn you not to ditch a pal gregorio had dismounted and was stripping his outer garments and bull followed his example as they exchanged clothing and horses they joked together over the days work which they considered good gregorio swung himself into his saddle first a dios senor bull he cried with a wave of his hand perhaps in a few days gregorio comes out of the hills eh ill fix that up when i git through with this business gregorio replied the american in the meantime just lay low and i will work with you for the bar y rancho inquired the mexican if i do gregorio solong a dios senor and gregorio wheeled his pony back toward the hills thet greasers whitern some white men said bull when he trotted into hendersville a few minutes behind the stage he found that already the news had spread and a crowd gathered about the stage in front of the donovan house surrounded him and his prisoner durn his hide exclaimed one who had been fore most among the posse that had ridden forth to hang bull only a short time before i knew right along twarnt bull i anus said they was something shady about thet there colby feller bull had but just drawn rein when texas pete and shorty rode up safely delivered in town by their escort and having reclaimed their guns which had been emptied of cartridges and dropped in the road at the edge of town while the escort galloped quickly out of range toward the bar i texas pete had no time for questions his quick eyes took in the scene at a glance and possibly he guessed the explanation or caught it from the comments of the crowd but another and more important matter occupied his thoughts as he forced his pony to bulls side have you saw anything of miss di he asked is she here in town i dont know why she aint on the bar y corson says shes sold out an left fer aldea replied texas pete corsons a liar snapped bull he turned toward the veranda of the donovan house where he espied the proprietress mrs donovan he called to her is miss henders in town she is not bull replied mary donovan bull turned his eyes toward the crowd until they alighted upon a man he knew bore a decent reputation one who was not affiliated with gum smith or his gang thompson he called you take colby an keep him til i git back dont let gum smith git his hands on him an shoot colby if he makes any funny plays git down offen your horse colby take him thompson come on boys and with texas pete and shorty at his ponys heels he started on a run for the bar y as they raced along now neck and neck texas pete jerked his head back in the general direction of hendersville what was it all about he inquired i jest runded up the black coyote replied bull colby bull nodded i ben suspicionin him he said fer a long time back but i couldnt never call the turn on him then i runs onto gregorio while im hidin out up coyote canyon him an colby ben workin together all along but it seems lately the greasers found out colbys plannin on doublecrossin him an goin south with all the swag this was to be his last job an colby fixed it someway to have a big shipment of gold today so gregorio an me fixes it an swaps clothes an horses an i takes the greasers place colby never got onto it at all he thinks i was the greaser plumb up to the minute i yanks off the mask i thought gregorio didnt have no use fer you bull said shorty i done him a good turn a spell back that was all he said about the fight with the apaches in cottonwood canyon where he had risked his life to save the mexicans they rode on in silence for a while the ranch buildings nestling among the trees were visible in the distance when texas pete called attention to a speck among the sagebrush far to the southeast to an untrained eye it was scarcely appreciable theres a saddled cayuse he said what fer is it doin out yender bull strained his eyes in the direction of the animal looks like the lo sorrel idaho used to ride he said idaho was left home with miss di said pete as one man the three reined toward the distant pony and with loosened reins tore over the powdery earth bounding in and out and over the brush like so many nimblefooted jackrabbits blazes outdistancing the other ponies reached the lo sorrel first bull threw himself from his saddle and kneeled beside the prostrate form of a man half hidden in the brush it was idaho as bull lifted his head he opened his eyes he looked at bull in a bewildered way for a moment the expression of his face denoting a concentrated effort to recall his mental faculties then texas pete and shorty reined in beside him in a cloud of dust and profanity wheres the boss demanded pete what you loafin out here fer inquired shorty slowly idaho sat up assisted by bull he looked at the reins looped about his wrist he felt of his side and brought his hand away covered with blood i done the best i could he said but they was too many of them wheres the boss you ornery sidewinder yelled texas pete whos them what hev they done with her they was all masked said idaho i didnt know no more after they creased me i dunno what they done with her help me aboard thet cayuse you bowlegged flannel mouth an well pull our freight an find her stid o sittin round here listenin to your yap pete who had dismounted helped idaho almost tenderly into the saddle you better beat it fer town he said you aint much good nohow an with a between your ribs you aint no good whatsumever shut up idaho admonished him if i was perforated like a salt cellar id be wuth two o you he reeled a little in the saddle but shook himself and straightened up it was evident that he was weak from shock and loss of blood and that he was suffering pain beside youd better go back idaho said bull you aint in no shape to ride at all an i reckon we got some hard ridin ahead o us go back you damn fool said texas pete who under the cloak of rough and almost brutal badinage had sought to hide his real concern for his friends welfare go chase yerselves replied idaho im goin with you they wasted no more time in argument but started a wide circle looking for the tracks of the abductors they found sufficient evidence to convince them that there had been upward of a dozen horsemen concerned in the work which corroborated idahos statement and that approximately half of these had ridden directly in the direction of the bar y while the others had taken a southerly route it was the latter trail they elected to follow after bull discovered upon it the imprint of an iron shoe and as captain being tender in front had recently had his forefeet shod it was safe to assume that they had taken diana renders this way they rode fast for dusk was already on them and when a short time later it became too dark to distinguish the trail from the saddle they were often compelled to stop and dismount and upon several occasions strike matches to make sure that they were still on the right track their progress was therefore necessarily slow toward midnight they lost the trail completely it was there they left idaho too weak from loss of blood to continue chapter xviii through the night in a back room of the chicago saloon thompson sat guard over hal colby who was neatly and securely trussed and tied to a chair in which he sat in the donovan house the guests were seated at dinner when gum smith entered and took his accustomed place he had just come from the bar y and as the streets of hendersville had happened to be deserted at the meal hour he had met no one lo gum greeted bill gatlin i reckon you hearn we got the black coyote ah haint see no one sence ah reached town replied smith but ah knowed colbyd git the critter yet withall he looked a bit mystified and uneasy whar be he he asked hes safe in the chicago said wildcat bob ah reckon ahd better git him over to the jail said gum smith i reckon youll leave him at the chicago replied wildcat do you know who he is bull o course bull hellits colby gum smith paled

bawled gum smith an nobody dont want to interfere with me in the discharge o mah duties do yoall hear me wildcat bob i hears you but jest like a jackass brayin it dont make no impression on my onderstandin replied wildcat embellishing his remarks with lurid and descriptive profanity he finished his meal first and went out when gum smith left the donovan house he repaired at once to his own saloon here he deputized a half a dozen loafers gave each of them several drinks and led them to the chicago saloon where he demanded of the proprietor that he turn over to him forthwith the person of hal colby otherwise known as the black coyote hes in the back room yonder replied the owner of the chicago saloon ef you craves him go git him i dont want him in front of the door to the back room sat wildcat bob his elbows were resting can his knees and from each hand dangled a in the name o the lawr piped gum smith in his high voice ah demands the pusson o one hal colby git the hell outen here you blankety blank blank blank screamed wildcat bob yoall better listen to reason wildcat bob yelled the sheriff or ahll have the lawr on yo wildcat bob raising his voice yet higher again than that of his ancient enemy bawled out an incoherent volley of blasphemous and obscene invective gum smith turned and whispered to one of his followers who withdrew from the room with two others presently gum smith stepped to one side of the room and pointing at the little old man sitting before the locked door called to his remaining deputies take him mendo yore duty one of the men stepped forward wildcat bob whirled a gun about his forefinger and without taking aim shot the fellows hat from his head the three stepped back almost simultaneously there came the sound of the crashing of glass from the interior of the room where colby was confined the voice of thompson raised in protest and then shots wildcat bob leaped to his feet and reached for the knob of the door as he did so his back was toward the barroom for an instant and in that instant gum smith raised his sixshooter and fired without a word wildcat bob crumpled to the floor and lay there motionless smith and his men leaped for the door it was locked and being a strong door withstood their combined efforts for several minutes when at last it gave before their assault and they stepped across the threshold they saw only the body of thompson sprawled upon the floor in a pool of blood the black coyote was gone surrounded by masked men her escort shot from his horse diana henders realized only too well the gravity of her situation and though she recognized no individual among those who had lain in ambush for her she guessed well enough that they had acted under orders from corson her note to him revealing the fact that she knew the entire truth concerning his duplicity and was in possession of the papers that proved it beyond peradventure of a doubt had she guessed prompted the desperate adventure in which he pitted all against all so suddenly had the masked riders come upon them from the bed of a dry wash that they had had them covered before they could draw yet idaho true to the unwritten code of his calling and his time had invited death by drawing in the face of their levelled guns in defense of a woman had he been alone or with another man his hands had gone up the moment he had realized that the odds were all against him and one of them had gone up but it had carried a sixgun with it and he had been shot out of the saddle for his chivalry and left for dead upon the parched ground as his assailants galloped off toward the south with diana night fell and yet the men kept on two riding ahead of diana henders and four behind they rode rapidly not sparing their horses and from both their haste and the direction of their way the girl guessed that they were making a try for the border once in the mountains they were forced to a slower gait and around nine oclock they halted for a brief rest where there was water for both the horses and their riders at first diana had attempted to question them relative to their intentions but they would not tell her where they were taking her and at last silenced her with oaths and threats nor did they remove their masks until darkness equally as well hid their features from her this and their almost unbroken silence convinced her that her abductors were men who feared recognition and therefore must have been recruited in the neighborhood a shrewd guess suggested that an habitue of gums placeliquors and cigarswould have recognized them all the abduction had therefore been engineered or at least connived in by the sheriff and this line of reasoning but corroborated what was already a foregone conclusion that it had been done at corsons behest what their purpose was with her she could not guess it might be a plan to remove her temporarily to some hidden spot where she might not further interfere with the plans of the new yorker or it might easily have a more sinister purpose she knew that corson would never be safe in possession of the bar y property while she lived and she did not believe that he was fool enough not to appreciate that fact but would he dare to have her done away with she wondered it was after midnight when they crossed the summit at a point where there appeared not the slightest vestige of a trail and dropped down a dangerous and rocky declivity into a wooded canyon a dozen times the girls life was in jeopardyher only safeguard the agility and surefootedness of captain a halfhour later the canyon widened into a little pocket in the mountains and here they stopped again through the gloom of the deep gorge her eyes finally distinguished the outlines of a small cabin the men dismounted get down said one of them to diana and when she had done so the fellow took her by the arm with a gruff come along and led her toward the shack he pushed open the door and told her to enter following behind her he struck a match revealing a single room rudely furnished with a table a few benches and a couple of cots all constructed in rustic fashion from branches of the trees which grew about the place on the table was a candle holder and a candle which the man lighted at one end of the room was a blackened fireplace above which a long shelf supported a few small boxes and cans on pegs flanking the fireplace were crude cooking utensilsa frying pan a stew pan and a coffee pot while a larger kettle for heating water squatted in the ashes of the dirty hearth the other men came in presently all were masked again one of them took the kettle and went out returning shortly with water another brought wood and then a third set about preparing a meal they had brought some flour and bacon with them there were baking powder salt pepper and sugar in the cans upon the mantel shelf together with one of coffee and another of tea the aroma of cooking food awoke diana to a realization of the fact that she was hungry her situation while grave had not as yet reached a point that she might consider dangerous the attitude of the men had been determined albeit somewhat nervous yet never at any time actually menacing what they had done had evidently been accomplished under orders from some person or persons who were taking no active part in the actual abductionwho were not even present when the thing was done nor now that they had reached this hiding place in the mountains diana henders was more or less familiar with these southern hills and she knew that she never had been in this spot before what an ideal place it would be to commit and effectually hide all traces of a crime she put such unpleasant thoughts from her and turned her attention to the bacon sizzling upon the hearth the while it filled the room with its delicious aroma she was given a portion of the food and seated upon one of the rude cots devoured it ravenously her fears of what ever magnitude they might be had not spoiled her appetite nor did she show in any other outward manner that she was afraid either of her abductors or contemplation of the fate that awaited her the meal over one of the men arose and left the cabin from the monosyllabic conversation that ensued she gathered that he had been sent back along their route to a point where he could act as sentinel and thus safeguard them from surprise they did not appear to expect pursuit but took this precaution evidently in accordance with orders previously received or a plan prearranged after the meal the men smoked for a while and then one by one lay down upon the rough boards to sleep so disposing themselves that the girl could not approach either the door or the single window without disturbing one or more of them the last man blew out the candle before he lay down diana renders stretched herself at length upon the rough branches that formed the bottom of one of the cots and tried to sleep how long she lay awake she did not know but eventually she fell into a light slumber from which she was awakened about three in the morning by the sound of horses feet on the ground outside the cabin then she heard mens voices speaking in subdued tones a sudden premonition seized herrescue was at hand she heard the door open and immediately two of the men upon the floor awoke and sat up whos that demanded one me replied one of the newcomers the rest o you fellers wake upwe got to get outta here he stepped to the table struck a match and lighted the candle in its first flare diana recognized his figure as that of the man who had gone out after the meal to act as guard along the trailthe man with him was hal colby put out that light you damn fool cried one of the awakened sleepers do you want this girl to reconize us all the light went out quickly hal colby stepped across the room to her side everythings all right di he said ive come for you the other man was speaking to his fellows theys someone on our trailcolby passed them on the cutoff hed ben ridin behind em fer an hour he says theys three o em we gotta git out hastily the men rose and sought their horses colby took diana by the arm come he said ill get you out o here why should i want to get out when someone is coming to take me away from these men she demanded but im hereill take you out di come we must hurry she shook her head no i shall stay here they wont let youtheyll take you along you had better come with me i am your friend you cannot be a friend of theirs arid mine both he took her by the arm again come this is no time for fooling she struggled to free herself and when he attempted to drag her forcibly she struck him in the face with a clenched fist you he cried applying a vile epithet to her youll come damn you and he picked her up and carried her out into the waning night most of the men had found their horses and mounted wheres her horse demanded colby of one of them and when it was led forward he threw her roughly into the saddle and with her own reata he bound her there then he mounted his own animal and leading hers started down the rough and wooded gorge toward the south a few miles away three men drew rein upon a ridge weve lost the damn trail agin muttered texas pete sourly bull sat erect upon blazes his head thrown far back his nostrils dilated what you lookin up yender fer demanded shorty the trail thet bunch o shorthorns on dont lead to heavin smell it asked bull what wood smoke theys a east wind come on he rode blindly through the darkness trusting to the instinct and the eyesight of his horse toward the east and the fire from which that tenuous suggestion of wood smoke emanated where there was fire there should be a manthus reasoned bull a halfhour later the three slid and rolled with their horses down the steep side of a gorge into a cuplike opening in the hills and before them in the growing dawn they saw a mean weatherworn shack from the crumbling chimney a thin wisp of smoke arose into the still air to be wafted gently westward after it had topped the summit of the canyon walls they hid their horses among the trees and the underbrush and crept stealthily toward the building from three sides bull was the first to come into the open and as he did so he stood erect and sprang toward the doorway of the building bursting into the interior with two guns readyin his hands the place was empty embers smouldered upon the dirty hearth a greasy frying pan lay upon the floor at one side a kettle half filled with warm water upon the other there was the odor of cigarette smoke in the air of the single room they ben here but theys gone said bull as his two friends joined him they aint ben gone long said shorty they found the trail leading down the canyon and followed it while a few miles ahead colby and diana with the six masked men debouched upon the wide fiat at the foot of the hills here they halted one o you fellers swap horses with the girl commanded colby and then you all circle back to the west an north an hit the high spots fer hendersville here grift you take her horse how come demanded grift why to lead the folks back at hendersville offen the trail o course replied colby youll tell em you found her horse tother side o the west ranch an theyll look there til the cows comes home grift satisfied with this explanation dismounted and took dianas horse after which she was bound to the one he had quitted now beat it said colby ill take care o the girl and he started off toward the south while the others turned westward i reckon i fooled em remarked colby when the others were out of hearing diana made no reply them three hombres is trailin you di he continued an theyll be jest wise enough to foller captains tracks i reckon i fooled em fine grift never would o swapped ef hed aknowed what my reason was diana said nothing she did not even look at him they rode on in silence then for some time look here di he exclaimed finally you might as well come down offen your high horse youre mine now an im agoin to keep youas long as i want you im rich now ill git all the money i wants from lillian but youre the one i loveyoure the one i want and youre the one im agoin to have after i gits all o lillians money ill quit her an you an mell do some travelin but in the meantime i gotta marry her to git the money sabe cur muttered diana shuddering well ef you wants to belong to a cur call me one he said laughing cause youre goin to belong to me after today you wont never want to go back then you thought youd turn me down did you you wanted that dirty damn bandit didnt cha well you wont never git him if he isnt follerin you with the three thets behind us he wont never catch up to us this side o the border an after that he couldnt never find us in a hundred years if he is with them hell foller the captains hoof prints until he catches up with em an then that bunch o badunsll shoot him full o holes i guess maybe i wasnt foolin the whole bunch on em eh diana henders looked her unutterable contempt and loathing colby fell silent after a bit seeing that it was impossible to draw the girl into conversation thus they continued on for miles suddenly from far away toward the north came just barely audible to their ears faintly the sound of distant firearms bull and his pals had come upon the six there had been no preliminaryno questions asked the three had but put spurs to their horses and overtaken the fleeing abductors who their work done had no desire to enter into an argument with anyone the moment he thought that he was within safe range bull had opened with a single gun and at the first shot a man had tumbled from his saddle it was a running fight from then on until but a single one of the six remained holding one hand far above his head he reined in his jaded mount at the same time letting his gun fall to the ground bull drew up beside him wheres miss henders he demanded i dont know nothin about heri aint seen her you lie said bull in a low voice youre riding her horse now where is she ill give you five seconds to answer before i send you to hell colby taken hersouthtoward the border cried grift and bull wondered for he had left the man safely in hendersville you take thet horse home grift said bull to the bar y ef youve lied to me about miss henders or ef thet horse aint in a bar y corral when i gets back i bore you sabe grift nodded now beat it said bull and reined about toward the south again the hard pitiless grind commenced beneath a scorching sun over blistering alkali flats the three urged their weary horses on you gotta make it blazes you gotta make it whispered bull in the ear of the pony she caint be much ahead an there aint nothin can step away from me an you blazes forever well catch up with em some day chapter xix tell me that you love me it was ten oclock that morning before bull texas pete and shorty picked up colbys trail and by that time the man and his unwilling companion were a good four hours ahead of them on tired horses through the heat of a blazing arizona day it seemed hopeless to expect to overhaul their quarry before night had fallen and by that time colby would have crossed the border not however that that meant much to the three who pursued him to whom international boundary lines were of no more practical import than parallels of latitude or isothermal lines before noon they were obliged to stop and rest their horses at a water hole that afforded a brackish but refreshing drink for the three jaded animals in the mud at the border they saw the fresh tracks of colbys pony and dianas it was evident that they had stopped here for a considerable time which in truth they had so positive was colby that he had thrown their pursuers off the track leading them into a gun fight with a superior force that might reasonably have been expected to have accounted for them to the last man five minutes was all the rest that the pursuers allowed their horses once again they were in the saddle lookee yender exclaimed texas pete pointing toward the south ef it aint rainin there im a siwash its about a month too early for the rains said bull but it shore is raininrainin like hell look at thet lightnin say if they aint crossed salees flats yet they wont never git acrost not while thet rain lasts n if they has crossed we wont never catch em said shorty ill catch em ef i hev to ride plumb to hell an it takes me a hundred years said bull the rain struck colby and diana at the northern edge of the flats it came in driving sheets and sometimes in solid masses that almost crushed them it came with deafening reverberations of titantic thunder and vivid almost terrifying displays of lightning it was bad where they were but colby knew from experience of the country that in the low hills at the upper end of the flats it was infinitely worsethat there had been a cloudburst he put spurs to his horse and dragging dianas into a gallop urged them both to greater speed knowing that if he did not cross the wash in the center of the flats within a few minutes he might not cross it again for days when they reached it three feet of turbid water tumbled madly down the narrow bed between the precipitous clay walls the man found a steep path that stock had made for crossing when the bed of the wash was dry and urged his horse downward the force of the current almost swept the animal from its feet but with widespread legs it stemmed the torrent while colby taking a few turns of the lead rope around his horn dragged dianas pony through in safety after him at the top of the bank the man turned and looked toward the north and then down at the rising flood if this rain holds out they wont nothin more cross here fer a spell he said smiling in ten minutes shell be plumb full we kin take it easier now he started off again but now at a walk for he knew that there was no longer need for haste if there had been before which he had doubted the horses cooled and refreshed by the rain would have been equal to a spurt now but none was necessary and so they came after a mile to the dim outlines of an adobe house showing through the driving downpour directly ahead colby rode close to the door and leaning from his saddle pounded upon it there was no reply i reckon well stop here a while he said dismounting he opened the door and looked in the place was deserted in rear of it was an open shed for stock and to this they rode colby helped diana from her horse removed the saddles and bridles from the animals and tied them beneath the shed then he led the girl to the house her arms still bound by the reata there was no chance that she could escape now so the man removed her bonds well rest here a few hours an give the horses a chance then well hit the trail we gotta find a place where we kin feed my bellys wrapped around my backbone lets be friends di you might as well make the best of it you caint blame a feller fer lovin you an i aint so badyou might adone a lot worse he came toward her and raised his hand as though to place it on her arm dont touch me she drew back with an appreciable shudder or revulsion he laughed youll feel better after a while he said were both too dog tired to be very good company im goin to get in a little sleep youd better do the same but ill have to tie you up again unless youll promise not to try to escape she made no reply all right he said ef youd rather be tied he came then and tied her hands behind her keeping one end of the rope in his own hand he lay down upon the dirt floor and was soon asleep diana sat with her back against the wall listening to the rain beating upon the roof and driving against the walls the roof leaked badly in several places and the water that came through formed puddles on the floor which joined together into a little rivulet that wound to the doorway and disappeared beneath the door how hopeless diana stifled a sob she was tired and hungry and weak from exhaustion the frightful rain had cut off the frail vestige of a chance of rescue that there had been before by now no man or beast could cross salees flats she knew one man who would try had he known of her predicament but how was he to know of ita hunted fugitive hiding in the mountains far to the north realizing the necessity for haste if they were to cross the flats before the wash became an impassable torrent the three pursuers drove their tired horses onward at the top of their diminished speed the race became at once a test for the survival of the fittest and blazes forged steadily farther and farther ahead of the ponies long before bull reached the flats the rain was upon him refreshing both horse and man and blazes as though imbued with new life increased the distance between himself and the two ponies now far behind the driving rain was rapidly obliterating the trail that the man followed yet he managed to cling to it to the very brink of the washto the very point where colby and diana had crossed and there bull drew rein to look down scowling upon a seething barrier of yellow water twenty feet wide it was and ten feet deep swirling and boiling like a cauldron of hell he eyed the greasy muddy footing of the bank had it been firm and dry he had put blazes to it for a jump but he knew that it could not be done nor could he swim the horse even could the animal have made the crossing it could not have clambered out upon the top of that perpendicular constantly caving wall with the mighty current always dragging at it but bull was not hopelesshe was merely devising ways and means not an instant had he considered the possibility of giving up the pursuit or even of delaying it by waiting for the waters to recede taking his rope in hand he dismounted and stepped close to the brink of the torrent upon both sides of which grew numerous clumps of greasewood he seemed already to have formed a plan for he drew one of his sixguns and hurled it across the wash he followed it with the second gun and then with his heavy belt of cartridges then came his boots one by one shaking down the honda he swung a noose at the end of his rope which opening up described a circle that seemed to revolve about his head at an angle of fortyfive degrees with the ground like a rakish halo just for an instant and then it rose and sailed gracefully across the newborn river to drop around a clump of greasewood upon the opposite bank come here said bull to blazes and the horse steppedto his side close to the waters edge stand commanded bull knowing that blazes would stand where he was for hours if necessary until his master gave a new order bull drew in his rope until it became taut and then he dragged heavily upon the greasewood across the channel it held despite his most strenuous efforts he tied the loose end about his waist stepped to the edge of the water and leaped in hal colby awoke and looked about him his eyes fell upon the girl sitting with her back against the wall across the room feelin better he asked i am nothin like sleep onless it be grub she did not reply he rose to his feet and approached her youre shore a sullen little devil but ill take that out o youa little lovinll do that git up an kiss me you unspeakablething it would be an insult to a cur to call you that colby laughed goodnaturedly ef youd ruther have a bandit i might turn one he said and again he laughed this time at his own joke if you are trying to suggest that i would prefer bull you are right you may thank god that he is not herebut he will comeand you will pay well you aint got up and kissed me yet said colby do you want me to yank you up you got a lot to learn an im the hombre what can learn you ive hed a lot o experienceive tamed em before as good as you tamed em an made em like it if it caint be did one way it can another sometimes a quirt helps he struck his chaps with the lash of the one he carried git up you he seized her by the arm and jerked her roughly to her feet again she struck him and this time the man struck backa stinging blow across her shoulders with the quirt ill learn you he cried she tried to free herself striking him repeatedly but he held her off and lashed her cruelly nor did he appear to care where the quirt fell the tumbling waters engulfing bull rolled him over and over before halfdrowned his powerful strokes succeeded in raising his head above the surface he had had no conception of the tremendous strength of the current he was but a bobbing bit of flotsam upon its surface he could not stem it he was helpless the rope about his waist suddenly tautened and he was again dragged beneath the surface he grasped it with his hands and tried to pull himself in toward shore but the giant waters held him in their grip dragging him downward stronger by far than the strength of many men suddenly the muddy flood spewed him to the surface once morethis time against the bank to which the opposite end of his rope was fastened and was dragging heavily upon its precarious anchor he clutched at the slippery red mud clawing frantically for a handhold the waters leaped upon him and beat him down but still he fought on valiantly not for his life but for the girl he loved and at last he won dragging himself slowly out upon the bank almost exhausted he rose staggering to his feet and looked back across the torrent at blazes it aint no use boy he said with a shake of his head i was agoin to rope you an drag you acrost but it caint be did now i reckon ill hev to hoof it he sat down in the mud and pulled on his boots gathered up his guns and belt coiled his rope and turned his face southward ef it takes a hundred years an i hev to foller him plumb to hell he muttered ill git him still spent and blowing from his tremendous exertions against the flood he staggered on through the sticky clay and the blinding rain his head bent down against the storm it was hard work but never once did a thought of surrender enter his mind he would find a ranch house somewhere and get a horsehe might even come upon some range stock he had his lariat and there was a bare chance that he might get close enough to an animal to rope it but he must have a horse he felt helplessentirely impotentwithout one imagine yourself thrust into a cold and unfriendly world if you are a man without a pocket knife a bunch of keys a handkerchief money or a pair of shoes and you will be able to appreciate how a cowboy feels without a horse thus buffeted by the storm he shouldered on until suddenly there loomed almost directly in his path the outlines of an adobe house fortune smiled upon him here he would find a horse he stepped to the door and was about to knock when he heard the voice of a woman crying out in protestation and pain then he flung the door wide and stepped into the interior colby holding dianas wrist was twisting it in an excess of rage for she had struck him and repulsed him until the last vestige of his thin veneer of manhood had fallen from him leaving exposed the raw primordial beast he saw bull the instant that the latter opened the door and swinging the girl in front of him reached for a gun diana too saw the figure in the doorway a great wave of joy swept through her and then she saw colbys gun flash from its holster and knew that bull could not shoot because of fear of hitting her but she did not know bull as well as she thought she knew him and similarly was colby deceived for the man in the doorway fired from the hip the instant that colbys gun was raised the weapon fell from nerveless fingers the grasp upon dianas wrist relaxed and hal colby pitched forward upon his face a bullet hole between his eyes diana swayed for an instant dazed by the wonder of her deliverance and then as bull stepped toward her she went to meet him and put her arms about his neck bull it was half a sob the man took her in his arms diana the word carried all the reverence of a benediction raising her face from his shoulder she pushed him away a little bull she said once you told me that you loved me tell me so again love dont tell half of it girl he said his voice husky with emotion oh bull she cried i have been such a fool i love you i have always loved you but i did not know it until that nightthe night they came after you at the west ranch but you couldnt love me diana thinkin i was the black coyote i dont care bull what you are all i care or know is that you are my man we will go away together and start over againwill you bull for my sake and then he told her that he didnt have to go awaytold her who the black coyote had been why he even planted one o the bullion sacks under my bedroll at the west ranch to prove i was the right hombre said bull saw a sack o dust i brung from idaho an he tried to make em think it was yours he used to send me off alone the days he was agoin to hold up the stage sos when the time was ripe he could throw suspicion on me he shore was a clever feller hal was but the day mack was wounded she asked we saw you coming in from the north and there was blood on your shirt i got in a brush with apaches up cottonwood me an gregorio an i got scratched twasnt nothin and to think that all the time he was professing friendship for you he was trying to make me believe that you were the black coyote cried diana he was worse than mr corson and i thought him about the wickedest man i had ever known we gotta think about gittin back an havin a friendly powwow with thet there corson gent said bull by golly the suns out everythings happy diana now thet youre safe they walked to the doorway the rain had stopped as suddenly as it had begun and now the fierce sun blazed down upon the steaming mud wheres your horses asked bull in a shed behind the house good well start along theys a bridge twentyfive miles below here ef i aint mistaken i think i know this here shack i was down this way two year ago but what about him she nodded back toward the body of colby he kin rot here fer all i care said bull bitterly ahurtin you god i wisht he had nine lives like a cat sos i could kill him a few more times she closed the door behind them well have to notify gum smith so they can send down and bury him gum smith wont never get the chanct he said they walked to the shed and he saddled the two horses rested now and refreshed a little by the past hours of relief fromthe heat and after they had mounted and ridden halfway to the wash they saw the figures of two men upon the opposite bank texas pete and shorty he told her they recognized the girl and bull and whooped and shouted in the exuberance of youth and joy it was a hard ride to the bridge through the heavy mud but it was made at last and then the four joined upon the same side and set out toward home picking up idaho en route still weak but able to sit on a horse it was two days later before they rode into the bar y ranch yard where they were met with wild acclaim by willie wong and the mens cook wheres corson demanded bull the whole bunch has gone to town to close the deal they was some hitch the other day wong said he heard em talkin corson wouldnt take nothin but gold an wainright had to send up to aldea fer it they say its comin in on todays stage im goin to town announced bull so am i said diana
