the way it wasthe way it was this is the third kiss of death story in this volume this one i was maneuvered into by that secret master of us all harlan ellison he called me up one day to tell me there was a new magazine to be published by bob guccionenot omni it was long before omni whose editor he said was slavering to have a short article on the future written by me well short articles on the future i sneeze out at the slightest request and the money was good when the editor called a little later i told her id be glad to do it we talked a little bit about subject matter and i sat down to write it i was typing happily along when the phone rang again had i understood she wanted to know that by piece she meant fiction piecespecifically not an article but a short story i had not i wouldnt have started on the thing if i had still in the course of thinking about the themes i wanted to touch on in the article i had dreamed up what seemed to me a brandnew aspect of a long considered subject so i said all right ill do a story and did and then what do you know the new magazine died stillborn the story languished in bob gucciones files for a year or two until he started another new magazine this one was called viva and my story appeared in its first issue but this time the pharaohs curse had not yet finished its work vivas first issue was also its last and this time i had slain not one but two magazines with a single story this is the way it was with stan and evanie they fell in love when stan came out of the wakingup room at blue balls evanie was there pretty and new on the job and a little flustered to give him his check and see that everything was all right one thing led to another an hour later they were lying in the long grass at the foot of a waterfall gently stoned skin bare on the warm soft turf listening to rorschach rock while sweet bunnies and gentle chipmunks peered at them from the edges of the lawn it was like the first time for both of them only better because they each knew every move the other was going to make and leapt to meet each other there was never skin softer or smoother than evanies never a breast as firm stan stayed hard inside her for fiftyfour minutes never impatient bringing her with joy through gasps and shudders until both of them had had it all and they lay spent and contented among the violets it was like the first time because it was always like the first time and as always the first they knew that it was over was when the waterfall stopped and the bunnies froze in midhop oh said evanie drowsily shit she sat up and leaned away from him scratching the inside of her thigh i guess i better get back to work sam stan it was really nice though stan yeah now that the breezes had stopped too stan became aware of the way they smelled in the city outside this room he would never have noticed it but after the perfumed flowers it was a bringdown and now that the soft sunlight was off the lawn was only celloturf again and it itched the next couple was already waiting in the entry room stan and evanie nodded to them and pushed their checks into the locker slots as they got dressed stan said id really like to do this again some time zip me up will you no i mean it evanie she patted his shoulder absently and pushed the door open they walked out into the city and the heat and the stink smote them behind them the liquidcrystal sign glowed its message harrys place studsy sex spectaculars the colors flowed into superstud embracing the tenderest blond beauty who ever lived with waving palms dissolving into mirrored walls behind them thanks stan ill see you he put out his hand to stop her i seriously mean i want to do it again evanie but its so expensive ive got a thousand dollars a week he said proudly i can afford it now what the hell she was suddenly blinded with tears and how do you get it she sobbed no let go of my arm stan ive got to go he called after her sweet little rump jouncing under the hem of the workmini as she hurried away but she didnt look back perplexedand he realized hungry he pushed his way through the crowded hall to a fast food fuck her he said to the cashier as he pushed his credit card into its slot but it was only a money machine and did not reply two hours later he was still sitting at the same table in the fastfood but he had switched from food to drink i dont have to eat in a joint like this he told the man across from him the man had been sitting there for ten minutes nursing a cup of imitation coffee and eying stans collection of empty glasses he brightened up yeah i could tell that by looking at you youre used to better places right mac i damn am you can always tell somebody with you know some kind of status its the way you sit there even right said stan want a drink the man looked at the flickering digits on the wall clock well he said i really ought to be getting along which was doubtful he was welfare from clipped head to fabric shoes nothing to do but wait for thursday just the way stan had been most of his life stans face must have showed what he was thinking the man said quickly still i wouldnt mind a beer stan pushed his card into the cashier and read out the total glumly after the beer the readout showed he had left in his account harrys place wasnt cheap i just came from harrys he said you ever been there nice little screwery if the companys right i bet she was huh you won that bet prettiest little thing you ever saw i met her at i met her where we both work i had a job the man said enviously what kind of work do you do parts what about your job well it was in personal service i worked up in the penthouse areas when i was younger sort of general handyman i used to go to places like harrys all the time stud farms casinos travelive been skiing two or three times he knocked back the rest of his beer and pushed the empty container absentmindedly into the middle of the table yeah you can have a pretty good life when you have a job what kind of parts do you mean all different ones the forgetit shots were wearing off the selective proteins that numbed the sense of boredom and made everything seem fresh and exciting even sex and stan was rapidly tiring of his company funnily he wasnt tiring of evanie in his not particularly adventurous life she was probably the five or sixhundredth girl hed screwed and the fourth or fifth he had taken to harrys after he found out how to get a thousand dollars a week for practically nothing but there was something about her that stuck in his mind no not in his mind he could feel a crawling between his thighs when he thought of her even with the forgetit wearing off and being in this crummy joint the welfare man saw his next free beer wriggling off the hook let me tell you what its like up in the high rent district he said you know theyve got swimming pools bigger than this whole restaurant water so clean youd think it was perfume dances with live orchestras i heard it isnt the same just hearing it or seeing it on the tube you have to be there friend the happiest days of my life were when i was up there the women wore clothes that lit up and turned peekaboo and just hugged their little butts like skin just to look at them was enough almost enough and half of them were just begging to get balled by the hired help beds you wouldnt believe all the grass and fine wine you could handle you talked me into it stan said cruelly i think ill head up there for a visit now it wasnt exactly a lie he told himself he really could go up there at least long enough to spend the rest of his thousand dollars in one of the restaurants looking out into the clouds over the ocean and maybe he would plenty of money in the balance nothing to do stan wandered through the midlevel streets of the city reminding himself that anything he saw he could buy if he wanted to this was all welfare country not a soul in sight that had had a dime in capital or a dollars pay in ten years he wasted a few dollars in a game parlor bought himself a new wristlet because it looked like something evanie would appreciate stopped to buy some popsoy to give to a couple of nicelooking hungrylooking kids but decided against ityou never knew when they might threaten to call the fuzz for molesting them if you didnt pay off that wasnt his style all he wanted to molest was a pretty lady there was plenty of that around too and he cased the available material carefully without seeing anything that took his fancy what took his fancy was evanie but what was the use of that when she let him spend two and a half big bills in harrys place and then took off without even saying shed see him again most girls appreciated that kind of thing a little more that was half the best part of it not just the fucking but taking her to a place your average working man couldnt afford more than twice a year and your welfare stiff couldnt get inside the door of he found he was near an observation gallery and pushed his card into the admissions turnstilefive dollars to look out the windowand strolled out even there it was crowded mostly couples and cops the couples to make out in some place other than their dormitories and the cops to keep them from it he stood looking over lower new york bay through the smoggy clouds without seeing much that interested him the high walls of jersey city were lighting up as it got dark and far out past sandy hook he could see the lights of the offshore oil condominiums it was the third time he had been there in three days and it wasnt worth it it was only worth it when you couldnt afford it the reality was a waste of time all the things they used to talk about in the dorms they were true enough having a job wasnt just getting a paycheck having a job was a thing to organize your life around it was something to do having a job was thirtytwo hours a week when you felt it mattered some way or another whether you were in one place or some different place having ajob was a lot better than being in parts even though the pay there was all you could want shortly before the end of the shift he went up to the blue balls office the sign didnt say that the sign said associated medical services of greater new york transparts division but everyone knew it by the other name usually he didnt like to hang around there but apart from being where he got his money it was also where evanie worked the trouble with that was that he hadnt caught her last name stan walked in through the door as though he had never been there before and a receptionist smiled and said good evening sir one of our account executives will be with you right away i just wanted to ask you yes sir its company policy that our account executives give out all information here you are mr medway is ready to see you pale slim mr medwav in a sober scarlet jacket smiling at the door was waving him in welcome to transparts sir please sit down would you care for a drink coffee a coke i just wanted to ask you something certainly sir but before that let me congratulate you on your civic spirit whatever you decideand remember transparts will not attempt to influence your decision in any wayjust the fact that you came here shows that you are an extraordinary person well let me tell you a little about us transparts supplies all of the surgical facilities in the greater new york area with organs for transplant under title seven federal statute we are authorized to accept and process wholebody donations from any competent adult and to reward the donor to the extent of fifty thousand dollarsassuming of course that the donor meets our rather rigid physical standards but looking at you sir you seem the picture of health that wasnt what no outright sale eh twinkled mr medway stroking his lightly graying sideburns i dont blame you for that well i think i know what you would like we can offer you one thousand dollars for what is essentially a fiftytoone chance that you will walk out of this office with everything you had when you came in plus our cheek for a thousand deposited direct to your credit account the procedure simplicity itself we bring you to a very comfortable room and present you with a tray containing fifty sealed bottles of a very fine liqueur each of them has something added fortynine of them contain a mild sleeping potion you fall asleep eight hours later you wake up you walk out the fiftiethwell sir thats the gamble eh and you can come back and repeat this process every week if you like think of that a guaranteed income a thousand dollars a week for life why we have clients who have been living off the fat of the land for years if youll let me have your credit card for identification purposes it was easier to do it than to argue stan handed it over while mr medway babbled on im sure you know sir that transparts is officially licensed by the federal government we operate under the most rigid inspection possible if you fear that there might be somewhat shall i say tinkeringwith the odds let me tell you that our license would be pulled in a minute we wouldnt dare no its a fair draw and he stopped staring at the card reader he looked up at stan his expression ugly what the fuck man youre already on our books i know that then what the hell are you doing here i just wanted to ask you a question ask theres a girl said stan her names evanie i wanted to get in touch with her she works here mr medway stared at him for a minute then laughed he tossed stans credit card back and punched a combination on his desk top yeah he said reading shes in postsession care right shes just about to go off duty you can probably catch her at the employees entrance the most astonishing thing about evanie was she still looked good a little depressed but good when she caught sight of stan her face flickered into a smile then became sadder than ever hi evanie hey stan he put his hand on her shoulder then pulled her to him and kissed her deep and long he didnt let go and she smiled up at him dont you ever wear out stan im the picture of health want to do something evanie we could go back and try out one of the other rooms at harrys stan its crazy to waste your money like that why is it crazy thats what i get it for to spend it if i run out i go back and get some more maybe you get some more maybe you never come out again and next week some guy on the twohundredandfiftieth floors wearing your balls he winced and backed away and saw that she was near tears again oh stan i hate to think of you in there why me you work there thats different i know ill be coming out at the end of the day youdo you know what they do to you in there when you lose i mean for christs sake evanie of course i know its an organ bank if i lose if i lose thats the last i know right i just dont wake up the next morning and they take me apart and heal sick people with my parts heart here lungs there anywhere somebody needs a transplant whats wrong with that he knew he was repeating what the account executive had been saying all the while he was signing up but he went on anyway my life might save i dont know ten or twenty other lives and thats a fair rate of exchange and meanwhile im off welfare ive got a few dollars in my pocket i can live like a human being stan she said hold still what are you doing she had taken something out of her purse was clipping it to his tunic thats my id badge itll get you past if they dont look at it too closely me they know im going to show you what blue balls looks like from the inside he didnt have the heart for harrys place but neither of them wanted to go back to their dorms so they wound up in a cramped but not awful hotel room rented to the desk clerks surprise for the whole night it had a good sized bed if nothing else at first stan didnt have the heart for sex either or even for talking but after a while in the gentle dark with evanie warm and tender beside him his spirits rose they screwed and drowsed whispered and explored each other and drowsed again and when it was nearly time to get up and get out evanie said stan i really like you and you turn me on better than anybody else i ever knew me too evanie i wouldnt have believed it even here without the sets without the forgetit its as good as harrys place with anybody else dont say that stan you didnt let me finish its no good stan im not going to see you again fist to the solar plexus when he hadnt been expecting an attack he got his breath evanie that doesnt make sense to me it makes sense every dollar you spend its a piece of your body what did it cost you for the night a hundred dollars that brings you a hundred dollars closer to the time you go back to blue balls and take your chances again i cant stand that stan itll drive me up the wall if i let it im willing to take the chance im not stan dont you remember what ijust showed you the usedup stiffs with nothing left you want to be like that one leg a head without the eyes or ears plastic tubing where your gut used to be pumping along on a heartlung machine until somebody decides theres not enough left of you to sell and they pull the plug stan winced he had been devoting a lot of his attention that whole night to trying to forget all that they werent all like that he protested some of them looked just fine like they were only asleep asleep yeah they keep some goingrare blood types they just keep them on the machine to make blood to sell for a while anyway but theyre not asleep when you do it to a frog you call it pithing the brains disconnected theres nothing there but a vegetable and even so you didnt look too close because they take off all the spare parts they can anyway whats a blood factory need with a weenie stan but some old guyll pay plenty of money for it you think i like it when i feel you inside me like that thinking that same thing might be in me some other time but with some other guy on the other end of it oh hell evanie at least youre a man she said morosely you see those pregnant women in the shops theyre making babies for somebody of course they dont feel anything because theyre pithed too but i feel i look at them and think about myself being there after somebody has reached way up inside me with a light pipe and a flexible forceps and pulled out my own ovum and thrown it away and stuck in some other womans ovum and then they fertilize it with sperm from her husband or her boy friend or whoever she pushed her pillow up and sat higher looking down at him if youre the customer its okay you get the baby and you dont have to pay off in morning sickness or looking funny just in money daddy turns in a sperm sample mom picks out a nicelooking breeder female from the photograph albumof course the picture shows her the way she used to be not the way she is now a couple quick squirts on the day shift and nine months later the hulk on the heartlung machine squeezes out junior for you evanie so i cant take it stan if we had some real money you know enough for six months or so if you had a job but thats not the way it is my job wont keep us both it barely keeps me off welfare i dont want to go back to living on the fortieth floor i dont want you to do that and i know you cant get a job stan im not blaming you im just telling you what i can take and this is past it how did you get the job evanie i laid the right people what did you think oh he scratched uncomfortably do you suppose i who are you going to screw mr medway any of the account execs male or female they dont need you stan no offense youre a real great guy you know i think you are but that was just luck and a section chief who liked young chicks and it wont happen again in a million years those guys in the upper brackets at blue balls they dont just get salaries they get a commission for keeping you on the hook stan for making sure you come in and take your bottle of fluid every week they go to school for that psychology salesmanship once theyve got the degree theyre set for life and they can buy whatever they want even you if they wanted you bad enough a lot cheaper than putting you on the payroll so this is it stan i hope i never see you again especially at work he kept the room an extra day the hell with the expense and got a decent sleep and followed it up with a shower clean clothes from the slot machines and the best meal he could find that didnt take more than half an hour to eat half an hour was as long as he was sure his courage would hold out and then he took the transit elevator up to the blue balls office i want to talk to medway he told the receptionist mr medway im afraid hes with a client just now but one of our other account executives medway tell him hes got a live one when mr medway appeared it took him a moment to recognize stan oh the one who was looking for the girl didnt she work out you want to pick another no mr medway i want to make a deal i want to take twenty bottles one after another i walk out of here with twenty thousand dollars or you get to keep the bod medway sank back behind his desk thumbs in his armpits looking at stan youre a real gambler he said admiringly but you cant do that itd kill you twenty is an overdose ill take that chance medway i want the money i want to take it and he hesitated all right i want to take it and go to school and train for your job i want real money medway wow said medway softly i have to say i admire your spirit well you cant do it the way you say but transparts is willing to roll the dice with any of its clients any stakes just so its a fair shot how about this you get your choice of two bottles one puts you to sleep for the night the other thats a fiftyfifty chance and what you get if you win is twentyfive thousand dollars or if youre really hot you can take the long shot the same fifty bottles as always only this time only one of them is just a sleeping pill all the other fortynine are toobad charlie thats a fortyninetoone shot according to the arithmetic but transparts is willing to absorb the difference so if you win that one you walk away with fifty thou you can even get a hundred to one if you want it or a thousand you name it well set it up just so the arithmetic works out a thousand to one my god a million dollars but to have only one chance in a thousand of surviving if i take the twentyfive he said good bet nodded medway when right now medway punched a combination into his desk top and stood up come on theyll have it ready for you by the time we get there and so they did the standard room with its single bed and vase of flowers and on the sideboard the little tray of bottles but this time there were only two on it you could spend the whole night arguing which is which stan thought grayly and reached out for the nearer he flipped off the top and drank it down might as well get a good nights sleep he said turning toward the bed so long medway he didnt look around as the account executive went out and so he didnt see that someone had come in until she said i really liked you stan i mean it he turned around feet tingling in his pants legs evanie go ahead stan get into bed youll be feeling it in a minute i know and he was the same warm whirling that he had felt every other time that was good but not really good he thought the killer dose would feel the same going down he just wouldnt ever wake up he tried a pleasantry i thought maybe you were coming to to the words got harder and harder to get out but she knew what he meant not this time sweetie she said drawing the cover over him i just came in because i wanted to tell you two things wh he couldnt even finish the at that i really liked you and that it wasnt anything personal stan you see i get a commission too
