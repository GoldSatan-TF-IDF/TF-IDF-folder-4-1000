the transference went smoothly like a scalpel slicing into skin cohen was simultaneously excited and disappointed he was thrilled to be here perhaps the judge was right perhaps this was indeed where he really belonged but the gleaming edge was taken off that thrill because it wasnt accompanied by the usual physiological signs of excitement no sweaty palms no racing heart no rapid breathing oh there was a heartbeat to be sure thundering in the background but it wasnt cohens it was the dinosaurs everything was the dinosaurs cohen saw the world now through tyrannosaur eyes the colors seemed all wrong surely plant leaves must be the same chlorophyll green here in the mesozoic but the dinosaur saw them as navy blue the sky was lavender the dirt underfoot ash gray old bones had different cones thought cohen well he could get used to it after all he had no choice he would finish his life as an observer inside this tyrannosaurs mind hed see what the beast saw hear what it heard feel what it felt he wouldnt be able to control its movements they had said but he would be able to experience every sensation the rex was marching forward cohen hoped blood would still look red it wouldnt be the same if it wasnt red and what ms cohen did your husband say before he left your house on the night in question he said he was going out to hunt humans but i thought he was making a joke no interpretations please ms cohen just repeat for the court as precisely as you remember it exactly what your husband said he said im going out to hunt humans thank you ms cohen that concludes the crowns case my lady the needlepoint on the wall of the honourable madam justice amanda hoskinss chambers had been made for her by her husband it was one of her favorite verses from the mikado and as she was preparing sentencing she would often look up and reread the words my object all sublime i shall achieve in time to let the punishment fit the crime the punishment fit the crime this was a difficult case a horrible case judge hoskins continued to think it wasnt just colors that were wrong the view from inside the tyrannosaurs skull was different in other ways too the tyrannosaur had only partial stereoscopic vision there was an area in the center of cohens field of view that showed true depth perception but because the beast was somewhat walleyed it had a much wider panorama than normal for a human a kind of saurian cinemascope covering degrees the wideangle view panned back and forth as the tyrannosaur scanned along the horizon scanning for prey scanning for something to kill the calgary herald thursday october hardcopy edition serial killer rudolph cohen was sentenced to death yesterday formerly a prominent member of the alberta college of physicians and surgeons dr cohen was convicted in august of thirtyseven counts of firstdegree murder in chilling testimony cohen had admitted without any signs of remorse to having terrorized each of his victims for hours before slitting their throats with surgical implements this is the first time in eighty years that the death penalty has been ordered in this country in passing sentence madam justice amanda hoskins observed that cohen was the most coldblooded and brutal killer to have stalked canadas prairies since tyrannosaurus rex from behind a stand of dawn redwoods about ten meters away a second tyrannosaur appeared cohen suspected tyrannosaurs might be fiercely territorial since each animal would require huge amounts of meat he wondered if the beast he was in would attack the other individual his dinosaur tilted its head to look at the second rex which was standing in profile but as it did so almost all of the dinos mental picture dissolved into a white void as if when concentrating on details the beasts tiny brain simply lost track of the big picture at first cohen thought his rex was looking at the other dinosaurs head but soon the top of others skull the tip of its muzzle and the back of its powerful neck faded away into snowy nothingness all that was left was a picture of the throat good thought cohen one shearing bite there could kill the animal the skin of the others throat appeared graygreen and the throat itself was smooth maddeningly cohens rex did not attack rather it simply swiveled its head and looked out at the horizon again in a flash of insight cohen realized what had happened other kids in his neighborhood had had pet dogs or cats hed had lizards and snakes coldblooded carnivores a fact to which expert psychological witnesses had attached great weight some kinds of male lizards had dewlap sacks hanging from their necks the rex he was in a male the tyrrell paleontologists had believed had looked at this other one and seen that she was smooththroated and therefore a female something to be mated with perhaps rather than to attack perhaps they would mate soon cohen had never orgasmed except during the act of killing he wondered what it would feel like we spent a billion dollars developing time travel and now you tell me the system is useless well that is what youre saying isnt it professor that chronotransference has no practical applications not exactly minister the system does work we can project a human beings consciousness back in time superimposing his or her mind overtop of that of someone who lived in the past with no way to sever the link wonderful thats not true the link severs automatically right when the historical person youve transferred consciousness into dies the link is broken precisely and then the person from our time whose consciousness youve transferred back dies as well i admit thats an unfortunate consequence of linking two brains so closely so im right this whole damn chronotransference thing is useless oh not at all minister in fact i think ive got the perfect application for it the rex marched along although cohens attention had first been arrested by the beasts vision he slowly became aware of its other senses too he could hear the sounds of the rexs footfalls of twigs and vegetation being crushed of birds or pterosaurs singing and underneath it all the relentless drone of insects still all the sounds were dull and low the rexs simple ears were incapable of picking up highpitched noises and what sounds they did detect were discerned without richness cohen knew the late cretaceous must have been a symphony of varied tone but it was as if he was listening to it through earmuffs the rex continued along still searching cohen became aware of several more impressions of the world both inside and out including hot afternoon sun beating down on him and a hungry gnawing in the beasts belly food it was the closest thing to a coherent thought that hed yet detected from the animal a mental picture of bolts of meat going down its gullet food the social services preservation act of canada is built upon the principle of the social safety net a series of entitlements and programs designed to ensure a high standard of living for every citizen however everincreasing life expectancies coupled with constant lowering of the mandatory retirement age have placed an untenable burden on our socialwelfare system and in particular its cornerstone program of universal health care with most taxpayers ceasing to work at the age of and with average canadians living to be or the system is in danger of complete collapse accordingly all social programs will henceforth be available only to those below the age of with one exception all canadians regardless of age may take advantage at no charge to themselves of governmentsponsored euthanasia through chronotransference there up ahead something moving big whatever it was an indistinct outline only intermittently visible behind a small knot of fir trees a quadruped of some sort its back to him it them ah there turning now peripheral vision dissolving into albino nothingness as the rex concentrated on the head three horns triceratops glorious cohen had spent hours as a boy pouring over books about dinosaurs looking for scenes of carnage no battles were better than those in which tyrannosaurus rex squared off against triceratops a fourfooted mesozoic tank with a trio of horns projecting from its face and a shield of bone rising from the back of its skull to protect the neck and yet the rex marched on no thought cohen turn damn you turn and attack cohen remembered when it had all begun that fateful day so many years ago so many years from now it should have been a routine operation the patient had supposedly been prepped properly cohen brought his scalpel down toward the abdomen then with a steady hand sliced into the skin the patient gasped it had been a wonderful sound a beautiful sound not enough gas the anesthetist hurried to make an adjustment cohen knew he had to hear that sound again he had to the tyrannosaur continued forward cohen couldnt see its legs but he could feel them moving left right up down attack you bastard left attack right go after it up go after the triceratops dow the beast hesitated its left leg still in the air balancing briefly on one foot attack attack and then at last the rex changed course the ceratopsian appeared in the threedimensional central part of the tyrannosaurs field of view like a target at the end of a gun sight welcome to the chronotransference institute if i can just see your government benefits card please yup theres always a last time for everything heh heh now im sure you want an exciting death the problem is finding somebody interesting who hasnt been used yet see we can only ever superimpose one mind onto a given historical personage all the really obvious ones have been done already im afraid we still get about a dozen calls a week asking for jack kennedy but he was one of the first to go so to speak if i may make a suggestion though weve got thousands of roman legion officers cataloged those tend to be very satisfying deaths how about a nice something from the gallic wars the triceratops looked up its giant head lifting from the wide flat gunnera leaves it had been chewing on now that the rex had focussed on the planteater it seemed to commit itself the tyrannosaur charged the hornface was sideways to the rex it began to turn to bring its armored head to bear the horizon bounced wildly as the rex ran cohen could hear the things heart thundering loudly rapidly a barrage of muscular gunfire the triceratops still completing its turn opened its parrotlike beak but no sound came out giant strides closed the distance between the two animals cohen felt the rexs jaws opening wide wider still mandibles popping from their sockets the jaws slammed shut on the hornfaces back over the shoulders cohen saw two of the rexs own teeth fly into view knocked out by the impact the taste of hot blood surging out of the wound the rex pulled back for another bite the triceratops finally got its head swung around it surged forward the long spear over its left eye piercing into the rexs leg pain exquisite beautiful pain the rex roared cohen heard it twice once reverberating within the animals own skull a second time echoing back from distant hills a flock of silverfurred pterosaurs took to the air cohen saw them fade from view as the dinosaurs simple mind shut them out of the display irrelevant distractions the triceratops pulled back the horn withdrawing from the rexs flesh blood cohen was delighted to see still looked red if judge hoskins had ordered the electric chair said axworthy cohens lawyer we could have fought that on charter grounds cruel and unusual punishment and all that but shes authorized full access to the chronotransference euthanasia program for you axworthy paused she said bluntly that she simply wants you dead how thoughtful of her said cohen axworthy ignored that im sure i can get you anything you want he said who would you like to be transferred into not who said cohen what i beg your pardon that damned judge said i was the most coldblooded killer to stalk the alberta landscape since tyrannosaurus rex cohen shook his head the idiot doesnt she know dinosaurs were warmblooded anyway thats what i want i want to be transferred into a t rex youre kidding kidding is not my forte john killing is i want to know which was better at it me or the rex i dont even know if they can do that kind of thing said axworthy find out damn you what the hell am i paying you for the rex danced to the side moving with surprising agility for a creature of its bulk and once again it brought its terrible jaws down on the ceratopsians shoulder the planteater was hemorrhaging at an incredible rate as though a thousand sacrifices had been performed on the altar of its back the triceratops tried to lunge forward but it was weakening quickly the tyrannosaur crafty in its own way despite its trifling intellect simply retreated a dozen giant paces the hornface took one tentative step toward it and then another and with great and ponderous effort one more but then the dinosaurian tank teetered and eyelids slowly closing collapsed on its side cohen was briefly startled then thrilled to hear it fall to the ground with a splash he hadnt realized just how much blood had poured out of the great rent the rex had made in the beasts back the tyrannosaur moved in lifting its left leg up and then smashing it down on the triceratopss belly the three sharp toe claws tearing open the things abdomen entrails spilling out into the harsh sunlight cohen thought the rex would let out a victorious roar but it didnt it simply dipped its muzzle into the body cavity and methodically began yanking out chunks of flesh cohen was disappointed the battle of the dinosaurs had been fun the killing had been well engineered and there had certainly been enough blood but there was no terror no sense that the triceratops had been quivering with fear no begging for mercy no feeling of power of control just dumb mindless brutes moving in ways preprogrammed by their genes it wasnt enough not nearly enough judge hoskins looked across the desk in her chambers at the lawyer a tyrannosaurus mr axworthy i was speaking figuratively i understand that my lady but it was an appropriate observation dont you think ive contacted the chronotransference people who say they can do it if they have a rex specimen to work from they have to backpropagate from actual physical material in order to get a temporal fix judge hoskins was as unimpressed by scientific babble as she was by legal jargon make your point mr axworthy i called the royal tyrrell museum of paleontology in drumheller and asked them about the tyrannosaurus fossils available worldwide turns out theres only a handful of complete skeletons but they were able to provide me with an annotated list giving as much information as they could about the individual probable causes of death he slid a thin plastic printout sheet across the judges wide desk leave this with me counsel ill get back to you axworthy left and hoskins scanned the brief list she then leaned back in her leather chair and began to read the needlepoint on her wall for the thousandth time my object all sublime i shall achieve in time she read that line again her lips moving slightly as she subvocalized the words i shall achieve in time the judge turned back to the list of tyrannosaur finds ah that one yes that would be perfect she pushed a button on her phone david see if you can find mr axworthy for me there had been a very unusual aspect to the triceratops kill an aspect that intrigued cohen chronotransference had been performed countless times it was one of the most popular forms of euthanasia sometimes the transferees original body would give an ongoing commentary about what was going on as if talking during sleep it was clear from what they said that transferees couldnt exert any control over the bodies they were transferred into indeed the physicists had claimed any control was impossible chronotransference worked precisely because the transferee could exert no influence and therefore was simply observing things that had already been observed since no new observations were being made no quantummechanical distortions occurred after all said the physicists if one could exert control one could change the past and that was impossible and yet when cohen had willed the rex to alter its course it eventually had done so could it be that the rex had so little brains that cohens thoughts could control the beast madness the ramifications were incredible still he had to know if it was true the rex was torpid flopped on its belly gorged on ceratopsian meat it seemed prepared to lie here for a long time to come enjoying the early evening breeze get up thought cohen get up damn you nothing no response get up the rexs lower jaw was resting on the ground its upper jaw was lifted high its mouth wide open tiny pterosaurs were flitting in and out of the open maw their long needlelike beaks apparently yanking gobbets of hornface flesh from between the rexs curved teeth get up thought cohen again get up the rex stirred up the tyrannosaur used its tiny forelimbs to keep its torso from sliding forward as it pushed with its powerful legs until it was standing forward thought cohen forward the beasts body felt different its belly was full to bursting forward with ponderous steps the rex began to march it was wonderful to be in control again cohen felt the old thrill of the hunt and he knew exactly what he was looking for judge hoskins says okay said axworthy shes authorized for you to be transferred into that new t rex theyve got right here in alberta at the tyrrell its a young adult they say judging by the way the skeleton was found the rex died falling probably into a fissure both legs and the back were broken but the skeleton remained almost completely articulated suggesting that scavengers couldnt get at it unfortunately the chronotransference people say that backpropagating that far into the past they can only plug you in a few hours before the accident occurred but youll get your wish youre going to die as a tyrannosaur oh and here are the books you asked for a complete library on cretaceous flora and fauna you should have time to get through it all the chronotransference people will need a couple of weeks to set up as the prehistoric evening turned to night cohen found what he had been looking for cowering in some underbrush large brown eyes long drawnout face and a lithe body covered in fur that to the tyrannosaurs eyes looked bluebrown a mammal but not just any mammal purgatorius the very first primate known from montana and alberta from right at the end of the cretaceous a little guy only about ten centimeters long excluding its ratlike tail rare creatures these days only a precious few the little furball could run quickly for its size but a single step by the tyrannosaur equaled more than a hundred of the mammals there was no way it could escape the rex leaned in close and cohen saw the furballs face the nearest thing there would be to a human face for another sixty million years the animals eyes went wide in terror naked raw fear mammalian fear cohen saw the creature scream heard it scream it was beautiful the rex moved its gaping jaws in toward the little mammal drawing in breath with such force that it sucked the creature into its maw normally the rex would swallow its meals whole but cohen prevented the beast from doing that instead he simply had it stand still with the little primate running around terrified inside the great cavern of the dinosaurs mouth banging into the giant teeth and great fleshy walls and skittering over the massive dry tongue cohen savored the terrified squealing he wallowed in the sensation of the animal mad with fear moving inside that living prison and at last with a great glorious release cohen put the animal out of its misery allowing the rex to swallow it the furball tickling as it slid down the giants throat it was just like old times just like hunting humans and then a wonderful thought occurred to cohen why if he killed enough of these little screaming balls of fur they wouldnt have any descendants there wouldnt ever be any homo sapiens in a very real sense cohen realized he was hunting humans every single human being who would ever exist of course a few hours wouldnt be enough time to kill many of them judge hoskins no doubt thought it was wonderfully poetic justice or she wouldnt have allowed the transfer sending him back to fall into the pit damned stupid judge why now that he could control the beast there was no way he was going to let it die young hed just there it was the fissure a long gash in the earth with a crumbling edge damn it was hard to see the shadows cast by neighboring trees made a confusing gridwork on the ground that obscured the ragged opening no wonder the dullwitted rex had missed seeing it until it was too late but not this time turn left thought cohen left his rex obeyed hed avoid this particular area in future just to be on the safe side besides there was plenty of territory to cover fortunately this was a young rex a juvenile there would be decades in which to continue his very special hunt cohen was sure that axworthy knew his stuff once it became apparent that the link had lasted longer than a few hours hed keep any attempt to pull the plug tied up in the courts for years cohen felt the old pressure building in himself and in the rex the tyrannosaur marched on this was better than old times he thought much better hunting all of humanity the release would be wonderful he watched intently for any sign of movement in the underbrush the end
