the mighty van that freedom leads her glorious standard flaming to the day the crimsoned pavement where a hero bleeds breathes nobler lessons than the poets lay strong arms broad breasts brave hearts are better worth than strains that sing the ravished echoes dumb hark t is the loud reverberating drum rolls oer the prairied west the rockbound north the myriadhanded future stretches forth its shadowy palms behold we come we come turn oer these idle leaves such toys as these were not unsought for as in languid dreams we lay beside our lotusfeeding streams and nursed our fancies in forgetful ease it matters little if they pall or please dropping untimely while the sudden gleams glare from the mustering clouds whose blackness seems too swollen to hold its lightning from the trees yet in some lull of passion when at last these calm revolving moons that come and go turning our months to years they creep so slow have brought us rest the not unwelcome past may flutter to thee through these leaflets cast on the wild winds that all around us blow may agnes the story of sir harry frankland and agnes surriage is told in the ballad with a very strict adhesion to the facts these were obtained from information afforded me by the rev mr webster of hopkinton in company with whom i visited the frankland mansion in that town then standing from a very interesting memoir by the rev elias nason of medford and from the manuscript diary of sir harry or more properly sir charles henry frankland now in the library of the massachusetts historical society at the time of the visit referred to old julia was living and on our return we called at the house where she resided she was living june when this ballad was published her account is little more than paraphrased in the poem if the incidents are treated with a certain liberality at the close of the fifth part the essential fact that agnes rescued sir harry from the ruins after the earthquake and their subsequent marriage as related may be accepted as literal truth so with regard to most of the trifling details which are given they are taken from the record it is greatly to be regretted that the frankland mansion no longer exists it was accidentally burned on the d of january a year or two after the first sketch of this ballad was written a visit to it was like stepping out of the century into the years before the revolution a new house similar in plan and arrangements to the old one has been built upon its site and the terraces the clump of box and the lilacs doubtless remain to bear witness to the truth of this story the story which i have told literally in rhyme has been made the subject of a carefully studied and interesting romance by mr e l bynner part first the knight the tale i tell is gospel true as all the bookmen know and pilgrims who have strayed to view the wrecks still left to show the old old story fair and young and fond and not too wise that matrons tell with sharpened tongue to maids with downcast eyes ah maidens err and matrons warn beneath the coldest sky love lurks amid the tasselled corn as in the bearded rye but who would dream our sober sires had learned the old worlds ways and warmed their hearths with lawless fires in shirleys homespun days t is like some poets pictured trance his idle rhymes recite this old new englandborn romance of agnes and the knight yet known to all the country round their home is standing still between wachusetts lonely mound and shawmuts threefold hill one hour we rumble on the rail one halfhour guide the rein we reach at last oer hill and dale the village on the plain with blackening wall and mossy roof with stained and warping floor a stately mansion stands aloof and bars its haughty door this lowlier portal may be tried that breaks the gable wall and lo with arches opening wide sir harry franklands hall t was in the second georges day they sought the forest shade the knotted trunks they cleared away the massive beams they laid they piled the rockhewn chimney tall they smoothed the terraced ground they reared the marblepillared wall that fenced the mansion round far stretched beyond the village bound the masters broad domain with page and valet horse and hound he kept a goodly train and all the midland county through the ploughman stopped to gaze wheneer his chariot swept in view behind the shining bays with mute obeisance grave and slow repaid by nod polite for such the way with high and low till after concord fight nor less to courtly circles known that graced the threehilled town with faroff splendors of the throne and glimmerings from the crown wise phipps who held the seals of state for shirley over sea brave knowles whose pressgang moved of late the king street mobs decree and judges grave and colonels grand fair dames and stately men the mighty people of the land the world of there and then t was strange no chloes beauteous form and eyes ccelestial blew this strephon of the west could warm no nymph his heart subdue perchance he wooed as gallants use whom fleeting loves enchain but still unfettered free to choose would brook no bridlerein he saw the fairest of the fair but smiled alike on all no band his roving foot might snare no ring his hand enthrall part second the maiden why seeks the knight that rocky cape beyond the bay of lynn what chance his wayward course may shape to reach its village inn no story tells whateer we guess the past lies deaf and still but fate who rules to blight or bless can lead us where she will make way sir harrys coach and four and liveried grooms that ride they cross the ferry touch the shore on winnisimmets side they hear the wash on chelsea beach the level marsh they pass where miles on miles the desert reach is rough with bitter grass the shining horses foam and pant and now the smells begin of fishy swampscott salt nahant and leatherscented lynn next on their left the slender spires and glittering vanes that crown the home of salems frugal sires the old witchhaunted town so onward oer the rugged way that runs through rocks and sand showered by the tempestdriven spray from bays on either hand that shut between their outstretched arms the crews of marblehead the lords of oceans watery farms who plough the waves for bread at last the ancient inn appears the spreading elm below whose flapping sign these fifty years has seesawed to and fro how fair the azure fields in sight before the lowbrowed inn the tumbling billows fringe with light the crescent shore of lynn nahant thrusts outward through the waves her arm of yellow sand and breaks the roaring surge that braves the gauntlet on her hand with eddying whirl the waters lock yon treeless mound forlorn the sharpwinged seafowls breedingrock that fronts the spouting horn then free the whitesailed shallops glide and wide the ocean smiles till shoreward bent his streams divide the two bare misery isles the masters silent signal stays the wearied cavalcade the coachman reins his smoking bays beneath the elmtrees shade a gathering on the village green the cockedhats crowd to see on legs in ancient velveteen with buckles at the knee a clustering round the taverndoor of squaretoed village boys still wearing as their grandsires wore the oldworld corduroys a scampering at the fountain inn a rush of great and small with hurrying servants mingled din and screaming matrons call poor agnes with her work half done they caught her unaware as humbly like a praying nun she knelt upon the stair bent oer the steps with lowliest mien she knelt but not to pray her little hands must keep them clean and wash their stains away a foot an ankle bare and white her girlish shapes betrayed ha nymphs and graces spoke the knight look up my beauteous maid she turned a reddening rose in bud its calyx half withdrawn her cheek on fire with damasked blood of girlhoods glowing dawn he searched her features through and through as royal lovers look on lowly maidens when they woo without the ring and book come hither fair one here my sweet nay prithee look not down take this to shoe those little feet he tossed a silver crown a sudden paleness struck her brow a swifter blush succeeds it burns her cheek it kindles now beneath her golden beads she flitted but the glittering eye still sought the lovely face who was she what and whence and why doomed to such menial place a skippers daughter so they said left orphan by the gale that cost the fleet of marblehead and gloucester thirty sail ah many a lonely home is found along the essex shore that cheered its goodman outward bound and sees his face no more not so the matron whispered sure no orphan girl is she the surriage folk are deadly poor since edward left the sea and mary with her growing brood has work enough to do to find the children clothes and food with thomas john and hugh this girl of marys growing tall just turned her sixteenth year to earn her bread and help them all would work as housemaid here so agnes with her golden beads and naught beside as dower grew at the wayside with the weeds herself a gardenflower t was strange t was sad so fresh so fair thus pitys voice began such grace an angels shape and air the halfheard whisper ran for eyes could see in georges time as now in later days and lips could shape in prose and rhyme the honeyed breath of praise no time to woo the train must go long ere the sun is down to reach before the nightwinds blow the manysteepled town t is midnight street and square are still dark roll the whispering waves that lap the piers beneath the hill ridged thick with ancient graves ah gentle sleep thy hand will smooth the weary couch of pain when all thy poppies fail to soothe the lovers throbbing brain t is morn the orangemantled sun breaks through the fading gray and long and loud the castle gun peals oer the glistening bay thank god t is day with eager eye he hails the morning shine if art can win or gold can buy the maiden shall be mine part third the conquest who saw this hussy when she came what is the wench and who they whisper agnes is her name pray what has she to do the housemaids parley at the gate the scullions on the stair and in the footmens grave debate the butler deigns to share black dinah stolen when a child and sold on boston pier grown up in service petted spoiled speaks in the coachmans ear what all this household at his will and all are yet too few more servants and more servants still this pert young madam too servant fine servant laughed aloud the man of coach and steeds she looks too fair she steps too proud this girl with golden beads i tell you you may fret and frown and call her what you choose you ll find my lady in her gown your mistress in her shoes ah gentle maidens free from blame god grant you never know the little whisper loud with shame that makes the world your foe why tell the lordly flatterers art that won the maidens ear the fluttering of the frightened heart the blush the smile the tear alas it were the saddening tale that every language knows the wooing wind the yielding sail the sunbeam and the rose and now the gown of sober stuff has changed to fair brocade with broidered hem and hanging cuff and flower of silken braid and clasped around her blanching wrist a jewelled bracelet shines her flowing tresses massive twist a glittering net confines and mingling with their truant wave a fretted chain is hung but ah the gift her mother gave its beads are all unstrung her place is at the masters board where none disputes her claim she walks beside the mansions lord his bride in all but name the busy tongues have ceased to talk or speak in softened tone so gracious in her daily walk the angel light has shown no want that kindness may relieve assails her heart in vain the lifting of a ragged sleeve will check her palfreys rein a thoughtful calm a quiet grace in every movement shown reveal her moulded for the place she may not call her own and save that on her youthful brow there broods a shadowy care no matron sealed with holy vow in all the land so fair part fourth the rescue a ship comes foaming up the bay along the pier she glides before her furrow melts away a courier mounts and rides haste haste post haste the letters bear sir harry frankland these sad news to tell the loving pair the knight must cross the seas alas we part the lips that spoke lost all their rosy red as when a crystal cup is broke and all its wine is shed nay droop not thus whereer he cried i go by land or sea my love my life my joy my pride thy place is still by me through town and city far and wide their wandering feet have strayed from alpine lake to ocean tide and cold sierras shade at length they see the waters gleam amid the fragrant bowers where lisbon mirrors in the stream her belt of ancient towers red is the orange on its bough tomorrows sun shall fling oer cintras hazelshaded brow the flush of aprils wing the streets are loud with noisy mirth they dance on every green the mornings dial marks the birth of proud braganzas queen at eve beneath their pictured dome the gilded courtiers throng the broad moidores have cheated rome of all her lords of song ah lisbon dreams not of the day pleased with her painted scenes when all her towers shall slide away as now these canvas screens the spring has passed the summer fled and yet they linger still though autumns rustling leaves have spread the flank of cintras hill the town has learned their saxon name and touched their english gold nor tale of doubt nor hint of blame from over sea is told three hours the first november dawn has climbed with feeble ray through mists like heavy curtains drawn before the darkened day how still the muffled echoes sleep hark hark a hollow sound a noise like chariots rumbling deep beneath the solid ground the channel lifts the water slides and bares its bar of sand anon a mountain billow strides and crashes oer the land the turrets lean the steeples reel like masts on oceans swell and clash a long discordant peal the deathdoomed citys knell the pavement bursts the earth upheaves beneath the staggering town the turrets crack the castle cleaves the spires come rushing down around the lurid mountains glow with strange unearthly gleams while black abysses gape below then close in jagged seams and all is over street and square in ruined heaps are piled ah where is she so frail so fair amid the tumult wild unscathed she treads the wreckpiled street whose narrow gaps afford a pathway for her bleeding feet to seek her absent lord a temples broken walls arrest her wild and wandering eyes beneath its shattered portal pressed her lord unconscious lies the power that living hearts obey shall lifeless blocks withstand love led her footsteps where he lay love nerves her womans hand one cry the marble shaft she grasps up heaves the ponderous stone he breathes her fainting form he clasps her life has bought his own part fifth the reward how like the starless night of death our beings brief eclipse when faltering heart and failing breath have bleached the fading lips the earth has folded like a wave and thrice a thousand score clasped shroudless in their closing grave the sun shall see no more she lives what guerdon shall repay his debt of ransomed life one word can charm all wrongs away the sacred name of wife the love that won her girlish charms must shield her matron fame and write beneath the frankland arms the village beautys name go call the priest no vain delay shall dim the sacred ring who knows what change the passing day the fleeting hour may bring before the holy altar bent there kneels a goodly pair a stately man of high descent a woman passing fair no jewels lend the blinding sheen that meaner beauty needs but on her bosom heaves unseen a string of golden beads the vow is spoke the prayer is said and with a gentle pride the lady agnes lifts her head sir harry franklands bride no more her faithful heart shall bear those griefs so meekly borne the passing sneer the freezing stare the icy look of scorn no more the blueeyed english dames their haughty lips shall curl wheneer a hissing whisper names the poor new england girl but stay his mothers haughty brow the pride of ancient race will plighted faith and holy vow win back her fond embrace too well she knew the saddening tale of love no vow had blest that turned his blushing honors pale and stained his knightly crest they seek his northern home alas he goes alone before his own dear agnes may not pass the proud ancestral door he stood before the stately dame he spoke she calmly heard but not to pity nor to blame she breathed no single word he told his love her faith betrayed she heard with tearless eyes could she forgive the erring maid she stared in cold surprise how fond her heart he told how true the haughty eyelids fell the kindly deeds she loved to do she murmured it is well but when he told that fearful day and how her feet were led to where entombed in life he lay the breathing with the dead and how she bruised her tender breasts against the crushing stone that still the strongarmed clown protests no man can lift alone oh then the frozen spring was broke by turns she wept and smiled sweet agnes so the mother spoke god bless my angel child she saved thee from the jaws of death t is thine to right her wrongs i tell thee i who gave thee breath to her thy life belongs thus agnes won her noble name her lawless lovers hand the lowly maiden so became a lady in the land part sixth conclusion the tale is done it little needs to track their after ways and string again the golden beads of loves uncounted days they leave the fair ancestral isle for bleak new englands shore how gracious is the courtly smile of all who frowned before again through lisbons orange bowers they watch the rivers gleam and shudder as her shadowy towers shake in the trembling stream fate parts at length the fondest pair his cheek alas grows pale the breast that trampling death could spare his noiseless shafts assail he longs to change the heaven of blue for englands clouded sky to breathe the air his boyhood knew he seeks then but to die hard by the terraced hillside town where healing streamlets run still sparkling with their old renown the waters of the sun the lady agnes raised the stone that marks his honored grave and there sir harry sleeps alone by wiltshire avons wave the home of early love was dear she sought its peaceful shade and kept her state for many a year with none to make afraid at last the evil days were come that saw the red cross fall she hears the rebels rattling drum farewell to frankland hall i tell you as my tale began the hall is standing still and you kind listener maid or man may see it if you will the box is glistening huge and green like trees the lilacs grow three elms higharching still are seen and one lies stretched below the hangings rough with velvet flowers flap on the latticed wall and oer the mossy ridgepole towers the rockhewn chimney tall the doors on mighty hinges clash with massive bolt and bar the heavy englishmoulded sash scarce can the nightwinds jar behold the chosen room he sought alone to fast and pray each year as chill november brought the dismal earthquake day there hung the rapier blade he wore bent in its flattened sheath the coat the shrieking woman tore caught in her clenching teeth the coat with tarnished silver lace she snapped at as she slid and down upon her deathwhite face crashed the huge coffins lid a graded terrace yet remains if on its turf you stand and look along the wooded plains that stretch on either hand the broken forest walls define a dim receding view where on the far horizons line he cut his vista through if further story you shall crave or ask for living proof go see old julia born a slave beneath sir harrys roof she told me half that i have told and she remembers well the mansion as it looked of old before its glories fell the box when round the terraced square its glossy wall was drawn the climbing vines the snowballs fair the roses on the lawn and julia says with truthful look stamped on her wrinkled face that in her own black hands she took the coat with silver lace and you may hold the story light or if you like believe but there it was the womans bite a mouthful from the sleeve now go your ways i need not tell the moral of my rhyme but youths and maidens ponder well this tale of olden time the ploughman anniversary of the berkshire agricultural society october clear the brown path to meet his coulters gleam lo on he comes behind his smoking team with toils bright dewdrops on his sunburnt brow the lord of earth the hero of the plough first in the field before the reddening sun last in the shadows when the day is done line after line along the bursting sod marks the broad acres where his feet have trod still where he treads the stubborn clods divide the smooth fresh furrow opens deep and wide matted and dense the tangled turf upheaves mellow and dark the ridgy cornfield cleaves up the steep hillside where the laboring train slants the long track that scores the level plain through the moist valley clogged with oozing clay the patient convoy breaks its destined way at every turn the loosening chains resound the swinging ploughshare circles glistening round till the wide field one billowy waste appears and wearied hands unbind the panting steers these are the hands whose sturdy labor brings the peasants food the golden pomp of kings this is the page whose letters shall be seen changed by the sun to words of living green this is the scholar whose immortal pen spells the first lesson hunger taught to men these are the lines which heavencommanded toil shows on his deed the charter of the soil o gracious mother whose benignant breast wakes us to life and lulls us all to rest how thy sweet features kind to every clime mock with their smile the wrinkled front of time we stain thy flowers they blossom oer the dead we rend thy bosom and it gives us bread oer the red field that trampling strife has torn waves the green plumage of thy tasselled corn our maddening conflicts sear thy fairest plain still thy soft answer is the growing grain yet o our mother while uncounted charms steal round our hearts in thine embracing arms let not our virtues in thy love decay and thy fond sweetness waste our strength away no by these hills whose banners now displayed in blazing cohorts autumn has arrayed by yon twin summits on whose splintery crests the tossing hemlocks hold the eagles nests by these fair plains the mountain circle screens and feeds with streamlets from its dark ravines true to their home these faithful arms shall toil to crown with peace their own untainted soil and true to god to freedom to mankind if her chained bandogs faction shall unbind these stately forms that bending even now bowed their strong manhood to the humble plough shall rise erect the guardians of the land the same stern iron in the same right hand till oer their hills the shouts of triumph run the sword has rescued what the ploughshare won spring winter is past the heart of nature warms beneath the wrecks of unresisted storms doubtful at first suspected more than seen the southern slopes are fringed with tender green on sheltered banks beneath the dripping eaves springs earliest nurslings spread their glowing leaves bright with the hues from wider pictures won white azure golden drift or sky or sun the snowdrop bearing on her patient breast the frozen trophy torn from winters crest the violet gazing on the arch of blue till her own iris wears its deepened hue the spendthrift crocus bursting through the mould naked and shivering with his cup of gold swelled with new life the darkening elm on high prints her thick buds against the spotted sky on all her boughs the stately chestnut cleaves the gummy shroud that wraps her embryo leaves the housefly stealing from his narrow grave drugged with the opiate that november gave beats with faint wing against the sunny pane or crawls tenacious oer its lucid plain from shaded chinks of lichencrusted walls in languid curves the gliding serpent crawls the bogs green harper thawing from his sleep twangs a hoarse note and tries a shortened leap on floating rails that face the softening noons the still shy turtles range their dark platoons or toiling aimless oer the mellowing fields trail through the grass their tessellated shields at last young april ever frail and fair wooed by her playmate with the golden hair chased to the margin of receding floods oer the soft meadows starred with opening buds in tears and blushes sighs herself away and hides her cheek beneath the flowers of may then the proud tulip lights her beacon blaze her clustering curls the hyacinth displays oer her tall blades the crested fleurdelis like blueeyed pallas towers erect and free with yellower flames the lengthened sunshine glows and love lays bare the passionbreathing rose queen of the lake along its reedy verge the rival lily hastens to emerge her snowy shoulders glistening as she strips till morn is sultan of her parted lips then bursts the song from every leafy glade the yielding seasons bridal serenade then flash the wings returning summer calls through the deep arches of her forest halls the bluebird breathing from his azure plumes the fragrance borrowed where the myrtle blooms the thrush poor wanderer dropping meekly down clad in his remnant of autumnal brown the oriole drifting like a flake of fire rent by a whirlwind from a blazing spire the robin jerking his spasmodic throat repeats imperious his staccato note the crackbrained bobolink courts his crazy mate poised on a bulrush tipsy with his weight nay in his cage the lone canary sings feels the soft air and spreads his idle wings why dream i here within these caging walls deaf to her voice while blooming nature calls peering and gazing with insatiate looks through blinding lenses or in wearying books off gloomy spectres of the shrivelled past fly with the leaves that fill the autumn blast ye imps of science whose relentless chains lock the warm tides within these living veins close your dim cavern while its captive strays dazzled and giddy in the mornings blaze the study yet in the darksome crypt i left so late whose only altar is its rusted grate sepulchral rayless joyless as it seems shamed by the glare of mays refulgent beams while the dim seasons dragged their shrouded train its paler splendors were not quite in vain from these dull bars the cheerful firelights glow streamed through the casement oer the spectral snow here while the nightwind wreaked its frantic will on the loose ocean and the rockbound hill rent the cracked topsail from its quivering yard and rived the oak a thousand storms had scarred fenced by these walls the peaceful taper shone nor felt a breath to slant its trembling cone not all unblest the mild interior scene when the red curtain spread its falling screen oer some light task the lonely hours were past and the long evening only flew too fast or the wide chair its leathern arms would lend in genial welcome to some easy friend stretched on its bosom with relaxing nerves slow moulding plastic to its hollow curves perchance indulging if of generous creed in brave sir walters dreamcompelling weed or happier still the evening hour would bring to the round table its expected ring and while the punchbowls sounding depths were stirred its silver cherubs smiling as they heard our hearts would open as at evenings hour the closesealed primrose frees its hidden flower such the warm life this dim retreat has known not quite deserted when its guests were flown nay filled with friends an unobtrusive set guiltless of calls and cards and etiquette ready to answer never known to ask claiming no service prompt for every task on those dark shelves no housewife hand profanes oer his mute files the monarch folio reigns a mingled race the wreck of chance and time that talk all tongues and breathe of every clime each knows his place and each may claim his part in some quaint corner of his masters heart this old decretal won from mosss hoards thickleaved brasscornered ribbed with oaken boards stands the gray patriarch of the graver rows its fourth ripe century narrowing to its close not daily conned but glorious still to view with glistening letters wrought in red and blue there towers stagiras allembracing sage the aldine

dreamers of an earlier age lully and geber and the learned crew that loved to talk of all they could not do why count the rest those names of later days that many love and all agree to praise or point

place i snatch the book along whose burning leaves his scarlet web our wild romancer weaves yet while proud hesters fiery pangs i share my old magnalia must be standing there the bells when oer the street the morning peal is flung from yon tall belfry with the brazen tongue its wide vibrations wafted by the gale to each far listener tell a different tale the sexton stooping to the quivering floor till the great caldron spills its brassy roar whirls the hot axle counting one by one each dull concussion till his task is done toils patient daughter when the welcome note clangs through the silence from the steeples throat streams a white unit to the checkered street demure but guessing whom she soon shall meet the bell responsive to her secret flame with every note repeats her lovers name the lover tenant of the neighboring lane sighing and fearing lest he sigh in vain hears the stern accents as they come and go their only burden one despairing no oceans rough child whom many a shore has known ere homeward breezes swept him to his own starts at the echo as it circles round a thousand memories kindling with the sound the early favorites unforgotten charms whose blue initials stain his tawny arms his first farewell the flapping canvas spread the seaward streamers crackling overhead his kind pale mother not ashamed to weep her firstborns bridal with the haggard deep while the brave father stood with tearless eye smiling and choking with his last goodby t is but a wave whose spreading circle beats with the same impulse every nerve it meets yet who shall count the varied shapes that ride on the round surge of that aerial tide o child of earth if floating sounds like these steal from thyself their power to wound or please if here or there thy changing will inclines as the bright zodiac shifts its rolling signs look at thy heart and when its depths are known then try thy brothers judging by thine own but keep thy wisdom to the narrower range while its own standards are the sport of change nor count us rebels when we disobey the passing breath that holds thy passions sway nonresistance perhaps too far in these considerate days has patience carried her submissive ways wisdom has taught us to be calm and meek to take one blow and turn the other cheek it is not written what a man shall do if the rude caitiff smite the other too land of our fathers in thine hour of need god help thee guarded by the passive creed as the lone pilgrim trusts to beads and cowl when through the forest rings the gray wolfs howl as the deep galleon trusts her gilded prow when the black corsair slants athwart her bow as the poor pheasant with his peaceful mien trusts to his feathers shining goldengreen when the dark plumage with the crimson beak has rustled shadowy from its splintered peak so trust thy friends whose babbling tongues would charm the lifted sabre from thy foemans arm thy torches ready for the answering peal from bellowing fort and thunderfreighted keel the moral bully yon wheyfaced brother who delights to wear a weedy flux of illconditioned hair seems of the sort that in a crowded place one elbows freely into smallest space a timid creature lax of knee and hip whom small disturbance whitens round the lip one of those harmless spectacled machines the holyweek of protestants convenes whom schoolboys question if their walk transcends the last advices of maternal friends whom john obedient to his masters sign conducts laborious up to ninetynine while peter glistening with luxurious scorn husks his white ivories like an ear of corn dark in the brow and bilious in the cheek whose yellowish linen flowers but once a week conspicuous annual in their threadbare suits and the laced highlows which they call their boots well mayst thou shun that dingy front severe but him o stranger him thou canst not fear be slow to judge and slower to despise man of broad shoulders and heroic size the tiger writhing from the boas rings drops at the fountain where the cobra stings in that lean phantom whose extended glove points to the text of universal love behold the master that can tame thee down to crouch the vassal of his sunday frown his velvet throat against thy corded wrist his loosened tongue against thy doubled fist the moral bully though he never swears nor kicks intruders down his entry stairs though meekness plants his backwardsloping hat and nonresistance ties his white cravat though his black broadcloth glories to be seen in the same plight with shylocks gaberdine hugs the same passion to his narrow breast that heaves the cuirass on the troopers chest hears the same hellhounds yelling in his rear that chase from port the maddened buccaneer feels the same comfort while his acrid words turn the sweet milk of kindness into curds or with grim logic prove beyond debate that all we love is worthiest of our hate as the scarred ruffian of the pirates deck when his long swivel rakes the staggering wreck heaven keep us all is every rascal clown whose arm is stronger free to knock us down has every scarecrow whose cachectic soul seems fresh from bedlam airing on parole who though he carries but a doubtful trace of angel visits on his hungry face from lack of marrow or the coins to pay has dodged some vices in a shabby way the right to stick us with his cutthroat terms and bait his homilies with his brother worms the minds diet no life worth naming ever comes to good if always nourished on the selfsame food the creeping mite may live so if he please and feed on stilton till he turns to cheese but cool magendie proves beyond a doubt if mammals try it that their eyes drop out no reasoning natures find it safe to feed for their sole diet on a single creed it spoils their eyeballs while it spares their tongues and starves the heart to feed the noisy lungs when the first larvae on the elm are seen the crawling wretches like its leaves are green ere chill october shakes the latest down they like the foliage change their tint to brown on the blue flower a bluer flower you spy you stretch to pluck it tis a butterfly the flattened treetoads so resemble bark theyre hard to find as ethiops in the dark the woodcock stiffening to fictitious mud cheats the young sportsman thirsting for his blood so by long living on a single lie nay on one truth will creatures get its dye red yellow green they take their subjects hue except when squabbling turns them black and blue our limitations we trust and fear we question and believe from lifes dark threads a trembling faith to weave frail as the web that misty night has spun whose dewgemmed awnings glitter in the sun while the calm centuries spell their lessons out each truth we conquer spreads the realm of doubt when sinais summit was jehovahs throne the chosen prophet knew his voice alone when pilates hall that awful question heard the heavenly captive answered not a word eternal truth beyond our hopes and fears sweep the vast orbits of thy myriad spheres from age to age while history carves sublime on her waste rock the flaming curves of time how the wild swayings of our planet show that worlds unseen surround the world we know the old player the curtain rose in thunders long and loud the galleries rung the veteran actor bowed in flaming line the telltales of the stage showed on his brow the autograph of age pale hueless waves amid his clustered hair and umbered shadows prints of toil and care round the wide circle glanced his vacant eye he strove to speak his voice was but a sigh year after year had seen its shortlived race flit past the scenes and others take their place yet the old prompter watched his accents still his name still flaunted on the evenings bill heroes the monarchs of the scenic floor had died in earnest and were heard no more beauties whose cheeks such roseate bloom oerspread they faced the footlights in unborrowed red had faded slowly through successive shades to gray duennas foils of younger maids sweet voices lost the melting tones that start with southern throbs the sturdy saxon heart while fresh sopranos shook the painted sky with their long breathless quivering locustcry yet there he stood the man of other days in the clear presents full unsparing blaze as on the oak a faded leaf that clings while a new april spreads its burnished wings how bright yon rows that soared in triple tier their central sun the flashing chandelier how dim the eye that sought with doubtful aim some friendly smile it still might dare to claim how fresh these hearts his own how worn and cold such the sad thoughts that longdrawn sigh had told no word yet faltered on his trembling tongue again again the crashing galleries rung as the old guardsman at the bugles blast hears in its strain the echoes of the past so as the plaudits rolled and thundered round a life of memories startled at the sound he lived again the page of earliest days days of small fee and parsimonious praise then lithe young romeo hark that silvered tone from those smooth lips alas they were his own then the bronzed moor with all his love and woe told his strange tale of midnight melting snow and dark plumed hamlet with his cloak and blade looked on the royal ghost himself a shade all in one flash his youthful memories came traced in bright hues of evanescent flame as the spent swimmers in the lifelong dream while the last bubble rises through the stream call him not old whose visionary brain holds oer the past its undivided reign for him in vain the envious seasons roll who bears eternal summer in his soul if yet the minstrels song the poets lay spring with her birds or children at their play or maidens smile or heavenly dream of art stir the few lifedrops creeping round his heart turn to the record where his years are told count his gray hairs they cannot make him old what magic power has changed the faded mime one breath of memory on the dust of time as the last window in the buttressed wall of some gray minster tottering to its fall though to the passing crowd its hues are spread a dull mosaic yellow green and red viewed from within a radiant glory shows when through its pictured screen the sunlight flows and kneeling pilgrims on its storied pane see angels glow in every shapeless stain so streamed the vision through his sunken eye clad in the splendors of his morning sky all the wild hopes his eager boyhood knew all the young fancies riper years proved true the sweet lowwhispered words the winning glance from queens of song from houris of the dance wealths lavish gift and flatterys soothing phrase and beautys silence when her blush was praise and melting pride her lashes wet with tears triumphs and banquets wreaths and crowns and cheers pangs of wild joy that perish on the tongue and all that poets dream but leave unsung in every heart some viewless founts are fed from faroff hillsides where the dews were shed on the worn features of the weariest face some youthful memory leaves its hidden trace as in old gardens left by exiled kings the marble basins tell of hidden springs but gray with dust and overgrown with weeds their choking jets the passer little heeds till times revenges break their seals away and clad in rainbow light the waters play good night fond dreamer let the curtain fall the worlds a stage and we are players all a strange rehearsal kings without their crowns and threadbare lords and jewelwearing clowns speak the vain words that mock their throbbing hearts as want stern prompter spells them out their parts the tinselled hero whom we praise and pay is twice an actor in a twofold play we smile at children when a painted screen seems to their simple eyes a real scene ask the poor hireling who has left his throne to seek the cheerless home he calls his own which of his double lives most real seems the world of solid fact or scenic dreams canvas or clouds the footlights or the spheres the play of two short hours or seventy years dream on though heaven may woo our open eyes through their closed lids we look on fairer skies truth is for other worlds and hope for this the cheating future lends the presents bliss life is a running shade with fettered hands that chases phantoms over shifting sands death a still spectre on a marble seat with ever clutching palms and shackled feet the airy shapes that mock lifes slender chain the flying joys he strives to clasp in vain death only grasps to live is to pursue dream on there s nothing but illusion true a poem dedication of the pittsfield cemetery september angel of death extend thy silent reign stretch thy dark sceptre oer this new domain no sable car along the winding road has borne to earth its unresisting load no sudden mound has risen yet to show where the pale slumberer folds his arms below no marble gleams to bid his memory live in the brief lines that hurrying time can give yet o destroyer from thy shrouded throne look on our gift this realm is all thine own fair is the scene its sweetness oft beguiled from their dim paths the children of the wild the darkhaired maiden loved its grassy dells the feathered warrior claimed its wooded swells still on its slopes the ploughmans ridges show the pointed flints that left his fatal bow chipped with rough art and slow barbarian toil last of his wrecks that strews the alien soil here spread the fields that heaped their ripened store till the brown arms of labor held no more the scythes broad meadow with its dusky blush the sickles harvest with its velvet flush the greenhaired maize her silken tresses laid in soft luxuriance on her harsh brocade the gourd that swells beneath her tossing plume the coarser wheat that rolls in lakes of bloom its coral stems and milkwhite flowers alive with the wide murmurs of the scattered hive here glowed the apple with the pencilled streak of morning painted on its southern cheek the pears long necklace strung with golden drops arched like the banian oer its pillared props here crept the growths that paid the laborers care with the cheap luxuries wealth consents to spare here sprang the healing herbs which could not save the hand that reared them from the neighboring grave yet all its varied charms forever free from task and tribute labor yields to thee no more when april sheds her fitful rain the sowers hand shall cast its flying grain no more when autumn strews the flaming leaves the reapers band shall gird its yellow sheaves for thee alike the circling seasons flow till the first blossoms heave the latest snow in the stiff clod below the whirling drifts in the loose soil the springing herbage lifts in the hot dust beneath the parching weeds lifes withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds its germ entranced in thy unbreathing sleep till what thou sowest mightier angels reap spirit of beauty let thy graces blend with loveliest nature all that art can lend come from the bowers where summers lifeblood flows through the red lips of junes halfopen rose dressed in bright hues the loving sunshines dower for tranquil nature owns no mourning flower come from the forest where the beechs screen bars the fierce noonbeam with its flakes of green stay the rude axe that bares the shadowy plains stanch the deep wound that dries the maples veins come with the stream whose silverbraided rills fling their unclasping bracelets from the hills till in one gleam beneath the forests wings melts the white glitter of a hundred springs come from the steeps where look majestic forth from their twin thrones the giants of the north on the huge shapes that crouching at their knees stretch their broad shoulders rough with shaggy trees through the wide waste of ether not in vain their softened gaze shall reach our distant plain there while the mourner turns his aching eyes on the blue mounds that print the bluer skies nature shall whisper that the fading view of mightiest grief may wear a heavenly hue cherub of wisdom let thy

every word it forms seraph of love in heavens adoring zone nearest of all around the central throne while with soft hands the pillowed turf we spread that soon shall hold us in its dreamless bed with

oerhanging vault oh teach us kindness for our brothers fault lay all our wrongs beneath this peaceful sod and lead our hearts to mercy and its god father of all in deaths relentless claim we read thy mercy by its sterner name in the bright flower that decks the solemn bier we see thy glory in its narrowed sphere in the deep lessons that affliction draws we trace the curves of thy encircling laws in the long sigh that sets our spirits free we own the love that calls us back to thee through the hushed street along the silent plain the spectral future leads its mourning train dark with the shadows of uncounted bands where mans white lips and womans wringing hands track the still burden rolling slow before that love and kindness can protect no more the smiling babe that called to mortal strife shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life the drooping child who prays in vain to live and pleads for help its parent cannot give the pride of beauty stricken in its flower the strength of manhood broken in an hour age in its weakness bowed by toil and care traced in sad lines beneath its silvered hair the sun shall set and heavens resplendent spheres gild the smooth turf unhallowed yet by tears but ah how soon the evening stars will shed their sleepless light around the slumbering dead take them o father in immortal trust ashes to ashes dust to kindred dust till the last angel rolls the stone away and a new morning brings eternal day to governor swain dear governor if my skiff might brave the winds that lift the ocean wave the mountain stream that loops and swerves through my

not be oh would it might could i live oer that glowing night what golden hours would come to life what goodly feats of peaceful strife such jests that drained of every joke the very bank of language broke such deeds that laughter nearly died with stitches in his belted side while time caught fast in pleasures chain his double goblet snapped in twain and stood with half in either hand both brimming full but not of sand it may not be i strive in vain to break my slender household chain three pairs of little clasping hands one voice that whispers not commands even while my spirit flies away my gentle jailers murmur nay all shapes of elemental wrath they raise along my threatened path the storm grows black the waters rise the mountains mingle with the skies the mad tornado scoops the ground the midnight robber prowls around thus kissing every limb they tie they draw a knot and heave a sigh till fairly netted in the toil my feet are rooted to the soil only the soaring wish is free

dropped by the weary tempests wing it feels the kindling ray of spring and starting from its dream of death pours on the air its perfumed breath so parted by the rolling flood the love that springs from common blood needs but a single sunlit hour of mingling smiles to bud and flower unharmed its slumbering life has flown from shore to shore from zone to zone where summers falling roses stain the tepid waves of pontchartrain or where the lichen creeps below katahdins wreaths of whirling snow though fiery sun and stiffening cold may change the fair ancestral mould no winter chills no summer

swell a hundred brooks a hundred brooks and still they run with ripple shade and gleam till clustering all their braids in one they flow a single stream a bracelet spun from mountain mist a silvery sash unwound with oxbow curve and sinuous twist it writhes to reach the sound this is my bark a pygmys ship beneath a child it rolls fear not one body makes it dip but not a thousand souls float we

double in the stream as if some wounded eagles breast slow throbbing oer the plain had left its airy path impressed in drops of scarlet rain and hark and hark the woodland rings there thrilled the thrushs soul and look that flash of flamy wings the fireplumed oriole above the henhawk swims and swoops flung from the bright blue sky below the robin hops and whoops his piercing indian cry beauty runs virgin in the woods robed in her rustic green and oft a longing thought intrudes as if we might have seen her every fingers every joint ringed with some golden line poet whom nature did anoint

purpureos spargam flores the wreath that starcrowned shelley gave is lying on thy roman grave yet on its turf young april sets her store of slender violets though all the gods their garlands shower i too may bring one purple flower alas what blossom shall i bring that opens in my northern spring the garden beds have all run wild so trim when i was yet a child flat plantains and unseemly stalks have crept across the gravel walks the vines are dead long long ago the almond buds no longer blow no more upon its mound i see the azure plumebound fleurdelis where once the tulips used to show in straggling tufts the pansies grow the grass has quenched my whiterayed gem the flowering star of bethlehem though its long blade of glossy green and pallid stripe may still be seen nature who treads her nobles down and gives their birthright to the clown has sown her baseborn weedy things above the gardens queens and kings yet one sweet flower of ancient race springs in the old familiar place when snows were melting down the vale and earth unlaced her icy mail and march his stormy trumpet blew and tender green came peeping through i loved the earliest one to seek that broke the soil with emerald beak and watch the trembling bells so blue spread on the column as it grew meek child of earth thou wilt not shame the sweet dead poets holy name the god of music gave thee birth called from the crimsonspotted earth where sobbing his young life away his own fair hyacinthus lay the hyacinth my garden gave shall lie upon that roman grave after a lecture on shelley one broad white sail in

with lamps the long veranda burns come wandering sail they watch they burn for thee suns come and go alas no bark returns and feet are thronging on the pebbly sands and torches flaring in the weedy caves whereer the waters lay with icy hands the shapes uplifted from their coral graves vainly they seek the idle quest is oer the coarse dark women with their hanging locks and lean wild children gather from the shore to the black hovels bedded in the rocks but love still prayed with agonizing wail one one last look ye heaving waters yield till ocean clashing in his jointed mail raised the pale burden on his level shield slow from the shore the sullen waves retire his form a nobler element shall claim nature baptized him in ethereal fire and death shall crown him with a wreath of flame fade mortal semblance never to return swift is the change within thy crimson shroud seal the white ashes in the peaceful urn all else has risen in yon silvery cloud sleep where thy gentle adonais lies whose open page lay on thy dying heart both in the smile of those bluevaulted skies earths fairest dome of all divinest art breathe for his wandering soul one passing sigh o happier christian while

of spring on the icegirdled stream there comes a soft footstep a whisper to me the vision is over the rivulet free we have trod from the threshold of turbulent march till the green scarf of april is hung on the larch and down the bright hillside that welcomes the day we hear the warm panting of beautiful may we will part before summer has opened her wing and the bosom of june swells the bodice of spring while the hope of the season lies fresh in the bud and the young life of nature runs warm in our blood it is but a word and the chain is unbound the bracelet of steel drops unclasped to the ground no hand shall replace it it rests where it fell it is but one word that we all know too well yet the hawk with the wildness untamed in his eye if you free him stares round ere he springs to the sky the slave whom no longer his fetters restrain will turn for a moment and look at his chain our parting is not as the friendship of years that chokes with the blessing it speaks through its tears we have walked in a garden and looking around have plucked a few leaves from the myrtles we found but now at the gate of the garden we stand and the moment has come for unclasping the hand will you drop it like lead and in silence retreat like the twenty crushed forms from an omnibus seat nay hold it one moment the last we may share i stretch it in kindness and not for my fare you may pass through the doorway in rank or in file if your ticket from nature is stamped with a smile for the sweetest of smiles is the smile as we part when the light round the lips is a ray from the heart and lest a stray tear from its fountain might swell we will seal the bright spring with a quiet farewell the hudson after a lecture at albany t was a vision of childhood that came with its dawn ere the curtain that covered lifes daystar was drawn the nurse told the tale when the shadows grew long and the mothers soft lullaby breathed it in song there flows a fair stream by the hills of the west she sang to her boy as he lay on her breast along its smooth margin thy fathers have played beside its deep waters their ashes are laid i wandered afar from the land of my birth i saw the old rivers renowned upon earth but fancy still painted that wideflowing stream with the manyhued pencil of infancys dream i saw the green banks of the castlecrowned rhine where the grapes drink the moonlight and change it to wine i stood by the avon whose waves as they glide still whisper his glory who sleeps at their side but my heart would still yearn for the sound of the waves that sing as they flow by my forefathers graves if manhood yet honors my cheek with a tear i care not who sees it no blush for it here farewell to the deepbosomed stream of the west i fling this loose blossom to float on its breast nor let the dear love of its children grow cold till the channel is dry where its waters have rolled december the new eden meeting of the berkshire horticultural society at stockbridge

slanted sun the hillsides gleamed with golden maize the food was scant the fruits were few a redstreak glistening here and there perchance in statelier precincts grew some stern old puritanic pear austere in taste and tough at core its unrelenting bulk was shed to ripen in the pilgrims store when all the summer sweets were fled such was his lot to front the storm with iron heart and marble brow nor ripen till his earthly form was cast from lifes autumnal bough but ever on the bleakest rock we bid the brightest beacon glow and still upon the thorniest stock the sweetest roses love to blow so

unseen here let his body rest where the calm shadows that his soul loved best may slide above his breast smooth his uncurtained bed and if some natural tears are softly shed it is not for the dead

round her neck we find her at her stately door and in her ancient chair dressed in the robes of red and green she always loved to wear her eye has all its radiant youth her cheek its morning flame we drop our roses as we go hers flourish still the same we have been playing many an hour and far away weve strayed some laughing in the cheerful sun some lingering in the shade and some have tired and laid them down where darker shadows fall dear as her loving voice may be they cannot hear its call what miles we ve travelled since we shook the dewdrops from our shoes we gathered on this classic green so famed for heavy dues how many boys have joined the game how many slipped away since weve been running up and down and having out our play one boy at work with book and brief and one with gown and band one sailing vessels on the pool one digging sand one flying paper kites on change one planting little pills the seeds of certain annual flowers well known as little bills what maidens met us on our way and clasped us hand in hand what cherubs not the legless kind that fly but never stand how many a youthful head weve seen put on its silver crown what sudden changes back again to youths empurpled brown but fairer sights have met our eyes and broader lights have shone since others lit their midnight lamps where once we trimmed our own a thousand trains that flap the sky with flags of rushing fire and throbbing in the thunderers hand thoughts millionchorded lyre weve seen the sparks of empire fly beyond the mountain bars till glittering oer the western wave they joined the setting

these but ah when science drops her shield its peaceful shelter proved in vain and bares her snowwhite arm to wield the sad stern ministry of pain when shuddering oer the fount of life she folds her heavenanointed wings to lift unmoved the glittering knife that searches all its crimson springs when faithful to her ancient lore she thrusts aside her fragrant balm for blistering juice or cankering ore and tames them till they cure or calm when in her gracious hand are seen the dregs and scum of earth and seas her kindness counting all things clean that lend the sighing sufferer ease though on the field that death has won she save some stragglers in retreat these single acts of mercy done are but confessions of defeat what though our tempered poisons save some wrecks of life from aches and

swelling breasts of ayr and doon with sea green wavelets quiver the century shrivels like a scroll the past becomes the present and face to face and soul to soul we greet the monarchpeasant while shenstone strained in feeble flights with corydon and phillis while wolfe was climbing abrahams heights to snatch the bourbon lilies who heard the wailing infants cry the babe beneath the sheeliug whose song tonight in every sky will shake earths starry ceiling whose passionbreathing voice ascends and floats like incense oer us whose ringing lay of friendship blends with labors anvil chorus we love him not for sweetest song though never tone so tender we love him even in his wrong his wasteful selfsurrender we praise him not for gifts divine his muse was born of woman his manhood breathes in every line was ever heart more human we love him praise him just for this in every form and feature through wealth and want through woe and bliss he saw his fellowcreature no soul could sink beneath his love not even angel blasted no mortal power could soar above the pride that all outlasted ay heaven had set one living man beyond the pedants tether his virtues frailties he may scan who weighs them all together i fling my pebble on the cairn of him though dead undying sweet natures nursling bonniest bairn beneath her daisies lying the waning suns the wasting globe shall spare the minstrels story the centuries weave his purple robe the mountainmist of glory at a meeting of friends august i remember why yes god bless me and was it so long ago i fear im growing forgetful as old folks do you know it must have been in forty i would say thirtynine we talked this matter over i and a friend of mine he said well now old fellow im thinking that you and i if we act like other people shall be older by and by what though the bright blue ocean is smooth as a pond can be there is always a line of breakers to fringe the broadest sea were taking it mighty easy but that is nothing strange for up to the age of thirty we spend our years like change but creeping up towards the forties as fast as the old years fill and time steps in for payment we seem to change a bill i know it i said old fellow you speak the solemn truth a man cant live to a hundred and likewise keep his youth but what if the ten years coming shall silverstreak my hair you know i shall then be forty of course i shall not care at forty a man grows heavy and tired of fun and noise leaves dress to the fiveandtwenties and love to the silly boys no foppish tricks at forty no pinching of waists and toes but highlow shoes and flannels and good thick worsted hose but one fine august morning i found myself awake my birthday by jove im forty yes forty and no mistake why this is the very milestone i think i used to hold that when a fellow had come to a fellow would then be old but that is the young folks nonsense theyre full of their foolish stuff a mans in his prime at forty i see that plain enough at fifty a man is wrinkled and may be bald or gray i call men old at fifty in spite of all they say at last comes another august with mist and rain and shine its mornings are slowly counted and creep to twentynine and when on the western summits the fading light appears it touches with rosy fingers the last of my fifty years there have been both men and women whose hearts were firm and bold but there never was one of fifty that loved to say im old so any elderly person that strives to shirk his years make him stand up at a table and try him by his peers now here i stand at fifty my jury gathered round sprinkled with dust of silver but not yet silvercrowned ready to meet your verdict waiting to hear it told guilty of fifty summers speak is the verdict old no say that his hearing fails him say that his sight grows dim say that hes getting wrinkled and weak in back and limb losing his wits and temper but pleading to make amends the youth of his fifty summers he finds in his twenty friends
