the chain of aforgomon clark ashton smith it is indeed strange that john milwarp and his writings should have fallen so speedily into semioblivion his books treating of oriental life in a somewhat flowery romantic style were popular a few months ago but now in spite of their range and penetration their pervasive verbal sorcery they are seldom mentioned and they seem to have vanished unaccountably from the shelves of bookstores and libraries even the mystery of milwarps death baffling to both law and science has evoked but a passing interest an excitement quickly lulled and forgotten i was well acquainted with milwarp over a term of years but my recollection of the man is becoming strangely blurred like an image in a misted mirror his dark halfalien personality his preoccupation with the occult his immense knowledge of eastern life and lore are things i remember with such effort and vagueness as attends the recovery of a dream sometimes i almost doubt that he ever existed it is as if the man and all that pertains to him were being erased from human record by some mysterious acceleration of the common process of obliteration in his will he appointed me his executor i have vainly tried to interest publishers in the novel he left among his papers a novel surely not inferior to anything he ever wrote they say that his vogue has passed now i am publishing as a magazine story the contents of the diary kept by milwarp for a period preceding his demise perhaps for the openminded this diary will explain the enigma of his death it would seem that the circumstances of that death are virtually forgotten and i repeat them here as part of my endeavor to revive and perpetuate milwarps memory milwarp had returned to his house in san francisco after a long sojourn in indochina we who knew him gathered that he had gone into places seldom visited by occidentals at the time of his demise he had just finished correcting the typescript of a novel which dealt with the more romantic and mysterious aspects of burma on the morning of april nd his housekeeper a middleaged woman was startled by a glare of brilliant light which issued from the halfopen door of milwarps study it was as if the whole room were in flames horrified the woman hastened to investigate entering the study she saw her master sitting in an armchair at the table wearing the rich somber robes of chinese brocade which he affected as a dressinggown he sat stiffly erect a pen clutched unmoving in his fingers on the open pages of a manuscript volume about him in a sort of nimbus glowed and flickered the strange light and her only thought was that his garments were on fire she ran toward him crying out a warning at that moment the weird nimbus brightened intolerably and the wan early dayshine the electric bulbs that still burned to attest the nights labor were alike blotted out it seemed to the housekeeper that something had gone wrong with the room itself for the walls and table vanished and a great luminous gulf opened before her and on the verge of the gulf in a seat that was not his cushioned armchair but a huge and roughhewn seat of stone she beheld her master stark and rigid his heavy brocaded robes were gone and about him from head to foot were blinding coils of pure white fire in the form of linked chains she could not endure the brilliance of the chains and cowering back she shielded her eyes with her hands when she dared to look again the weird glowing had faded the room was as usual and milwarps motionless figure was seated at the table in the posture of writing shaken and terrified as she was the woman found courage to approach her master a hideous smell of burnt flesh arose from beneath his garments which were wholly intact and without visible trace of fire he was dead his fingers clenched on the pen and his features frozen in a stare of tetanic agony his neck and wrists were completely encircled by frightful burns that had charred them deeply the coroner in his examination found that these burns preserving an outline as of heavy links were extended in long unbroken spirals around the arms and legs and torso the burning was apparently the cause of milwarps death it was as if iron chains heated to incandescence had been wrapped about him small credit was given to the housekeepers story of what she had seen no one however could suggest an acceptable explanation of the bizarre mystery there was at the time much aimless discussion but as i have hinted people soon turned to other matters the efforts made to solve the riddle were somewhat perfunctory chemists tried to determine the nature of a queer drug in the form of a gray powder with pearly granules to whose use milwarp had become addicted but their tests merely revealed the presence of an alkaloid whose source and attributes were obscure to western science day by day the whole incredible business lapsed from public attention and those who had known milwarp began to display the forgetfulness that was no less unaccountable than his weird doom the housekeeper who had held steadfastly in the beginning to her story came at length to share the common dubiety her account with repetition became vague and contradictory detail by detail she seemed to forget the abnormal circumstances that she had witnessed with overwhelming horror the manuscript volume in which milwarp had apparently been writing at the time of death was given into my charge with his other papers it proved to be a diary its last entry breaking off abruptly since reading the diary i have hastened to transcribe it in my own hand because for some mysterious reason the ink of the original is already fading and has become almost illegible in places the reader will note certain lacunae due to passages written in an alphabet which neither i nor any scholar of my acquaintance can transliterate these passages seem to form an integral part of the narrative and they occur mainly toward the end as if the writer had turned more and more to a language remembered from his ancient avatar to the same mental reversion one must attribute the singular dating in which milwarp still employing english script appears to pass from our contemporary notation to that of some premundane world i give hereunder the entire diary which begins with an undated footnote this book unless i have been misinformed concerning the qualities of the drug souvara will be the record of my former life in a lost cycle i have had the drug in my possession for seven months but fear has prevented me from using it now by certain tokens i perceive that the longing for knowledge will soon overcome the fear ever since my earliest childhood i have been troubled by intimations dim unplaceable that seemed to argue a forgotten existence these intimations partook of the nature of feelings rather than ideas or images they were like the wraiths of dead memories in the background of my mind there has lurked a sentiment of formless melancholy desire for some nameless beauty long perished out of time and coincidentally i have been haunted by an equally formless dread an apprehension as of some bygone but still imminent doom such feelings have persisted undiminished throughout my youth and maturity but nowhere have i found any clue to their causation my travels in the mystic orient my delvings into occultism have merely convinced me that these shadowy intuitions pertain to some incarnation buried under the wreck of remotest cycles many times in my wanderings through buddhistic lands i had heard of the drug souvara which is believed to restore even for the uninitiate the memory of other lives and at last after many vain efforts i managed to procure a supply of the drug the manner in which obtained it is a tale sufficiently remarkable in itself but of no special relevance here so far perhaps because of that apprehension which i have hinted i have not dared to use the drug march th this morning i took souvara for the first time dissolving the proper amount in pure distilled water as i had been instructed to do afterward i leaned back easily in my chair breathing with a slow regular rhythm i had no preconceived idea of the sensations that would mark the drugs initial effect since these were said to vary prodigiously with the temperament of the users but i composed myself to await them with tranquility after formulating clearly in my mind the purpose of the experinent for a while there was no change in my awareness i noticed a slight quickening of the pulse and modulated my breathing in conformity with this then by slow degrees i experienced a sharpening of visual perception the chinese rugs on the floor the backs of the serried volumes in my bookcases the very wood of chairs table and shelves began to exhibit new and unimagined colors at the same time there were curious alterations of outline every object seeming to extend itself in a hitherto unsuspected fashion following this my surroundings became semitransparent like molded shapes of mist i found that i could see through the marbled cover the illustrations in a volume of john martins edition of paradise lost which lay before me on the table all this i knew was a mere extension of ordinary physical vision it was only a prelude to those apperceptions of occult realms which i sought through souvara fixing my mind once more on the goal of the experiment i became aware that the misty walls had vanished like a drawn arras about me like reflections in rippled water dim sceneries wavered and shifted erasing one another from instant to instant i seemed to hear a vague but everpresent sound more musical than the murmurs of air water or fire which was a property of the unknown element that environed me with a sense of troublous familiarity i beheld the blurred unstable pictures which flowed past me upon this neverresting medium orient temples flashing with sunstruck bronze and gold the sharp crowded gables and spires of medieval cities tropic and northern forests the costumes and physiognomies of the levant of persia of old rome and carthage went by like blown flying mirages each succeeding tableau belonged to a more ancient period than the one before it and i knew that each was a scene from some former existence of my own still tethered as it were to my present self i reviewed these visible memories which took on tridimensional depth and clarity i saw myself as warrior and troubadour as noble and merchant and mendicant i trembled with dead fears i thrilled with lost hopes and raptures and was drawn by ties that death and lethe had broken yet never did i fully identify myself with those other avatars for i knew well that the memory i sought pertained to some incarnation of older epochs still the fantasmagoria streamed on and i turned giddy with vertigo ineffable before the vastness and diuturnity of the cycles of being it seemed that i the watcher was lost in a gray land where the homeless ghosts of all dead ages went fleeing from oblivion to oblivion the walls of nineveh the columns and towers of unnamed cities rose before me and were swept away i saw the luxuriant plains that are now the gobi desert the sealost capitals of atlantis were drawn to the light in unquenched glory i gazed on lush and cloudy scenes from the first continents of earth briefly i relived the beginnings of terrestrial man and knew that the secret i would learn was ancienter even than these my visions faded into black voidness and yet in that void through fathomless eons it seemed that i existed still like a blind atom in the space between the worlds about me was the darkness and repose of that night which antedated the earths creation time flowed backward with the silence of dreamless sleep the illumination when it came was instant and complete i stood in the full fervid blaze of day amid royally towering blossoms in a deep garden beyond whose lofty vineclad walls i heard the confused murmuring of the great city called kalood above me at their vernal zenith were the four small suns that illumed the planet hestan jewelcolored insects fluttered about me lighting without fear on the rich habiliments of gold and black enwrought with astronomic symbols in which i was attired beside me was a dialshaped altar of zoned agate carved with the same symbols which were those of the dreadful omnipotent timegod aforgomon whom i served as a priest i had not even the slightest memory of myself as john milwarp and the long pageant of my terrestrial lives was as something that had never been or was yet to be sorrow and desolation choked my heart as ashes fill some urn consecrated to the dead and all the hues and perfumes of the garden about me were redolent only of the bitterness of death gazing darkly upon the altar i muttered blasphemy against aforgomon who in his inexorable course had taken away my beloved and had sent no solace for my grief separately i cursed the signs upon the altar the stars the worlds the suns the moons that meted and fulfilled the processes of time belthoris my betrothed had died at the end of the previous autumn and so with double maledictions i cursed the stars and planets presiding over that season i became aware that a shadow had fallen beside my own on the altar and knew that the dark sage and sorcerer atmox had obeyed my summons fearfully but not without hope i turned toward him noting first of all that he bore under his arm a heavy sinisterlooking volume with covers of black steel and hasps of adamant only when i had made sure of this did i lift my eyes to his face which was little less somber and forbidding than the tome he carried greeting o calaspa he said harshly i have come against my own will and judgment the lore that you request is in this volume and since you saved me in former years from the inquisitorial wrath of the timegods priests i cannot refuse to share it with you but understand well that even i who have called upon names that are dreadful to utter and have evoked forbidden presences shall never dare to assist you in this conjuration gladly would i help you to hold converse with the shadow of belthoris or to animate her still unwithered body and draw it forth from the tomb but that which you purpose is another matter you alone must perform the ordained rites must speak the necessary words for the consequences of this thing will be direr than you deem i care not for the consequences i replied eagerly if it be possible to bring back the lost hours which i shared with belthoris think you that i could content myself with her shadow wandering thinly back from the borderland or that i could take pleasure in the fair clay that the breath of necromancy has troubled and has made to arise and walk without mind or soul nay the belthoris i would summon is she on whom the shadow of death has never yet fallen it seemed that atmox the master of doubtful arts the vassal of umbrageous powers recoiled and blenched before my vehement declaration bethink you he said with minatory sternness that this thing will constitute a breach of the sacred logic of time and a blasphemy against aforgomon god of the minutes and the cycles moreover there is little to be gained for not in its entirety may you bring back the season of your love but only one single hour torn with infinite violence from its rightful period in time refrain i adjure you and content yourself with a lesser sorcery give me the book i demanded my service to aforgomon is forfeit with due reverence and devotion i have worshipped the timegod and have done in his honor the rites ordained from eternity and for all this the god has betrayed me then in that highclimbing luxuriant garden beneath the four suns atmox opened the adamantine clasps of the steelbound volume and turning to a certain page he laid the book reluctantly in my hands the page like its fellows was of some unholy parchment streaked with musty discolorations and blackening at the margin with sheer antiquity but upon it shone unquenchably the dread characters a primal age had written with an ink bright as the newshed ichor of demons above this page i bent in my madness conning it over and over till i was dazzled by the fiery runes and shutting my eyes i saw them burn on a red darkness still legible and writhing like hellish worms hollowly like the sound of a far bell i heard the voice of atmox you have learned o calaspa the unutterable name of that one whose assistance can alone restore the fled hours and you have learned the incantation that will rouse that hidden power and the sacrifice needed for its propitiation knowing these things is your heart still strong and your purpose firm the name i had read in the wizard volume was that of the chief cosmic power antagonistic to aforgomon the incantation and the required offering were those of a foul demonolatry nevertheless i did not hesitate but gave resolute affirmative answer to the somber query of atmox perceiving that i was inflexible he bowed his head trying no more to dissuade me then as the flameruned volume had bade me do i defiled the altar of aforgomon blotting certain of its prime symbols with dust and spittle while atmox looked on in silence i wounded my right arm to its deepest vein on the sharptipped gnomon of the dial and letting the blood drip from zone to zone from orb to orb on the graven agate i made unlawful sacrifice and intoned aloud in the name of the lurking chaos xexanoth an abominable ritual composed by a backward repetition and jumbling of litanies sacred to the timegod even as i chanted the incantation it seemed that webs of shadow were woven foully athwart the suns and the ground shook a little as if colossal demons trod the worlds rim striding stupendously from abysses beyond the garden walls and trees wavered like a windblown reflection in a pool and i grew faint with the loss of that lifeblood i had poured out in demonolatrous offering then in my flesh and in my brain i felt the intolerable racking of a vibration like the longdrawn shock of cities riven by earthquake and coasts crumbling before some chaotic sea and my flesh was torn and harrowed and my brain shuddered with the toneless discords sweeping through me from deep to deep i faltered and confusion gnawed at my inmost being dimly i heard the prompting of atmox and dimmer still was the sound of my own voice that made answer to xexanoth naming the impious necromancy which was to be effected only through its power madly i implored from xexanoth in despite of time and its ordered seasons one hour of that bygone autumn which i had shared with belthoris and imploring this i named no special hour for all in memory had seemed of an equal joy and gladness as the words ceased upon my lips i thought that darkness fluttered in the air like a great wing and the four suns went out and my heart was stilled as if in death then the light returned falling obliquely from suns mellow with fulltided autumn and nowhere beside me was there any shadow of atmox and the altar of zoned agate was bloodless and undefiled i the lover of belthoris witting not of the doom and sorrow to come stood happily with my beloved before the altar and saw her young hands crown its ancient dial with the flowers we had plucked from the garden dreadful beyond all fathoming are the mysteries of time even i the priest and initiate though wise in the secret doctrines of aforgomon know little enough of that elusive ineluctable process whereby the present becomes the past and the future resolves itself into the present all men have pondered the riddles of duration and transience have wondered vainly to what bourn the lost days and the sped cycles are consigned some have dreamt that the past abides unchanged becoming eternity as it slips from our mortal ken and others have deemed that time is a stairway whose steps crumble one by one behind the climber falling into a gulf of nothing howsoever this may be i know that she who stood beside me was the belthoris on whom no shadow of mortality had yet descended the hour was one newborn in a golden season and the minutes to come were pregnant with all wonder and surprise belonging to the untried future taller was my beloved than the frail unbowed lilies of the garden in her eyes was the sapphire of moonless evenings sown with small golden stars her lips were strangely curved but only blitheness and joy had gone to their shaping she and i had been betrothed from our childhood and the time of the marriagerites was now approaching our intercourse was wholly free according to the custom of that world often she came to walk with me in my garden and to decorate the altar of that god whose revolving moons and suns would soon bring the season of our felicity the moths that flew about us winged with aerial clothofgold were no lighter than our hearts making blithe holiday we fanned our frolic mood to a high flame of rapture we were akin to the fullhued climbing flowers the swiftdarting insects and our spirits blended and soared with the perfumes that were drawn skyward in the warm air unheard by us was the loud murmuring of the mighty city of kalood lying beyond my garden walls for us the manypeopled planet known as hestan no longer existed and we dwelt alone in a universe of light in a blossomed heaven exalted by love in the high harmony of those moments we seemed to touch eternity and even i the priest of aforgomon forgot the blossomfretting days the systemdevouring cycles in the sublime folly of passion i swore then that death or discord could never mar the perfect communion of our hearts after we had wreathed the altar i sought the rarest the most delectable flowers frailcurving cups of winewashed pearl of moony azure and white with scrolled purple lips and these i twined between kisses and laughter in the blaze maze of belthoris hair saying that another shrine than that of time should receive its due offering tenderly with a lovers delay i lingered over the wreathing and ere i had finished there fluttered to the ground beside us a great crimsonspotted moth whose wing had somehow been broken in its airy voyaging through the garden and belthoris ever tender of heart and pitiful turned from me and took up the moth in her hands and some of the bright blossoms dropped from her hair unheeded tears welled from her deep blue eyes and seeing that the moth was sorely hurt and would never fly again she refused to be comforted and no longer would she respond to my passionate wooing i who grieved less for the moth than she was somewhat vexed and between her sadness and my vexation there grew between us some tiny temporary rift then ere love had ended the misunderstanding then while we stood before the dread altar of time with sundered hands with eyes averted from each other it seemed that a shroud of darkness descended upon the garden i heard the crash and crumbling of shattered worlds and a black flowing of ruinous things that went past me through the darkness the dead leaves of winter were blown about me and there was a falling of tears or rain then the vernal suns came back highstationed in cruel splendor and with them came the knowledge of all that had been of belthoris death and my sorrow and the madness that had led to forbidden sorcery vain now like all other hours was the resummoned hour and doubly irredeemable was my loss my blood dripped heavily on the dishallowed altar my faintness grew deathly and i saw through murky mist the face of atmox beside me and the face was like that of some comminatory demon march th i john milwarp write this date and my name with an odd dubiety my visionary experience under the drug souvara ended with that rilling of my blood on the symboled dial that glimpse of the terrordistorted face of atmox all this was in another world in a life removed from the present by births and deaths without number and yet it seems not wholly have i returned from the twiceancient past memories broken but strangely vivid and living press upon me from the existence of which my vision was a fragment and portions of the lore of hestan and scraps of its history and words from its lost language arise unbidden in my mind above all my heart is still shadowed by the sorrow of calaspa his desperate necromancy which would seem to others no more than a dream within a dream is stamped as with fire on the black page of recollection i know the awfulness of the god he had blasphemed and the foulness of the demonolatry he had done and the sense of guilt and despair under which he swooned it is this that i have striven all my life to remember this which i have been doomed to reexperience and i fear with a great fear the further knowledge which a second experiment with the drug will reveal to me the next entry of milwarps diary begins with a strange dating in english script the second day of the moon occalat in the thousandandninth year of the red eon this dating perhaps is repeated in the language of hestan for directly beneath it a line of unknown ciphers is set apart several lines of the subsequent text are in the alien tongue and then as if by an unconscious reversion milwarp continues the diary in english there is no reference to another experiment with souvara but apparently such had been made with a continued revival of his lost memories what genius of the nadir gulf had tempted me to this thing and had caused me to overlook the consequences verily when i called up for myself and belthoris an hour of former autumn with all that was attendant upon the hour that bygone interim was likewise evoked and repeated for the whole world hestan and the four suns of hestan from the full midst of spring all men had stepped backward into autumn keeping only the memory of things prior to the hour thus resurrected and knowing not the events future to the hour but returning to the present they recalled with amazement the unnatural necromancy and fear and bewilderment were upon them and none could interpret the meaning for a brief period the dead had lived again the fallen leaves had returned to the bough the heavenly bodies had stood at a longabandoned station the flower had gone back into the seed the plant into the root then with eternal disorder set among all its cycles time had resumed its delayed course no movement of any cosmic body no year or instant of the future would be precisely as it should have been the error and discrepancy i had wrought would bear fruit in ways innumerable the suns would find themselves at fault the worlds and atoms would go always a little astray from their appointed bourns it was of these matters that atmox spoke warning me after he had staunched my bleeding wound for he too in that relumined hour had gone back and had lived again through a past happening for him the hour was one in which he had descended into the nether vaults of his house there standing in a manypentacled circle with burning of unholy incense and uttering of accurst formulae he had called upon a malign spirit from the bowels of hestan and had questioned it concerning the future but the spirit black and voluminous as the fumes of pitch refused to answer him directly and pressed furiously with its clawed members against the confines of the circle it said only thou hast summoned me at thy peril potent are the spells thou hast used and strong is the circle to withstand me and i am restrained by time and space from the wreaking of my anger upon thee but haply thou shalt summon me again albeit in the same hour of the same autumn and in that summoning the laws of time shall be broken and a rift shall be made in space and through the rift though with some delay and divagation i will yet win to thee saying no more it prowled restlessly about the circle and its eyes burned down upon atmox like embers in a highlifted sooty brazier and ever and anon its fanged mouth was flattened on the spelldefended air and in the end he could dismiss it only after a double repetition of the form of exorcism as he told me this tale in the garden atmox trembled and his eyes searched the narrow shadows wrought by the high suns and he seemed to listen for the noise of some evil thing that burrowed toward him beneath the earth fourth day of the moon occalat stricken with terrors beyond those of atmox i kept apart in my mansion amid the city of kalood i was still weak with the loss of blood i had yielded to xexanoth my senses were full of strange shadows my servitors coming and going about me were as phantoms and scarcely i heeded the pale fear in their eyes or heard the dreadful things they whispered madness and chaos they told me were abroad in kalood the divinity of aforgomon was angered all men thought that some baleful doom impended because of that unnatural confusion which had been wrought among the hours of time this afternoon they brought me the story of atmoxs death in bated tones they told me how his neophytes had heard a roaring as of a loosed tempest in the chamber where he sat alone with his wizard volumes and paraphernalia above the roaring for a little human screams had sounded together with a dashing as of hurled censers and braziers a crashing as of overthrown tables and tomes blood rilled from under the shut door of the chamber and rilling it took from instant to instant the form of dire ciphers that spelt an unspeakable name after the noises had ceased the neophytes waited a long while ere they dared to open the door entering at last they saw the floor and the walls heavily bespattered with blood and rags of the sorcerers raiment mingled everywhere with the sheets of his torn volumes of magic and the shreds and manglings of his flesh strewn amid broken furniture and his brains daubed in a horrible paste on the high ceiling hearing this tale i knew that the earthly demon feared by atmox had found him somehow and had wreaked its wrath upon him in ways unguessable it had reached him through the chasm made in ordered time and space by one hour repeated through necromancy and because of that lawless chasm the magicians power and lore had utterly failed to defend him from the demon fifth day of the moon occalat atrnox i am sure had not betrayed me for in so doing he must have betrayed his own implicit share in my crime howbeit this evening the priests came to my house ere the setting of the westernmost sun silent grim with eyes averted as if from a foulness innominable me their fellow they enjoined with loth gestures to accompany them thus they took me from my house and along the thoroughfares of kalood toward the lowering suns the streets were empty of all other passers and it seemed that no man desired to meet or behold the blasphemer down the avenue of gnomonshaped pillars i was led to the portals of aforgomons fane those awfully gaping portals arched in the likeness of some devouring chimeras mouth sixth day of the moon occalat they had thrust me into an oubliette beneath the temple dark noisome and soundless except for the maddening measured drip of water beside me there i lay and knew not when the night passed and the morning came light was admitted only when my captors opened the iron door coming to lead me before the tribunal thus the priests condemned me speaking with one voice in whose dreadful volume the tones of all were indistinguishably blended then the aged highpriest helpenor called aloud upon aforgomon offering himself as a mouthpiece to the god and asking the god to pronounce through him the doom that was adequate for such enormities as those of which i had been judged guilty by my fellows instantly it seemed the god descended into helpenor and the figure of the highpriest appeared to dilate prodigiously beneath his mufflings and the accents that issued from his mouth were like thunders of the upper heaven o calaspa thou hast set disorder amid all future hours and eons through this evil necromancy thereby moreover thou hast wrought thine own doom fettered art thou for ever to the hour thus unlawfully repeated apart from its due place in time according to hieratic rule thou shalt meet the death of the fiery chains but deem not that this death is more than the symbol of thy true punishment thou shalt pass hereafter through other lives in hestan and shalt climb midway in the cycles of the world subsequent to hestan in time and space but through all thine incarnations the chaos thou hast invoked will attend thee widening ever like a rift and always in all thy lives the rift will bar thee from reunion with the soul of belthoris and always though merely by an hour thou shalt miss the love that should otherwise have been oftentimes regained at last when the chasm has widened overmuch thy soul shall fare no farther in the onward cycles of incarnation at that time it shall be given thee to remember clearly thine ancient sin and remembering thou shalt perish out of time upon the body of that latter life shall be found the charred imprint of the chains as the final token of thy bondage but they that knew thee will soon forget and thou shalt belong wholly to the cycles limited for thee by thy sin march th i write this date with infinite desperation trying to convince myself that there is a john milwarp who exists on earth in the twentieth century for two days running i have not taken the drug souvara and yet i have returned twice to that oubliette of aforgomons temple in which the priest calaspa awaits his doom twice i have been immersed in its stagnant darkness hearing the slow drip of water beside me like a clepsydra that tells the black ages of the damned even as i write this at my library table it seems that an ancient midnight plucks at the lamp the bookcases turn to walls of oozing nighted stone there is no longer a table nor one who writes and i breathe the noisome dankness of a dungeon lying unfathomed by any sun in a lost world eighteenth day of the moon occalat today for the last time they took me from my prison helpenor together with three others came and led me to the adytum of the god far beneath the outer temple we went through spacious crypts unknown to the common worshippers there was no word spoken no glance exchanged between the others and me and it seemed that they already regarded me as one cast out from time and claimed by oblivion we came ultimately to that sheerfalling gulf in which the spirit of aforgomon is said to dwell lights feeble and farscattered shone around it like stars on the rim of cosmic vastness shedding no ray into the depths there in a seat of hewn stone overhanging the frightful verge i was placed by the executioners and a ponderous chain of black unrusted metal stapled to the solid rock was wound about and about me circling my naked body and separate limbs from head to foot to this doom others had been condemned for heresy or impiety though never for a sin such as mine after the chaining of the victim he was left for a stated interim to ponder his crime and haply to confront the dark divinity of aforgomon at length from the abyss into which his position forced him to peer a light would dawn and a bolt of strange flame would leap upward striking the many coiled chain about him and heating it instantly to the whiteness of candescent iron the source and nature of the flame were mysterious and many ascribed it to the god himself rather than to mortal agency even thus they have left me and have gone away long since the burden of the massy links cutting deeper and deeper into my flesh has become an agony i am dizzy from gazing downward into the abyss and yet i cannot fall beneath immeasurably beneath at recurrent intervals i hear a hollow and solemn sound perhaps it is the sigh of sunken waters of cavernstraying winds or the respiration of one that abides in the darkness meting with his breath the slow minutes the hours the days the ages my terror has become heavier than the chain my vertigo is born of a twofold gulf eons have passed by and all the worlds have ebbed into nothingness like wreckage borne on a chasmfalling stream taking with them the lost face of belthoris i am poised above the gaping maw of the shadow somehow in another world an exile phantom has written these words a phantom who must fade utterly from time and place even as i the doomed priest calaspa i cannot remember the name of the phantom beneath me in the black depths there is an awful brightening
