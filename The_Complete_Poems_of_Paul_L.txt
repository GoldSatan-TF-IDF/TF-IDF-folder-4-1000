to alice lyrics of love and laughter to miss catherine impey lyrics of sunshine and shadow to mrs frank conover with thanks for her long belief introduction to lyrics of lowly life i think i should scarcely trouble the reader with a special appeal in behalf of this book if it had not specially appealed to me for reasons apart from the authors race origin and condition the world is too old now and i find myself too much of its mood to care for the work of a poet because he is black because his father and mother were slaves because he was before and after he began to write poems an elevatorboy these facts would certainly attract me to him as a man if i knew him to have a literary ambition but when it came to his literary art i must judge it irrespective of these facts and enjoy or endure it for what it was in itself it seems to me that this was my experience with the poetry of paul laurence dunbar when i found it in another form and in justice to him i cannot wish that it should be otherwise with his readers here still it will legitimately interest those who like to know the causes or if these may not be known the sources of things to learn that the father and mother of the first poet of his race in our language were negroes without admixture of white blood the father escaped from slavery in kentucky to freedom in canada while there was still no hope of freedom otherwise but the mother was freed by the events of the civil war and came north to ohio where their son was born at dayton and grew up with such chances and mischances for mental training as everywhere befall the children of the poor he has told me that his father picked up the trade of a plasterer and when he had taught himself to read loved chiefly to read history the boys mother shared his passion for literature with a special love of poetry and after the father died she struggled on in more than the poverty she had shared with him she could value the faculty which her son showed first in prose sketches and attempts at fiction and she was proud of the praise and kindness they won him among the people of the town where he has never been without the warmest and kindest friends in fact from every part of ohio and from several cities of the adjoining states there came letters in cordial appreciation of the critical recognition which it was my pleasure no less than my duty to offer paul dunbars work in another place it seemed to me a happy omen for him that so many people who had known him or known of him were glad of a strangers good word and it was gratifying to see that at home he was esteemed for the things he had done rather than because as the son of negro slaves he had done them if a prophet is often without honor in his own country it surely is nothing against him when he has it in this case it deprived me of the glory of a discoverer but that is sometimes a barren joy and i am always willing to forego it what struck me in reading mr dunbars poetry was what had already struck his friends in ohio and indiana in kentucky and illinois they had felt as i felt that however gifted his race had proven itself in music in oratory in several of the other arts here was the first instance of an american negro who had evinced innate distinction in literature in my criticism of his book i had alleged dumas in france and i had forgetfully failed to allege the far greater pushkin in russia but these were both mulattoes who might have been supposed to derive their qualities from white blood vastly more artistic than ours and who were the creatures of an environment more favorable to their literary development so far as i could remember paul dunbar was the only man of pure african blood and of american civilization to feel the negro life aesthetically and express it lyrically it seemed to me that this had come to its most modern consciousness in him and that his brilliant and unique achievement was to have studied the american negro objectively and to have represented him as he found him to be with humor with sympathy and yet with what the reader must instinctively feel to be entire truthfulness i said that a race which had come to this effect in any member of it had attained civilization in him and i permitted myself the imaginative prophecy that the hostilities and the prejudices which had so long constrained his race were destined to vanish in the arts that these were to be the final proof that god had made of one blood all nations of men i thought his merits positive and not comparative and i held that if his black poems had been written by a white man i should not have found them less admirable i accepted them as an evidence of the essential unity of the human race which does not think or feel black in one and white in another but humanly in all yet it appeared to me then and it appears to me now that there is a precious difference of temperament between the races which it would be a great pity ever to lose and that this is best preserved and most charmingly suggested by mr dunbar in those pieces of his where he studies the moods and traits of his race in its own accent of our english we call such pieces dialect pieces for want of some closer phrase but they are really not dialect so much as delightful personal attempts and failures for the written and spoken language in nothing is his essentially refined and delicate art so well shown as in these pieces which as i ventured to say described the range between appetite and emotion with certain lifts far beyond and above it which is the range of the race he reveals in these a finely ironical perception of the negros limitations with a tenderness for them which i think so very rare as to be almost quite new i should say perhaps that it was this humorous quality which mr dunbar had added to our literature and it would be this which would most distinguish him now and hereafter it is something that one feels in nearly all the dialect pieces and i hope that in the present collection he has kept all of these in his earlier volume and added others to them but the contents of this book are wholly of his own choosing and i do not know how much or little he may have preferred the poems in literary english some of these i thought very good and even more than very good but not distinctively his contribution to the body of american poetry what i mean is that several people might have written them but i do not know any one else at present who could quite have written the dialect pieces these are divinations and reports of what passes in the hearts and minds of a lowly people whose poetry had hitherto been inarticulately expressed in music but now finds for the first time in our tongue literary interpretation of a very artistic completeness i say the event is interesting but how important it shall be can be determined only by mr dunbars future performance i cannot undertake to prophesy concerning this but if he should do nothing more than he has done i should feel that he had made the strongest claim for the negro in english literature that the negro has yet made he has at least produced something that however we may critically disagree about it we cannot well refuse to enjoy in more than one piece he has produced a work of art w d howells index of titles absence accountability advice after a visit after many days after the quarrel

your spoken words are roses fine and sweet lyrics of lowly life ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes which all the day with ceaseless care have sought the magic gold which from the seeker flies ere dreams put on the gown and cap of thought and make the waking world a world of lies of lies most palpable uncouth forlorn that say lifes full of aches and tears and sighs oh how with more than dreams the soul is torn ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes how all the griefs and heartaches we have known come up like poisnous vapors that arise from some base witchs caldron when the crone to work some potent spell her magic plies the past which held its share of bitter pain whose ghost we prayed that time might exorcise comes up is lived and suffered oer again ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes what phantoms fill the dimly lighted room what ghostly shades in awecreating guise are bodied forth within the teeming gloom what echoes faint of sad and soulsick cries and pangs of vague inexplicable pain that pay the spirits ceaseless enterprise come thronging through the chambers of the brain ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes where ranges forth the spirit far and free through what strange realms and unfamiliar skies tends her far course to lands of mystery to lands unspeakable beyond surmise where shapes unknowable to being spring till faint of wing the fancy fails and dies much wearied with the spirits journeying ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes how questioneth the soul that other soul the inner sense which neither cheats nor lies but self exposes unto self a scroll full writ with all lifes acts unwise or wise in characters indelible and known so trembling with the shock of sad surprise the soul doth view its awful self alone ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes when sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes the last dear sleep whose soft embrace is balm and whom sad sorrow teaches us to prize for kissing all our passions into calm ah then no more we heed the sad worlds cries or seek to probe th eternal mystery or fret our souls at longwithheld replies at glooms through which our visions cannot see when sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes the poet and his song a song is but a little thing and yet what joy it is to sing in hours of toil it gives me zest and when at eve i long for rest when cows come home along the bars and in the fold i hear the bell as night the shepherd herds his stars i sing my song and all is well there are no ears to hear my lays no lips to lift a word of praise but still with faith unfaltering i live and laugh and love and sing what matters yon unheeding throng they cannot feel my spirits spell since life is sweet and love is long i sing my song and all is well my days are never days of ease i till my ground and prune my trees when ripened gold is all the plain i put my sickle to the grain i labor hard and toil and sweat while others dream within the dell but even while my brow is wet i sing my song and all is well sometimes the sun unkindly hot my garden makes a desert spot sometimes a blight upon the tree takes all my fruit away from me and then with throes of bitter pain rebellious passions rise and swell but life is more than fruit or grain and so i sing and all is well retort thou art a fool said my head to my heart indeed the greatest of fools thou art to be led astray by the trick of a tress by a smiling face or a ribbon smart and my heart was in sore distress then phyllis came by and her face was fair the light gleamed soft on her raven hair and her lips were blooming a rosy red then my heart spoke out with a right bold air thou art worse than a fool o head accountability folks aint got no right to

is over all the teeming lists and there is pause a breathspace in the strife a spirit brave has passed beyond the mists and vapors that obscure the sun of life and ethiopia with bosom torn laments the passing of her noblest born she weeps for him a mothers burning tears she loved him with a mothers deepest love he was her champion thro direful years and held her weal all other ends above when bondage held her bleeding in the dust he raised her up and whispered hope and trust for her his voice a fearless clarion rung that broke in warning on the ears of men for her the strong bow of his power he strung and sent his arrows to the very den where grim oppression held his bloody place and gloated oer the misries of a race and he was no softtongued apologist he spoke straightforward fearlessly uncowed the sunlight of his truth dispelled the mist and set in bold relief each dark hued cloud to sin and crime he gave their proper hue and hurled at evil what was evils due through good and ill report he cleaved his way right onward with his face set toward the heights nor feared to face the foemans dread array the lash of scorn the sting of petty spites he dared the lightning in the lightnings track and answered thunder with his thunder back when men maligned him and their torrent wrath in furious imprecations oer him broke he kept his counsel as he kept his path t was for his race not for himself he spoke he knew the import of his masters call and felt himself too mighty to be small no miser in the good he held was he his kindness followed his horizons rim his heart his talents and his hands were free to all who truly needed aught of him where poverty and ignorance were rife he gave his bounty as he gave his life the place and cause that first aroused his might still proved its power until his latest day in freedoms lists and for the aid of right still in the foremost rank he waged the fray wrong lived his occupation was not gone he died in action with his armor on we weep for him but we have touched his hand and felt the magic of his presence nigh the current that he sent throughout the land the kindling spirit of his battlecry oer all that holds us we shall triumph yet and place our banner where his hopes were set oh douglass thou hast passed beyond the shore but still thy voice is ringing oer the gale thou st taught thy race how high her hopes may soar and bade her seek the heights nor faint nor fail she will not fail she heeds thy stirring cry she knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh and rising from beneath the chastning rod she stretches out her bleeding hands to god life a crust of bread and a corner to sleep in a minute to smile and an hour to weep in a pint of joy to a peck of trouble and never a laugh but the moans come double and that is life a crust and a corner that love makes precious with a smile to warm and the tears to refresh us and joy seems sweeter when cares come after and a moan is the finest of foils for laughter and that is life the lesson my cot was down by a cypress grove and i sat by my window the whole night long and heard well up from the deep dark wood a mockingbirds passionate song and i thought of myself so sad and lone and my lifes cold winter that knew no spring of my mind so weary and sick and wild of my heart too sad to sing but een as i listened the mockbirds song a thought stole into my saddened heart and i said i can cheer some other soul by a carols simple art for oft from the darkness of hearts and lives come songs that brim with joy and light as out of the gloom of the cypress grove the mockingbird sings at night so i sang a lay for a brothers ear in a strain to soothe his bleeding heart and he smiled at the sound of my voice and lyre though mine was a feeble art but at his smile i smiled in turn and into my soul there came a ray in trying to soothe anothers woes mine own had passed away the rising of the storm the lakes dark breast is all unrest it heaves with a sob and a sigh like a tremulous bird from its slumber stirred the moon is atilt in the sky from the silent deep the waters sweep but faint on the cold white stones and the wavelets fly with a plaintive cry oer the old earths bare bleak bones and the spray upsprings on its ghostwhite wings and tosses a kiss at the stars while a watersprite in seapearls dight hums a seahymns solemn bars far out in the night on the wavering sight i see a dark hull loom and its light on high like a cyclops eye shines out through the mist and gloom now the winds well up from the earths deep cup and fall on the sea and shore and against the pier the waters rear and break with a sullen roar up comes the gale and the mistwrought veil gives way to the lightnings glare and the clouddrifts fall a sombre pall oer water earth and air the stormking flies his whip he plies and bellows down the wind the lightning rash with blinding flash comes pricking on behind rise waters rise and taunt the skies with your swiftflitting form sweep wild winds sweep and tear the deep to atoms in the storm and the waters leapt and the wild winds swept and blew out the moon in the sky and i laughed with glee it was joy to me as the storm went raging by sunset the river sleeps beneath the sky and clasps the shadows to its breast the crescent moon shines dim on high and in the lately radiant west the gold is fading into gray now stills the lark his festive lay and mourns with me the dying day while in the south the first faint star lifts to the night its silver face and twinkles to the moon afar across the heavens graying space low murmurs reach me from the town as day puts on her sombre crown and shakes her mantle darkly down the old appletree theres a memory keeps arunnin through my weary head tonight an i see a picture dancin in the fireflames ruddy light tis the picture of an orchard wrapped in autumns purple haze with the tender light about it that i loved in other days an astandin in a corner once again i seem to see the verdant leaves an branches of an old appletree you perhaps would call it ugly an i dont know but its so when you look the tree all over unadorned by memorys glow for its boughs are gnarled an crooked an its leaves are gettin thin an the apples of its bearin would nt fill so large a bin as they used to but i tell you when it comes to pleasin me its the dearest in the orchard is that old appletree i would hide within its shelter settlin in some cosy nook where no calls nor threats could stir me from the pages o my book oh that quiet sweet seclusion in its fulness passeth words it was deeper than the deepest that my sanctum now affords why the jaybirds an the robins they was hand in glove with me as they winked at me an warbled in that old appletree it was on its sturdy branches that in summers long ago i would tie my swing an dangle in contentment to an fro idly dreamin childish fancies buildin castles in the air makin o myself a hero of romances rich an rare i kin shet my eyes an see it jest as plain as plain kin be that same old swing adanglin to the old appletree theres a rustic seat beneath it that i never kin forget its the place where me an hallie little sweetheart used to set when we d wander to the orchard so s no listenin ones could hear as i whispered sugared nonsense into her little willin ear now my gray old wife is hallie an i m grayer still than she but i ll not forget our courtin neath the old appletree life for us aint all been summer but i guess we we had our share of its flittin joys an pleasures an a sprinklin of its care oft the skies have smiled upon us then again we ve seen em frown though our load was neer so heavy that we longed to lay it down but when death does come acallin this my last request shall be that they ll bury me an hallie neath the old apple tree a prayer o lord the hardwon miles have worn my stumbling feet oh soothe me with thy smiles and make my life complete the thorns were thick and keen whereer i trembling trod the way was long between my wounded feet and god where healing waters flow do thou my footsteps lead my heart is aching so thy gracious balm i need passion and love a maiden wept and as a comforter came one who cried i love thee and he seized her in his arms and kissed her with hot breath that dried the tears upon her flaming cheeks while evermore his boldly blazing eye burned into hers but she uncomforted shrank from his arms and only wept the more then one came and gazed mutely in her face with wide and wistful eyes but still aloof he held himself as with a reverent fear as one who knows some sacred presence nigh and as she wept he mingled tear with tear that cheered her soul like dew a dusty flower until she smiled approached and touched his hand the seedling as a quiet little seedling lay within its darksome bed to itself it fell atalking and this is what it said i am not so very robust but i ll do the best i can and the seedling from that moment its work of life began so it pushed a little leaflet up into the light of day to examine the surroundings and show the rest the way the leaflet liked the prospect so it called its brother stem then two other leaflets heard it and quickly followed them to be sure the haste and hurry made the seedling sweat and pant but almost before it knew it it found itself a plant the sunshine poured upon it and the clouds they gave a shower and the little plant kept growing till it found itself a flower little folks be like the seedling always do the best you can every child must share lifes labor just as well as every man and the sun and showers will help you through the lonesome struggling hours till you raise to light and beauty virtues fair unfading flowers promise i grew a rose within a garden fair and tending it with more than loving care i thought how with the glory of its bloom i should the darkness of my life illume and watching ever smiled to see the lusty bud drink freely in the summer sun to tinct its blood my rose began to open and its hue was sweet to me as to it sun and dew i watched it taking on its ruddy flame until the day of perfect blooming came then hasted i with smiles to find it blushing red too late some thoughtless child had plucked my rose and fled fulfilment i grew a rose once more to please mine eyes all things to aid it dew sun wind fair skies were kindly and to shield it from despoil i fenced it safely in with grateful toil no other hand than mine shall pluck this flower said i and i was jealous of the bee that hovered nigh it grew for days i stood hour after hour to watch the slow unfolding of the flower and then i did not leave its side at all lest some mischance my flower should befall at last oh joy the central petals burst apart it blossomed but alas a worm was at its heart song my heart to thy heart my hand to thine my lip to thy lips kisses are wine brewed for the lover in sunshine and shade let me drink deep then my african maid lily to lily rose unto rose my love to thy love tenderly grows rend not the oak and the ivy in twain nor the swart maid from her swarthier swain an antebellum sermon we is gathahed hyeah my brothahs in dis howlin wildaness fu to

and spread its leaves so fresh and young its blossoms now are blowing on every hand in this fair land proud ethiopes swarthy children stand beside their fairer neighbor the forests flee before their stroke their hammers ring their forges smoke they stir in honest labour they tread the fields where honour calls their voices sound through senate halls in majesty and power to right they cling the hymns they sing up to the skies in beauty ring and bolder grow each hour be proud my race in mind and soul thy name is writ on glorys scroll in characters of fire high mid the clouds of fames bright sky thy banners blazoned folds now fly and truth shall lift them higher thou hast the right to noble pride whose spotless robes were purified by bloods severe baptism upon thy brow the cross was laid

past and proved them men so noble in forgiving go on and up our souls and eyes shall follow thy continuous rise our ears shall list thy story from bards who from thy root shall spring and proudly tune their lyres to sing of ethiopias glory the cornstalk fiddle when the corn s all cut and the bright stalks shine like the burnished spears of a field of gold when the fieldmice rich on the nubbins dine and the frost comes white and the wind blows cold then its heigho fellows and hididdlediddle for the time is ripe for the cornstalk fiddle and you take a stalk that is straight and long with an expert eye to its worthy points and you think of the bubbling strains of song that are bound between its pithy joints then you cut out strings with a bridge in the middle with a cornstalk bow for a cornstalk fiddle then the strains that grow as you draw the bow oer the yielding strings with a practised hand and the musics flow never loud but low is the concert note of a fairy band oh your dainty songs are a misty riddle to the simple sweets of the cornstalk fiddle when the eve comes on and our work is done and the sun drops down with a tender glance with their hearts all prime for the harmless fun come the neighbor girls for the evenings dance and they wait for the wellknown twist and twiddle more time than tune from the cornstalk fiddle then brother jabez takes the bow while ned stands off with susan bland then henry stops by milly snow and john takes nellie joness hand while i pair off with mandy biddle and scrape scrape scrape goes the cornstalk fiddle salute your partners comes the call all join hands and circle round grand train back and balance all footsteps lightly spurn the ground take your lady and balance down the middle to the merry strains of the cornstalk fiddle so the night goes on and the dance is oer and the merry girls are homeward gone but i see it all in my sleep once more and i dream till the very break of dawn of an impish dance on a redhot griddle to the screech and scrape of a cornstalk fiddle the masterplayer an old worn harp that had been played till all its strings were loose and frayed joy hate and fear each one essayed to play but each in turn had found no sweet responsiveness of sound then love the masterplayer came with heaving breast and eyes aflame the harp he took all undismayed smote on its strings still strange to song and brought forth music sweet and strong the mystery i was not now i am a few days hence i shall not be i fain would look before and after but can neither do some power or lack of power says no to all i would i stand upon a wide and sunless plain nor chart nor steel to guide my steps aright wheneer oercoming fear i dare to move i grope without direction and by chance some feign to hear a voice and feel a hand that draws them ever upward thro the gloom but i i hear no voice and touch no hand tho oft thro silence infinite i list and strain my hearing to supernal sounds tho oft thro fateful darkness do i reach and stretch my hand to find that other hand i question of th eternal bending skies that seem to neighbor with the novice earth but they roll on and daily shut their eyes on me as i one day shall do on them and tell me not the secret that i ask not they who soar not they who soar but they who plod their rugged way unhelped to god are heroes they who higher fare and flying fan the upper air miss all the toil that hugs the sod tis they whose backs have felt the rod whose feet have pressed the path unshod may smile upon defeated care not they who soar high up there are no thorns to prod nor boulders lurking neath the clod to turn the keenness of the share for flight is ever free and rare but heroes they the soil who ve trod not they who soar whittier not oer thy dust let there be spent the gush of maudlin sentiment such drift as that is not for thee whose life and deeds and songs agree sublime in their simplicity nor shall the sorrowing tear be shed o singer sweet thou art not dead in spite of times malignant chill with living fire thy songs shall thrill and men shall say he liveth still great poets never die for earth doth count their lives of too great worth to lose them from her treasured store so shalt thou live for evermore though far thy form from mortal ken deep in the hearts and minds of men two songs a bee that was searching for sweets one day through the gate of a rose garden happened to stray in the heart of a rose he hid away and forgot in his bliss the light of day as sipping his honey he buzzed in song though day was waning he lingered long for the rose was sweet so sweet a robin sits pluming his ruddy breast and a madrigal sings to his love in her nest oh the skies they are blue the fields are green and the birds in your nest will soon be seen she hangs on his words with a thrill of love and chirps to him as he sits above for the song is sweet so sweet a maiden was out on a summers day with the winds and the waves and the flowers at play and she met with a youth of gentle air with the light of the sunshine on his hair together they wandered the flowers among they loved and loving they lingered long for to love is sweet so sweet bird of my ladys

sweetest dreamings oer and oer i think i should not find the clouds so dim and gray and not so loud the waves complaining at the shore if you could sit with me upon the shore today and hold my hand in yours as in the days of old i think i should not mind the chill baptismal spray nor find my hand and heart and all the world so cold if you could walk with me upon the strand today and tell me that my longing love had won your own i think all my sad thoughts would then be put away and i could give back laughter for the oceans moan the path there are no beaten paths to glorys height there are no rules to compass greatness known each for himself must cleave a path alone and press his own way forward in the fight smooth is the way to ease and calm delight and soft the road sloth chooseth for her own but he who craves the flower of life fullblown must struggle up in all his armor dight what though the burden bear him sorely down and crush to dust the mountain of his pride oh then with strong heart let him still abide for rugged is the roadway to renown nor may he hope to gain the envied crown till he hath thrust the looming rocks aside the lawyers ways i ve been listnin to them lawyers in the court house up the street an i ve come to the conclusion that im most completely beat fust one feller riz to argy an he boldly waded in as he dressed the tremblin prisner in a coat o deepdyed sin why he painted him all over in a hue o blackest crime an he smeared his reputation with the thickest kind o grime tell i found myself awondrin in a misty way and dim how the lord had come to fashion sich an awful man as him then the other lawyer started an with brimmin tearful eyes said his client was a martyr that was brought to sacrifice an he give to that same prisner every blessed human grace tell i saw the light o virtue fairly shinin from his face then i own at i was puzzled how sich things could rightly be an this aggervatin question seems to keep apuzzlin me so will some one please inform me an this mystery unroll how an angel an a devil can persess the selfsame soul ode for memorial day done are the toils and the wearisome marches done is the summons of bugle and drum softly and sweetly the sky overarches sheltring a land where rebellion is dumb dark were the days of the countrys derangement sad were the hours when the conflict was on but through the gloom of fraternal estrangement god sent his light and we welcome the dawn oer the expanse of our mighty dominions sweeping away to the uttermost parts peace the wideflying on untiring pinions bringeth her message of joy to our hearts ah but this joy which our minds cannot measure what did it cost for our fathers to gain bought at the price of the hearts dearest treasure born out of travail and sorrow and pain born in the battle where fleet death was flying slaying with sabrestroke bloody and fell born where the heroes and martyrs were dying torn by the fury of bullet and shell ah but the day is past silent the rattle and the confusion that followed the fight peace to the heroes who died in the battle martyrs to truth and the crowning of right out of the blood of a conflict fraternal out of the dust and the dimness of death burst into blossoms of glory eternal flowers that sweeten the world with their breath flowers of charity peace and devotion bloom in the hearts that are empty of strife love that is boundless and broad as the ocean leaps into beauty and fulness of life so with the singing of paeans and chorals and with the flag flashing high in the sun place on the graves of our heroes the laurels which their unfaltering valor has won premonition dear heart goodnight nay list awhile that sweet voice singing when the world is all so bright and the sound of song sets the heart aringing oh love it is not right not then to say goodnight dear heart goodnight the late winds in the lake weeds shiver and the spray flies cold and white and the voice that sings gives a telltale quiver ah yes the world is bright but dearest heart goodnight dear heart goodnight and do not longer seek to hold me for my soul is in affright as the fearful glooms in their pall enfold me see him who sang how white and still so dear goodnight dear heart goodnight thy hand i ll press no more forever and mine eyes shall lose the light for the great white wraith by the winding river shall check my steps with might so dear goodnight goodnight retrospection when you and i were young the days were filled with scent of pink and rose and full of joy from dawn till close from mornings mist till evenings haze and when the robin sung his song the verdant woodland ways along we whistled louder than he sung and school was joy and work was sport for which the hours were all too short when you and i were young my boy when you and i were young when you and i were young the woods brimmed bravely oer with every joy to charm the happyhearted boy the quail turned out her timid broods the prickly copse a hostess fine held high black cups of harmless wine and low the laden grapevine swung with beads of nightkissed amethyst where buzzing lovers held their tryst when you and i were young my boy when you and i were young when you and i were young the cool and fresh wind fanned our fevered brows when tumbling oer the scented mows or stripping by the dimpling pool sedgefringed about its shimmering face save where we d worn an entring place how with our shouts the calm banks rung how flashed the spray as we plunged in pure gems that never caused a sin when you and i were young my boy when you and i were young when you and i were young we heard all sounds of nature with delight the whirr of wing in sudden flight the chirping of the babybird the columbines red bells were rung the locusts vested chorus sung while every wind his zithern strung to high and holysounding keys and played sonatas in the trees when you and i were young my boy when you and i were young when you and i were young we knew to shout and laugh to work and play and night was partner to the day in all our joys so swift time flew on silent wings that ere we wist the fleeting years had fled unmissed and from our hearts this cry was wrung to fill with fond regret and tears the days of our remaining years when you and i were young my boy when you and i were young unexpressed deep in my heart that aches with the repression and strives with plenitude of bitter pain there lives a thought that clamors for expression and spends its undelivered force in vain what boots it that some other may have thought it the right of thoughts expression is divine the price of pain i pay for it has bought it i care not who lays claim to it t is mine and yet not mine until it be delivered the manner of its birth shall prove the test alas alas my rock of pride is shivered i beat my brow the thought still unexpressed song of summer dis is gospel weathah sho hills is sawt o hazy meddahs level ez a flo callin to

the hedge sweet perfumes scent the balmy air and life is brimming everywhere what lark and breeze and bluebird sing is spring spring spring no more the air is sharp and cold the planter wends across the wold and glad beneath the shining sky we wander forth my love and i and ever in our hearts doth ring this song of spring spring for life is life and love is love twixt maid and man or dove and dove life may be short life may be long but love will come and to its song shall this refrain for ever cling of spring spring spring to louise oh the poets may sing of their lady irenes and may rave in their rhymes about wonderful queens but i throw my poetical wings to the breeze and soar in a song to my lady louise a sweet little maid who is dearer i ween than any fair duchess or even a queen when speaking of her i cant plod in my prose for she s the wee lassie who gave me a rose since poets from seeing a ladys lip curled have written fair verse that has sweetened the world why then should not i give the space of an hour to making a song in return for a flower i have found in my life it has not been so long there are too few of flowers too little of song so out of that blossom this lay of mine grows for the dear little lady who gave me the rose i thank god for innocence dearer than art that lights on a byway which leads to the heart and led by an impulse no less than divine walks into the temple and sits at the shrine i would rather pluck daisies that grow in the wild or take one simple rose from the hand of a child then to breathe the rich fragrance of flowers that bide in the gardens of luxury passion and pride i know not my wee one how came you to know which way to my heart was the right way to go unless in your purity soulclean and clear god whispers his messages into your ear you have now had my song let me end with a prayer that your life may be always sweet happy and fair that your joys may be many and absent your woes o dear little lady who gave me the rose the rivals t was three an thirty year ago when i was ruther young you know i had my last an only fight about a gal one summer night t was me an zekel johnson zeke n me d ben spattin bout a week

lover and the moon a lover whom duty called over the wave with himself communed will my love be true if left to herself had i better not sue some friend to watch over her good and grave but my friend might fail in my need he said and i return to find love dead since friendships fade like the flowrs of june i will leave her in charge of the stable moon then he said to the moon o dear old moon who for years and years from thy thrown above hast nurtured and guarded young lovers and love my heart has but come to its waiting june and the promise time of the budding vine oh guard thee well this love of mine and he harked him then while all was still and the pale moon answered and said i will and he sailed in his ship oer many seas and he wandered wide oer strange far strands in isles of the south and in orient lands where pestilence lurks in the breath of the breeze but his star was high so he braved the main and sailed him blithely home again and with joy he bended his footsteps soon to learn of his love from the matron moon she sat as of yore in her olden place serene as death in her silver chair a white rose gleamed in her whiter hair and the tint of a blush was on her face at sight of the youth she sadly bowed and hid her face neath a gracious cloud she faltered faint on the nights dim marge but how spoke the youth have you kept your charge the moon was sad at a trust illkept the blush went out in her blanching cheek and her voice was timid and low and weak as she made her plea and sighed and wept oh another prayed and another plead and i could nt resist she answering said but love still grows in the hearts of men go forth dear youth and love again but he turned him away from her proffered grace thou art false o moon as the hearts of men i will not will not love again and he turned sheer round with a soulsick face to the sea and cried sea curse the moon who makes her vows and forgets so soon and the awful sea with anger stirred and his breast heaved hard as he lay and heard and ever the moon wept down in rain and ever her sighs rose high in wind but the earth and sea were deaf and blind and she wept and sighed her griefs in vain and ever at night when the storm is fierce the cries of a wraith through the thunder pierce and the waves strain their awful hands on high to tear the false moon from the sky conscience and remorse goodbye i said to my conscience goodbye for aye and aye and i put her hands off harshly and turned my face away and conscience smitten sorely returned not from that day but a time came when my spirit grew weary of its pace and i cried come back my conscience i long to see thy face but conscience cried i cannot remorse sits in my place ione i ah yes t is sweet still to remember though twere less painful to forget for while my heart glows like an ember mine eyes with sorrows drops are wet and oh my heart is aching yet it is a law of mortal pain that old wounds long accounted well beneath the memorys potent spell will wake to life and bleed again so t is with me it might be better if i should turn no look behind if i could curb my heart and fetter from reminiscent gaze my mind or let my soul go blind go blind but would i do it if i could nay ease at such a price were spurned for since my love was once returned all that i suffer seemeth good i know i know it is the fashion when love has left some heart distressed to weight the air with wordful passion but i am glad that in my breast i ever held so dear a guest love does not come at every nod or every voice that calleth hasten he seeketh out some heart to chasten and whips it wailing up to god love is no random road wayfarer who where he may must sip his glass love is the king the purplewearer whose guard recks not of tree or grass to blaze the way that he may pass what if my heart be in the blast that heralds his triumphant way shall i repine shall i not say rejoice my heart the king has passed in life each heart holds some sad story the saddest ones are never told i too have dreamed of fame and glory and viewed the future bright with gold but that is as a tale long told mine eyes have lost their youthful flash my cunning hand has lost its art i am not old but in my heart the ember lies beneath the ash i loved why not my heart was youthful my mind was filled with healthy thought he doubts not whose own self is truthful doubt by dishonesty is taught so loved i boldly fearing naught i did not walk this lowly earth mine was a newer higher sphere where youth was long and life was dear and all save love was little worth her likeness would that i might limn it as love did with enduring art nor dust of days nor death may dim it where it lies graven on my heart of this sad fabric of my life a part i would that i might paint her now as i beheld her in that day ere her first bloom had passed away and left the lines upon her brow a face serene that beaming brightly disarmed the hot suns glances bold a foot that kissed the ground so lightly he frowned in wrath and deemed her cold but loved her still though he was old a form where every maiden grace bloomed to perfections richest flower the statued pose of conscious power like lithelimbed dians of the chase beneath a brow too fair for frowning like moonlit deeps that glass the skies till all the hosts above seem drowning looked forth her steadfast hazel eyes with gaze serene and purely wise and over all her tresses rare which when with his desire grown weak the night bent down to kiss her cheek entrapped and held him captive there this was ione a spirit finer neer burned to ash its house of clay a soul instinct with fire diviner neer fled athwart the face of day and tempted time with earthly stay her loveliness was not alone of face and form and tresses hue for aye a pure high soul shone through her every act this was ione ii t was in the radiant summer weather when god looked smiling from the sky and we went wandring much together by wood and lane ione and i attracted by the subtle tie of common thoughts and common tastes of eyes whose vision saw the same and freely granted beautys claim where others found but worthless wastes we paused to hear the far bells ringing across the distance sweet and clear we listened to the wild birds singing the song he meant for his mates ear and deemed our chance to do so dear we loved to watch the warrior sun with flaming shield and flaunting crest go striding down the gory west when days long fight was fought and won and life became a different story whereer i looked i saw new light earths self assumed a greater glory mine eyes were cleared to fuller sight then first i saw the need and might of that fair band the singing throng who gifted with the skill divine take up the threads of life spun fine and weave them into soulful song they sung for me whose passion pressing my soul found vent in song nor line they bore the burden of expressing all that i felt with arts design and every word of theirs was mine i read them to ione ofttimes by hill and shore beneath fair skies and she looked deeply in mine eyes and knew my love spoke through their rhymes her life was like the stream that floweth and mine was like the waiting sea her love was like the flower that bloweth and mine was like the searching bee i found her sweetness all for me god plied him in the mint of time and coined for us a golden day and rolled it ringing down lifes way with loves sweet music in its chime and god unclasped the book of ages and laid it open to our sight upon the dimness of its pages so long consigned to rayless night he shed the glory of his light we read them well we read them long and ever thrilling did we see that love ruled all humanity the master passion pure and strong iii today my skies are bare and ashen and bend on me without a beam since love is held the masterpassion its loss must be the pain supreme and grinning fate has wrecked my dream but pardon dear departed guest i will not rant i will not rail for good the grain must feel the flail there are whom love has never blessed i had and have a younger brother one whom i loved and love today as never fond and doting mother adored the babe who found its way from heavenly scenes into her day oh he was full of youths new wine a man on lifes ascending slope flushed with ambition full of hope and every wish of his was mine a kingly youth the way before him was thronged with victories to be won so joyous too the heavens oer him were bright with an unchanging sun his days with rhyme were overrun toil had not taught him natures prose tears had not dimmed his brilliant eyes and sorrow had not made him wise his life was in the budding rose i know not how i came to waken some instinct pricked my soul to sight my heart by some vague thrill was shaken a thrill so true and yet so slight i hardly deemed i read aright as when a sleeper ignrant why not knowing what mysterious hand has called him out of slumberland starts up to find some danger nigh love is a guest that comes unbidden but having come asserts his right he will not be repressed nor hidden and so my brothers dawning plight became uncovered to my sight some soundmote in his passing tone caught in the meshes of my ear some little glance a shade too dear betrayed the love he bore ione what could i do he was my brother and young and full of hope and trust i could not dared not try to smother his flame and turn his heart to dust i knew how oft life gives a crust to starving men who cry for bread but he was young so few his days he had not learned the great worlds ways nor disappointments volumes read however fair and rich the booty i could not make his loss my gain for love is dear but dearer duty and here my way was clear and plain i saw how i could save him pain and so with all my day grown dim that this loved brothers sun might shine i joined his suit gave over mine and sought ione to plead for him i found her in an eastern bower where all day long the amrous sun lay by to woo a timid flower this day his course was wellnigh run but still with lingering art he spun gold fancies on the shadowed wall the vines waved soft and green above and there where one might tell his love i told my griefs i told her all i told her all and as she hearkened a teardrop fell upon her dress with grief her flushing brow was darkened one sob that she could not repress betrayed the depths of her distress upon her grief my sorrow fed and i was bowed with unlived years my heart swelled with a sea of tears the tears my manhood could not shed the world is rome and fate is nero disporting in the hour of doom god made us men times make the hero but in that awful space of gloom i gave no thought but sorrows room all all was dim within that bower what time the sun divorced the day and all the shadows glooming gray proclaimed the sadness of the hour she could not speak no word was needed her look half strength and half despair told me i had not vainly pleaded that she would not ignore my prayer and so she turned and left me there and as she went so passed my bliss she loved me i could not mistake but for her own and my loves sake her womanhood could rise to this my wounded heart fled swift to cover and life at times seemed very drear my brother proved an ardent lover what had so young a man to fear he wed ione within the year no shadow clouds her tranquil brow men speak her husbands name with pride while she sits honored at his side she is she must be happy now i doubt the course i took no longer since those i love seem satisfied the bond between them will grow stronger as they go forward side by side then will my pains be jusfied their joy is mine and that is best i am not totally bereft for i have still the memry left love stopped with me a royal guest religion i am no priest of crooks nor creeds for human wants and human needs are more to me than prophets deeds and human tears and human cares affect me more than human prayers go cease your wail lugubrious saint you fret high heaven with your plaint is this the christians joy you paint is this the christians boasted bliss avails your faith

you love you re dreaming there in paris but this is natures law love though just it may not seem that men should wake to sing love while maidens sleep and dream them care may not molest love nor stir them from their slumbers though midnight find the swain love still halting oer his numbers i watch the rosy dawn love come stealing up the east while all things round rejoice love that night her reign has ceased the lark will soon be heard love and on his way be winging when natures poets wake love why should a man be singing columbian ode i four hundred years ago a tangled waste lay sleeping on the west atlantics side their devious ways the old worlds millions traced content and loved and labored dared and died while students still believed the charts they conned and revelled in their thriftless ignorance nor dreamed of other lands that lay beyond old oceans dense indefinite expanse ii but deep within her heart old nature knew that she had once arrayed at earths behest another offspring fine and fair to view the chosen suckling of the mothers breast the child was wrapped in vestments soft and fine each fold a work of natures matchless art the mother looked on it with love divine and strained the loved one closely to her heart and there it lay and with the warmth grew strong and hearty by the salt sea breezes fanned till time with mellowing touches passed along and changed the infant to a mighty land iii but men knew naught of this till there arose that mighty mariner the genoese who dared to try in spite of fears and foes the unknown fortunes of unsounded seas o noblest of italias sons thy bark went not alone into that shrouding night o dauntless darer of the rayless dark the world sailed with thee to eternal light the deerhaunts that with game were crowded

honey jump back the dilettante a modern type he scribbles some in prose and verse and now and then he prints it he paints a little gathers some of natures gold and mints it he plays a little sings a song acts tragic roles or funny he does because his love is strong but not oh not for money he studies almost everything from social art to science a thirsty mind a flowing spring demand and swift compliance he looms above the sordid crowd at least through friendly lenses while his mamma looks pleased and proud and kindly pays expenses by the stream by the stream i dream in calm delight and watch as in a glass how the clouds like crowds of snowyhued and whiterobed maidens pass and the water into ripples breaks and sparkles as it spreads like a host of armored knights with silver helmets on their heads and i deem the stream an emblem fit of human life may go for i find a mind may sparkle much and yet but shallows show and a soul may glow with myriad lights and wondrous mysteries when it only lies a dormant thing and mirrors what it sees the colored soldiers if the muse were mine to tempt it and my feeble voice were strong if my tongue were trained to measures i would sing a stirring song i would sing a song heroic of those noble sons of ham of the gallant colored soldiers who fought for uncle sam in the early days you scorned them and with many a flip and flout said these battles are the white mans and the whites will fight them out up the hills you fought and faltered in the vales you strove and bled while your ears still heard the thunder of the foes advancing tread then distress fell on the nation and the flag was drooping low should the dust pollute your banner no the nation shouted no so when war in savage triumph spread abroad his funeral pall then you called the colored soldiers and they answered to your call and like hounds unleashed and eager for the life blood of the prey sprung they forth and bore them bravely in the thickest of the fray and whereer the fight was hottest where the bullets fastest fell there they pressed unblanched and fearless at the very mouth of hell ah they rallied to the standard to uphold it by their might none were stronger in the labors none were braver in the fight from the blazing breach of wagner to the plains of olustee they were foremost in the fight of the battles of the free and at pillow god have mercy on the deeds committed there and the souls of those poor victims sent to thee without a prayer let the fulness of thy pity oer the hot wrought spirits sway of the gallant colored soldiers who fell fighting on that day yes the blacks enjoy their freedom and they won it dearly too for the life blood of their thousands did the southern fields bedew in the darkness of their bondage in the depths of slaverys night their muskets flashed the dawning and they fought their way to light they were comrades then and brothers are they more or less today they were good to stop a bullet and to front the fearful fray they were citizens and soldiers when rebellion raised its head and the traits that made them worthy ah those virtues are not dead they have shared your nightly vigils they have shared your daily toil and their blood with yours commingling has enriched the southern soil they have slept and marched and suffered neath the same dark skies as you they have met as fierce a foeman and have been as brave and true and their deeds shall find a record in the registry of fame for their blood has cleansed completely every blot of slaverys shame so all honor and all glory to those noble sons of ham the gallant colored soldiers who fought for uncle sam nature and art to my friend charles booth nettleton i the young queen nature ever sweet and fair once on a time fell upon evil days from hearing oft herself discussed with praise there grew within her heart the longing rare to see herself and every passing air the warm desire fanned into lusty blaze full oft she sought this end by devious ways but sought in vain so fell she in despair for none within her train nor by her side could solve the task or give the envied boon so day and night beneath the sun and moon she wandered to and fro unsatisfied till art came by a blithe inventive elf and made a glass wherein she saw herself ii enrapt the queen gazed on her glorious self then trembling with the thrill of sudden thought commanded that the skilful wight be brought that she might dower him with lands and pelf then out upon the silent sealapt shelf and up the hills and on the downs they sought him who so well and wondrously had wrought and with much search found and brought home the elf but he put by all gifts with sad replies and from his lips these words flowed forth like wine o queen i want no gift but thee he said she heard and looked on him with lovelit eyes gave him her hand low murmuring i am thine and at the morrows dawning they were wed after while a poem of faith i think that though the clouds be dark that though the waves dash oer the bark yet after while the light will come and in calm waters safe at home the bark will anchor weep not my sadeyed grayrobed maid because your fairest blossoms fade that sorrow still oerruns your cup and even though you root them up the weeds grow ranker for after while your tears shall cease and sorrow shall give way to peace the flowers shall bloom the weeds shall die and in that faith seen by and by thy woes shall perish smile at old fortunes adverse tide smile when the scoffers sneer and chide oh not for you the gems that pale and not for you the flowers that fail let this thought cherish that after while the clouds will part and then with joy the waiting heart shall feel the light come stealing in that drives away the cloud of sin and breaks its power and you shall burst your chrysalis and wing away to realms of bliss untrammelled pure divinely free above all earths anxiety from that same hour the ol tunes you kin talk about yer anthems an yer arias an sich an yer modern choirsingin that you think so awful rich but you orter heerd us youngsters in the times now far away asingin o the ol tunes in the olfashioned way there was some of us sung treble an a few of us growled bass an the tide o song flowed smoothly with its compniment o grace there was spirit in that music an a kind o solemn sway asingin o the ol tunes in the olfashioned way i remember oft o standin in my homespun pantaloons on my face the bronze an freckles o the suns o youthful junes thinkin that no mortal minstrel ever chanted sich a lay as the ol tunes we was singin in the olfashioned way the boys ud always lead us an the girls ud all chime in till the sweetness o the singin robbed the listnin soul o sin an i used to tell the parson t was as good to sing as pray when the people sung the ol tunes in the olfashioned way how i long agin to hear em pourin forth from soul to soul with the treble high an meller an the basss mighty roll but the times is very diffrent an the music heerd today aint the singin o the ol tunes in the olfashioned way little screechin by a woman little squawkin by a man then the organs twiddletwaddle jest the empty space to span an ef you should even think it t is nt proper fur to say that you want to hear the ol tunes in the olfashioned way but i think that some bright mornin when the toils of life air oer an the sun o heaven arisin glads with light the happy shore i shall hear the angel chorus in the realms of endless day asingin o the ol tunes in the olfashioned way melancholia silently without my window tapping gently at the pane falls the rain through the trees sighs the breeze like a soul in pain here alone i sit and weep thought hath banished sleep wearily i sit and listen to the waters ceaseless drip to my lip fate turns up the bitter cup forcing me to sip t is a bitter bitter drink thus i sit and think thinking things unknown and awful thoughts on wild uncanny themes waking dreams spectres dark corpses stark show the gaping seams whence the cold and cruel knife stole away their life bloodshot eyes all strained and staring gazing ghastly into mine blood like wine on the brow clotted now shows deaths dreadful sign lonely vigil still i keep would that i might sleep still oh still my brain is whirling still runs on my stream of thought i am caught in the net fate hath set mind and soul are brought to destructions very brink yet i can but think eyes that look into the future peeping forth from out my mind they will find some new weight soon or late on my soul to bind crushing all its courage out heavier than doubt dawn the eastern monarchs daughter rising from her dewy bed lays her head gainst the clouds sombre shrouds now half fringed with red oer the land she gins to peep come o gentle sleep hark the morning cock is crowing dreams like ghosts must hie away tis the day rosy morn now is born dark thoughts may not stay day my brain from foes will keep now my soul i sleep the wooing a youth went faring up and down alack and welladay he fared him to the market town alack and welladay and there he met a maiden fair with hazel eyes and auburn hair his heart went from him then and there alack and welladay she posies sold right merrily alack and welladay but not a flower was fair as she alack and welladay he bought a rose and sighed a sigh ah dearest maiden would that i might dare the seller too to buy alack and welladay she tossed her head the coy coquette alack and welladay im not sir in the market yet alack and welladay your love must cool upon a shelf tho much i sell for gold and pelf i m yet too young to sell myself alack and welladay the youth was filled with sorrow sore alack and welladay and looked he at the maid once more alack and welladay then loud he cried fair maiden if too young to sell now as i live youre not too young yourself to give alack and welladay the little maid cast down her eyes alack and welladay and many a flush began to rise alack and welladay why since you are so bold she said i doubt not you are highly bred so take me and the twain were wed alack and welladay merry autumn its all a farce these tales they tell about the breezes sighing and moans astir oer field and dell because the year is dying such principles are most absurd i care not who first taught em theres nothing known to beast or bird to make a solemn autumn in solemn times when grief holds sway with countenance distressing youll note the more of black and gray will then be used in dressing now purple tints are all around the sky is blue and mellow and een the grasses turn the ground from modest green to yellow the seed burrs all with laughter crack on featherweed and jimson and leaves that should be dressed in black are all decked out in crimson a butterfly goes winging by a singing bird comes after and nature all from earth to sky is bubbling oer with laughter the ripples wimple on the rills like sparkling little lasses the sunlight runs along the hills and laughs among the grasses the earth is just so full of fun it really cant contain it and streams of mirth so freely run the heavens seem to rain it dont talk to me of solemn days in autumns time of splendor because the sun shows fewer rays and these grow slant and slender why its the climax of the year the highest time of living till naturally its bursting cheer just

planted and dug and tended toiling in joy from dew to dew the sun was kind and the rain befriended fine grew his orchard and fair to view then he said i will quiet my thrifty fears for here is fruit for my failing years but even then the stormclouds gathered swallowing up the azure sky the sweeping winds into white foam lathered the placid breast of the bay hard by then the spirits that raged in the darkened air swept oer his orchard and left it bare the old man stood in the rain uncaring viewing the place the storm had swept and then with a cry from his soul despairing he bowed him down to the earth and wept but a voice cried aloud from the driving rain arise old man and plant again invitation to love come when the nights are bright with stars or when the moon is mellow come when the sun his golden bars drops on the hayfield yellow come in the twilight soft and gray come in the night or come in the day come o love wheneer you may and you are welcome welcome you are sweet o love

falling of the leaf or with the reddning cherry come when the years first blossom blows come when the summer gleams and glows come with the winters drifting snows and you are welcome welcome he had his dream he had his dream and all through life worked up to it through toil and strife afloat foreer before his eyes it colored for him all his skies the stormcloud dark above his bark the calm and listless vault of blue took on its hopeful hue it tinctured every passing beam he had his dream he labored hard and failed at last his sails too weak to bear the blast the raging tempests tore away and sent his beating bark astray but what cared he for wind or sea he said the tempest will be short my bark will come to port he saw through every cloud a gleam he had his dream goodnight the lark is silent in his nest the breeze is sighing in its flight sleep love and peaceful be thy rest goodnight my love goodnight goodnight sweet dreams attend thee in thy sleep to soothe thy rest till mornings

truer than gold i cannot but love thee so do not reprove me if the strength of my passion should make me too bold nora pride of my heart rosy cheeks cherry lips sparkling with glee wake from thy slumbers wherever thou art wake from thy slumbers to me ah nora my nora there s love in the air it stirs in the numbers that thrill in my brain oh sweet sweet is love with its mingling of care though joy travels only a step before pain be roused from thy slumbers and list to my numbers my heart is poured out in this song unto thee oh be thou not cruel thou treasure thou jewel turn thine ear to my pleading and hearken to me october october is the treasurer of the year and all the months pay bounty to her store the fields and orchards still their tribute bear and fill her brimming coffers more and more but she with youthful lavishness spends all her wealth in gaudy dress and decks herself in garments bold of scarlet purple red and gold she heedeth not how swift the hours fly but smiles and sings her happy life along she only sees above a shining sky she only hears the breezes voice in song her garments trail the woodlands through and gather pearls of early dew that sparkle till the roguish sun creeps up and steals them every one but what cares she that jewels should be lost when all of natures bounteous wealth is hers though princely fortunes may have been their cost not one regret her calm demeanor stirs wholehearted happy careless free she lives her life out joyously nor cares when frost stalks oer her way and turns her auburn locks to gray a summers night the night is dewy as a maidens mouth the skies are bright as are a maidens eyes soft as a maidens breath the wind that flies up from the perfumed bosom of the south like sentinels the pines stand in the park and hither hastening like rakes that roam with lamps to light their wayward footsteps home the fireflies come staggring down the dark ships that pass in the night out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing i look far out into the pregnant night where i can hear a solemn booming gun and catch the gleaming of a random light that tells me that the ship i seek is passing passing my tearful eyes my souls deep hurt are glassing for i would hail and check that ship of ships i stretch my hands imploring cry aloud my voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips and but its ghost doth reach that vessel passing passing o earth o sky o ocean both surpassing o heart of mine o soul that dreads the dark is there no hope for me is there no way that i may sight and check that speeding bark which out of

dawn an angel robed in spotless white bent down and kissed the sleeping night night woke to blush the sprite was gone men saw the blush and called it dawn a drowsy day the air is dark the sky is gray the misty shadows come and go and here within my dusky room each chair looks ghostly in the gloom outside the rain falls cold and slow halfstinging drops halfblinding spray each slightest sound is magnified for drowsy quiet holds her reign the burnt stick in the fireplace breaks the nodding cat with start awakes and then to sleep drops off again unheeding towser at her side i look far out across the lawn where huddled stand the silly sheep my work lies idle at my hands my thoughts fly out like scattered strands of thread and on the verge of sleep still half awake i dream and yawn what spirits rise before my eyes how various of kind and form sweet memories of days long past the dreams of youth that could not last each smiling calm each raging storm that swept across my early skies half seen the bare gauntfingered boughs before my window sweep and sway and chafe in tortures of unrest my chin sinks down upon my breast i cannot work on such a day but only sit and dream and drowse dirge place this bunch of mignonette in her cold dead hand when the golden sun is set where the poplars stand bury her from sun and day lay my little love away from my sight she was like a modest flower blown in sunny june warm as sun at noons high hour chaster than the moon ah her day was brief and bright earth has lost a star of light she is dead softly breathe her name to me ah i loved her so gentle let your tribute be none may better know her true worth than i who weep oer her as she lies asleep soft asleep lay these lilies on her breast they are not more white than the soul of her at rest neath their petals bright chant your aves soft and low solemn be your tread and slow she is dead lay her here beneath the grass cool and green and sweet where the gentle brook may pass crooning at her feet natures bards shall come and sing and the fairest flowers shall spring where she lies safe above the waters swirl she has crossed the bar earth has lost a precious pearl heaven has gained a star that shall ever sing and shine till it quells this grief of mine for my love hymn when storms arise and darkning skies about me threatning lower to thee o lord i raise mine eyes to thee my tortured spirit flies for solace in that hour the mighty arm will let no harm come near me nor befall me thy voice shall quiet my alarm when lifes great battle waxeth warm no foeman shall appall me upon thy breast secure i rest from sorrow and vexation no more by sinful cares oppressed but in thy presence ever blest o god of my salvation preparation the little bird sits in the nest and sings a shy soft song to the morning light and it flutters a little and prunes its wings the song is halting and poor and brief and the fluttering wings scarce stir a leaf but the note is a prelude to sweeter things and the busy bill and the flutter slight are proving the wings for a bolder flight the deserted plantation oh de grubbinhoe s arustin in de conah an de plow s atumblin down in de fiel while de

its time to end it an calls me to my quaters in de sky the secret what says the wind to the waving trees what says the wave to the river what means the sigh in the passing breeze why do the rushes quiver have you not heard the fainting cry of the flowers that said goodbye goodbye list how the gray dove moans and grieves under the woodland cover list to the drift of the falling leaves list to the wail of the lover have you not caught the message heard already by wave and breeze and bird come come away to the rivers bank come in the early morning come when the grass with dew is dank there you will find the warning a hint in the kiss of the quickening air of the secret that birds and breezes bear the wind and the sea i stood by the shore at the death of day as the sun sank flaming red and the face of the waters that spread away was as gray as the face of the dead and i heard the cry of the wanton sea and the moan of the wailing wind for loves sweet pain in his heart had he but the gray old sea had sinned the wind was young and the sea was old but their cries went up together the wind was warm and the sea was cold for age makes wintry weather so they cried aloud and they wept amain till the sky grew dark to hear it and out of its folds crept the misty rain in its shroud like a troubled spirit for the wind was wild with a hopeless love and the sea was sad at heart at many a crime that he wot of wherein he had played his part he thought of the gallant ships gone down by the will of his wicked waves and he thought how the churchyard in the town held the seamade widows graves the wild wind thought of the love he had left afar in an eastern land and he longed as long the much bereft for the touch of her perfumed hand in his winding wail and his deepheaved sigh his aching grief found vent while the sea looked up at the bending sky and murmured i repent but een as he spoke a ship came by that bravely ploughed the main and a light came into the seas green eye and his heart grew hard again then he spoke to the wind friend seest thou not yon vessel is eastward bound pray speed with it to the happy spot where thy loved one may be found and the wind rose up in a dear delight and after the good ship sped but the crafty sea by his wicked might kept the vessel ever ahead till the wind grew fierce in his despair and white on the brow and lip he tore his garments and tore his hair and fell on the flying ship and the ship went down for a rock was there and the sailless sea loomed black while burdened again with dole and care the wind came moaning back and still he moans from his bosom hot where his raging grief lies pent and ever when the ships come not the sea says i repent riding to town when labor is light and the morning is fair i find it a pleasure beyond all compare to hitch up my nag and go hurrying down and take katie may for a ride into town for bumpetybump goes the wagon but tralalala our lay theres joy in a song as we rattle along in the light of the glorious day a coach would be fine but a spring wagons good my jeans are a match for kates gingham and hood the hills take us up and the vales take us down but what matters that we are riding to town and bumpetybump goes the wagon but tralalala sing we theres never a care may live in the air that is filled with the breath of our glee and after weve started theres naught can repress the thrill of our hearts in their wild happiness the heavens may smile or the heavens may frown and its all one to us when were riding to town for bumpetybump goes the wagon but tralalala we shout for our hearts they are clear and there s nothing to fear and weve never a pain nor a doubt the wagon is weak and the roadway is rough and tho it is long it is not long enough for mid all my ecstasies this is the crown to sit beside katie and ride into town when bumpetybump goes the wagon but tralalala our song and if i had my way i d be willing to pay if the road could be made twice as long we wear the mask we wear the mask that grins and lies it hides our cheeks and shades our eyes this debt we pay to human guile with torn and bleeding hearts we smile and mouth with myriad subtleties why should the world be overwise in counting all our tears and sighs nay let them only see us while we wear the mask we smile but o great christ our cries to thee from tortured souls arise we sing but oh the clay is vile beneath our feet and long the mile but let the world dream otherwise we wear the mask the meadow lark though the winds be dank and the sky be sober and the grieving day in a mantle gray hath let her waiting maiden robe her all the fields along i can hear the song of the meadow lark as she flits and flutters and laughs at the thunder when it mutters o happy bird of heart most gay to sing when skies are gray when the clouds are full and the tempest master lets the loud winds sweep from his bosom deep like heralds of some dire disaster then the heart alone to itself makes moan and the songs come slow while the tears fall fleeter and silence than song by far seems sweeter oh few are they along the way who sing when skies are gray one life oh i am hurt to death my love the shafts of fate have pierced my striving heart and i am sick and weary of the endless pain and smart my soul is weary of the strife and chafes at life and chafes at life time mocks me with fair promises a blooming future grows a barren past like rain my fair fullblossomed trees unburden in the blast the harvest fails on grain and tree nor comes to me nor comes to me the stream that bears my hopes abreast turns ever from my way its pregnant tide my laden boat torn from its rest drifts to the other side so all my hopes are set astray and drift away and drift away the lark sings to me at the morn and near me wings her skywardsoaring flight but pleasure dies as soon as born the owl takes up the night and night seems long and doubly dark i miss the lark i miss the lark let others labor as they may ill sing and sigh alone and write my line their fate is theirs or grave or gay and mine shall still be mine i know the world holds joy and glee but not for me t is not for me changing time the cloud looked in at the window and said to the day be dark and the roguish rain tapped hard on the pane to stifle the song of the lark the wind sprang up in the tree tops and shrieked with a voice of death but the roughvoiced breeze that shook the trees was touched with a violets breath dead a knock is at her door but she is weak strange dews have washed the paint streaks from her cheek she does not rise but ah this friend is known and knows that he will find her all alone so opens he the door and with soft tread goes straightway to the richly curtained bed his soft hand on her dewy head he lays a strange white light she gives him for his gaze then looking on the glory of her charms he crushes her resistless in his arms stand back look not upon this bold embrace nor view the calmness of the wantons face with joy unspeakable and bated breath she keeps her last long liaison with death a confidence uncle john he makes me tired thinks at hes jest so allfired smart at he kin pick up so

thine ensign high and shoutest thy loud battlecry higher than eer the tempest roared it cleaves the silence like a sword right arms and armors too that man who will not compromise with wrong though single he must front the throng and wage the battle hard and long minorities since time began have shown the better side of man and often in the lists of time one man has made a cause sublime if if life were but a dream my love and death the waking time if day had not a beam my love and night had not a rhyme a barren barren world were this without one saving gleam i d only ask that with a kiss you d wake me from the dream if dreaming were the sum of days and loving were the bane if battling for a wreath of bays could soothe a heart in pain i d scorn the meed of battles might all other aims above i d choose the humans higher right to suffer and to love the song my soul lost in the musics mist roamed rapt neath skies of amethyst the cheerless streets grew summer meads the son of phoebus spurred his steeds and wandring down the mazy tune december lost its way in june while from a verdant vale i heard the piping of a lovelorn bird a something in the tender strain revived an old longconquered pain and as in depths of many seas my heart was drowned in memories the tears came welling to my eyes nor could i ask it otherwise for oh a sweetness seems to last amid the dregs of sorrows past it stirred a chord that here of late i d grown to think could not vibrate it brought me back the trust of youth the world again was joy and truth and avice blooming like a bride once more stood trusting at my side but still with bosom desolate the lorn bird sang to find his mate then there are trees and lights and stars the silvry tinkle of guitars and throbs again as throbbed that waltz before i knew that hearts were false then like a cold wave on a shore comes silence and she sings no more i wake i breathe i think again and walk the sordid ways of men signs of the times air

the sparrow a little bird with plumage brown beside my window flutters down a moment chirps its little strain ten taps upon my windowpane and chirps again and hops along to call my notice to its song

mary young god has his plans and what if we with our sight be too blind to see their full fruition cannot he who made it solve the mystery one whom we loved has falln asleep not died although her calm be deep some new unknown and strange surprise in heaven holds enrapt her eyes and can you blame her that her gaze is turned away from earthly ways when to her eyes gods light and love have givn the view of things above a gentle spirit sweetly good the pearl of precious womanhood who heard the voice of duty clear and found her mission soon and near she loved all nature flowers fair the warmth of sun the kiss of air the birds that filled the sky with song the stream that laughed its way along her home to her was shrine and throne but one love held her not alone she sought out poverty and grief who touched her robe and found relief so sped she in her masters work too busy and too brave to shirk when through the silence dusk and dim god called her and she fled to him we wonder at the early call and tears of sorrow can but fall for her oer whom we spread the pall but faith sweet faith is over all the house is dust the voice is dumb but through undying years to come the spark that glowed within her soul shall light our footsteps to the goal she went her way but oh she trod the path that led her straight to god such lives as this put death to scorn they lose our day to find gods morn

apotheosis love me i care not what the circling years to me may do if but in spite of time and tears you prove but true love me albeit grief shall dim mine eyes and tears bedew i shall not een complain for then my skies shall still be blue love me and though the winter snow shall pile and leave me chill thy passions warmth shall make for me meanwhile a sunkissed hill and when the days have lengthened into years and i grow old oh spite of pains and griefs and cares and fears grow thou not cold then hand and hand we shall pass up the hill i say not down that twain go up of love who ve loved their fill to gain loves crown love me and let my life take up thine own as sun the dew come sit my queen for in my heart a throne awaits for you the paradox i am the mother of sorrows i am the ender of grief i am the bud and the blossom i am the latefalling leaf i am thy priest and thy poet i am thy serf and thy king i cure the tears of the heartsick when i come near they shall sing white are my hands as the snowdrop swart are my fingers as clay dark is my frown as the midnight fair is my brow as the day battle and war are my minions doing my will as divine i am the calmer of passions peace is a nursling of mine speak to me gently or curse me seek me or fly from my sight i am thy fool in the morning thou art my slave in the night down to the grave will i take thee out from the noise of the strife then shalt thou see me and know me death then no longer but life then shalt thou sing at my coming kiss me with passionate breath clasp me and smile to have thought me aught save the foeman of death come to me brother when weary come when thy lonely heart swells i ll guide thy footsteps and lead thee down where the dream woman dwells over the hills over the hills and the valleys of dreaming slowly i take my way life is the night with its dreamvisions teeming death is the waking at day down thro the dales and the bowers of loving singing i roam afar daytime or nighttime i constantly roving dearest one thou art my star with the lark night is for sorrow and dawn is for joy chasing the troubles that fret and annoy darkness for sighing and daylight for song cheery and chaste the strain heartfelt and strong all the night through though i moan in the dark i wake in the morning to sing with the lark deep in the midnight the rain whips the leaves softly and sadly the woodspirit grieves but when the first hue of dawn tints the sky i shall shake out my wings like the birds and be dry and though like the raindrops i grieved through the dark i shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark on the high hills of heaven some morning to be where the rain shall not grieve thro the leaves of the tree there my heart will be glad for the pain i have known for my hand will be clasped in the hand of mine own and though life has been hard and deaths pathway been dark i shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark in summer oh summer has clothed the earth in a cloak from the loom of the sun and a mantle too of the skies soft blue and a belt where the rivers run and now for the kiss of the wind and the touch of the airs soft hands with the rest from strife and the heat of life with the freedom of lakes and lands i envy the farmers boy who sings as he follows the plow while the shining green of the young blades lean to the breezes that cool his brow he sings to the dewy morn no thought of anothers ear but the song he sings is a chant for kings and the whole wide world to hear he sings of the joys of life of the pleasures of work and rest from an oerfull heart without aim or art t is a song of the merriest o ye who toil in the town and ye who moil in the mart hear the artless song and your faith made strong shall renew your joy of heart oh poor were the worth of the world if never a song were heard if the sting of grief had no relief and never a heart were stirred so long as the streams run down and as long as the robins trill let us taunt old care with a merry air and sing in the face of ill the mystic sea the smell of the sea in my nostrils the sound of the sea in mine ears the touch of the spray on my burning face like the mist of reluctant tears the blue of the sky above me the green of the waves beneath the sun flashing down on a graywhite sail like a scimitar from its sheath and ever the breaking billows and ever the rocks disdain and ever a thrill in mine inmost heart that my reason cannot explain so i say to my heart be silent the mystery of time is here deaths way will be plain when we fathom the main and the secret of life be clear a sailors song oh for the breath of the briny deep and the tug of the bellying sail with the seagulls cry across the sky and a passing boatmans hail for be she fierce or be she gay the sea is a famous friend alway ho for the plains where the dolphins play and the bend of the mast and spars and a fight at night with the wild seasprite when the foam has drowned the stars and pray what joy can the landsman feel like the rise and fall of a sliding keel fair is the mead the lawn is fair and the birds sing sweet on the lea but the echo soft of a song aloft is the strain that pleases me and swish of rope and ring of chain are music to men who sail the main then if you love me let me sail while a vessel dares the deep for the ship s my wife and the breath of life are the raging gales that sweep and when i m done with calm and blast a slide oer the side and rest at last the bohemian bring me the livery of no other man i am my own to robe me at my pleasure accepted rules to me disclose no treasure what is the chief who shall my garments plan no garb conventional but i ll attack it come why not don my spangled jacket absence goodnight my love for i have dreamed of thee in waking dreams until my soul is lost is lost in passions wide and shoreless sea where like a ship unruddered it is tost hither and thither at the wild waves will there is no potent masters voice to still this newer more tempestuous galilee the stormy petrels of my fancy fly in warning course across the darkening green and like a frightened bird my heart doth cry and seek to find some rock of rest between the threatening sky and the relentless wave it is not length of life that grief doth crave but only calm and peace in which to die here let me rest upon this single hope for oh my wings are weary of the wind and with its stress no more may strive or cope one cry has dulled mine ears mine eyes are blind would that oer all the intervening space i might fly forth and see thee face to face i fly i search but love in gloom i grope fly home far bird unto thy waiting nest spread thy strong wings above the windswept sea beat the grim breeze with thy unruffled breast until thou sittest wing to wing with me then let the past bring up its tales of wrong we shall chant low our sweet connubial song till storm and doubt and past no more shall be her thought and his the gray of the sea and the gray of the sky a glimpse of the moon like a halfclosed eye the gleam on the waves and the light on the land a thrill in my heart and my sweethearts hand she turned from the sea with a womans grace and the light fell soft on her upturned face and i thought of the floodtide of infinite bliss that would flow to my heart from a single kiss but my sweetheart was shy so i dared not ask for the boon so bravely i wore the mask but into her face there came a flame i wonder could she have been thinking the same the right to die i have no fancy for that ancient cant that makes us masters of our destinies and not our lives to hold or give them up as will directs i cannot will not think that men the subtle worms who plot and plan and scheme and calculate with such shrewd wit are such great blundring fools as not to know when they have lived enough men court not death when there are sweets still left in life to taste nor will a brave man choose to live when he full deeply drunk of life has reached the dregs and knows that now but bitterness remains he is the coward who outfaced in this fears the false goblins of another life i honor him who being much harassed drinks of sweet courage until drunk of it then seizing death reluctant by the hand leaps with him fearless to eternal peace behind the arras as in some dim baronial hall restrained a prisoner sits engirt by secret doors and waving tapestries that argue forth strange passages into the outer air so in this dimmer room which we call life thus sits the soul and marks with eye intent that mystic curtain oer the portal death still deeming that behind the arras lies the lambent way that leads to lasting light poor fooled and foolish soul know now that death is but a blind false door that nowhere leads and gives no hope of exit final free when the old man smokes in the forenoons restful quiet when the boys are off at school when the window lights are shaded and the chimneycorner cool then the old man seeks his armchair lights his pipe and settles back falls adreaming as he draws it till the smokewreaths gather black and the teardrops come atrickling down his cheeks a silver flow smoke or memories you wonder but you never ask him no for there s something almost sacred to the other family folks in those moods of silent dreaming when the old man smokes ah perhaps he sits there dreaming of the love of other days and of how he used to lead her through the merry dances maze how he called her little princess and to please her used to twine tender wreaths to crown her tresses from the matrimony vine then before his mental vision comes perhaps a sadder day when they left his little princess sleeping with her fellow clay how his young heart throbbed and pained him why the memory of it chokes is it of these things he s thinking when the old man smokes but some brighter thoughts possess him for the tears are dried the while and the old worn face is wrinkled in a reminiscent smile from the middle of the forehead to the feebly trembling lip at some ancient prank remembered or some long unheardof quip then the lips relax their tension and the pipe begins to slide till in little clouds of ashes it falls softly at his side and his head bends low and lower till his chin lies on his breast and he sits in peaceful slumber like a little child at rest dear old man there s something sadning in these dreamy moods of yours since the present proves so fleeting all the past for you endures weeping at forgotten sorrows smiling at forgotten jokes life epitomized in minutes when the old man smokes the garret within a london garret high above the roofs and near the sky my illrewarding pen i ply to win me bread this little chamber six by four is castle study den and more altho no carpet decks the floor nor down the bed my room is rather bleak and bare i only have one broken chair but then theres plenty of fresh air some light beside what tho i cannot ask my friends to share with me my odds and ends a liberty my aerie lends to most denied the bore who falters at the stair no more shall be my curse and care and duns shall fail to find my lair with beastly bills when debts have grown and funds are short i find it rather pleasant sport to live above the common sort with all their ills i write my rhymes and sing away and dawn may come or dusk or day tho fare be poor my heart is gay and full of glee though chimneypots be all my views t is nearer for the winging muse so i am sure she ll not refuse to visit me to e h k on the receipt of a familiar poem to me like hauntings of a vagrant breath from some far forest which i once have known the perfume of this flower of verse is blown tho seemingly soulblossoms faint to death naught that with joy she bears eer withereth so tho the pregnant years have come and flown lives come and gone and altered like mine own this poem comes to me a shibboleth brings sound of past communings to my ear turns round the tide of time and bears me back along an old and long untraversed way makes me forget this is a later year makes me tread oer a reminiscent track half sad half glad to one forgotten day a bridal measure come essay a sprightly measure tuned to some light song of pleasure maidens let your brows be crowned as we foot this merry round from the ground a voice is singing from the sod a soul is springing who shall say t is but a clod quickning upward toward its god who shall say it who may know it that the clod is not a poet waiting but a gleam to waken in a spirit musicshaken phyllis phyllis why be waiting in the woods the birds are mating from the tree beside the wall hear the amrous robin call listen to yon thrushs trilling phyllis phyllis are you willing when love speaks from cave and tree only we should silent be when the year itself renewing all the world with flowers is strewing then through youths arcadian land love and song go hand in hand come unfold your vocal treasure sing with me a nuptial measure let this springtime gambol be bridal dance for you and me vengeance is sweet when i was young i longed for love and held his glory far above all other earthly things i cried come love dear love with me abide and with my subtlest art i wooed and eagerly the wight pursued but love was gay and love was shy he laughed at me and passed me by well i grew old and i grew gray when wealth came wending down my way i took his golden hand with glee and comrades from that day were we then love came back with doleful face and prayed that i would give him place but though his eyes with tears were dim i turned my back and laughed at him a hymn after reading lead kindly light lead gently lord and slow for oh my steps are weak and ever as i go some soothing sentence speak that i may turn my face through doubts obscurity toward thine abidingplace een tho i cannot see for lo the way is dark through mist and cloud i grope save for that fitful spark the little flame of hope lead gently lord and slow for fear that i may fall i know not where to go unless i hear thy call my fainting soul doth yearn for thy green hills afar so let thy mercy burn my greater guiding star just whistle a bit just whistle a bit if the day be dark and the sky be overcast if mute be the voice of the piping lark why pipe your own small blast and its wonderful how oer the gray skytrack the truant warbler comes stealing back but why need he come for your souls at rest and the song in the heart ah that is best just whistle a bit if the night be drear and the stars refuse to shine and a gleam that mocks the starlight clear within you glows benign till the dearth of light in the glooming skies is lost to the sight of your soullit eyes what matters the absence of moon or star the light within is the best by far just whistle a bit if there s work to do with the mind or in the soil and your note will turn out a talisman true to exorcise grim toil it will lighten your burden and make you feel that there s nothing like work as a sauce for a meal and with song in your heart and the meal in its place there ll be joy in your bosom and light in your face just whistle a bit if your heart be sore tis a wonderful balm for pain just pipe some old melody oer and oer till it soothes like summer rain and perhaps t would be best in a later day when death comes stalking down the way to knock at your bosom and see if you re fit then as you wait calmly just whistle a bit the barrier the midnight wooed the morningstar and prayed her love come nearer your swinging coldly there afar to me but makes you dearer the morningstar was pale with dole as said she low replying oh lover mine soul of my soul for you i too am sighing but one ordained when we were born in spite of loves insistence that night might only view the morn adoring at a distance but as she spoke the jealous sun across the heavens panted oh whining fools he cried have done your wishes shall be granted he hurled his flaming lances far the twain stood unaffrighted and midnight and the morningstar lay down in death united dreams dream on for dreams are sweet do not awaken dream on and at thy feet pomegranates shall be shaken who likeneth the youth of life to morning tis like the night in truth rosecoloured dreams adorning the wind is soft above the shadows umber there is a dream called love take thou the fullest slumber in lethes soothing stream thy thirst thou slakest sleep sleep t is sweet to dream oh weep when thou awakest the dreamer temples he built and palaces of air and with the artists parentpride aglow his fancy saw his vague ideals grow into creations marvellously fair he set his foot upon fames nether stair but ah his dream it had entranced him so he could not move he could no farther go but paused in joy that he was even there he did not wake until one day there gleamed thro his dark consciousness a light that racked his being till he rose alert to act but lo what he had dreamed the while he dreamed another wedding action unto thought into the living pulsing world had brought waiting the sun has slipped his tether and galloped down the west oh its weary weary waiting love the little bird is sleeping in the softness of its nest night follows day day follows dawn and so the time has come and gone and its weary weary waiting love the cruel wind is rising with a whistle and a wail and its weary weary waiting love my eyes are seaward straining for the coming of a sail but void the sea and void the beach far and beyond where gaze can reach and its weary weary waiting love i heard the bellbuoy ringing how long ago it seems oh its weary weary waiting love and ever still its knelling crashes in upon my dreams the banns were read my frock was sewn since then two seasons winds have blown and its weary weary waiting love the stretches of the ocean are bare and bleak today oh its weary weary waiting love my eyes are growing dimmer is it tears or age or spray but i will stay till you come home strange ships come in across the foam but its weary weary waiting love the end of the chapter ah yes the chapter ends today we even lay the book away but oh how sweet the moments sped before the final page was read we tried to read between the lines the authors deepconcealed designs but scant reward such search secures you saw my heart and i saw yours the master he who penned the page and bade us read it he is sage and what he orders you and i can but obey nor question why we read together and forgot the world about us time was not unheeded and unfelt it fled we read and hardly knew we read until beneath a sadder sun we came to know the book was done then as our minds were but new lit it dawned upon us what was writ and we were startled in our eyes looked forth the light of great surprise then as a deeptoned tocsin tolls a voice spoke forth behold your souls i do i do i cannot look into your eyes so close the book but brought it grief or brought it bliss no other page shall read like this sympathy i know what the caged bird feels alas when the sun is bright on the upland slopes when the wind stirs soft through the springing grass and the river flows like a stream of glass when the first bird sings and the first bud opes and the faint perfume from its chalice steals i know what the caged bird feels i know why the caged bird beats his wing till its blood is red on the cruel bars for he must fly back to his perch and cling when he fain would be on the bough aswing and a pain still throbs in the old old scars and they pulse again with a keener sting i know why he beats his wing i know why the caged bird sings ah me when his wing is bruised and his bosom sore when he beats his bars and he would be free it is not a carol of joy or glee but a prayer that he sends from his hearts deep core but a plea that upward to heaven he flings i know why the caged bird sings love and grief out of my heart one treachrous winters day i locked young love and threw the key away grief wandering widely found the key and hastened with it straightway back to me with love beside him he unlocked the door and bade love enter with him there and stay and so the twain abide for evermore loves chastening once love grew bold and arrogant of air proud of the youth that made him fresh and fair so unto grief he spake what right hast thou to part or parcel of this heart griefs brow was darkened with the storm of inward strife thrice smote he love as only he might dare and love pride purged was chastened all his life mortality ashes to ashes dust unto dust what of his loving what of his lust what of his passion what of his pain what of his poverty what of his pride earth the great mother has called him again deeply he sleeps the worlds verdict defied shall he be tried again shall he go free who shall the court convene where shall it be no answer on the land none from the sea only we know that as he did we must you with your theories you with your trust ashes to ashes dust unto dust love a life was mine full of the close concern of manyvoiced affairs the world sped fast behind me ever rolled a pregnant past a present came equipped with lore to learn art science letters in their turn each one allured me with its treasures vast and i staked all for wisdom till at last thou camst and taught my soul anew to yearn i had not dreamed that i could turn away from all that men with brush and pen had wrought but ever since that memorable day when to my heart the truth of love was brought i have been wholly yielded to its sway and had no room for any other thought she gave me a rose she gave a rose and i kissed it and pressed it i love her she knows and my action confessed it she gave me a rose and i kissed it and pressed it ah how my heart glows could i ever have guessed it it is fair to suppose that i might have repressed it she gave me a rose and i kissed it and pressed it t was a rhyme in lifes prose that uplifted and blest it mans nature who knows until love comes to test it she gave me a rose and i kissed it and pressed it dream song i long years ago within a distant clime ere love had touched me with his wand sublime i dreamed of one to make my lifes calm may the panting passion of a summers day and ever since in almost sad suspense i have been waiting with a soul intense to greet and take unto myself the beams of her my star the lady of my dreams o love still longed and looked for come to me be thy far home by mountain vale or sea my yearning heart may never find its rest until thou liest rapt upon my breast the wind may bring its perfume from the south is it so sweet as breath from my loves mouth oh naught that surely is and naught that seems may turn me from the lady of my dreams dream song ii pray what can dreams avail to make love or to mar the child within the cradle rail lies dreaming of the star but is the star by this beguiled to leave its place and seek the child the poor plucked rose within its glass still dreameth of the bee but tho the lagging moments pass her love she may not see if dream of child and flower fail why should a maidens dreams prevail christmas in the heart the snow lies deep upon the ground and winters brightness all around decks bravely out the forest sere with jewels of the brave old year the coasting crowd upon the hill with some new spirit seems to thrill and all the temple bells achime ring out the glee of christmas time in happy homes the brown oakbough vies with the redgemmed holly now and here and there like pearls there show the berries of the mistletoe a sprig upon the chandelier says to the maidens come not here even the pauper of the earth some kindly gift has cheered to mirth within his chamber dim and cold there sits a grasping miser old he has no thought save one of gain to grind and gather and grasp and drain a peal of bells a merry shout assail his ear he gazes out upon a world to him all gray and snarls why this is christmas day no man of ice for shame for shame for christmas day is no mere name no not for you this ringing cheer this festal season of the year and not for you the chime of bells from holy temple rolls and swells in day and deed he has no part who holds not christmas in his heart the king is dead aye lay him in his grave the old dead year his life is lived fulfilled his destiny have you for him no sad regretful tear to drop beside the cold unfollowed bier can you not pay the tribute of a sigh was he not kind to you this dead old year did he not give enough of earthly store enough of love and laughter and good cheer have not the skies you scanned sometimes been clear how then of him who dies could you ask more it is not well to hate him for the pain he brought you and the sorrows manifold to pardon him these hurts still i am fain for in the panting period of his reign he brought me new wounds but he healed the old one little sigh for thee my poor dead friend one little sigh while my companions sing thou art so soon forgotten in the end we cry een as thy footsteps downward tend the king is dead long live the king theology there is a heaven for ever day by day the upward longing of my soul doth tell me so there is a hell i m quite as sure for pray if there were not where would my neighbours go resignation long had i grieved at what i deemed abuse but now i am as grain within the mill if so be thou must crush me for thy use grind on o potent god and do thy will loves humility as some rapt gazer on the lowly earth looks up to radiant planets ranging far so i whose soul doth know thy wondrous worth look longing up to thee as to a star precedent the poor man went to the rich mans doors i come as lazarus came he said the rich man turned with humble head i will send my dogs to lick your sores she told her beads she told her beads with downcast eyes within the ancient chapel dim and ever as her fingers slim slipt oer th insensate ivories my rapt soul followed spanielwise ah many were the beads she wore but as she told them oer and oer they did not number all my sighs my heart was filled with unvoiced cries and prayers and pleadings unexpressed but while i burned with loves unrest she told her beads with downcast eyes little lucy landman oh the day has set me dreaming in a strange half solemn way of the feelings i experienced on another long past day of the way my heart made music when the buds began to blow and o little lucy landman whom i loved long years ago it s in spring the poet tells us that we turn to thoughts of love and our hearts go out awooing with the lapwing and the dove but wheneer the soul goes seeking its twinsoul upon the wing i ve a notion backed by memry that its love that makes the spring i have heard a robin singing when the boughs were brown and bare and the chilling hand of winter scattered jewels through the air and in spite of dates and seasons it was always spring i know when i loved lucy landman in the days of long ago ah my little lucy landman i remember you as well as if t were only yesterday i strove your thoughts to tell when i tilted back your bonnet looked into your eyes so true just to see if you were loving me as i was loving you ah my little lucy landman it is true it was denied you should see a fuller summer and an autumn by my side but the glance of loves sweet sunlight which your eyes that morning gave has kept spring within my bosom though you lie within the grave the gourd in the heavy earth the miner toiled and laboured day by day wrenching from the miser mountain brilliant treasure where it lay and the artist worn and weary wrought with labour manifold that the king might drink his nectar from a goblet made of gold on the princes groaning table mid the silver gleaming bright mirroring the happy faces giving back the flaming light shine the cups of priceless crystal chased with many a lovely line glowing now with warmer colour crimsoned by the ruby wine in a valley sweet with sunlight fertile with the dew and rain without miners daily labour without artists nightly pain there there grows the cup i drink from summers sweetness in it stored and my lips pronounce a blessing as they touch an old brown gourd why the miracle at cana in the land of galilee tho it puzzles all the scholars is no longer strange to me for the poorest and the humblest could a priceless wine afford if they d only dip up water with a sunlightseasoned gourd so a health to my old comrade and a song of praise to sing when he rests inviting kisses in his place beside the spring give the king his golden goblets give the prince his crystal hoard but for me the sparkling water from a brown and brimming gourd the knight our good knight ted girds his broadsword on and he wields it well i ween he s on his steed and away has gone to the fight for king and queen what tho no edge the broadsword hath what tho the blade be made of lath t is a valiant hand that wields the brand so foeman clear the path he prances off at a goodly pace t is a noble steed he rides that bears as well in the speedy race as he bears in battletides what tho t is but a rockingchair that prances with this stately air t is a warrior bold the reins doth hold who bids all foes beware thou art my lute thou art my lute by thee i sing my being is attuned to thee thou settest all my words awing and meltest me to melody thou art my life by thee i live from thee proceed the joys i know sweetheart thy hand has power to give the meed of love the cup of woe thou art my love by thee i lead my soul the paths of light along from vale to vale from mead to mead and home it in the hills of song my song my soul my life my all why need i pray or make my plea since my petition cannot fall for i m already one with thee the phantom kiss one night in my room still and beamless with will and with thought in eclipse i rested in sleep that was dreamless when softly there fell on my lips a touch as of lips that were pressing mine own with the message of bliss a sudden soft fleeting caressing a breath like a maidens first kiss i wokeand the scoffer may doubt me i peered in surprise through the gloom but nothing and none were about me and i was alone in my room perhaps t was the wind that caressed me and touched me with dewladen breath or maybe closesweeping there passed me the lowwinging angel of death some sceptic may choose to disdain it or one feign to read it aright or wisdom may seek to explain it this mystical kiss in the night but rather let fancy thus clear it that thinking of me here alone the miles were made naught and in spirit thy lips love were laid on mine own communion in the silence of my heart i will spend an hour with thee when my love shall rend apart all the veil of mystery all that dim and misty veil that shut in between our souls when death cried ho maiden hail and your barque sped on the shoals on the shoals nay wrongly said on the breeze of death that sweeps far from life thy soul has sped out into unsounded deeps i shall take an hour and come sailing darling to thy side wind nor sea may keep me from soft communings with my bride i shall rest my head on thee as i did long days of yore when a calm untroubled sea rocked thy vessel at the shore i shall take thy hand in mine and live oer the olden days when thy smile to me was wine golden wine thy word of praise for the carols i had wrought in my souls simplicity for the petty beads of thought which thine eyes alone could see ah those eyes loveblind but keen for my welfare and my weal tho the gravedoor shut between still their lovelights oer me steal i can see thee thro my tears as thro rain we see the sun what tho cold and cooling years shall their bitter courses run i shall see thee still and be thy true lover evermore and thy face shall be to me dear and helpful as before death may vaunt and death may boast but we laugh his powr to scorn he is but a slave at most night that heralds coming morn i shall spend an hour with thee day by day my little bride true love laughs at mystery crying doors of death fly wide mare rubrum in lifes red sea with faith i plant my feet and wait the sound of that sustaining word which long ago the men of israel heard when pharaohs host behind them fierce and fleet raged on consuming with revengeful heat why are the barrier waters still unstirred that struggling faith may die of hope deferred is god not sitting in his ancient seat the billows swirl above my trembling limbs and almost chill my anxious heart to doubt and disbelief long conquered and defied but tho the music of my hopeful hymns is drowned by curses of the raging rout no voice yet bids th opposing waves divide in an english garden in this old garden fair i walk today heartcharmed with all the beauty of the scene the rich luxuriant grasses cooling green the walls environ ivydecked and gray the waving branches with the wind at play the slight and tremulous blooms that show between sweet all and yet my yearning heart doth lean toward loves egyptian fleshpots far away beside the wall the slim laburnum grows and flings its golden flowrs to every breeze but een among such soothing sights as these i pant and nurse my souldevouring woes of all the longings that our hearts wot of there is no hunger like the want of love the crisis a man of low degree was sore oppressed fate held him under ironhanded sway and ever those who saw him thus distressed would bid him bend his stubborn will and pray but he strong in himself and obdurate waged prayerless on his losing fight with fate friends gave his proffered hand their coldest clasp or took it not at all and poverty that bruised his body with relentless grasp grinned taunting when he struggled to be free but though with helpless hands he beat the air his need extreme yet found no voice in prayer then he prevailed and forthwith snobbish fate like some whipped cur came fawning at his feet those who had scorned forgave and called him great his friends found out that friendship still was sweet but he once obdurate now bowed his head in prayer and trembling with its import said mere human strength may stand illfortunes frown so i prevailed for human strength was mine but from the killing powr of great renown naught may protect me save a strength divine help me o lord in this my trembling cause i scorn mens curses but i dread applause the conquerors the black troops in cuba round the wide earth from the red field your valour has won blown with the breath of the farspeaking gun goes the word bravely you spoke through the battle cloud heavy and dun tossed though the speech toward the misthidden sun the world heard hell would have shrunk from you seeking it fresh from the fray grim with the dust of the battle and gray from the fight heaven would have crowned you with crowns not of gold but of bay owning you fit for the light of her day men of night far through the cycle of years and of lives that shall come there shall speak voices long muffled and dumb out of fear and through the noises of trade and the turbulent hum truth shall rise over the militant drum loud and clear then on the cheek of the honester nation that grows all for their love of you not for your woes there shall lie tears that shall be to your souls as the dew to the rose afterward thanks that the present yet knows not to ply alexander crummell dead back to the breast of thy mother child of the earth een her caress can not smother what thou hast done follow the trail of the westering sun over the earth thy light and his were as one sun in thy worth unto a nation whose sky was as night camest thou holily bearing thy light and the dawn came in it thy fame flashed up in a flame back to the breast of thy mother to rest long hast thou striven dared where the hills by the lightning of heaven were riven go now pure shriven who shall come after thee out of the clay learned one and leader to show us the way who shall rise up when the world gives the test think thou no more of this rest when all is done when all is done and my last word is said and ye who loved me murmur he is dead let no one weep for fear that i should know and sorrow too that ye should sorrow so when all is done and in the oozing clay ye lay this castoff hull of mine away pray not for me for after long despair the quiet of the grave will be a prayer for i have suffered loss and grievous pain the hurts of hatred and the worlds disdain and wounds so deep that love welltried and pure had not the powr to ease them or to cure when all is done say not my day is oer and that thro night i seek a dimmer shore say rather that my morn has just begun i greet the dawn and not a setting sun when all is done the poet and the baby hows a man to write a sonnet can you tell hows he going to weave the dim poetic spell when atoddling on the floor is the muse he must adore and this muse he loves not wisely but too well now to write a sonnet every one allows one must always be as quiet as a mouse but to write one seems to me quite superfluous to be when you ve got a little sonnet in the house just a dainty little poem true and fine that is full of love and life in every line earnest delicate and sweet altogether so complete that i wonder whats the use of writing mine distinction i am but clay the sinner plead who fed each vain desire not only clay another said but worse for thou art mire the sum a little dreaming by the way a little toiling day by day a little pain a little strife a little joy and that is life a little shortlived summers morn when joy seems all so newly born when one days sky is blue above and one bird sings and that is love a little sickening of the years the tribute of a few hot tears two folded hands the failing breath and peace at last and that is death just dreaming loving dying so the actors in the drama go a flitting picture on a wall love death the themes but is that all sonnet on an old book with uncut leaves emblem of blasted hope and lost desire no finger ever traced thy yellow page save times thou hast not wrought to noble rage the hearts thou wouldst have stirred not any fire save sad flames set to light a funeral pyre dost thou suggest nay impotent in age unsought thou holdst a corner of the stage and ceasest even dumbly to aspire how different was the thought of him that writ what promised he to love of ease and wealth when men should read and kindle at his wit but here decay eats up the book by stealth while it like some old maiden solemnly hugs its incongruous virginity on the sea wall i sit upon the old sea wall and watch the shimmering sea where soft and white the moonbeams fall till in a fantasy some pure white maidens funeral pall the strange light seems to me the waters break upon the shore and shiver at my feet while i dream old dreams oer and oer and dim old scenes repeat tho all have dreamed the same before they still seem new and sweet the waves still sing the same old song that knew an elder time the breakers beat is not more strong their music more sublime and poets thro the ages long have set these notes to rhyme but this shall not deter my lyre nor check my simple strain if i have not the oldtime fire i know the ancient pain the hurt of unfulfilled desire the ember quenched by rain i know the softly shining sea that rolls this gentle swell has snarled and licked its tongues at me and bared its fangs as well that neath its smile so heavenly there lurks the scowl of hell but what of that i strike my string for songs in youth are sweet i ll wait and hear the waters bring their loud resounding beat then in her own bold numbers sing the oceans dear deceit to a lady playing the harp thy tones are silver melted into sound and as i dream i see no walls around but seem to hear a gondolier sing sweetly down some slow venetian stream italian skies that i have never seen i see above ah play again my queen thy fingers white fly swift and light and weave for me the golden mesh of love oh thou dusk sorceress of the dusky eyes and soft dark hair t is thou that makst my skies so swift to change to far and strange but far and strange thou still dost make them fair now thou dost sing and i am lost in thee as one who drowns in floods of melody still in thy art give me this part till perfect love the love of loving crowns confessional search thou my heart if there be guile it shall depart before thy smile search thou my soul be there deceit t will vanish whole before thee sweet upon my mind turn thy pure lens naught shalt thou find thou canst not cleanse if i should pray i scarcely know in just what way my prayers would go so strong in me i feel loves leaven i d bow to thee as soon as heaven misapprehension out of my heart one day i wrote a song with my hearts blood imbued instinct with passion tremulously strong with grief subdued breathing a fortitude painbought and one who claimed much love for what i wrought read and considered it and spoke ay brother t is well writ but wheres the joke prometheus prometheus stole from heaven the sacred fire and swept to earth with it oer land and sea he lit the vestal flames of poesy content for this to brave celestial ire wroth were the gods and with eternal hate pursued the fearless one who ravished heaven that earth might hold in fee the perfect leaven to lift mens souls above their low estate but judge you now when poets wield the pen think you not well the wrong has been repaired twas all in vain that ill prometheus fared the fire has been returned to heaven again we have no singers like the ones whose note gave challenge to the noblest warblers song we have no voice so mellow sweet and strong as that which broke from shelleys golden throat the measure of our songs is our desires we tinkle where old poets used to storm we lack their substance tho we keep their form we strum our banjostrings and call them lyres loves phases love hath the wings of the butterfly oh clasp him but gently pausing and dipping and fluttering by inconsequently stir not his poise with the breath of a sigh love hath the wings of the butterfly love hath the wings of the eagle bold cling to him strongly what if the look of the world be cold and life go wrongly rest on his pinions for broad is their fold love hath the wings of the eagle bold love hath the voice of the nightingale hearken his trilling list to his song when the moonlight is pale passionate thrilling cherish the lay ere the lilt of it fail love hath the voice of the nightingale love hath the voice of the storm at night wildly defiant hear him and yield up your soul to his might tenderly pliant none shall regret him who heed him aright love hath the voice of the storm at night for the man who fails the world is a snob and the man who wins is the chap for its moneys worth and the lust for success causes half of the sins that are cursing this brave old earth for it s fine to go up and the worlds applause is sweet to the mortal ear but the man who fails in a noble cause is a hero that s no less dear t is true enough that the laurel crown twines but for the victors brow for many a hero has lain him down with naught but the cypress bough there are gallant men in the losing fight and as gallant deeds are done as ever graced the captured height or the battle grandly won we sit at lifes board with our nerves highstrung and we play for the stake of fame and our odes are sung and our banners hung for the man who wins the game but i have a song of another kind than breathes in these famewrought gales an ode to the noble heart and mind of the gallant man who fails the man who is strong to fight his fight and whose will no front can daunt if the truth be truth and the right be right is the man that the ages want tho he fail and die in grim defeat yet he has not fled the strife and the house of earth will seem more sweet for the perfume of his life harriet beecher stowe she told the story and the whole world wept at wrongs and cruelties it had not known but for this fearless womans voice alone she spoke to consciences that long had slept her message freedoms clear reveille swept from heedless hovel to complacent throne command and prophecy were in the tone and from its sheath the sword of justice leapt around two peoples swelled a fiery wave but both came forth transfigured from the flame blest be the hand that dared be strong to save and blest be she who in our weakness came prophet and priestess at one stroke she gave a race to freedom and herself to fame vagrants long time ago we two set out my soul and i i know not why for all our way was dim with doubt i know not where we two may fare though still with every changing weather we wander groping on together we do not love we are not friends my soul and i he lives a lie untruth lines every way he wends a scoffer he who jeers at me and so my comrade and my brother we wander on and hate each other ay there be taverns and to spare beside the road but some strange goad lets me not stop to taste their fare knew i the goal toward which my soul and i made way hope made life fragrant but no we wander aimless vagrant a winters day across the hills and down the narrow ways and up the valley where the free winds sweep the earth is folded in an ermined sleep that mocks the melting mirth of myriad mays departed her disheartening duns and grays and all her crusty black is covered deep dark streams are locked in winters donjonkeep and made to shine with keen unwonted rays o icy mantle and deceitful snow what worldold liars in your hearts ye are are there not still the darkened seam and scar beneath the brightness that you fain would show come from the cover with thy blot and blur o reeking earth thou whited sepulchre my little march girl come to the pane draw the curtain apart there she is passing the girl of my heart see where she walks like a queen in the street weatherdefying calm placid and sweet tripping along with impetuous grace joy of her life beaming out of her face tresses all truantlike curl upon curl windblown and rosy my little march girl hint of the violets delicate bloom hint of the roses pervading perfume how can the wind help from kissing her face wrapping her round in his stormy embrace but still serenely she laughs at his rout she is the victor who wins in the bout so may lifes passions about her soul swirl leaving it placid my little march girl what selfpossession looks out of her eyes what are the wild winds and what are the skies frowning and glooming when brimming with life cometh the little maid ripe for the strife ah wind and bah wind what might have you now what can you do with that innocent brow blow wind and grow wind and eddy and swirl but bring her to me wind my little march girl remembered she sang and i listened the whole song thro it was sweet so sweet the singing the stars were out and the moon it grew from a wee soft glimmer way out in the blue to a bird thro the heavens winging she sang and the song trembled down to my breast it was sweet so sweet the singing as a dove just out of its fledgling nest and putting its wings to the first sweet test flutters homeward so wearily winging she sang and i said to my heart that song that was sweet so sweet i the singing shall live with us and inspire us long and thou my heart shalt be brave and strong for the sake of those words awinging the woman died and the song was still it was sweet so sweet the singing but ever i hear the same low trill of the song that shakes my heart with a thrill and goes forever winging love despoiled as lone i sat one summers day with mien dejected love came by his face distraught his locks astray so slow his gait so sad his eye i hailed him with a pitying cry pray love what has disturbed thee so said i amazed thou seemst bereft and see thy quiver hanging low what not a single arrow left pray who is guilty of this theft poor love looked in my face and cried no thief were ever yet so bold to rob my quiver at my side but time who rules gave ear to gold and all my goodly shafts are sold the lapse this poem must be done today then i ll een to it i must not dream my time away i m sure to rue it the day is rather bright i know the muse will pardon my halfdefection if i go into the garden it must be better working there i m sure its sweeter and something in the balmy air may clear my metre in the garden ah this is noble what a sky what breezes blowing the very clouds i know not why call one to rowing the stream will be a paradise today i ll warrant i know the tide thats on the rise will seem a torrent i know just how the leafy boughs are all aquiver i know how many skiffs and scows are on the river i think i ll just go out awhile before i write it when nature shows us such a smile we should nt slight it for nature always makes desire by giving pleasure and so t will help me put more fire into my measure on the river the rivers fine i m glad i came that poem s teasing but health is better far than fame though cheques are pleasing i dont know what i did it for this air s a poppy i m sorry for my editor he ll get no copy the warriors prayer long since in sore distress i heard one pray lord who prevailest with resistless might ever from war and strife keep me away my battles fight i know not if i play the pharisee and if my brother after all be right but mine shall be the warriors plea to thee strength for the fight i do not ask that thou shalt front the fray and drive the warring foeman from my sight i only ask o lord by night by day strength for the fight when foes upon me press let me not quail nor think to turn me into coward flight i only ask to make mine arms prevail strength for the fight still let mine eyes look ever on the foe still let mine armor case me strong and bright and grant me as i deal each righteous blow strength for the fight and when at eventide the fray is done my soul to deaths bedchamber do thou light and give me be the field or lost or won rest from the fight farewell to arcady with sombre mien the evening gray comes nagging at the heels of day and driven faster and still faster before the duskymantled master the light fades from her fearful eyes she hastens stumbles falls and dies beside me amaryllis weeps the swelling tears obscure the deeps of her dark eyes as mistily the rushing rain conceals the sea here lay my tuneless reed away i have no heart to tempt a lay i scent the perfume of the rose which by my crystal fountain grows in this sad time are roses blowing and thou my fountain art thou flowing while i who watched thy waters spring am all too sad to smile or sing nay give me back my pipe again it yet shall breathe this single strain farewell to arcady the voice of the banjo in a small and lonely cabin out of noisy traffics way sat an old man bent and feeble dusk of face and hair of gray and beside him on the table battered old and worn as he lay a banjo droning forth this reminiscent melody night is closing in upon us friend of mine but dont be sad let us think of all the pleasures and the joys that we have had let us keep a merry visage and be happy till the last let the future still be sweetened with the honey of the past for i speak to you of summer nights upon the yellow sand when the southern moon was sailing high and silvering all the land and if love tales were not sacred theres a tale that i could tell of your many nightly wanderings with a dusk and lovely belle and i speak to you of carefree songs when labours hour was oer and a woman waiting for your step outside the cabin door and of something rolypoly that you took upon your lap while you listened for the stumbling hesitating words pap pap i could tell you of a possum hunt across the wooded grounds i could call to mind the sweetness of the baying of the hounds you could lift me up and smelling of the timber that s in me build again a whole green forest with the memry of a tree so the future cannot hurt us while we keep the past in mind what care i for trembling fingers what care you that you are blind time may leave us poor and stranded circumstance may make us bend but they ll only find us mellower wont they comrade in the end the stirrup cup come drink a stirrup cup with me before we close our rouse you re all aglow with wine i know the master of the house unmindful of our revelry has drowned the carking devil care and slumbers in his chair come drink a cup before we start we ve far to ride tonight and death may take the race we make and check our gallant flight but even he must play his part and tho the look he wears be grim we ll drink a toast to him for death a swift old chap is he and swift the steed he rides he needs no chart oer main or mart for no direction bides so come a final cup with me and let the soldiers chorus swell to hell with care to hell a choice they please me not these solemn songs that hint of sermons covered up tis true the world should heed its wrongs but in a poem let me sup not simples brewed to cure or ease humanitys confessed disease but the spiritwine of a singing line or a dewdrop in a honey cup humour and dialect then and now then he loved her and through many years had paid his fair devoted court until she wearied and with sneers turned all his ardent love to sport that night within his chamber lone he long sat writing by his bed a note in which his heart made moan for love the morning found him dead now like him a man of later day was jilted by the maid he sought and from her presence turned away consumed by burning bitter thought he sought his room to write a curse like him before and die i ween ah no he put his woes in verse and sold them to a magazine at cheshire cheese when first of wise old johnson taught my youthful mind its homage brought and made the pondrous crusty sage the object of a noble rage nor did i think how dense we are that any day however far would find me holding unrepelled the place that doctor johnson held but change has come and time has moved and now applauded unreproved i hold with pardonable pride the place that johnson occupied conceit presumption what is this you surely read my words amiss like johnson i a man of mind how could you ever be so blind no at the ancient cheshire cheese blown hither by some vagrant breeze to dignify my shallow wit in doctor johnsons seat i sit my corncob pipe men may sing of their havanas elevating to the stars the real or fancied virtues of their foreignmade cigars but i worship nicotina at a different sort of shrine and she sits enthroned in glory in this corncob pipe of mine it s as fragrant as the meadows when the clover is in bloom it s as dainty as the essence of the daintiest perfume it s as sweet as are the orchards when the fruit is hanging ripe with the suns warm kiss upon them is this corncob pipe thro the smoke about it clinging i delight its form to trace like an oriental beauty with a veil upon her face and my room is dim with vapour as a church when censers sway as i clasp it to my bosom in a figurative way it consoles me in misfortune and it cheers me in distress and it proves a warm partaker of my pleasures in success so i hail it as a symbol friendships true and worthy type and i press my lips devoutly to my corncob pipe in august when august days are hot an dry when burning copper is the sky i d rather fish than feast or fly in airy realms serene and high i d take a suit not made for looks some easily digested books some flies some lines some bait some hooks then would i seek the bays and brooks i would eschew mine every task in natures smiles my soul should bask and i methinks no more could ask except perhaps one little flask in case of accident you know or should the wind come on to blow or i be chilled or capsized so a flask would be the only go then could i spend a happy time a bit of sport a bit of rhyme a bit of lemon or of lime to make my bottles contents prime when august days are hot an dry i wont sit by an sigh or die i ll get my bottle on the sly and go ahead and fish and lie the disturber oh what shall i do i am wholly upset i am sure i ll be jailed for a lunatic yet i ll be out of a job its the thing to expect when i m letting my duty go by with neglect you may judge the extent and degree of my plight when i m thinking all day and adreaming all night and atrying my hand at a rhyme on the sly all on account of a sparkling eye there are those who say men should be strong welladay but what constitutes strength in a man who shall say i am strong as the most when it comes to the arm i have aye held my own on the playground or farm and when i ve been tempted i havent been weak but now why i tremble to hear a maid speak i used to be bold but now i ve grown shy and all on account of a sparkling eye there once was a time when my heart was devout but now my religion is open to doubt when parson is earnestly preaching of grace my fancy is busy with drawing a face thro the back of a bonnet most piously plain i draw it redraw it and draw it again while the songs and the sermon unheeded go by all on account of a sparkling eye oh dear little conjurer give oer your wiles it is easy for you youre all blushes and smiles but love of my heart i am sorely perplexed i am smiling one minute and sighing the next and if it goes on i ll drop hackle and flail and go to the parson and tell him my tale i warrant he ll find me a cure for the sigh that you re aye bringing forth with the glance of your eye expectation you

great battle may have proved a hero in the fight i dont believe in ristercrats i like the honest tan that lies upon the healthful cheek an speaks the honest man i like to grasp the brawny hand that

struggled day by day what though the thousands sneer an scoff an scorn yore humble birth kings are but puppets you are king by right o royal worth the man who simply sits an waits fur good to come

considable aseein men an things an i ve learned a little of the sense that meetin people brings but in spite of all my travelling an of all i think i know i ve got one notion in my head that i cant git to go an it is that the folks i meet in any other spot aint half so good as them i knowed back home in possum trot i know you ve never heerd the name it aint a famous place an i reckon ef you d search the map you could nt find a trace of any sich locality as this i ve named to you but never mind i know the place an i love it dearly too it dont make no pretensions to bein great or fine the circuses dont come that way they aint no railroad line it aint no great big city where the schemers plan an plot but jest a little settlement this place called possum trot but dont you think the folks that lived in that outlandish place were ignorant of all the things that go for sense or grace why there was hannah dyer you may search this teemin earth an never find a sweeter girl er one o greater worth an uncle abner williams aleanin on his staff it seems like i kin hear him talk an hear his hearty laugh his heart was big an cheery as a sunny acre lot why thats the kind o folks we had down there at possum trot good times well now to suit my taste an i m some hard to suit there aint been no sich pleasure sence an wont be none to boot with huskin bees in harvest time an dances later on an singin school an taffy pulls an fun from night till dawn revivals come in winter time baptizins in the spring you d ought to seen those people shout an heerd em pray an sing you d ought to ve heard ole parson brown athrowin gospel shot among the saints an sinners in the days of possum trot we live up in the city now my wife was bound to come i hear aroun me day by day the endless stir an hum i reckon that it done me good an yet it done me harm that oil was found so plentiful down there on my ole farm we ve got a newstyled preacher our church is newstyled too an i ve come down from what i knowed to rent a cushioned pew but often when i m settin there its foolish like as not to think of them ol benches in the church at possum trot i know that i m ungrateful an sich thoughts must be a sin but i find myself a wishin that the times was back agin with the huskins an the frolics an the joys i used to know when i lived at the settlement a dozen years ago i dont feel this way often i m scarcely ever glum for life has taught me how to take her chances as they come but now an then my mind goes back to that ol buryin plot that holds the dust of some i loved down there at possum trot

slavers cruel greed for the men who came from the cornfield who came from the plough and the flail who rallied round when they heard the sound of the mighty man of the rail they laid them down in the valleys they laid them down in the wood and the world looked on at the work they did and whispered it is good they fought their way on the hillside they fought their way in the glen and god looked down on their sinews brown and said i have made them men they went to the blue lines gladly and the blue lines took them in and the men who saw their muskets fire thought not of their dusky skin the gray lines rose and melted beneath their scathing showers and they said t is true they have force to do these old slave boys of ours ah wagner saw their glory and pillow knew their blood that poured on a nations altar a sacrificial flood port hudson heard their warcry that smote its smokefilled air and the old free fires of their savage sires again were kindled there they laid them down where the rivers the greening valleys gem and the song of the thundrous cannon was their sole requiem and the great smoke wreath that mingled its hue with the dusky cloud was the flag that furled oer a saddened world and the sheet that made their shroud oh mighty god of the battles who held them in thy hand who gave them strength through the whole days length to fight for their native land they are lying dead on the hillsides they are lying dead on the plain and we have not fire to smite the lyre and sing them one brief strain give thou some seer the power to sing them in their might the men who feared the masters whip but did not fear the fight that he may tell of their virtues as minstrels did of old till the pride of face and the hate of race grow obsolete and cold a song for the unsung heroes who stood the awful test when the humblest host that the land could boast went forth to meet the best a song for the unsung heroes who fell on the bloody sod who fought their way from night to

booker t washington the word is writ that he who runs may read what is the passing breath of earthly fame but to snatch glory from the hands of blame that is to be to live to strive indeed a poor virginia cabin gave the seed and from its dark and lowly door there came a peer of princes in the worlds acclaim a master spirit for the nations need strong silent purposeful beyond his kind the mark of rugged force on brow and lip straight on he goes nor turns to look behind where hot the hounds come baying at his hip with one idea foremost in his mind like the keen prow of some onforging ship the monks walk in this sombre garden close what has come and passed who knows what red passion what white pain haunted this dim walk in vain underneath the ivied wall where the silent shadows fall lies the pathway chill and damp where the worldquit dreamers tramp just across where sunlight burns smiling at the mourning ferns stand the roses side by side nodding in their useless pride ferns and roses who shall say what you witness day by day covert smile or dropping eye as the monks go pacing by has the novice come today here beneath the wall to pray has the young monk lately chidden sung his lyric sweet forbidden tell me roses did you note that pale fathers throbbing throat did you hear him murmur love as he kissed a faded glove mourning ferns pray tell me why shook you with that passing sigh is it that you chanced to spy something in the abbots eye here no dream nor thought of sin where no worlding enters in here no longing no desire heat nor flame of earthly fire branches waving green above whisper naught of life nor love softened winds that seem a breath perfumed bring no fear of death is it living thus to live has life nothing more to give ah no more of smile or sigh life the world and love goodbye gray and passionless and dim echoing of the solemn hymn lies the walk twixt fern and rose here within the garden close lovesong if death should claim me for her own today and softly i should falter from your side oh tell me loved one would my memory stay and would my image in your heart abide or should i be as some forgotten dream that lives its little space then fades entire should time send oer you its relentless stream to cool your heart and quench for aye loves fire i would not for the world love give you pain or ever compass what would cause you grief and oh how well i know that tears are vain but love is sweet my dear and life is brief so if some day before you i should go beyond the sound and sight of song and sea t would give my spirit stronger wings to know that you remembered still and wept for me slow through the dark slow moves the pageant of a climbing race their footsteps drag far far below the height and unprevailing by their utmost might seem faltering downward from each hard won place no strange swiftsprung exception we we trace a devious way thro dim uncertain light our hope through the long vistaed years a sight of that our captains soul sees face to face who faithless faltering that the road is steep now raiseth up his drear insistent cry who stoppeth here to spend a while in sleep or curseth that the storm obscures the sky heed not the darkness round you dull and deep the clouds grow thickest when the summits nigh the murdered lover say a mass for my souls repose my brother say a mass for my souls repose i need it lovingly lived we the sons of one mother mine was the sin but i pray you not heed it dark were her eyes as the sloe and they called me called me with voice independent of breath god how my heart beat her beauty appalled me dazed me and drew to the seabrink of death lithe was her form like a willow she beckoned what could i do save to follow and follow nothing of right or result could be reckoned life without her was unworthy and hollow ay but i wronged thee my brother my brother ah but i loved her thy beautiful wife shade of our father and soul of our mother have i not paid for my love with my life dark was the night when revengeful i met you deep in the heart of a desolate land warm was the lifeblood which angrily wet you sharp was the knife that i felt from your hand wept you oh wept you alone by the river when my stark carcass you secretly sank ha now i see that you tremble and shiver t was but my spirit that passed when you shrank weep not oh weep not t is over t is over stir the dark weeds with the turn of the tide go thou hast sent me forth ever a rover rest and the sweet realm of heaven denied say a mass for my souls repose my brother say a mass for my soul i need it

debt i thought poor was the loan at best god but the interest on the dedication of dorothy hall tuskegee ala april not to the midnight of the gloomy past do we revert today we look upon the golden present and the future vast whose vistas show us visions of the dawn nor shall the sorrows of departed years the sweetness of our tranquil souls annoy the sunshine of our hopes dispels the tears and clears our eyes to see this later joy not ever in the years that god hath given have we gone friendless down the thorny way always the clouds of pregnant black were riven by flashes from his own eternal day the women of a race should be its pride we glory in the strength our mothers had we glory that this strength was not denied to labor bravely nobly and be glad god give to these within this temple here clear vision of the dignity of toil that virtue in them may its blossoms rear unspotted fragrant from the lowly soil god bless the givers for their noble deed shine on them with the mercy of thy face who come with open hearts to help and speed the striving women of a struggling race a roadway let those who will stride on their barren roads and prick themselves to haste with selfmade goads unheeding as they struggle day by day if flowers be sweet or skies be blue or gray for me the lone cool way by purling brooks the solemn quiet of the woodland nooks a songbird somewhere trilling sadly gay a pause to pick a flower beside the way by rugged ways by rugged ways and thro the night we struggle blindly toward the light and groping stumbling ever pray for sight of long delaying day the cruel thorns beside the road stretch eager points our steps to goad and from the thickets all about detaining hands reach threatening out deliver us oh lord we cry our hands uplifted to the sky no answer save the thunders peal and onward onward still we reel oh give us now thy guiding light our sole reply the lightnings blight vain vain cries one in vain we call but faith serene is over all beside our way the streams are dried and famine mates us side by side discouraged and reproachful eyes seek once again the frowning skies yet shall there come spite storm and shock a moses who shall smite the rock call manna from the givers hand and lead us to the promised land the way is dark and cold and steep and shapes of horror murder sleep and hard the unrelenting years but twixt our sighs and moans and tears we still can smile we still can sing despite the arduous journeying for faith and hope their courage lend and rest and light are at the end loves seasons when the bees are humming in the honeysuckle vine and the summer days are in their bloom then my love is deepest oh dearest heart of mine when the bees are humming in the honeysuckle vine when the winds are moaning oer the meadows chill and gray and the land is dim with winter gloom then for thee my darling love will have its way when the winds are moaning oer the meadows chill and gray in the vernal dawning with the starting of the leaf in the merrychanting time of spring love steals all my senses oh the happyhearted thief in the vernal morning with the starting of the leaf always ever always even in the autumn drear when the days are sighing out their grief thou art still my darling dearest of the dear always ever always even in the autumn drear to a dead friend it is as if a silver chord were suddenly grown mute and lifes song with its rhythm warred against a silver lute it is as if a silence fell where bides the garnered sheaf and voices murmuring it is well are stifled by our grief it is as if the gloom of night had hid a summers day and willows sighing at their plight bent low beside the way for he was part of all the best that nature loves and gives and ever more on memorys breast he lies and laughs and lives to the south on its new slavery heart of the southland heed me pleading now who bearest unashamed upon my brow the long kiss of the loving tropic sun and yet whose veins with thy red current run borne on the bitter winds from every hand strange tales are flying over all the land and condemnation with his pinions foul glooms in the place where broods the midnight owl what art thou that the world should point at thee and vaunt and chide the weakness that they see there was a time they were not wont to chide where is thy old uncompromising pride bloodwashed thou shouldst lift up thine honored head white with the sorrow for thy loyal dead who lie on every plain on every hill and whose high spirit walks the southland still whose infancy our mothers hands have nursed thy manhood gone to battle unaccursed our fathers left to till th reluctant field to rape the soil for what she would not yield wooing for aye the cold unamrous sod whose growth for them still meant a masters rod tearing her bosom for the wealth that gave the strength that made the toiler still a slave too long we hear the deep impassioned cry that echoes vainly to the heedless sky too long too long the macedonian call falls fainting far beyond the outward wall within whose sweep beneath the shadowing trees a slumbering nation takes its dangerous ease too long the rumors of thy hatred go for those who loved thee and thy children so thou must arise forthwith and strong thou must throw off the smirching of this baser dust lay by the practice of this later creed and be thine honest self again indeed there was a time when even slaverys chain held in some joys to alternate with pain some little light to give the night relief some little smiles to take the place of grief there was a time when jocund as the day the toiler hoed his row and sung his lay found something gleeful in the very air and solace for his toiling everywhere now all is changed within the rude stockade a bondsman whom the greed of men has made almost too brutish to deplore his plight toils hopeless on from joyless morn till night for him no more the cabins quiet rest the homely joys that gave to labor zest no more for him the merry banjos sound nor trip of lightsome dances footing round for him no more the lamp shall glow at eve nor chubby children pluck him by the sleeve no more for him the masters eyes be bright he has nor freedoms nor a slaves delight what was it all for naught those awful years that drenched a groaning land with blood and tears was it to leave this sly convenient hell that brother fighting his own brother fell when that great struggle held the world in awe and all the nations blanched at what they saw did sanctioned slavery bow its conquered head that this unsanctioned crime might rise instead is it for this we all have felt the flame this newer bondage and this deeper shame nay not for this a nations heroes bled and north and south with tears beheld their dead oh mother south hast thou forgot thy ways forgot the glory of thine ancient days forgot the honor that once made thee great and stooped to this unhallowed estate it cannot last thou wilt come forth in might a warrior queen full armored for the fight and thou wilt take een with thy spear in rest thy dusky children to thy saving breast till then no more no more the gladsome song strike only deeper chords the notes of wrong till then the sigh the tear the oath the moan till thou oh south and thine come to thine own the haunted oak pray why are you so bare so bare oh bough of the old oaktree and why when i go through the shade you throw runs a shudder over me my leaves were green as the best i trow and sap ran free in my veins but i saw in the moonlight dim and weird a guiltless victims pains i bent me down to hear his sigh i shook with his gurgling moan and i trembled sore when they rode away and left him here alone they d charged him with the old old crime and set him fast in jail oh why does the dog howl all night long and why does the night wind wail he prayed his prayer and he swore his oath and he raised his hand to the sky but the beat of hoofs smote on his ear and the steady tread drew nigh who is it rides by night by night over the moonlit road and what is the spur that keeps the pace what is the galling goad and now they beat at the prison door ho keeper do not stay we are friends of him whom you hold within and we fain would take him away from those who ride fast on our heels with mind to do him wrong they have no care for his innocence and the rope they bear is long they have fooled the jailer with lying words they have fooled the man with lies the bolts unbar the locks are drawn and the great door open flies now they have taken him from the jail and hard and fast they ride and the leader laughs low down in his throat as they halt my trunk beside oh the judge he wore a mask of black and the doctor one of white and the minister with his oldest son was curiously bedight oh foolish man why weep you now tis but a little space and the time will come when these shall dread the memry of your face i feel the rope against my bark and the weight of him in my grain i feel in the throe of his final woe the touch of my own last pain and never more shall leaves come forth on a bough that bears the ban i am burned with dread i am dried and dead from the curse of a guiltless man and ever the judge rides by rides by and goes to hunt the deer and ever another rides his soul in the guise of a mortal fear and ever the man he rides me hard and never a night stays he for i feel his curse as a haunted bough on the trunk of a haunted tree weltschmertz you ask why i am sad today i have no cares no griefs you say ah yes t is true i have no grief but is there not the falling leaf the bare tree there is mourning left with all of autumns gray bereft it is not what has happened me think of the bare dismantled tree the birds go south along the sky i hear their lingering long goodbye who goes reluctant from my breast and yet the lone and windswept nest the mourning paleflowered hearse goes by why does a tear come to my eye is it the march rain blowing wild i have no dead i know no child i am no widow by the bier of him i held supremely dear i have not seen the choicest one sink down as sinks the westering sun faith unto faith have i beheld for me few solemn notes have swelled love bekoned me out to the dawn and happily i followed on and yet my heart goes out to them whose sorrow is their diadem the falling leaf the crying bird the voice to be all lost unheard not mine not mine and yet too much the thrilling power of human touch while all the world looks on and scorns i wear anothers crown of thorns count me a priest who understands the glorious pain of nailpierced hands count me a comrade of the thief hot driven into late belief oh mothers tear oh fathers sigh oh mourning sweethearts last goodbye i yet have known no mourning save beside some brothers brothers grave robert gould shaw why was it that the thunder voice of fate should call thee studious from the classic groves where calmeyed pallas with still footstep roves and charge thee seek the turmoil of the state what bade thee hear the voice and rise elate leave home and kindred and thy spicy loaves to lead th unlettered and despised droves to manhoods home and thunder at the gate far better the slow blaze of learnings light the cool and quiet of her dearer fane than this hot terror of a hopeless fight this cold endurance of the final pain since thou and those who with thee died for right have died the present teaches but in vain roses oh wind of the springtime oh free wind of may when blossoms and birdsong are rife oh joy for the season and joy for the day that gave me the roses of life of life that gave me the roses of life oh wind of the summer sing loud in the night when flutters my heart like a dove one came from thy kingdom thy realm of delight and gave me the roses of love of love and gave me the roses of love oh wind of the winter sigh low in thy grief i hear thy compassionate breath i wither i fall like the autumnkissed leaf he gave me the roses of death of death he gave me the roses of death a love song ah love my love is like a cry in the night a long loud cry to the empty sky the cry of a man alone in the desert with hands uplifted with parching lips oh rescue me rescue me thy form to mine arms the dew of thy lips to my mouth dost thou hear me my call thro the night darling i hear thee and answer thy fountain am i all of the love of my soul will i bring to thee all of the pains of my being shall wring to thee deep and forever the song of my loving shall sing to thee ever and ever thro day and

and yet and yet my vengeful soul will not forget the past forever now forgot you say from that half height where i had sadly climbed i stretched my hand i lone in all that land down there where helpless you were limed our fingers clasped and dragging me a pace you struggled up it is a bitter cup that now for naught you turn away your face i shall remember this for aye and aye whateer may come although my lips are dumb my spirit holds you to that yesterday in the tents of akbar in the tents of akbar are dole and grief today for the flower of all the indies has gone the silent way in the tents of akbar are emptiness and gloom and where the dancers gather the silence of the tomb across the yellow desert across the burning sands old akbar wanders madly and wrings his fevered hands and ever makes his moaning to the unanswering sky for sutna lovely sutna who was so fair to die for sutna danced at morning and sutna danced at eve her dusky eyes half hidden behind her silken sleeve her pearly teeth outglancing between her coral lips the tremulous rhythm of passion marked by her quivering hips as lovely as a jewel of fire and dewdrop blent so danced the maiden sutna in gallant akbars tent and one who saw her dancing saw her bosoms fall and rise put all his bodys yearning into his lovelit eyes then akbar came and drove him a jackal from his door and bade him wander far and look on sutnas face no more some day the sea disgorges the wilderness gives back those halfdead who have wandered aimless across its track and he returned the lover haggard of brow and spent he found fair sutna standing before her masters tent not mine nor akbars sutna he cried and closely pressed and drove his craven dagger straight to the maidens breast oh weep oh weep for sutna so young so dear so fair her face is gray and silent beneath her dusky hair and wail oh wail for akbar who walks the desert sands crying aloud for sutna wringing his fevered hands in the tents of akbar the tears of sorrow run but the corpse of sutnas slayer lies rotting in the sun the fount of tears all hot and grimy from the road dust gray from arduous years i sat me down and eased my load beside the fount of tears the waters sparkled to my eye calm crystallike and cool and breathing there a restful sigh i bent me to the pool when lo a voice cried pilgrim rise harsh tho the sentence be and on to other lands and skies this fount is not for thee pass on but calm thy needless fears some may not love or sin an angel guards the fount of tears all may not bathe therein then with my burden on my back i turned to gaze awhile first at the uninviting track then at the waters smile and so i go upon my way throout the sultry years but pause no more by night by day beside the fount of tears lifes tragedy it may be misery not to sing at all and to go silent through the brimming day it may be sorrow never to be loved but deeper griefs than these beset the way to have come near to sing the perfect song and only by a halftone lost the key there is the potent sorrow there the grief the pale sad staring of lifes tragedy to have just missed the perfect love not the hot passion of untempered youth but that which lays aside its vanity and gives thee for thy trusting worship truth this this it is to be accursed indeed for if we mortals love or if we sing we count our joys not by the things we have but by what kept us from the perfect thing de way tings come de way tings come hit seems to me is des one monstous mystery de way hit seem to strike a man dey aint no sense dey aint no plan ef trouble

strife and stress lost in a wilderness groping to find a way forth to the haunts of day sudden a vista peeps out of the tangled deeps only a point the ray but at the end is day dark is the dawn and chill daylight is on the hill night is the flitting breath day rides the hills of death night dim night night dim night and it rains my love it rains art thou dreaming of me i wonder the trees are sad and the wind complains outside the rolling of the thunder and the beat against the panes heart my heart thou art mournful in the rain are thy redolent lips aquiver my soul seeks thine doth it seek in vain my love goes surging like a river shall its tide bear naught save pain lyrics of love and sorrow i love is the light of the world my dear heigho but the world is gloomy the light has failed and the lamp down hurled leaves only darkness to me love is the light of the world my dear ah me but the world is dreary the night is down and my curtain furled but i cannot sleep though weary love is the light of the world my dear alas for a hopeless hoping when the flame went out in the breeze that swirled and a soul went blindly groping ii the light was on the golden sands a glimmer on the sea my soul spoke clearly to thy soul thy spirit answered me since then the light that gilds the sands and glimmers on the sea but vainly struggles to reflect the radiant soul of thee iii the sea speaks to me of you all the day long still as i sit by its side you are its song the sea sings to me of you loud on the reef always it moans as it sings voicing my grief iv my dear love died last night shall i clothe her in white my passionate love is dead shall i robe her in red but nay she was all untrue she shall not go drest in blue still my desolate love was brave unrobed let her go to her grave v there are brilliant heights of sorrow that only the few may know and the lesser woes of the world like waves break noiselessly far below i hold for my own possessing a mount that is lone and still the great high place of a hopeless grief and i call it my heartbreak hill and once on a winters midnight i found its highest crown and there in the gloom my soul and i weeping we sat us down but now when i seek that summit we are two ghosts that go only two shades of a thing that died once in the long ago so i sit me down in the silence and say to my soul be still so the world may not know we died that night from weeping on heartbreak hill lyrics of sunshine and shadow a boys summer song tis fine to play in the fragrant hay and romp on the golden load to ride old jack to the barn and back or tramp by a shady road to pause and drink at a mossy brink ah that is the best of joy and so i say on a summers day whats so fine as being a boy ha ha with line and hook by a babbling brook the fishermans sport we ply and list the song of the feathered throng that flit in the branches nigh at last we strip for a quiet dip ah that is the best of joy for this i say on a summers day whats so fine as being a boy ha ha the sandman i know a man with face of tan but who is ever kind whom girls and boys leaves games and toys each eventide to find when day grows dim they watch for him he comes to place his claim he wears the crown of dreamingtown the sandman is his name when sparkling eyes troop sleepywise and busy lips grow dumb when little heads nod toward the beds we know the sandmans come johnny speaks the sandman hes a jolly old fellow his face is kind and his voice is mellow but he makes your eyelids as heavy as lead and then you got to go off to bed i dont think i like the sandman but ive been playing this livelong day it does make a fellow so tired to play oh my im ayawning right here before ma im the sleepiest fellow that ever you saw i think i do like the sandman wintersong oh who would be sad tho the sky be agraying and meadow and woodlands are empty and bare for softly and merrily now there come playing the little white birds thro the winterkissed air the squirrels enjoying the rest of the thrifty he munches his store in the old hollow tree tho cold is the blast and the snowflakes are drifty he fears the white flock not a whit more than we chorus then

of the valley sweetest of the flowers ablooming in the fragrant vernal days is the lily of the valley with its soft retiring ways well you chose this humble blossom as the nurses emblem flower who grows more like her ideal every day and every hour like the lily of the valley in her honesty and worth ah she blooms in truth and virtue in the quiet nooks of earth tho she stands erect in honor when the heart of mankind bleeds still she hides her own deserving in the beauty of her deeds in the silence of the darkness where no eye may see and know there her footsteps shod with mercy and fleet kindness come and go not amid the sounds of plaudits nor before the garish day does she shed her souls sweet perfume does she take her gentle way but alike her ideal flower with its honeyladen breath still her heart blooms forth its beauty in the valley shades of death encouraged because you love me i have much achieved had you despised me then i must have failed but since i knew you trusted and believed i could not disappoint you and so prevailed to j q what are the things that make life bright a star gleam in the night what hearts us for the coming fray the dawn tints of the day what helps

ends theres a fabulous story full of splendor and glory that arabian legends transcends of the wealth without measure the coffers of treasure at the place where the rainbow ends oh many have sought it and all would have bought it with the blood we so recklessly spend but none has uncovered the gold nor discovered the spot at the rainbows end they have sought it in battle and een where the rattle of dice with mans blasphemy blends but howeer persuasive it still proves evasive this place where the rainbow ends i own for my pleasure i yearn not for treasure though gold has a power it lends and i have a notion to find without motion the place where the rainbow ends the pot may hold pottage the place be a cottage that a humble contentment defends only joy fills its coffer but spite of the scoffer theres the place where the rainbow ends where care shall be quiet and love shall run riot and i shall find wealth in my friends then truce to the story of riches and glory theres the place

and all went well till on a day learned dr cupid wandered by a search along our sylvan way for some peculiar butterfly a flash of wings a hurried dive a flutter and a shortlived flit this scientist as i am alive had seen my heart and captured it right tightly now tis held among the specimens that he has trapped and sings oh love is ever young tis passing sweet to be kidnaped compensation because i had loved so deeply because i had loved so long god in his great compassion gave me the gift of song because i have loved so vainly and sung with such faltering breath the master in infinite mercy

a good wahm coat fu to wrop him in she she look at de skillet an she smile oh my an ol brer rabbit got to sholy fly dey know anchored if thro the sea of night which here surrounds me i could swim out beyond the farthest star break every barrier of circumstance that bounds me and greet the sun of sweeter life afar tho near you there is passion grief and sorrow and out there rest and joy and peace and all i should renounce that beckoning for tomorrow i could not choose to go beyond your call the veteran underneath the autumn sky haltingly the lines go by ah would steps were blithe and gay as when first they marched away smile on lip and curl on brow only whitefaced graybeards now standing on lifes outer verge een the marches sound a dirge blow you bugles play you fife rattle drums for dearest life let the flags wave freely so as the marching legions go shout hurrah and laugh and jest this is memory at its best did you notice at your quip that old comrades quivering lip ah i see them as they come stumbling with the rumbling drum but a sight more sad to me een than these ranks could be was that one with cane upraised who stood by and gazed and gazed trembling solemn lips compressed longing to be with the rest did he dream of old alarms as he stood presented arms did he think of field and camp and the unremitting tramp mile on mile the lonely guard when he kept his midnight ward did he dream of wounds and scars in that bitter war of wars what of that he stood and stands in my memory trembling hands whitened beard and cane and all as if waiting for the call once again to arms my sons and his ears hear faroff guns roll of cannon and the tread of the legions of the dead yesterday and tomorrow yesterday i held your hand reverently i pressed it and its gentle yieldingness from my soul i blessed it but today i sit alone sad and sore repining must our gold forever know flames for the refining yesterday i walked with you could a day be sweeter life was all a lyric song set to tricksy meter ah today is like a dirge place my arms around you let me feel the same dear joy as when first i found you let me once retrace my steps from these roads unpleasant let my heart and mind and soul all ignore the present yesterday the iron seared and today means sorrow pause my soul arise arise look where gleams the morrow the change love used to carry a bow you know but now he carries a taper it is either a length of wax aglow or a twist of lighted paper i pondered a little about the scamp and then i decided to follow his wandering journey to field and camp up hill down dale or hollow i dogged the rollicking gay young blade in every species of weather till leading me straight to the home of a maid he left us there together and then i saw it oh sweet surprise the taper it set aburning the lovelight brimming my ladys eyes and my heart with the fire of yearning the chase the wind told the little leaves to hurry and chased them down the way while the mother tree laughed loud in glee for she thought her babes at play the cruel wind and the rain laughed loudly well bury them deep they said and the old tree grieves and the little leaves lie low all chilled and dead suppose if twere fair to suppose that your heart were not taken that the dew from the rose petals still were not shaken i should pluck you howeer you should thorn me and scorn me and wear you for life as the green of the bower if twere fair to suppose that that road was for vagrants that the wind and the rose counted all in their fragrance oh my dear one by love i should take you and make you the green of my life from the scintillant hour the death of the first born cover him over with daisies white and eke with the poppies red sit with me here by his couch tonight for the firstborn love is dead poor little fellow he seemed so fair as he lay in my jealous arms silent and cold he is lying there stripped of his darling charms lusty and strong he had grown forsooth sweet with an infinite grace proud in the force of his conquering youth laughter alight in his face oh but the blast it was cruel and keen and ah but the chill it was rare the look of the winterkissed flowr youve seen when meadows and fields were bare can you not wake from this white cold sleep and speak to me once again true that your slumber is deep so deep but deeper by far is my pain cover him over with daisies white and eke with the poppies red sit with me here by his couch tonight for the firstborn love is dead bein back home home agin an home to stay yes its nice to be away plenty things to

wounds have ceased to smart no more the quick delight of youth no more the sudden pain i look no more for trust or truth where greed may compass gain what was it i who bared my heart through unrelenting years and knew the sting of miserys dart the tang of sorrows tears tis better now i do not weep i do not laugh nor care my soul and spirit half asleep drift aimless everywhere we float upon a sluggish stream we ride no rapids mad while life is all a tempered dream and every joy half sad night silence and whirling worlds afar through all encircling skies what floods come oer the spirits bar what wondrous thoughts arise the earth a mantle falls away and winged we leave the sod where shines in its eternal sway the majesty of god at loafingholt since i left the citys heat for this sylvan cool retreat high upon the hillside here where the air is clean and clear i have lost the urban ways mine are calm and tranquil days sloping lawns of green are mine clustered treasures of the vine long forgotten plants i know where the best wild berries grow where the greens and grasses sprout when the elders blossom out now i am grown weatherwise with the lore of winds and skies mine the song whose soft refrain is the sigh of summer rain seek you where the woods are cool would you know the shady pool where throughout the lazy day speckled beauties drowse or play would you find in rest or peace sorrows permanent release leave the city grim and gray come with me ah come away do you fear the winter chill deeps of snow upon the hill tis a mantle kind and warm shielding tender shoots from harm do you dread the iceclad streams they are mirrors for your dreams heres a rouse when summers past to the raging winters blast let him roar and let him rout we are armored for the bout how the logs are glowing see who sings louder they or he could the city be more gay burn your bridges come away when a fellers itchin to be spanked wen us fellers stomp around makin lots o noise

they are free they that know not the treacherous sands ah but this be a venturesome journey forever those sands are ashift and a step to one side means a grasp of the tide and the current is fearful

he plays upon the harpstrings of the rain a lost dream ah i have changed i do not know why lonely hours affect me so in days of yore this were not wont no loneliness my soul could daunt for me too serious for my age the weighty tome of hoary sage until with puzzled heart astir one godgivn night i dreamed of her i loved no woman hardly knew more of the sex that strong men woo than cloistered monk within his cell but now the dream is lost and hell holds me her captive tight and fast who prays and struggles for the past no living maid has charmed my eyes but now my soul is wonderwise for i have dreamed of her and seen her redbrown tresses ruddy sheen have known her sweetness lip to lip the joy of her companionship when days were bleak and winds were rude she shared my smiling solitude and all the bare hills walked with me to hearken winters melody and when the spring came oer the land we fared together hand in hand beneath the lindens leafy screen that waved above us faintly green in summer by the riverside our souls were kindred with the tide that floated onward to the sea as we swept toward eternity the birds call and the waters drone were all for us and us alone the waterfall that sang all night was her companion my delight and een the squirrel as he sped along the branches overhead half kindly and half envious would chatter at the joy of us twas but a dream her face her hair the springtime sweet the winter bare the summer when the woods we ranged twas but a dream but all is changed yes all is changed and all has fled the dream is broken shattered dead and yet sometimes i pray to know how just a dream could hold me so a song thou art the soul of a summers day thou art the breath of the rose but the summer is fled and the rose is dead where are they gone who knows who knows thou art the blood of my heart o hearts thou art my souls repose but my heart grows numb and my soul is dumb where art thou love who knows who knows thou art the hope of my after years sun for my winter snows but the years go by neath a clouded sky where shall we meet who knows who knows miscellaneous the capture duck come switchin cross de lot hi oh miss lady hurry up an hide

sign of spring sir however you may look around pray what will then you sing sir the spring was here last year i know and many bards did flute sir i shall not fear a little snow forbid me from my lute sir if words grow dull and rhymes grow rare ill sing of springs farewell sir for every season steals an air which has a springtime smell sir but if upon the other side with passionate longing burning will seek the half unjeweled tide and sing of springs returning from the porch at runnymede i stand above the citys rush and din and gaze far down with calm and undimmed eyes to where the misty smoke wreath grey and dim above the myriad roofs and spires rise still is my heart and vacant is my breath this lovely view is breath and life to me why i could charm the icy soul of death with such a sight as this i stand and see i hear no sound of labors din or stir i feel no weight of worldly cares or fears sweet song of birds of wings the soothing whirr these sounds alone assail my listening ears unwhipt of conscience here i stand alone the breezes humbly kiss my garments hem i am a king the whole world is my throne the blue grey sky my royal diadem equipment with what thou gavest me o master i have wrought such chances such abilities to see the end was not for my poor eyes thine was the impulse thine the forming thought ah i have wrought and these sad hands have right to tell their story it was no hard up striving after glory catching and losing gaining and failing raging me back at the worlds raucous railing simply and humbly from stone and from wood wrought i the things that to thee might seem good if they are little ah god but the cost who but thou knowest the all that is lost if they are few is the workmanship true try them and weigh me whateer be my due evening the moon begins her stately ride across the summer sky the happy wavelets lash the shore the tide is rising high beneath some friendly blade of grass the lazy beetle cowers the coffers of the air are filled with offerings from the flowers and slowly buzzing oer my head a swallow wings her flight i hear the weary plowman sing as falls the restful night to pfrimmer lines on reading driftwood driftwood gathered here and there along the beach of time now and then a chip of truth mid boards and boughs of rhyme driftwood gathered day by day the cypress and the oak twigs that in some former time from sturdy home trees broke did this wood come floating thick all along down injin crik or did kind tides bring it thee from the pasts receding sea down the stream of memory to the miami kiss me miami thou most constant one i love thee more for that thou changest not when winter comes with frigid blast or when the blithesome spring is past and summers here with sunshine hot or in sere autumn thou has still the powr to charm alike whateer the hour kiss me miami with thy dewy lips throbs fast my heart een as thine own breast beats my soul doth rise as rise thy waves as each on each the dark shore laves and breaks in ripples and retreats there is a poem in thine every phase thou still has sung through all thy days tell me miami how it was with thee when years ago tecumseh in his prime his birch boat oer thy waters sent and pitched upon thy banks his tent in that longgone poetic time did some bronze bard thy flowing stream sit by and sing thy praises een as i did some bronze lover neath this dark old tree whisper of love unto his indian maid and didst thou list his murmurs deep and in thy bosom safely keep the many raging vows they said or didst thou tell to fish and frog and bird the raptured scenes that there occurred but o dear stream what volumes thou couldst tell to all who know thy language as i do of life and love and jealous hate but now to tattle were too late thou who hast ever been so true tell not to every passing idler here all those sweet tales that reached thine ear but silent stream speak out and tell me this i say that men and things are still the same were men as bold to do and dare were women then as true and fair did poets seek celestial flame the hero die to gain a laureled brow and women suffer then as now christmas carol ring out ye bells all nature swells with gladness at the wondrous story the world was lorn but christ is born to change our sadness into glory sing earthlings sing tonight a king hath come from heavens high throne to bless us the outstretched hand oer all the land is raised in pity to caress us come at his call be joyful all away with mourning and with sadness the heavenly choir with holy fire their voices raise in songs of gladness the darkness breaks and dawn awakes her cheeks suffused with youthful blushes the rocks and stones in holy tones are singing sweeter than the thrushes then why should we in silence be when nature lends her voice to praises when heaven and earth proclaim the truth of him for whom that lone star blazes no be not still but with a will strike all your harps and set them ringing on hill and heath let every breath throw all its power into singing a summer pastoral its hot today the bees is buzzin kinder dontkeerlike aroun an fur off the warm air dances oer the parchin roofs in town in the

plow another furrer its too mortal hot today i aint weak nor i aint lazy but ill stand this half days loss fore i let the devil make me lose my patience an git cross in summer time when summer time has come and all the world is in the magic thrall of perfumed airs that lull each sense to fits of drowsy indolence when skies are deepest blue above and flowrs aflush then most i love to start while early dews are damp and wend my way in woodland tramp where forests rustle tree on tree and sing their silent songs to me where pathways meet and path ways part to walk with nature heart by heart till wearied out at last i lie where some sweet stream steals singing by a mossy bank where violets vie in color with the summer sky or take my rod and line and hook and wander to some darkling brook where all day long the willows dream and idly droop to kiss the stream and there to loll from morn till night unheeding nibble run or bite just for the joy of being there and drinking in the summer air the summer sounds and summer sights that set a restless mind to rights when grief and pain and raging doubt of men and creeds have worn it out the birds song and the waters drone the humming bees low monotone the murmur of the passing breeze and all the sounds akin to these that make a man in summer time feel only fit for rest and rhyme joy springs all radiant in my breast though pauper poor than king more blest the tide beats in my soul so strong that happiness breaks forth in song and rings aloud the welkin blue with all the songs i ever knew o time of rapture time of song how swiftly glide thy days along adown the current of the years above the rocks of grief and tears tis wealth enough of joy for me in summer time to simply be a thanksgiving poem the sun hath shed its kindly light our harvesting is gladly oer our fields have felt no killing blight our bins are filled with goodly store from pestilence fire flood and sword we have been spared by thy decree and now with humble hearts o lord we come to pay our thanks to thee we feel that had our merits been the measure of thy gifts to us we erring children born of sin might not now be rejoicing thus no deed of ours hath brought us grace when thou were nigh our sight was dull we hid in trembling from thy face but thou o god wert merciful thy mighty hand oer all the land hath still been open to bestow those blessings which our wants demand from heaven whence all blessings flow thou hast with ever watchful eye looked down on us with holy care and from thy storehouse in the sky hast scattered plenty everywhere then lift we up our songs of praise to thee o father good and kind to thee we consecrate our days be thine the temple of each mind with incense sweet our thanks ascend before thy works our powers pall though we should strive years without end we could not thank thee for them all nutting song the november sun invites me and although the chill wind smites me i will wander to the woodland where the laden trees await and with loud and joyful singing i will set the forest ringing as if i were king of autumn and dame nature were my mate while the squirrel in his gambols fearless round about me ambles as if he were bent on showing in my kingdom hed a share while my warm blood leaps and dashes and my eye with freedom flashes as my soul drinks deep and deeper of the magic in the air theres a pleasure found in nutting all lifes cares and griefs outshutting that is fuller far and better than what prouder sports impart who could help a carol trilling as he sees the baskets filling why the flow of song keeps running oer the high walls of the heart so when i am home returning when the sun is lowly burning i will once more wake the echoes with a happy song of praise for the golden sunlight blessing and the breezes soft caressing and the precious boon of living in the sweet november days loves pictures like the blush upon the rose when the wooing south wind speaks kissing soft its petals are thy cheeks tender soft beseeching true like the stars that deck the skies through the ether sparkling are thine eyes like the song of happy birds when the woods with spring rejoice in their blithe awakning is thy voice like soft threads of clustered silk oer thy face so pure and fair sweet in its profusion is thy hair like a fair but fragile vase triumph of the carvers art graceful formed and slender thus thou art ah thy cheek thine eyes thy voice and thy hairs delightful wave make me ill confess it thy poor slave the old homestead tis an old deserted homestead on the outskirts of the town where the roof is all mosscovered and the walls are tumbling down but around that little cottage do my brightest memries cling for twas there i spent the moments of my youth lifes happy spring i remember how i used to swing upon the old front gate while the robin in the tree tops sung a night song to his mate and how later in the evening as the beaux were wont to do mr perkins in the parlor sat and sparked my sister sue there my mother heaven bless her kissed or spanked as was our need and by smile or stroke implanted in our hearts fair virtues seed while my father man of wisdom lawyer keen and farmer stout argued long with neighbor dobbins how the corn crops would turn out then the quiltings and the dances how my feet were wont to fly while the moon peeped through the barn chinks from her stately place on high oh those days so sweet so happy ever backward oer me roll still the music of that farm life rings an echo in my soul now the old place is deserted and the walls are falling down all who made the home life cheerful now have died or moved to town but about that dear old cottage shall my memries ever cling for twas there i spent the moments of my youth lifes happy spring on the death of w c thou arrant robber death couldst thou not find some lesser one than he to rob of breath some poorer mind thy prey to be his mind was like the sky as pure and free his heart was broad and open as the sea his soul shone purely through his face and love made him her dwelling place not less the scholar than the friend not less a friend than man the manly life did shorter end because so broad it ran weep not for him unhappy muse his merits found a grander use some otherwhere god wisely sees the place that needs his qualities weep not for him for when death lowers oer youths ambrosiascented bowers he only plucks the choicest flowers an old memory how sweet the music sounded that summer long ago when you were by my side love to list its gentle flow i saw your eyes ashining i felt your rippling hair i kissed your pearly cheek love and had no thought of care and gay or sad the music with subtle charm replete i found in after years love twas you that made it sweet for standing where we heard it i hear again the strain it wakes my heart but thrills it with sad mysterious pain it pulses not so joyous as when you stood with me and hand in hand we listened to that low melody oh could the years turn back love oh could events be changed to what they were that time love before we were estranged wert thou once more a maiden whose smile was gold to me were i once more the lover whose word was life to thee o god could all be altered the pain the grief the strife and wert thou as thou shouldst be my true and loyal wife but all my tears are idle and all my wishes vain what once you were to me love you may not be again for i alas like others have missed my dearest aim i asked for love oh mockery fate comes to me with fame a career break me my bounds and let me fly to regions vast of boundless sky nor i like piteous daphne be rootbound ah no i would be free as yon same bird that in its flight outstrips the range of mortal sight free as the mountain streams that gush from bubbling springs and downward rush across the serrate mountains side the rocks oerwhelmed their banks defied and like the passions in the soul swell into torrents as they roll oh circumscribe me not by rules that serve to lead the minds of fools but give me powr to work my will and at my deeds the world shall thrill my words shall rouse the slumbring zest that hardly stirs in manhoods breast and as the sun feeds lesser lights as planets have their satellites so round about me will i bind the men who prize a master mind he lived a silent life alone and laid him down when it was done and at his head was placed a stone on which was carved a name unknown on the river the sun is low the waters flow my boat is dancing to and fro the eve is still yet from the hill the killdeer echoes loud and shrill the paddles plash the wavelets dash we see the summer lightning flash while now and then in marsh and fen too muddy for the feet of men where neither bird nor beast has stirred the spotted bullfrogs croak is heard the wind is high the grasses sigh the sluggish stream goes sobbing by and far away the dying day has cast its last effulgent ray while on the land the shadows stand proclaiming that the eves at hand poor withered rose a song poor withered rose she gave it me half in revenge and half in glee its petals not so pink by half as are her lips when curled to laugh as are her cheeks when dimples gay in merry mischief oer them play chorus forgive forgive it seems unkind to cast thy petals to the wind but it is right and lest i err so scatter i all thought of her poor withered rose so like my heart that wilts at sorrows cruel dart who hath not felt the winters blight when every hope seemed warm and bright who doth not know love unreturned een when the heart most wildly burned poor withered rose thou liest dead too soon thy beautys bloom hath fled tis not without a tearful ruth i watch decay thy blushing youth and though thy life goes out in dole thy perfume lingers in my soul worn out you bid me hold my peace and dry my fruitless tears forgetting that i bear a pain beyond my years you say that i should smile and drive the gloom away i would but sun and smiles have left my lifes dark day all time seems cold and void and naught but tears remain lifes music beats for me a melancholy strain i used at first to hope but hope is past and gone and now without a ray my cheerless life drags on like to an ashstained hearth when all its fires are spent like to an autumn wood by storm winds rudely shent so sadly goes my heart unclothed of hope and peace it asks not joy again but only seeks release james whitcomb riley from a westerners point of view no matter what you call it whether genius or art he sings the simple songs that come the closest to your heart fur trim an skillful phrases i do not keer a jot taint the words alone but feelins that tech the tender spot an thats jest why i love him why hes got sech human feelin an in evry song he gives us you kin see it creepin stealin through the core the tears go tricklin but the edge is bright an smiley i never saw a poet like that poet whitcomb riley his heart keeps beatin time with ourn in measures fast or slow he tells us jest the same ol things our souls have learned to know he paints our joys an sorrers in a way so stricly true that a body cant help knowin that he has felt them too if theres a lesson to be taught he never fears to teach it an he puts the food so good an low that the humblest one kin reach it now in our time when poets rhyme for money fun or fashion tis good to hear one voice so clear that thrills with honest passion so let the others build their songs an strive to polish highly theres none of them kin tech the heart like our own whitcomb riley a madrigal dream days of fond delight and hours as rosyhued as dawn are mine loves drowsy wine brewed from the heart of passion flowers flows softly oer my lips and save thee all the world is in eclipse there were no light if thou wert not the sun would be too sad to shine and all the line of hours from dawn would be a blot and night would haunt the skies an unlaid ghost with staring darkringed eyes oh love if thou wert not my love and i perchance not thine what then could gift of men or favor of the god above plant aught in this bare heart or teach this tongue the singers soulful art ah no tis love and love alone that spurs my soul so surely on turns night to dawn and thorns to roses fairest blown and winter drear to spring oh were it not for love i could not sing a starry night a cloud fell down from the heavens and broke on the mountains brow it scattered the dusky fragments all over the vale below the moon and the stars were anxious to know what its fate might be so they rushed to the azure opning and all peered down to see a lyric my lady love lives far away and oh my heart is sad by day and ah my tears fall fast by night what may i do in such a plight why miles grow few when love is fleet and love you know hath flying feet break off thy sighs and witness this how poor a thing mere distance is my love knows not i love her so and would she scorn me did she know how may the tale i would impart attract her ear and storm her heart calm thou the tempest in my breast who loves in silence loves the best but bide thy time she will awake no night so dark but morn will break but though my heart so strongly yearn my lady loves me not in turn how may i win the blest reply that my void heart shall satisfy love breedeth love be thou but true and soon thy love shall love thee too if fate hath meant you heart for heart theres naught may keep you twain apart how shall i woo thee how shall i woo thee to win thee mine own say in what tongue shall i tell of my love i who was fearless so timid have grown all that was eagle has turned into dove the path from the meadow that leads to the bars is more to me now than the path of the stars how shall i woo thee to win thee mine own thou who art fair and as far as the moon had i the strength of the torrents wild tone had i the sweetness of warblers in june the strength and the sweetness might charm and persuade but neither have i my petition to aid how shall i woo thee to win thee mine own how shall i traverse the distance between my humble cot and your glorious throne how shall a clown gain the ear of a queen oh teach me the tongue that shall please thee the best for till i have won thee my heart may not rest transcribers notes many contractions which would normally be printed together in their shortened form are left spaced as printed sometimes this is done due to the meter of the poem other times it is just the older way that printers handled these words the original was not always consistent about how these were handled and may have been contracted to save space since this book has a significant amount of dialect no attempt was made to change any odd spellings some of these words are not easy to translate but usually the context will be sufficient for instance the word stuhs means stirs as dat melody stuhs me up
