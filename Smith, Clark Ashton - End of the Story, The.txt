the end of the story clark ashton smith the following narrative was found among the papers of christophe morand a young lawstudent of tours after his unaccountable disappearance during a visit at his fathers home near moulins in november a sinister brownishpurple autumn twilight made premature by the imminence of a sudden thunderstorm had filled the forest of averoigne the trees along my road were already blurred to ebon masses and the road itself pale and spectral before me in the thickening gloom seemed to waver and quiver slightly as with the tremor of some mysterious earthquake i spurred my horse who was woefully tired with a journey begun at dawn and had fallen hours ago to a protesting and reluctant trot and we galloped adown the darkening road between enormous oaks that seemed to lean toward us with boughs like clutching fingers as we passed with dreadful rapidity the night was upon us the blackness became a tangible clinging veil a nightrnare confusion and desperation drove me to spur my mount again with a more cruel rigor and now as we went the first faroff mutter of the storm mingled with the clatter of my horses hoofs and the first lightning flashes illumed our way which to my amazement had inexplicably narrowed to a welltrodden footpath feeling sure that i had gone astray but not caring to retrace my steps in the teeth of darkness and the towering clouds of the tempest i hurried on hoping as seemed reasonable that a path so plainly worn would lead eventually to some house or chateau where i could find refuge for the night my hope was wellfounded for within a few minutes i descried a glimmering light through the forestboughs and came suddenly to an open glade where on a gentle eminence a large building loomed with several litten windows in the lower story and a top that was wellnigh indistinguishable against the bulks of driven cloud doubtless a monastery i thought as i drew rein and descending from my exhausted mount lifted the heavy brazen knocker in the form of a dogs head and let it fall on the oaken door the sound was unexpectedly loud and sonorous with a reverberation almost sepulchral and i shivered involuntarily with a sense of startlement of unwonted dismay this a moment later was wholly dissipated when the door was thrown open and a tall ruddyfeatured monk stood before me in the cheerful glow of the cressets that illumed a capacious hallway i bid you welcome to the abbey of perigon he said in a suave rumble and even as he spoke another robed and hooded figure appeared and took my horse in charge as i murmured my thanks and acknowledgments the storm broke and tremendous gusts of rain accompanied by evernearing peals of thunder drove with demoniac fury on the door that had closed behind me it is fortunate that you found us when you did observed my host twere ill for man and beast to be abroad in such a hellbrew divining without question that i was hungry as well as tired he led me to the refectory and set before me a bountiful meal of mutton brown bread lentils aad a strong excellent red wine he sat opposite me at the refectory table while i ate and with my hunger a little mollifed i took occasion to scan him more attentively he was both tall and stoutly built and his features where the brow was no less broad than the powerful jaw betokened intellect as well as a love for good living a certain delicacy and refinement an air of scholarship of good taste and good breeding emanated from him and i thought to myself this monk is probably a connoisseur of books as well as of wines doubtless my expression betrayed the quickening of my curiosity for he said as if in answer i am hilaire the abbot of perigon we are a benedictine order who live in amity with god and with all men and we do not hold that the spirit is to be enriched by the mortification or impoverishment of the body we have in our butteries an abundance of wholesome fare in our cellars the best and oldest vintages of the district of averoigne and if such thiags interest you as mayhap they do we have a library that is stocked with rare tomes with precious manuscripts with the finest works of heathendom and christendom even to certain unique writings that survived the holocaust of alexandria i appreciate your hospitality i said bowing i am christophe morand a lawstudent on my way home from tours to my fathers estate near moulins i too am a lover of books and nothing would delight me more than the privilege of inspecting a library so rich and curious as the one whereof you speak forthwith while i finished my meal we fell to discussing the classics and to quoting and capping passages from latin greek or christian authors my host i soon discovered was a scholar of uncommon attainments with an erudition a ready familiarity with both ancient and modern literature that made my own seem as that of the merest beginner by comparison he on his part was so good as to commend my far from perfect latin and by the time i had emptied my bottle of red wine we were chatting familiarly like old friends all my fatigue had now flown to be succeeded by a rare sense of wellbeing of physical comfort combined with mental alertness and keenness so when the abbot suggested that we pay a visit to the library i assented with alacrity he led me down a long corridor on each side of which were cells belonging to the brothers of the order and unlocked with a huge brazen key that depended from his girdle the door of a great room with lofty ceiling and several deepset windows truly he had not exaggerated the resources of the library for the long shelves were overcrowded with books and many volumes were piled high on the tables or stacked in corners there were rolls of papyrus of parchment of vellum there were strange byzantine or coptic bibles there were old arabic and persian manuscripts with floriated or jewelstudded covers there were scores of incunabula from the first printingpresses there were innumerable monkish copies of antique authors bound in wood or ivory with rich illuminations and lettering that was often in itself a work of art with a care that was both loving and meticulous the abbot hilaire brought out volume after volume for my inspection many of them i had never seen before some were unknown to me even by fame or rumor my excited interest my unfeigned enthusiasm evidently pleased him for at length he pressed a hidden spring in one of the library tables and drew out a long drawer in which he told me were certain treasures that he did not care to bring forth for the edification or delectation of many and whose very existence was undreamed of by the monks here he continued are three odes by catullus which you will not find in any published edition of his works here also is an original manuscript of sappho a complete copy of a poem otherwise extant only in brief fragments here are two of the lost tales of miletus a letter of perides to aspasia an unknown dialogue of plato and an old arabian work on astronomy by some anonymous author in which the theories of copernicus are anticipated and lastly here is the somewhat infamous histoire damour by bernard de vaillantcoeur which was destroyed immediately upon publication and of which only one other copy is known to exist as i gazed with mingled awe and curiosity on the unique unheardof treasures he displayed i saw in one corner of the drawer what appeared to be a thin volume with plain untitled binding of dark leather i ventured to pick it up and found that it contained a few sheets of ciosely written manuscript in old french and this i queried turning to look at hilaire whose face to my amazement had suddenly assumed a melancholy and troubled expression it were better not to ask my son he crossed himself as he spoke and his voice was no longer mellow but harsh agitated full of a sorrowful perturbation there is a curse on the pages that you hold in your hand an evil spell a malign power is attached to them and he who would venture to peruse them is henceforward in dire peril both of body and soul he took the little volume from me as he spoke and returned it to the drawer again crossing himself carefully as he did so but father i dared to expostulate how can such things be how can there be danger in a few written sheets of parchment christophe there are things beyond your understanding things that it were not well for you to know the might of satan is manifestable in devious modes in diverse manners there are other temptations than those of the world and the flesh there are evils no less subtle than irresistible there are hidden heresies and necromancies other than those which sorcerers practise with what then are these pages concerned that such occult peril such unholy power lurks within them i forbid you to ask his tone was one of great rigor with a finality that dissuaded me from further questioning for you my son he went on the danger would be doubly great because you are young ardent full of desires and curiosities believe me it is better to forget that you have ever seen this manuscript he closed the hidden drawer and as he did so the melancholy troubled look was replaced by his former benignity now he said as he turned to one of the bookshelves i will show you the copy of ovid that was owned by the poet petrarch he was again the mellow scholar the kindly jovial host and it was evident that the mysterious manuscript was not to be referred to again but his odd perturbation the dark and awful hints he had let fall the vague terrific terms of his proscription had all served to awaken my wildest curiosity and though i felt the obsession to be unreasonable i was quite unable to think of anything else for the rest of the evening all manner of speculations fantastic absurd outrageous ludicrous terrible defiled through my brain as i duly admired the incunabula which hilaire took down so tenderly from the shelves for my delectation at last toward midnight he led me to my room a room especially reserved for visitors and with more of comfort of actual luxury in its hangings carpets and deeply quilted bed than was allowable in the cells of the monks or of the abbot himself even when hilaire had withdrawn and i had proved for my satisfaction the softness of the bed allotted me my brain still whirled with questions concerning the forbidden manuscript though the storm had now ceased it was long before i fell asleep but slumber when it finally came was dreamless and profound when i awoke a river of sunshine clear as molten gold was pouring through my wmdow the storm had wholly vanished and no lightest tatter of cloud was visible anywhere in the paleblue october heavens i ran to the window and peered out on a world of autumnal forest and fields all asparkle with the diamonds of rain all was beautiful all was idyllic to a degree that could be fully appreciated only by one who had lived for a long time as i had within the walls of a city with towered buildings in lieu of trees and cobbled pavements where grass should be but charming as it was the foreground held my gaze only for a few moments then beyond the tops of the trees i saw a hill not more than a mile distant on whose summit there stood the ruins of some old chateau the crumbling brokendown condition of whose walls and towers was plainly visible it drew my gaze irresistibly with an overpowering sense of romantic attraction which somehow seemed so natural so inevitable that i did not pause to analyze or wonder and once having seen it i could not take my eyes away but lingering at the window for how long i knew not scrutinizing as closely as i could the details of each timeshaken turret and bastion some undefinable fascination was inherent in the very form the extent the disposition of the pile some fascination not dissimilar to that exerted by a strain of music by a magical combination of words in poetry by the features of a beloved face gazing i lost myself in reveries that i could not recall afterward but which left behind them the same tantalizing sense of innominable delight which forgotten nocturnal dreams may sometimes leave i was recalled to the actualities of life by a gentle knock at my door and realized that i had forgotten to dress myself it was the abbot who came to inquire how i had passed the night and to tell me that breakfast was ready whenever i should care to arise for some reason i felt a little embarrassed even shamefaced to have been caught daydreaming and though this was doubtless unnecessary i apologized for my dilatoriness hilaire i thought gave me a keen inquiring look which was quickly withdrawn as with the suave courtesy of a good host he assured me that there was nothing whatever for which i need apologize when i had breakfast i told hilaire with many expressions of gratitude for his hospitality that it was time for me to resume my journey but his regret at the announcement of my departure was so unfeigned his invitation to tarry for at least another night was so genuinely hearty so sincerely urgent that i consented to remain in truth i required no great amount of solicitation for apart from the real liking i had taken to hilaire the mystery of the forbidden manuscript had entirely enslaved my imagination and i was loth to leave without having learned more concerning it also for a youth with scholastic leanings the freedom of the abbots library was a rare privilege a precious opportunity not to be passed over i should like i said to pursue certain studies while i am here with the aid of your incomparable collection my son you are more than welcome to remain for any length of time and you can have access to my books whenever it suits your need or inclination so saying hilaire detached the key of the library from his girdle and gave it to me there are duties he went on which will call me away from the monastery for a few hours today and doubtless you will desire to study in my absence a little later he excused himself and departed with inward felicitations on the longedfor opportunity that had fallen so readily into my hands i hastened to the library with no thought save to read the proscribed manuscript giving scarcely a glance at the laden shelves i sought the table with the secret drawer and fumbled for the spring after a little anxious delay i pressed the proper spot and drew forth the drawer an impulsion that had become a veritable obsession a fever of curiosity that bordered upon actual madness drove me and if the safety of my soul had really depended upon it i could not have denied the desire which forced me to take from the drawer the thin volume with plain unlettered binding seating myself in a chair near one of the windows i began to peruse the pages which were only six in number the writing was peculiar with letterforms of a fantasticality i had never met before and the french was not only old but wellnight barbarous in its quaint singularity notwithstanding the difficulty i found in deciphering them a mad unaccountable thrill ran through me at the first words and i read on with all the sensations of a man who had been bewitched or who had drunken a philtre of bewildering potency there was no title no date and the writing was a narrative which began almost as abruptly as it ended it concerned one gerard comte de venteillon who on the eve of his marriage to the renowned and beautiful demoiselle eleanor des lys had met in the forest near his chateau a strange halfhuman creature with hoofs and horns now gerard as the narrative explained was a knightly youth of indisputably proven valor as well as a true christian so in the name of our savior jesus christ he bade the creature stand and give an account of itself laughing wildly in the twilight the bizarre being capered before him and cried i am a satyr and your christ is less to me than the weeds that grow on your kitchenmiddens appalled by such blasphemy gerard would have drawn his sword to slay the creature but again it cried saying stay gerard de venteillon and i will tell you a secret knowing which you will forget the worship of christ and forget your beautiful bride of tomorrow and turn your back on the world and on the very sun itself with no reluctance and no regret now albeit half uawillingly gerard lent the satyr an ear and it came closer and whispered to him and that which it whispered is not known but before it vanished amid the blackening shadows of the forest the satyr spoke aloud once more and said the power of christ has prevailed like a black frost on all the woods the fields the rivers the mountains where abode in their felicity the glad immortal goddesses and nymphs of yore but still in the cryptic caverns of earth in places far underground like the hell your priests have fabled there dwells the pagan loveliness there cry the pagan ecstasies and with the last words the creature laughed again its wild unhuman laugh and disappeared among the darkening boles of the twilight trees from that moment a change was upon gerard de venteillon he returned to his chateau with downcast mien speaking no cheery or kindly word to his retainers as was his wont but sitting or pacing always in silence and scarcely heeding the food that was set before him nor did he go that evening to visit his betrothed as he had promised but toward midnight when a waning moon had arisen red as from a bath of blood he went forth clandestinely by the postern door of the chateau and followed an old halfobliterated trail through the woods found his way to the ruins of the chateau des faussesflammes which stands on a hill opposite the benedictine abbey of perigon now these ruins are very old and have long been avoided by the people of the district for a legendry of immemorial evil clings about them and it is said that they are the dwellingplace of foul spirits the rendezvous of sorcerers and succubi but gerard as if oblivious or fearless of their ill renown plunged like one who is devildriven into the shadow of the crumbling walls and went with the carefulgroping of a man who follows some given direction to the northern end of the courtyard there directly between and below the two centermost windows which it may be looked forth from the chamber of forgotten chatelaines he pressed with his right foot on a flagstone differing from those about it in being of a triangular form and the flagstone moved and tilted beneath his foot revealing a flight of granite steps that went down into the earth then lighting a taper he had brought with him gerard descended the steps and the flagstone swung into place behind him on the morrow his betrothed eleanor des lys and all her bridal train waited vainly for him at the cathedral of vyones the principal town of averoigne where the wedding had been set and from that time his face was beheld by no man and no vaguest rumor of gerard de venteillon or of the fate that befell him has ever passed among the living such was the substance of the forbidden manuscript and thus it ended as i have said before there was no date nor was there anything to indicate by whom it had been written or how the knowledge of the happenings related had come into the writers possession but oddly enough it did not occur to me to doubt their veridity for a moment and the curiosity i had felt concerning the contents of the manuscript was now replaced by a burning desire a thousandfold more powerful more obsessive to know the ending of the story and to learn what gerard de venteillon had found when he descended the hidden steps in reading the tale it had of course occurred to me that the ruins of the chateau des faussesflammes described therein were the very same ruins i had seen that morning from my chamber window and pondering this i became more and more possessed by an insane fever by a frenetic unholy excitement returning the manuscript to the secret drawer i left the library and wandered for awhile in an aimless fashion about the corridors of the monastery chancing to meet there the same monk who had taken my horse in charge the previous evening i ventured to question him as discreetly and casually as i could regarding the ruins which were visible from the abbey windows he crossed himself and a frightened look came over his broad placid face at my query the ruins are those of the chateau des faussesflammes he replied for untold years men say they have been the haunt of unholy spirits of witches and demons and festivals not to be described or even named are held within their walls no weapon known to man no exorcism or holy water has ever prevailed against these demons many brave cavaliers and monks have disappeared amid the shadows of faussesflammes never to return and once it is told an abbot of perigon went thither to make war on the powers of evil but what befell him at the hands of the succubi is not known or conjectured some say that the demons are abominable hags whose bodies terminate in serpentine coils others that they are women of more than mortal beauty whose kisses are a diabolic delight that consumes the flesh of men with the fierceness of hellfire as for me i know not whether such tales are true but i should not care to venture within the walls of faussesflammes before he had finished speaking a resolve had sprung to life fullborn in my mind i felt that i must go to the chateau des faussesflammes and learn for myself if possible all that could be learned the impulse was immediate overwhehning ineluctable and even if i had so desired i could no more have fought against it than if i had been the victim of some sorcerers invultuation the proscription of the abbot hilaire the strange unfinished tale in the old manuscript the evil legendry at which the monk had now hinted all these it would seem should have served to frighten and deter me from such a resolve but on the contrary by some bizarre inversion of thought they seemed to conceal some delectable mystery to denote a hidden world of ineffable things of vague undreamable pleasures that set my brain on fire and made my pulses throb deliriously i did not know i could not conceive of what these pleasures would consist but in some mystical manner i was as sure of their ultimate reality as the abbot hilaire was sure of heaven i determined to go that very afternoon in the absence of hilaire who i felt instinctively might be suspicious of any such intention on my part and would surely be inimical toward its fulfillment my preparations were very simple i put in my pockets a small taper from my room and the heel of a loaf of bread from the refectory and making sure that a little dagger which i always carried was in its sheath i left the monastery forthwith meeting two of the brothers in the courtyard i told them i was going for a short walk in the neighboring woods they gave me a jovial pax vobiscum and went upon their way in the spirit of the words heading directly as i could for faussesflammes whose turrets were often lost behind the high and interlacing boughs i entered the forest there were no paths and often i was conpelled to brief detours and divagations by the thickness of the underbrush in my feverous hurry to reach the ruins it seemed hours before i came to the top of the hill which faussesflammes surmounted but probably it was little more than thirty minutes climbing the last declivity of the boulderstrewn slope i came suddenly within view of the chateau standing close at hand in the center of the level table which formed the summit trees had taken root in its brokendown walls and the ruinous gateway that gave on the courtyard was halfchoked by bushes brambles and nettleplants forcing my way through not without difficulty and with clothing that had suffered from the bramblethorns i went like gerard de venteillon in the old manuscript to the northern end of the court enormous evillooking weeds were rooted between the flagstones rearing their thick and fleshy leaves that had turned to dull sinister maroons and purples with the onset of autumn but i soon found the triangular flagstone indicated in the tale and without the slightest delay or hesitation i pressed upon it with my right foot a mad shiver a thrill of adventurous triumph that was mingled with something of trepidation leaped through me when the great flagstone tilted easily beneath my foot disclosing dark steps of granite even as in the story now for a moment the vaguely hinted horrors of the monkish legends became imminently real in my imagination and i paused before the black opening that was to engulf me eondering if some satanic spell had not drawn me thither to perils of unknown terror and inconceivable gravity only for a few instants however did i hesitate then the sense of peril faded the monkish horrors became a fantastic dream and the charm of things unformulable but ever closer at hand always more readily attainable tightened about me like the embrace of amorous arms i lit my taper i descended the stair and even as behind gerard de venteillon the triangular block of stone silently resumed its place in the paving of the court above me doubtless it was moved by some mechanism operable by a mans weight on one of the steps but i did not pause to consider its modus operandi or to wonder if there were any way by which it could be worked from beneath to permit my return there were perhaps a dozen steps terminating in a low narrow musty vault that was void of anything more substantial than ancient dustencumbered cobwebs at the end a small doorway admitted me to a second vault that differed from the first only in being larger and dustier i passed through several such vaults and then found myself in a long passage or tunnel half blocked in places by boulders or heaps of rubble that had fallen from the crumbling sides it was very damp and full of the noisome odor of stagnant waters and subterranean mold my feet splashed more than once in little pools aad drops fell upon me from above fetid and foul as if they had oozed from a charnel beyond the wavering circle of light that my taper maintained it seemed to me that the coils of dim and shadowy serpents slithered away in the darkness at my approach but i could not be sure whether they really were serpents or only the troubled and retreating shadows seen by an eye that was still unaccustomed to the gloom of the vaults rounding a sudden turn in the passage i saw the last thing i had dreamt of seeing the gleam of sunlight at what was apparently the tunnels end i scarcely know what i had expected to find but such an eventuation was somehow altogether unanticipated i hurried on in some confusion of thought and stumbled through the opening to find myself blinking in the full rays of the sun even before i had sufficiently recovered my wits and my eyesight to take note of the landscape before me i was struck by a strange circumstance though it had been early afternoon when i entered the vaults and though my passage through them could have been a matter of no more than a few minutes the sun was now nearing the horizon there was also a difference in its light which was both brighter and mellower than the sun i had seen above averoigne and the sky itself was intensely blue with no hint of autumnal pallor now with everincreasing stupefaction i stared about me and could find nothing familiar or even credible in the scene upon which i had emerged contrary to all reasonable expectation there was no semblance of the hill upon which faussesflammes stood or of the adjoining country but around me was a placid land of rolling meadows through which a goldengleaming river meandered toward a sea of deepest azure that was visible beyond the tops of laureltrees but there are no laureltrees in averoigne and the sea is hundreds of miles away judge then my complete confusion and dumbfoundment it was a scene of such loveliness as i have never before beheld the meadowgrass at my feet was softer and more lustrous than emerald velvet and was full of violets and manycolored asphodels the dark green of ilextrees was mirrored in the golden river and far away i saw the pale gleam of a marble acropolis on a low summit above the plain all things bore the aspect of a mild and clement spring that was verging upon an opulent summer i felt as if i had stepped into a land of classic myth of grecian legend and moment by moment all surprise all wonder as to how i could have come there was drowned in a sense of evergrowing ecstasy before the utter ineffable beauty of the landscape near by in a laurelgrove a white roof shone in the late rays of the sun i was drawn toward it by the same allurement only far more potent and urgent which i had felt on seeing the forbidden manuscript and the ruins of faussesflammes here i knew with an esoteric certainty was the culmination of my quest the reward of all my mad and perhaps impious curiosity as i entered the grove i heard laughter among the trees blending harmoniously with the low murmur of their leaves in a soft balmy wind i thought i saw vague forms that melted among the boles at my approach and once a shaggy goatlike creature with human head and body ran across my path as if in pursuit of a flying nymph in the heart of the grove i found a marble place with a portico of doric columns as i neared it i was greeted by two women in the costume of ancient slaves and though my greek is of the meagerest i found no difficulty in comprehending their speech which was of attic purity our mistress nycea awaits you they told me i could no longer marvel at anything but accepted my situation without question or surmise like one who resigns himself to the progress of some delightful dream probably i thought it was a dream and i was still lying in my bed at the monastery but never before had i been favored by nocturnal visions of such clarity and surpassing loveliness the interior of the palace was full of a luxury that verged upon the barbaric and which evidently belonged to the period of greek decadence with its intermingling of oriental influences i was led through a hallway gieaming with onyx and polished porphyry into an opulently furnished room where on a couch of gorgeous fabrics there reclined a woman of goddesslike beauty at sight of her i trembled from head to foot with the violence of a strange emotion i had heard of the sudden mad loves by which men are seized on beholding for the first time a certain face and form but never before had i experienced a passion of such intensity such allconsuming ardor as the one i conceived immediately for this woman indeed it seemed as if i had loved her for a long time without knowing that it was she whom i loved and without being able to identify the nature of my enotion or to orient the feeling in any manner she was not tall but was formed with exquisite voluptuous purity of line and contour her eyes were of a dark sapphire blue with molten depths into which the soul was fain to plunge as into the soft abysses of a summer ocean the curve of her lips was enigmatic a little mournful and gravely tender as the lips of an antique venus her hair brownish rather than blond fell over her neck and ears and forehead in delicious ripples confined by a plain fillet of silver in her expression there was a mixture of pride and voluptuousness of regal imperiousness and feminine yielding her moverneats were all as effortless and graceful as those of a serpent i knew you would come she murmured in the same softvoweled greek i had heard from the lips of her servants i have waited for you long but when you sought refuge from the storm in the abbey of perigon and saw the manuscript in the secret drawer i knew that the hour of your arrival was at hand ah you did not dream that the spell which drew you so irresistibly with such unaccountable potency was the spell of my beauty the magical allurement of my love who are you i queried i spoke readily in greek which would have surprised me greatly an hour before but now i was prepared to accept anything whatever no matter how fantastic or preposterous as part of the miraculous fortune the unbelievable adventure which had befallen me i am nycea she replied to my question i love you and the hospitality of my palace and of my arms is at your disposal need you know anything nore the slaves had disappeared i flung myself beside the couch and kissed the hand she ofered me pouring out protestations that were no doubt incoherent but were nevertheless full of an ardor that made her smile tenderly her hand was cool to my lips but the touch of it fired my passion i ventured to seat myself beside her on the couch and she did not deny my familiarity while a soft purple twilight began to fill the corners of the chamber we conversed happily saying over and over again all the sweet absurd litanies all the felicitous nothings that come instinctively to the lips of lovers she was incredibly soft in my arms and it seemed almost as if the completeness of her yielding was unhindered by the presence of bones in her lovely body the servants entered noiselessly lighting rich lamps of intricately carven gold and setting before us a meal of spicy meats of unknown savorous fruits and potent wines but i could eat little and while i drank i thirsted for the sweeter wine of nyceas mouth i do not know when we fell asleep but the evening had flown like an enchanted moment heavy with felicity i drifted off on a silken tide of drowsiness and the golden lamps and the face of nycea blurred in a blissful mist and were seen no more suddenly from the depths of a slumber beyond all dreams i found myself compelled into full wakefulness for an instant i did not even realize where i was still less what had aroused me then i heard a footfall in the open doorway of the room and peering across the sleeping head of nycea saw in the lamplight the abbot hilaire who had paused on the threshold a look of absolute horror was imprinted upon his face and as he caught sight of me he began to gibber in latin in tones where something of fear was blended with fanatical abhorrence and hatred i saw that he carried in his hands a large bottle and an aspergillus i felt sure that the bottle was full of holy water and of course divined the use for which it was intended looking at nycea i saw that she too was awake and knew that she was aware of the abbots presence she gave me a strange smile in which i read an affectionate pity mingled with the reassurance that a woman offers a frightened child do not fear for me she whispered foul vampire accursed lamia sheserpent of hell thundered the abbot suddenly as he crossed the threshold of the room raising the aspergillus aloft at the same moment nycea glided from the couch with an unbelievable swiftness of motion and vanished through an outer door that gave upon the forest of laurels her voice hovered in my ear seeming to come from an immense distance farewell for awhile christophe but have no fear you shall find me again if you are brave and patient as the words ended the holy water from the aspergillus fell on the floor of the chamber and on the couch where nycea had lain beside me there was a crash as of many thunders and the golden lamps went out in a darkness that seemed full of falling dust of raining fragments i lost all consciousness and when i recovered i found myself lying on a heap of rubble in one of the vaults i had traversed earlier in the day with a taper in his hand and an expression of great solicitude of infinite pity upon his face hilaire was stooping over me beside him lay the bottle and the dripping aspergillus i thank god my son that i found you in good time he said when i returned to the abbey this evening and learned that you were gone i surmised all that had happened i knew you had read the accursed manuscript in my absence and had fallen under its baleful spell as have so many others even to a certain reverend abbot one of my predecessors all of them alas beginning hundreds of years ago with gerard de venteillon have fallen victims to the lamia who dwells in these vaults the lamia i questioned hardly comprehending his words yes my son the beautiful nycea who lay in your arms this night is a lamia an ancient vampire who maintains in these noisome vaults her palace of beatific illusions how she came to take up her abode at faussesflammes is not known for her coming antedates the memory of men she is old as paganism the greeks knew her she was exorcised by apollonius of tyana and if you could behold her as she really is you would see in lieu of her voluptuous body the folds of a foul and monstrous serpent all those whom she loves and admits to her hospitality she devours in the end after she has drained them of life and vigor with the diabolic delight of her kisses the laurelwooded plain you saw the ilexbordered river the marble palace and all the luxury therein were no more than a satanic delusion a lovely bubble that rose from the dust and mold of immemorial death of ancient corruption they crumbled at the kiss of the holy water i brought with me when i followed you but nycea alas has escaped and i fear she will still survive to build again her palace of demoniacal enchantments to commit again and again the unspeakable abomination of her sins still in a sort of stupor at the ruin of my newfound happiness at the singular revelations made by the abbot i followed him obediently as he led the way through the vaults of faussesflammes he mounted the stairway by which i had descended and as he neared the top and was forced to stoop a little the great flagstone swung upward letting in a stream of chill moonlight we emerged and i permitted him to take me back to the monastery as my brain began to clear and the confusion into which i had been thrown resolved itself a feeling of resentment grew apace a keen anger at the interference of hilaire unheedful whether or not he had rescued me from dire physical and spiritual perils i lamented the beautiful dream of which he had deprived me the kisses of nycea burned softly in my memory and i knew that whatever she was woman or demon or serpent there was no one in all the world who could ever arouse in me the same love and the same delight i took care however to conceal my feellings fron hilaire realizing that a betrayal of such emotions would merely lead him to look upon me as a soul that was lost beyond redemption on the morrow pleading the urgency of my return home i departed from perigon now in the library of my fathers house near moulins i write this account of my adventures the memory of nycea is magically clear ineffably dear as if she were still beside me and still i see the rich draperies of a midnight chamber illumined by lamps of curiously carven gold and still i hear the words of her farewell have no fear you shall find me again if you are brave and patient soon i shall return to visit again the ruins of the chateau des faussesflammes and redescend into the vaults below the triangular flagstone but in spite of the nearness of perigon to faussesflammes in spite of my esteem for the abbot my gratitude for his hospitality and my admiration for his incomparable library i shall not care to revisit my friend hilaire
