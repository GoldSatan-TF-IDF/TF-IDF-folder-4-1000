part one the hammerton curse chapter one the girl struggled tried to fight off her rising panic as well as the man who held her but he pulled her back she swung wildly at him screaming her fear and frustration let go of me steve i want to look no he spoke firmly a silhouette against the starlight of a warm august night thats one thing im not going to allow you to do but he might still be alive her voice tailed off in a tremble of hopelessness she knew there was no way her father could still live in the same way that she had known that there could have been no hope for her brother justin when she had seen the photographs in the papers of his mangled burnedout car on the le mans track less than a month ago and now this lee hammerton did not try to break free now just accepted the inevitable and stared into the night until she was able to make out the shape of the huge baler a robot made by man stronger than man ruthless if it got out of control a hungry carnivorous beast if you underestimated it got in its way the machine was still running a clanking monster that seemed to be laughing in its own mechanical way grinding its teeth it had fed but still it was hungry he might not be in there she said weakly the tall fairhaired man sighed wished that he could tell a convincing lie but it was pointless the police and the doctor would be here any minute and then every detail would have to be revealed nobody would be able to hide anything no matter how gruesome lee would have to face the truth then hes in there steve kilby looked down at the girl even in shocked terror she was beautiful had a man wanting her no matter what the long dark hair was tangled her perfect features white and streaked with tears her bottom lip was bleeding where she had bitten it but you still wanted to kiss her to hold her close tell her that everything was going to be ok even though you knew it wasnt you didnt give a damn whether or not craig hammerton had been baled into a pulped bloody square of flesh and bone or not because his daughter still lived and that was all that mattered youd fake grief and make a good job of it for her sake clyde found him kilby was afraid she might slip his hold and go and see for herself theres no point in either of us looking wed better get back theres nothing we can do no defiant as always lee hammertons mind was made up she was staying a thought crossed her mind one that had her stomach knotting and brought on a desire to be violently sick im the boss now that daddys gone and justin too a millionairess i give the orders everybody else has to obey them kilby isnt just my lover nor my chief driver hes my servant clyde too all right well stay until the others get here kilby tried to edge her a yard or so back but she held her ground how could it have happened suddenly she felt calmer more logical daddy wasnt driving the baler he wouldnt want to anyway i dont know but accidents happen when you least expect them it sounded trite but if anybody mentioned suicide then it had to be the police i guess you father must have gone on a tour of inspection of his farms maybe wondering how the harvest had gone and he got curious and tinkered with the baler when there was nobody around they fell into an uneasy silence this was one night when they didnt want to be alone out here in the fields a late summer night that no longer smelted of honeysuckle and wild flowers just death a chill breeze had sprung up and kilby felt his flesh goosepimpling maybe it had been just an accident he couldnt think of any reason why craig hammerton would want to kill himself not with all his millions he felt embarrassed too because he couldnt think of anything to say to lee and maybe she was expecting him to say something after all he was her lover or was he there were rumours stories of other men in her life that hed shut his ears to she was in the driving seat right now she only had to snap her fingers and she could have what she wanted john clyde would write out the cheques and lee hammerton would sign them she didnt need money only what it bought the baler shuddered suddenly and cut out a faint whirring noise a propeller gradually losing its momentum then silence she clung to him tightly so that he could feel her breasts heaving small firm mounds of flesh that he had once fondled and kissed hallowed hammerton breasts that money couldnt buy its its the the curse again isnt it steve the hammerton curse her voice was a cracked whisper that he scarcely recognised thats silly talk a legend that has been embroidered over the years and no it isnt she looked up at him and he read the fear in her expression a terror that was eating deep into her my ancester jasper hammerton was killed in an almost identical accident two hundred years ago beheaded by a careless farmworker scything corn and in the same month his son was killed when his horse threw him and trampled him and his daughter edwina she began to sob dont think about them he kissed her forehead theyre dead and gone centuries ago and theres no way of knowing how they really died oh yes there is its all written down in the parish records you can read it for yourself in the church if you dont believe me and what about edwina kilby wished in the same second that he hadnt asked edwina got herself pregnant by the groom there was no mistaking the note of contempt in her voice and that was when mongrel blood infiltrated the hammerton line she died in childbirth but in her death throes she cursed the hammertons that future generations should experience the tragedies that they went through and my god steve she was right just look whats happened to us now kilby thought she was on the verge of hysteria wondered whether he ought to slap her and drag her forcibly from this field of violent death but even as he hesitated twin shafts of brilliant white light swung across the landscape focused on them like the principal actors in the final act of a tragic play held them for the audience to dwell upon their trauma kilby turned his head saw the closeset headlights of the old series i land rover more vehicles following on behind bumping their way across the uneven stubble heres clyde he said and added and the police too lee hammerton stood watching in a daze as the land rover and three cars came to a halt figures getting out the engines maybe left running purposely so that she wouldnt be able to hear what was being said john clyde was pointing towards the baler she knew what he was saying hes in there baled into a neat little square so that you wouldnt recognise what he was hell have to be scraped out she turned away retched shook off kilbys hand and he didnt clutch at her again she was the boss now and if she wanted to go across there and look nobody could stop her but she didnt want to look jesus it wasnt as though she and the old man were close if you looked at it realistically he had been a right bastard most of his life long before her mother had died fifteen years ago all hed ever thought about was women the flat slob and motorracing a kind of prestige symbol hed wanted to win the iroc and put the name of hammerton amongst the elite that way the women would fawn around him but he didnt have to go out there on the circuit and risk his neck instead he sent justin and now maybe kilby except that steve wasnt quite in that class lambs to the slaughter sacrifices to the hammerton idol oh christ it was bloody funny when you thought about it the great craig hammerton ignominiously sliced up and compressed into a chunk of unrecognisable raw meat going out as small as he had come into the world she hadnt loved him shed hated him feigned adoration because in the end she knew it would bring her what she had now and justin hadnt been any better she started to laugh aloud heard herself above the drone of the idling engines stop it lee recoiled almost lost her balance as the flat of steve kilbys hand hit her across the face damn you damn you steve kilby subconsciously she tasted blood in her mouth dont you ever dare touch me again for any reason the hands reaching out for her checked surprise on his face because he suddenly realised that she wasnt hysterical just coldly ruthless even the fear in her eyes was temporarily gone replaced by a fury that had him backing off im sorry i he licked his lips glanced away and saw a number of figures had clambered up onto the stationary baler if i want to laugh ill bloody well laugh she spoke softly words that were loaded with venom yet barely audible youve had it too easy steve and from this moment on there are going to be a number of changes around here and dont go pushing your luck im going to win the iroc not because craig hammerton would have wanted it that way but because thats the way i want it and remember youre a driver not the driver ill find the man i want to win the championship you mark my words now im going back to the house its well past midnight and i need my sleep tell clyde im not to be disturbed until morning steve kilby stood and watched her walk away until she was lost in the darkness beyond the glare of the headlights now it was his turn to feel the nausea rising up in him and not just because of what had happened to craig hammerton in those few moments lee hammerton had undergone a frightening change almost as though the girl whose bed he had shared had died alongside her father in the baler and a reincarnation had materialised in her shapely body without any physical change and now it was steve kilbys turn to experience fear a mounting inexplicable terror that was eating into him like a fastgrowing cancer it had suddenly gone very cold and he shivered chapter two slade had not exceeded thirtyfive mph for the last ten miles even on the wide straight stretches of country roads the heather a deep purple in the sunshine his foot pressure did not increase on the throttle a steady trundling an articulated foden overtook him a gesture of impatience on the part of its driver as he cut in abruptly forcing slade to drop down to thirty the lorry picked up speed forging ahead slade kept the cortina at thirty no incentive to move back up to thirtyfive again his lean suntanned face beneath the twoweekold growth of beard was expressionless vacant short cropped hair a hand habitually left the steering wheel and brushed away nonexistent strands that had once hung below his collar an aggravation at times but fashionable everything had had to be fashionable up until recently casual clothing that all went to create the image a personality that required a certain amount of uniformity which was at once recognisable and acceptable in a harsh world of glamour one pandered to the media to the public presented oneself in accordance with their ideas heroworship somebody they could identify with film stars television personalities footballers racing drivers a faint smile momentarily crossed mark slades features but it was mirthless irony perhaps maybe a touch of regret right now he did not even understand his own feelings an instinct beyond his comprehension urged him to blend himself into the jungle of convention that existed around him the majority of his fellow beings accepted a routine mundane existence they did things because they had to because they were forced to do so in order to survive a mode of life totally in contrast to the inner personality of every individual but they overcame it by a submergence an acceptance or perhaps by fantasy that would never materialise into reality occasionally the odd one made the effort to climb out of the rut a brief show of some previously hidden talent perched precariously on a pedestal above their fellows some made it remained there if only for a brief spell then toppled back clinging to a few precious memories fantasies again dreaming of what might have been slade understood better than most hed made it right to the top almost second placing in the international race of champions at daytona beaten by half a length he was tipped to win it next time a world champion on the verge of greatness a man alone standing out above millions an idol but there would be no next time a kind of suicide driving back into the world of convention from which he had risen a total reversal his thoughts turned to the chevy camaros gutted and rebuilt according to individual specifications tuned for speeds of mph perhaps more stockcar and indianapolis drivers claiming supremacy over their grand prix rivals equally matched in formula one racing fighting it out for the number one placing not just for money either but for something that meant a great deal more to the one who finished first slade knew he could have done it next time except with an effort he pushed all thoughts of formula one from his mind somehow he had to get it all out of his system in the same way that an alcoholic would refuse a halfpint of shandy fighting every inch of the way an inveterate smoker tossing a packet of cigarettes into a litter bin steeling himself to walk on past the nearest tobacconists shop slade compromised somehow he had to divorce himself from cars the cortina presented him with the ideal opportunity to make a start he pressed down on the seatadjustment lever pushing against the backrest with his powerful shoulders with some reluctance the seat slid back to the furthest notch the controls were still well within his reach but not comfortably that meant that he would continue to drive steadily instead of hunching over the wheel and succumbing to instincts which even a man who has lost his nerve on the track cannot entirely suppress a lazy pose that defied speed thirty mph constant three cars and another lorry overtook him he sensed their annoyance at his own performance impatience muttered curses he smiled to himself it was going to be a long process but he would make it all the way back to the very bottom just another motorist cluttering up the overcrowded roads or staying at home like a hermit the choice was his the cortina totally in contrast to everything which he had driven for the past five years a xl estate power a status symbol to the average man who had not quite made it to the jag or mercedes faction another step up the social ladder for some but several rungs down for slade a lumbering giant the way he was driving it three years old miles on the clock some rust on the sills a broken windowwinder a rip in the upholstery on the back seat the pistons were knocking a bit he didnt give a damn he hated cars he kept on silently reminding himself of that fact he slowed down still further moved over to the middle of the road and turned right by an impressive looking hotel subconsciously noticing the sign on the adjacent car park which requested patrons to park prettily the phrase appealed to his declining sense of humour so starkly removed from circuit regulations a request not an order the car shuddered still in top gear that pleased him even more a sure sign that he was returning to the realm of the average motorist he should have changed down into third maybe second the omission had been deliberate although he refused to admit it parked cars some two or three feet from the kerb as he took the road on the right lack of forethought and consideration for other motorists he would become like that eventually too the narrow winding road headed out into remote countryside thickly wooded hills on either side he took a fork to the left now the roads were narrower snaking bends and twice he had to pull well over to the left in order to avoid oncoming cattletrucks more shuddering the engine labouring and as the lanes began to rise sharply he was forced down into second gear high hedges obscured his view on either side not that he was interested in panoramic scenery mark slade wasnt interested in anything in particular the lanes narrowed still more and he was compelled to remain in second gear no room for oncoming vehicles to pass he remembered those two trucks the speed at which they had been travelling blind bends a clammy hand wiped the sweat from his forehead one thing was a certainty he had lost his nerve all right daytona or out here it was all the same on through a small village halftimbered houses many in need of restoration a brook rushing down the side of the road houses on one side a hedge fields hills on the other the muddy lane rose even more sharply once he was clear of this place of semiprimitive civilisation life was all so easy for some people sheep a few crops nothing else boredom but they accepted it something which he would have to learn to do also a nasty s bend in the midst of a massive larch forest he took it at ten mph his training had taught him to go into a bend slowly and come out of it fast he simply drove slowly to hell with techniques they counted for nothing up here down past a couple of farms the lane following a course between two barns rising even more sharply now he engaged bottom gear he could see over the hedges in places through gaps in others golden fields led up to the lush dark green of forestry commission plantations stocked corn so beautifully primitive these lanes were not wide enough to admit a combineharvester anyway he wondered how long it would remain that way before some progressminded councillor put forward roadwidening schemes the lane had levelled out now a towering forest on his right an unrestricted view of distant mountain peaks beyond the valley on his left a perfect blend of green purple and brown offset by infrequent patches of golden stubble life could be very good up here once one adapted that was the only problem to slade it presented even greater difficulties than winning the iroc he was determined to make it somehow though then he saw his own place standing on a kind of crossroads the way he had come the road leading down to the nearest village straight ahead a left turn that headed somewhere in the direction of those distant mountains and a rough unsurfaced track on the right up into the forestry crossways mark slade was certainly at a crossroads once it had been a farmworkers cottage probably before that it had been a barn or a stable various extensions and renovations by the previous owner had transformed it into what the estate agent had described as a cottage residence of exquisite beauty with panoramic views low ceilings oak beams recently whitewashed exterior walls and a quarter of an acre of triangularshaped garden the latter in need of some attention mark slade had already contemplated taking up gardening the idea did not appeal but nevertheless it was yet another challenge of the right kind escapism he did not drive straight into the leanto garage but instead left the cortina parked on the adjacent forestry track in the three weeks during which he had sampled life as a recluse here he had never known a vehicle to use that route two or three a day maybe on the surfaced roads mostly tractors and land rovers to and from the farms lower down as he switched off the engine he heard for the first time the mechanical whirring and clanking sound slowing down then dying away his experience located the source of the trouble at once the heater fan was on the verge of packing up good chevy camaros designed for formula one did not have heaters anything the slightest thing which was in contrast to his former life pleased him especially this clappedout cortina it was as he was fitting his key into the front door that he heard the telephone ringing inside the house the unexpected harsh jangling caused him to stiffen momentarily telephones too had been a large part of his world of socalled glamour this one was already installed when he had moved in he should have instructed the gpo engineers to disconnect it anyway who the hell knew he was living here he had taken steps to fade into obscurity his name certainly wouldnt be in the directory the lock was stiff or maybe it was the key that was bent it took him a couple of minutes to gain entry and just as he closed the door behind him the phone stopped ringing a sigh of relief mingled with natural curiosity he shrugged his shoulders probably it was somebody trying to contact the last owner if so they would ring again he dismissed the matter from his mind there were chores to be done fires had to be made and lit food prepared rooms cleaned all foreign to his nature but hed learn the hard way he would not seek help from anybody if it was offered he would spurn it politely at first of course but it had to be a lone battle all the way every house every man needs a woman he tried to find an alternative to that one as he filled a glass with water from the tap in the sink reached down a small brown bottle from the shelf above shook out a tiny yellow tablet and swallowed it valium three times a day possibly a third of the population existed on them their reasons overwork family and business pressures something to help ease a routine of boredom at least those were the reasons slade had given the doctor hell how else could he have explained it fact is doc ive just lost my nerve cant face the track again he knew it but he would never be able to put it into words few people admit to losing their nerve over anything even to themselves a steeplejack takes a motorway construction labouring job and tells everybody that its because he earns more money that way the only person he doesnt succeed in kidding is himself hell never do that he fears that one day hell step off a piece of scaffolding and drop seventy feet to the concrete below likewise slade had lied to stern his manager seamark too all lies my contract finished at daytona ive made my pile ill never spend it if i live it up for the rest of my days thats why im quitting persuasion pleading cursing illfeeling on both sides but they still wanted him back he hadnt the guts to tell them that before every race he was scared that it might be his last he had seen better drivers than himself burned to a cinder in a heap of crumpled twisted metal cremated within a matter of minutes rescueteams and ambulancemen helpless christ he might not even make it to the finals at daytona it could happen in the qualifying rounds at riverside or even on the seamark circuit anywhere these lanes a speeding land rover all over in seconds god he hated cars even that bloody runofthemill cortina he studied his reflection in the mirror on the kitchen wall stroking his new growth of dark beard amazed to note flecks of grey already evident amongst the stubble thirtythree according to the socalled allotted life span of three score years and ten he was practically halfway there middleaged he hadnt thought of it that way before and so far he hadnt started to live well this was it the beginning of life right here in these remote hills the beard the cropped hair a new approach fresh thinking new ideals that all added up to one thing mark slade racing idol was dead in his place was just an ordinary guy whom people in the streets would scarcely glance at a second time that was the way it would be from now on he might even change his name by deedpoll he settled for a scratch meal of corned beef and baked beans sometime he would have to learn to cook property the idea was not attractive to him but his determination would overcome it perhaps it was something else at which he would eventually attempt to attain perfection cordon bleu another daytona the ultimate something more to chicken out of when it was within his reach as he ate his thoughts turned to yvonne he knew he would never be able to get her off his mind ever that was the way with racing drivers another occupational hazard one got through wives like sets of tyres they couldnt stand the pace husbands away from home for long periods other women fawning on their idols temptations on both sides yvonne had never taken a lover whilst mark had been away perhaps it would have been better if she had there was no way of knowing ah too often fidelity does not make a marriage work slade had had other women though zoe in the states had given him everything that his physical needs demanded she would not have made the marital grade though he wouldnt have wanted her anyway his gaze rested on the framed photograph which stood on the oak welshdresser yvonne was twentythree then she hadnt changed any not since the last time he had seen her eleven months ago that was when she had presented him with the ultimatum quit racing or else he couldnt make up his mind then two loves and he had had to make his choice yvonne or daytona maybe he hadnt taken her seriously when he returned to england it was too late she knew all about his affair with zoe and she had put the wheels of divorce proceedings into action right away no real animosity just a woman who had been hurt deeper than she could stand hell if only hed lost his nerve earlier at least hed still have a wife the divorce had gone through all too easy these days time was not on his side shed never disclosed how she had learned about his adultery but slade had his own ideas that bastard stern seamark too they wanted the iroc it would put seamark cruises on the map and to hell with slade hed get his cut but only a fraction in comparison with theirs probably that was his only small crumb of satisfaction from opting out sure theyd find another driver but not of slades calibre they had until february to sort it out it was almost worth a visit to the states to watch them lose maybe not even qualify at riverside hell no he wasnt going to go near a circuit again it was all over he had phoned yvonne once and told her that he was thinking of quitting it was too late though she had somebody else a widower a bank manager ten years older than herself but she also had something which she had never ever had before security no more weeks months of loneliness no more wondering whether or not her husband would come out of each race alive trembling every time she watched the television rushing to the telephone with anxiety in her heart every time it rang slade was bitter but he hoped that she would make a go of it that was the very least he owed her he didnt hate the banker he just envied him the day dragged on there were chores to be done but they could wait until the morrow or the day after he had all the time in the world now each evening he went and stood in the small conservatory which faced west from here he had an unrestricted view of the distant mountains a setting sun was something comparatively new to him he had overlooked it for thirtythree years taking the elements for granted his only concern being the condition of the track before a race he hated rain more than anything else it was a killer he would never be able to regard it as anything else even up here it depressed him yet the magnificent splendour of those mountain sunsets enthralled him something so big something beyond the control of mankind an aura of beauty a hint of power that was far greater than either stern or seamark the latter with his multimillion backed company was just as other mortals when it came to the crunch out here they were nothing these farmers were real men learning to live with the wind in their teeth slade stood with the conservatory door open breathing in the freshness of the mountain air filling his lungs expelling it slowly something else which he had missed out on so natural so different from the tearing whipping winds on a racetrack the sun sank lower and lower soon it would be hidden behind the nearest range of peaks already one or two stars were beginning to twinkle in the cloudless sky dusk came so gradually out here one scarcely noticed it until it was almost dark especially a man who had turned his back on an artificial world where neonlighting predominated slade thought of las vegas night or day it made no difference there a place to which he vowed he would never return that had been zoes home he wondered whether she would have appreciated it out here more than likely not she hadnt that kind of grit a steady droning sound from all around these hillfarmers worked a natural day dawn till dusk they were still harvesting taking advantage of the current spell of fine weather tomorrow it might rain slade hoped that it would not perhaps when he had lived here long enough he would be able to read the weather signs in the sky the way these locals did this was just the beginning of his new life darkness fell and still he stood there no longer was he able to discern the distant mountains the hum of tractors ceased the day was over a scent assailed his nostrils which at first he was unable to recognise it was vaguely familiar finally he realised what it was woodsmoke drifing up from the valley on the evening breeze pine logs no centralheating systems here he had taken a step back in time too then came the silence not even the sound of a tractor and trailer on its way home twinkling lights from isolated farms and cottages scattered in this area of borderland slade was reluctant to go back inside the house the atmosphere was much colder now perhaps there would be a slight frost yet it did not even cause him to shiver it was all so fresh and wonderful the opening up of a new existence the telephone rang again with harsh reality reminding him that even out here connections with the world from which he had fled were not totally severed it continued to ring his first inclination was to ignore it more than likely it was the previous caller trying again slade had no idea where the former owner of crossways lived now he did not care it would be pointless answering the call on the other hand whoever it was would pester him with further calls until he answered it with a sigh of regret he went back inside closed the door and lifted the receiver slade the voice distorted by distance and mountain telephone cables was only too recognisable slade tensed every nerve in his body tautening stern there was a harsh note of unwelcome in the former racing drivers tone a tightening of his lips an urge to slam the receiver back on its cradle yet curiosity prevailed he knew only too well what seamarks racingteam manager wanted but he felt himself compelled to listen a last throw on seamarks part more harsh words and then it would all be over for good in no way would mark slade ever return to the circuits i rang earlier a hint of annoyance presumption stern had always expected everyone to jump to his immediate command almost as though slade should have sat by the telephone in anticipation no the implication was that the driver should have made the call in the first place how the hell did you find me i made enquiries slade let it pass stern would not reveal the source of his information it was pointless pursuing the matter i heard the phone ringing slade seized upon the earliest opportunity to provoke the other i just let it ring thats my policy now im going to contact the engineers tomorrow get em to take it out i dont need it ive no calls to make and i dont anticipate receiving any either youre bloody crazy mark thats my privilege slade was tempted to slam the receiver down there was no point though stern would only ring again persistently he was another like slade himself who never gave up never took no for an answer well this was one time he would have to daytona is only next february the riverside rounds begin in january there isnt much time so what what dyou mean so what you cant lay off much longer mark youve got to get behind the wheel again pretty quick martin tested a car yesterday a chevy tuned to the specifications laid down he clocked we can do it this time mark no doubt about that let martin drive at daytona then dont be fucking stupid hes fine on a testrun no competition experience though well start training him hes got the makings of a topclass iroc driver we dont bloody well want martin to drive at daytona there isnt time anyway he hasnt the experience maybe not the nerve when it comes to the real thing mark slade sighed audibly when would everybody stop talking about nerve he contemplated telling stern the truth changed his mind no hed taken his last bow in his own way conned everybody ive made my pile to hell with that your contract my contract ended with seamark the moment i crossed the finishing line at daytona last year you know that as well as i do same goes for all the perks ive put paid to the aftershave advert by growing some facefungus let me finish will you stern was becoming angry there was also a note of frustration in his voice slade enjoyed that he could visualise the others pencilline moustache twitching uneven teeth scraping the lower lip the way it always did when stern failed to get his own way he fawned on seamark and that gave him a sense of power basically that was what it was all about power theres nothing more to say ive said it all take it or leave it just listen damn you harsh abrupt an order but still slade did not replace the receiver we know your contract ended at daytona last year weve drawn up a new one a hundred and fifty grand two hundred if you win seamarks already signed it it only needs your signature sorry nothing doing i wouldnt be interested if it was a million like ive already said ive made my bread so youd better start training martin up youve got to i dont have to do anything any more that i dont want to well sue you now youre really talking crap youve got no comeback on me youll drive at daytona no chance ok so youve made your pile a sudden change of attitude forced tact an attempt at persuasion stern fawned on seamark now he was trying it on slade seamarks been good to you mark a hell of a lot better than most sponsors without them you could still be just testing i reckon you owe it to us i owe you nothing stern nor seamark just the reverse seamark cruises owes me something that they can never repay oh yeah and whats that a wife the best woman i ever had a pause pregnant silence you know how fickle women are mark as well as i do a faint sigh from stern ive had two wives leave me personally i dont want another but thats no reason to chuck the sponge in win the international race of champions at daytona and you can have the pick of the women in almost any country in the world damn it man one womans much the same as another that was when mark slade finally slammed the receiver down anger seethed inside him then came to the boil as his gaze rested once more on that photograph on the welshdresser a fit of frenzy seized him his hands closed over the nearest object a bulky telephone directory his arm went back then forward flinging the heavy book with all his force at the opposite wall a dull thud he stood there trembling seamark stern he wondered if he would ever be able to push them out of his life demanding enticing the one lure money everything revolved around money it bought power except yvonne she was the only person who could not be bought not even seamark cruises with all its subsidiary companies could get her back for him he calmed down somewhat switched out the light and stretched himself out on the sofa sleep would not come easily tonight there was little point in bothering to go upstairs to bed chapter three it was well after ten oclock the following morning when mark slade awoke his limbs ached after a night spent in a cramped position on the sofa his head throbbed his neck was stiff and there was a sour taste in his mouth sunlight streamed in through the latticed windows he made no attempt to rise there was nothing to get up for anyway from now onwards one day would be much the same as another sometimes it would be sunny sometimes it would rain that was the only difference yet this was what he had sought and he was not prepared to discard it it was all a matter of adjustment it would take time it was midday before he finally roused himself went through to the kitchen and performed a few perfunctory ablutions his headache persisted the kind which one awoke with and endured for the remainder of the day he stepped outside and stood looking at the scenery again sheer magnificence it had a kind of hypnotic effect upon him as though he could stand and view it day after day for the rest of his life without tiring the steady hum of distant tractors providing soothing background music like a documentary film on television without the accompaniment of a human voice he remembered that the cortina was still parked on the forestry road the thought of driving it into the garage did not appeal to him it could stay there until he needed it again or somebody requested him to move it he envied those farmers on their tractors no speed no competitive atmosphere they probably assisted each other with mechanical repairs when one of the machines broke down that spirit did not exist in the racing world it never had and it never would it was every man for himself worse a dogeatdog attitude survival of the fittest he turned his attention to the garden it would need tidying up before the winter set in there were some tools in the shed at the bottom of his land where the apex of the triangle terminated in a halfgrown scots pine a tree that had weathered a decade of winters it would still be there in three or four decades time bigger stronger slade wondered where he would be then the idea of winter appealed to him the snow would drift up in these hills blocking the narrow lanes perhaps for weeks at a time total isolation even seamark and stern would not be able to reach him then today he would give instructions for the disconnection of the telephone his headache had subsided a little by the time he went back indoors he boiled the kettle and made some coffee hot and black the way he had always been used to it little things like that would remain unchanged he could do just as he liked he felt more at peace with the world now than he could ever remember he decided it would work out after all no effort would be needed just drift let everything sort itself out the telephone rang slade tensed his fingers tightening around the mug of coffee threatening to crush the pottery the harsh jangling continued stern or seamark probably the latter he decided they wouldnt give up he crossed the room carrying the coffee in one hand ignored the incessant ringing stepped outside and closed the door behind him the noise which had disturbed his pleasant reverie was muffled now he walked on down the narrow path and stopped only when he was beyond the patch of soft fruit bushes a partially rotted rustic garden seat was set back on some broken paving slabs slade wondered if it would bear his weight hesitantly he lowered his body onto it it creaked and swayed slightly but held he sighed sipped his coffee and looked across at the mountains again only the hum of tractors came to his ears he sensed that the phone was still ringing but he could not hear it that was all that mattered the sun was well past its zenith moving slowly towards those western mountain peaks it was too late to make a start on the garden now the cortina was still blocking the rough road leading up to the forestry commission plantations but there was always tomorrow slade decided that that was a philosophy which he must adopt never do today what can be done tomorrow a total contrast to everything which he had known hitherto no scurrying no mechanics working throughout the nocturnal hours in order to complete a specification to meet a deadline he stayed there until dusk even then reluctant to go inside again the total silence returned a few lights appeared in the distance at last he retraced his steps in the direction of the conservatory a feeling engulfed him which he could not at first determine it had been creeping up on him this last hour fear of what he paused and thought about it then he realised what it was nothing to do with cars or racing not directly anyway it was a kind of terror that emanated from one single invention of rapid communication the telephone alexander graham bell had inflicted a curse upon certain people slade was one of them he knew it would ring again he should have phoned the engineers and insisted upon an immediate disconnection already he was practising his chosen philosophy tomorrow would do hell this was one task that should have been done today but it was too late now tomorrow definitely pm the telephone rang again this time he did not even tense it was almost a relief to hear it ignore it five minutes later it was still ringing maybe if he lifted the receiver replaced it then took it off altogether it would solve his problem so easy he wondered why he had not thought of it before he stood up something caught his eye that photograph a faint hope flickered within him no it couldnt be even if yvonne had heard of his decision changed her mind she wouldnt know where to contact him unless seamark had worked on her and was using her no she couldnt be bought at any price nevertheless slade yielded to the persistent ringing curiosity now predominating his hand reached out closed over the receiver but did not lift it immediately he had never cursed seamark in his life few men had dared a faint smile mentally he consulted his vocabulary of fourlettered words he would use them all a spate of the foulest language tell him what a bastard he was hed make mister big himself ring off victory mark slade smiled he wished that he had not delayed he could have settled it hours ago this way he lifted the receiver mark slade there are times in the life of every man however determined or verbose when he finds himself at a total loss for words this was one of them slade had braced himself for the thick nasal tones of seamark his reply was building up in his own vocal chords ready to insult the multimillionaire cutting off the first demand in midsentence instead he heard the soft cultured sound of a female voice and it most certainly was not yvonne on the other end of the line husky sophisticated he caught his breath dispelled his prepared speech sought vainly for another to replace it mark slade yes speaking he sensed already that he was at a disadvantage the element of surprise had caught him off his guard scores of women used to phone his hampstead flat mostly teenage fans the sound of his voice temporarily satisfying their quest for idol worship many rang again more mature women had ulterior motives in contacting him that was the part yvonne had hated most now it was beginning all over again my name is lee hammerton im sorry if ive called at an inopportune moment i tried to ring earlier in the day but there was no reply oh thats all right i wasnt doing anything in particular he realised subconsciously that he was already pandering to her his mind was confused dazed by the unexpectedness of it all lee hammerton the name was familiar he should have known somewhere in racing circles damn racing all the same i dont know if my name is familiar to you possibly you knew of my late father craig hammerton it clicked two years ago one of the only unsponsored british teams riverside they hadnt qualified neither machine nor driver had been quite up to standard good but not good enough hammertons son had been at the wheel there had been some trouble a few months afterwards hammerton junior had been mixed up in some kind of scandal drugs slade couldnt recall the details the son had tried to get back into formula one racing hed been killed in an accident at le mans recently the old man a horrific farming accident he remembered the newspaper headlines fortunately slade had a good memory vague recollections just at this moment though trying to piece them together are you still there oh er yes sorry i was just trying to place you i remember your father and he checked himself just in time and my brother she went on justin a frameup and a terrible tragedy but thats not what i rang you about i heard youd quit the seamark team ive quit racing thats why im living out here oh shock and disappointment i i didnt realise how did you find me it wasnt easy youre the second caller ive had in two days im having the phone taken out tomorrow it was as well that i called you tonight then wasnt it she laughed softly a sound that somehow reminded him of yvonne perhaps that was the reason he did not bring the conversation to a close and replace the receiver he had no intention of discussing motorracing neither did he want another woman in his life not yet anyway ive quit he repeated for good make it plain here and now no compromises im sorry im not a slight pause slade still wondered why she had rung he knew that he could not hang up until he had discovered her reason maybe it was a putup job seamark using a woman to get through to him im entered at riverside in january slade checked the retort which rose instantaneously hell she had to be crazy motorracing was no place for women instead he said continuing where your father left off eh thats right or more to the point where justin left off i owe him that the very least i owe him i admire you for it in other words you think im crazy mark she lapsed into using his first name as though she had known him all his life they had never even met vaguely he remembered once having seen a photograph of her in a magazine he could not recall the particular publication an american one certainly a group standing around a car hammertons car she had caught his eye he could not remember exactly what she looked like attractive certainly it was slowly coming back to him he reminded himself once again that he was finished with both cars and women i didnt say that no but you thought it you dont realise what youre taking on building up hopes then having them dashed theres no glory in alsorans you lose money too ive got it to lose apart from the cash you need a topclass driver with formula one experience you can rule me out you also need mechanics capable of carrying out the iroc specifications tuning the engine up to speeds of mph plus the seamark team reckon they can top that frank wylies as good a mechanic as any youll find ive taken on another guy too no doubt you know him chris fogg the hell you have mark slade was unable to contain his surprise a seamark man another testdriver who might given the opportunity make it to the top might he was good enough but lacked certain qualities determination for one fogg had been with slade at daytona last year now he was with lee hammerton stern hadnt mentioned anything about that maybe he didnt consider it important his main task being to get slade back slade wondered again whether this was all part of some intricate plot on the part of seamark to get him back to the circuits no possibility could be ruled out all the same his curiosity had to be satisfied so if i dont drive for you fogg will eh no hell work in the pits there isnt time to prepare him for riverside if you wont drive for me itll have to be steve kilby hes good hes got a house full of trophies maybe but that wont count for much when it comes to riverside you cant compare this type of racing with silverstone or mallory youre putting the ball in your own court mark i know you could win for me so do you the hell i could slade sweated at the idea already too much was coming back to him the roar of bunching cars the smell of oil smouldering rubber all adding up to one thing in his mind fear sorry lee he was surprised at the ease with which he too resorted to familiarity nothing doing im sorry but thats the way it is ill never drive again the money will be better than seamarks money doesnt bother me any more nor a chance to beat seamark he hesitated i dont give a damn for seamark whether they win or lose is immaterial to me i wish you luck though and luck does play a large part in it by the way why did chris fogg quit the seamark team thats not really for me to say i wish you hadnt asked then let me tell you he didnt want to be part of certain things which were going on things that go on in one helluva tot of teams only theyre a hundred times worse at seamark you said it not me right enough but ive yet to find a team thats one hundred per cent on the level money and power breed corruption you wont change your mind no im sorry im not racing again by the way you still havent told me how you found me i dont think its really that important is it no i guess not really as he hung up slades eyes focused on the photograph of yvonne a thought crossed his mind he asked himself a question no there couldnt be any tieup two totally different types he decided to go upstairs to bed the sofa was too cramped and suddenly he realised that he needed an awful lot of sleep something else he had to catch up on tomorrow he would do something about getting that phone taken out another bright clear day slade awoke earlier than on the previous morning and a glance at his watch showed him that it was just after eight oclock he felt totally relaxed refreshed a comparatively new experience for him he was adapting faster than he had anticipated the slight headache which had plagued him yesterday was gone too he contemplated a liein there was nothing to get up for he changed his mind it would be a sure way to bring the headache back again he sat up then swung his legs to the floor the cool of the early morning was invigorating to his naked body he never slept in pyjamas that was akin to going to bed in a suit in his opinion slowly he dressed then went downstairs and made some coffee somehow this morning everything seemed different it was hard to define an enthusiasm but for what there was nothing that needed to be done urgently except to instruct the disconnection of the telephone of course that must be treated as a priority his train of thought led to lee hammerton an unsolved mystery vague recollections of a photograph in an old magazine he had a feeling that there was a deeper reason behind her telephone call in that case it was something that he would never learn stern was right in what he had said one got through wives like sets of tyres a harsh comparison but it was true he admired lee hammerton for what she was doing an awful lot of people would not take kindly to an unsponsored team especially one owned by a female she probably wouldnt even make her mark at riverside seamark would qualify somehow a combination of cash and a top driver they wouldnt chance it with martin they had the money to lure the best another mark slade another puppet nothing would have pleased slade more than to learn that this hammerton girls car had finished ahead of seamarks just wishful thinking though there was no way slade wouldnt drive for her not at any price he had made his decision and he wasnt going back on it he couldnt his ability had gone with his nerve it wouldnt be fair to either her or to himself there would be nothing more that seamark and stern would like better than to see him come in last at riverside in the hammerton car sheer degradation it had always been his intention even in the early days to quit if he ever got to the very top go out on the crest of the wave take his title with him too many tried to carry on it was hard getting to the peak but a damned sight harder staying there slades was a sort of compromise a nearmiss people would forget him they wouldnt remember him for his decline the crumbling of a fallen idol he wondered if yvonne still thought about him she was bound to but in a neutral sort of way a guy i once knew was married to slade went outside he had not wished to succumb to nostalgia the air was cold in his lungs like an iced drink swigged too hastily he decided to make a start on the garden maybe there was a sickle in the shed or even a pair of shears with which he could attack that bed of nettles beyond the soft fruit tractors were humming in the distance he paused halfway down the narrow path just standing listening a symphony a rural orchestra yet something spoiled the harmony an engine powerful some distance away but coming closer all the time louder faster no tractor certainly he altered course and stood at the small gate in the uncut hawthorn hedge from here he had a view of the valley below the lanes twisting narrowing a car in the clear atmosphere he could see it plainly although it was still a mile or so away an alfa romeo nothing remarkable about that except that it seemed so out of place up here a range rover belonging to one of the wealthier lowland farmers perhaps visiting a less fortunate relative in the hills would not have aroused slades curiosity yet it wasnt just the car it was the way it was being driven recklessly with no regard for bends nor the possibility of an oncoming vehicle shining red metal power of another sort wealth too a couple of farmworkers paused in their task of loading stocks of corn onto a decrepit trailer and stared after the speeding vehicle with a curious intentness an intruder closer now lost to sight for a brief moment where the road dipped down into a hollow then it was on the last straight stretch which led directly towards crossways slade watched a sudden premonition creeping over him judging by that reckless hillclimb the driver should be accelerating now taking advantage of a stretch of unrestricted vision perhaps touching sixty or seventy then using the gears to slow down on the approach to the crossroads instead the alfa romeo was slowing right down the wheels came to a standstill directly opposite the gate in the hedge and for the first time mark slade was afforded a view of the driver a woman her searching glance flicked over his place took it all in a fleeting expression of amazement then alighted on himself they looked at each other in silence recognition was mutual instantaneous even though they had never met before photographs in magazines his frequently hers once only dark hair immaculately groomed in spite of her fast driving features that were almost perfection freckles in spite of the darkness of her complexion he noted a quality of determination endurance in her shapely figure effortless unthinking adjustment to every movement as she emerged gracefully from the car allowing the door to swing shut quietly behind her a firm tapering chin an air of habitual alterness a part of everything that comprised lee hammerton she walked towards him her posture relaxed and almost lazy yet with a quiet confidence that did not go unnoticed a sudden chill ran through mark slades body and it had nothing whatever to do with the cold mountain air for once he realised that he was at a disadvantage a situation which had seldom occurred throughout his illustrious career something which he had also sensed during their telephone conversation a tightfitting dark blue sweater displayed her bosom far more provocatively than a lowcut dress could have done levis showed off her shapely hips only the rickety gate separated them she extended a hand long slim fingers mark slade the same husky voice cultured pregnant with confidence her grip was firm lee hammerton slades voice seemed to come from afar a slight tremor of nervousness in it which he hoped she had not noticed if she did she gave no sign you shouldnt have come here shouldnt i eyebrows raised half mocking him visitors barred are they im surprised you havent started digging a moat around your mountain refuge a drawbridge permanently raised im sorry he apologised instinctively sensing that he had to its just that well i told you last night you were wasting your time ive quit racing for good thats final theres no question of going back youre jumping to conclusions she laughed softly as he dragged the gate back and stood to one side i accept your decision regrettable as it may be nevertheless ive driven hard and fast up from hertfordshire without a stop i hope i havent disturbed your plans for the day i had no plans he replied those nettles could wait she followed him into the house i could use some coffee she seated herself on the sofa leaning back her legs stretched out in front of her sure he switched on the kettle ive only dried milk to offer you i usually drink my coffee black so do i she watched his every movement he placed a steaming cup on the table by her elbow as ive already said he forced an unnatural hardness into his tone ive quit racing and im not going back by the way i take it youve met my exwife yvonne a statement not a question so sudden that she could not hide the flicker of admission in her eyes so he had been right after all she nodded he was pleased she did not attempt a clumsy lie had she done so everything that he had admired about her during the five minutes or so in which they had known each other would have crumbled he sighed with silent relief it was replaced by curiosity on his part he waited patiently for her to speak thats one of the reasons why ive come all the way up here to see you she looked at him closely all her confidence seeming to have evaporated tm hoping that perhaps we shall be able to help each other all i ask is that you hear me out mark please he nodded he could feel his heart pounding wildly he wondered if she could hear it go ahead but he reminded himself that he wasnt going back to the circuits no way chapter four im sorry i had to use your wife to find you lee hammerton dropped her gaze a mixture of guilt and embarrassment flooding briefly over her but it was the only way i hope youll understand of course slade felt equally uncomfortable his powerful frame tensing as though an electric current surged through it td have done the same in your position how is yvonne the question was abrupt his usual lazy drawling tone disappearing instantly his body responding with a rigidness eyes boring into the girl who was seated opposite to him so much more than just a casual enquiry shes all right just all right lee hammerton dropped her gaze again staring into her mug of coffee as though it was the most important object in the whole world to her ive never met her before i called round in person thought it was better than phoning we talked but i dont really know her one cant expect to get to know somebody in halfanhour can one no but i have a feeling that theres something you havent told me maybe something she hinted at an impression she gave you perhaps something she said youre being a bit unfair she did not lift her gaze and mark slade was fully aware that her confidence had drained temporarily from her and so are you he pressed home the advantage which he sensed he had gained over her you used yvonne to find me and all i ask in return oh all right her eyes met his again conceding defeat yet not graciously her features hardening the embarrassment gone her confidence restored but there was something else in her attitude which he was unable to define shes had second thoughts but i dont think shell come back i see slades fingers trembled the coffee almost spilling but that wasnt what you came all the way here to tell me no she smiled but yvonne hoped you might help me out shes glad youve packed in racing but when i told her that i wasnt trying to lure you back to the circuits she said that you were the one to advise me go on he said lets hear it but im making no promises slade had to force himself to concentrate he could not get yvonne out of his mind he tried to tell himself that there was no chance of a reunion one never refitted worn tyres but it was himself that was worn out not yvonne someone is going to great lengths to try and stop me competing at riverside lees words filtered through to his bemused brain like sunlight penetrating the foliage of a dense wood are they it was a stupid question far better had he remained silent once again he experienced that feeling that he was pandering to her she took her time sipping her coffee relaxed again he knew that he would help her he would do anything except drive for her ive been warned off twice now she said telephone calls i used to get dozens hoaxes mostly this is no hoax how do you know i just know call it female intuition if you like but i know that whoever it is they mean business and ive blown my last chance to back down not that i ever would chicken out but i need someone around that i can rely on mark someone to turn to yvonne said that you were that man slade sighed she was using yvonne effectively but not for one moment did he doubt that she was telling the truth in a way he would be helping both of them he liked the idea and maybe afterwards after riverside any idea whos behind these threats slade forced himself back to the current situation seamark cruises she sighed ive no proof but its them all right dont you think youre jumping to conclusions they cant regard you as a serious threat an unsponsored team runofthemill drivers no but i dont think thats their main reason for trying to scare me off what is it then my father and seamark were enemies and thats putting it mildly twenty years ago they started up a business together catamaran cruises my father put up most of the money after a year it looked doomed to failure seamark wanted to sell up my father believed that if they held on long enough they would pull through they couldnt agree so dad paid seamark out two years later my father had ridden through stormy waters and come out all right seamark wanted to buy back his shares but dad said that he wasnt accepting rats back on a ship theyd deserted and then found out it wasnt sinking after all so seamark started up on his own damn it all the worlds big enough for more than one catamaran company but seamark didnt see it that way there were several attempts at sabotage and it seemed that every foreign port was against us seamark was growing fat and powerful a huge spider at the centre of a web which was spreading all the time there were big payoffs to customs officials so dad said then seamark branched out into cruiseliners he didnt bother with catamarans any more except ours one was gutted by fire at san remo a passenger died and it made the headlines in a big way the italian authorities made out that our fire precautions were to blame fortunately dad had ploughed most of his capital into industry and although seamark virtually finished us at sea we were fast overhauling him in other fields one would have thought that seamark would have been satisfied having driven us onto dry land but not seamark unfortunately both he and my father had a passion for formula one motorracing maybe if one of them had developed other interests the hammertonseamark war would have faded into obscurity instead the battleground was transferred to the circuits on and off them in fact they framed my brother justin before he was killed youve no proof theres one helluva lot of things i know but cant prove i dont need to i dont want to go to the police in their eyes were a family of drug addicts smugglers peddlers thats nonsense just because they found a cache of heroin in justins car you dont realise what it meant mark twice our place was raided by the drugs squad theyd had a tipoff an anonymous phone call and because justin had a conviction they believed there was no smoke without fire our greatest fear was another plant it would have been only too easy now their main concern seems to be frightening me off the circuits its crazy if they feel that way about you then theyve only got to beat you at riverside or at daytona and its all fair and square dont forget i was a seamark driver thats another reason id appreciate your help you know how they work the kind of tricks theyre likely to try and pull mark slade shook his head not really he said i was just a driver first and foremost concerned with winning they played it straight with me because you were good possibly the best around they had no reason to try anything else they considered you were capable of winning the iroc for them so they had no worries now that youve quit and their drivers are much the same as all the others taking part theyre having to resort to other means but as i said before youre no real threat lee they can buy the best im not the only one i can find the cash for a top man too and they know it it still doesnt figure ok so your old man and seamark were at each others throats and to some extent the fires of hatred are still smouldering but i say seamarks best bet is to come in ahead of you in either the heats or at daytona itself yet theyre threatening me if it is them it is chris fogg says so does he now well in all the time i was driving for seamark i never heard any mention of the hammerton rivalry because you were too damned straight for them mark you drove and you won regularly you were doing what you were paid to do they had no reason to try and involve you in their intrigue maybe but it doesnt ring true not to me at any rate ive still been threatened though ive been threatened on more than one occasion theres an element of cranks who get their kicks out of hoaxes like that i learned to ignore them after a time this guy said there wouldnt be another warning he said that if i went to riverside i wouldnt come back to england alive thats why i need you mark yvonne said youd help me slade was silent yvonne was figuring in it in a roundabout sort of way it was the kind of thing she would have said mark will help hes your man lee hammerton would not have lied about something like that in effect it was a call for help from yvonne she was asking him through this beautiful darkhaired girl who sat opposite him awaiting his decision he wondered if there was an ulterior motive slades brain was functioning slowly too slowly his ability for fast reactions and snap decisions seemed to have deserted him completely yesterday it would not have mattered he would happily have resigned himself to a placid existence where time stood still and everything happened in slow motion he was just beginning to adapt too a new way of life had been in the offing and suddenly an alfa romeo had roared in to shatter it all into a thousand fragments he thought of yvonne lee seamark and stern and he did not want to make a decision either way only one thing was certain in his mind he would never drive on the circuits again id better get us something to eat he stood up and turned to look out of the small latticed windows noticing that a line of black clouds was forming beyond the distant mountain peaks to the west they were looming up on his own horizon the tranquillity of the last few days being wafted away by the cold winds of change nothing remained constant you did not control your own destiny you havent given me an answer no because right now i havent got one i need time to think im not particularly hungry neither am i but we still have to eat turn me down and ill be on my way you can forget that i ever drifted into your seclusion yvonne said you might lets eat first im afraid its all out of cans im going to make a study of horticulture then everything will be fresh from the garden itll take time but ill do it she smiled softly but he knew that she was not mocking him perhaps she understood mark slade wished that he did they ate in silence corned beef baked beans italian tomatoes followed by coffee a halfempty packet of biscuits standing upright on the table between them as though it had been placed there to act as a deliberate barrier both of them studied the colourful outer wrapping the special offer coupon one could obtain a model chevy with that and p everybody it seemed was geared up for daytona next february taking their cut in any conceivable way slade decided that those custard creams had a bitter tang about them he cleared the dishes away and washed them in the sink once again it was something to do another means of stalling lee hammerton made no move to help him as though she sensed that her presence in the tiny kitchen would be an intrusion or maybe she just never did menial chores the afternoon sun was obscured by the advancing formation of black cloud slade could no longer hear the tractors outside these hillfarmers accepted the fact that the brief spell of fine weather was over what was done was done the rest would have to wait there was no way of fighting the inevitable only fools showed resistance the first heavy spots of rain spattered against the window panes the atmosphere had become much colder no longer that crisp invigorating air which inspired one to undertake menial tasks with enthusiasm but instead a penetrating damp which sapped ones morale slade went back into the adjoining livingroom and resumed his seat opposite lee hammerton she was making a study of the pattern on the faded carpet left behind by the previous owner tracing the faded diamond shapes with her toe round one way back the other she did not look up she was waiting for him to speak first he said its started to rain felt incredibly stupid and lapsed into silence again he had spent many such hours with yvonne wasted hours when they just sat there without speaking why only now did he understand fully the barrier between them which had doomed their marriage from the start yvonne had never pleaded with him to quit racing until the very end she had bottled it all up inside herself wanting the decision to come from him and he hadnt had the guts to make it that was what he had lacked all along guts he had conned himself until now and still he was conning everybody most of all lee hammerton anything but the truth he wished that he could have mustered the courage to say i quit racing because i lost my nerve but he knew that he would never admit that to anybody neither to lee nor yvonne ive made my pile ive had enough thats why im quitting all lies its getting late she said at last looking at her watch with an unnecessary flourish tour oclock too late to go back to hertfordshire today he seized upon yet another opportunity to stall meaning me or both of us he hesitated she had put the onus on him now and he had to answer her too late whichever way you look at it he grasped for one final straw suddenly realising that not only did he not want to go but he did not relish the thought of her leaving either and the claustrophobic loneliness surging softly back to envelop him subconsciously he saw her as a final link with yvonne and he did not want to sever it youve got to make up your mind sometime mark one way or the other id like to know i told you id never race again im not asking you to come to me as a driver theres nothing else im any good at thats why im up here trying to make something out of nothing starting all over again im just asking you for help id feel much easier if if you were just around have you ever heard of of the hammerton curse no he stiffened wondering if she were deliberately resorting to melodrama when every other ploy seemed to have failed youll be telling me next that seamark cruises have hired a witchdoctor to work on you its nothing to joke about she snapped her eyes narrowing sure i thought that way once when i first heard it i dont any more my ancestor jasper hammerton was accidentally beheaded by a careless farm worker with a scythe his son was killed shortly afterwards in a riding accident edwina jaspers daughter who got herself pregnant by the groom and died in childbirth put a curse on the family a cycle of doom that has come round again justin killed at le mans dad crushed in a strawbaler theres just me left now as edwina was thats what frightens me mark more than seamark does i need you around mark why dont you hire yourself a private detective his words lacked conviction im trying to you im not asking you to come down to hertfordshire for nothing i can afford to pay you well i dont need money oh to hell with your excuses mark it was the first time that he had sensed anger within her her dark eyes narrowed her knuckles bloodless where she gripped the arms of the chair youve given me nothing but doubletalk and excuses the whole time if i didnt know otherwise id say you were scared of something life itself maybe youve run up here to hide he turned away aware that he was trembling his heart pounded and he found it difficult to breathe easily she was more than just angry she was terrified to a state of desperation by the curse of an eighteenthcentury wench who had died in childbirth a man has a right to shape his life to suit himself ive chosen this way i wish id done it years ago and then youd still have yvonne his whole body tautened but he felt no anger towards lee hammerton all the same he was unable to turn around and face her her intuition was uncanny theres no need to bring my wife into this he spoke slowly uncertainly im not bringing her into it i merely mention something which is apparent to me i may be wrong nevertheless we did talk for quite a time and she confided a lot in me i hate to say this but she isnt your wife youre divorced now or had you forgotten no his voice was low subdued i hadnt forgotten i heard she had somebody else a banker philip i dont know his other name are they going to marry i presume so she didnt say he spends quite a lot of time away at conferences like i did only theres a difference she doesnt have to sit there worrying about whether shell see him alive again she knows hell come back all in one piece shes never known security before i guess it must be quite a novelty and suppose i accept your offer he found his gaze drawn irresistibly towards that biscuit packet again staring at the picture of the chevy camaro as though hypnotised by it he cursed it beneath his breath td like you to come to the states with the team maybe im wrong and nothing will happen but i just feel that a guy who knows the circuits like you do would be able to spot trouble before it happened and anyway wouldnt you like to play a small part in winning against seamark cruises i dont give a damn for seamark now he snapped or yvonne he felt like telling her to mind her own goddamned business instead he turned and looked at her and there was a faint smile hovering around the corners of his mouth you worked this out between you didnt you no she looked him in the face and her gaze did not waver but at least shed feel easier knowing that you werent going to kill yourself on the track or else dying of boredom like a hermit its too late to travel down today he dropped back into the chair youd better pull your car into the garage mines parked on the track at the back then we can get off to an early start in the morning she fumbled in the pockets of her levis and pulled out a small bunch of keys a quick movement of her hand and the jangling carkeys had landed in his lap thanks her eyes sparkled momentarily and then became misty slade stood up so youre hiring a chauffeur and general handyman as well as a private eye he laughed ill drive down tomorrow lee hammerton said but right now i feel physically and mentally drained it was raining hard as mark slade drove the alfa romeo into the small garage the way the car surged forward even over that distance of a few yards brought back everything he was trying to forget with a sigh of relief he switched off the engine and clambered out another thought struck him as he went back into the house and with it came an arousement in his loins situations had a habit of repeating themselves lee hammerton reminded him of zoe there was no resemblance neither physically nor in their personalities she was just another woman on hand to satisfy a mans needs in one way lee was coming between himself and yvonne in another she was bringing them closer together it was crazy but it did not alter the fact that there was only one bed in crossways night came swiftly on the wings of the storm this time it was lee who prepared some food and made coffee slade watched her through the open door noting her inexperience in household chores so different from yvonne he thought about the night which lay ahead and it worried him wed better get an early night lee glanced at her watch and then fixed her eyes unwaveringly on him sure he dropped his gaze and hoped that she did not notice the trembling of his lower lip the bedrooms all yours im used to the couch often sleep on it when i cant be bothered to go upstairs to bed if thats the way you want it she smiled and stood up thats fine by me theres one thing you should know though whats that i have a lover you surprise me no doubt youll meet him tomorrow ill look forward to it he was grateful when the door closed behind her the wave of depression hit him with unexpectedness automatically he reached for the valium tablets shook one out and swallowed it without water even then he could not force himself to face reality he was conning himself again but there was no getting away from the fact that lee hammerton had hit him where it hurt most and he was still prepared to go down to hertfordshire simply because yvonne cared or at least that was what he tried to tell himself slade switched on the radio just background music loud enough to screen a telephone conversation from anyone who might be listening in the room above he did not hurry simply because he was obeying instincts rather than acting logically he studied the picture of the chevy camaro on the biscuit wrapper and then turned his attention to the framed photograph of yvonne on the welshdresser he picked up the receiver the forefinger of his right hand resting on the dial hesitating even though he knew the number off by heart indecision flooded over him it would have been far easier not to make that call but in his mind he knew that he had to he paused for the first time giving some thought to what he was going to say thought youd like to know ive taken the job as private eye and bodyguard to the hammerton team no im not going back to the circuits ill be in the states until february maybe ill see you when i get back got a nice little place up here panoramic scenery whitewashed walls ivy over the porch so peaceful it all sounded so crummy definitely not mark slade style he scrapped that one and without further deliberation began to dial hed play it as it came say whatever entered his head that had always been his way he heard the call ringing out at the other end a steady monotonous brrrbrrr on and on perhaps yvonne had retired to bed or else gone out slade was in no hurry he hung on a couple of minutes later he tensed as the steady purring cut out philip baldock speaking an icy chill flooded over mark slade at the sound of that cultured male voice the air of quiet confidence the solidarity respectability who is that speaking a slight note of puzzlement irritation im sorry slade muttered must have dialled the wrong number sorry to have troubled you he replaced the receiver switched off the transistor and stretched himself out on the couch still looking at that photograph for the first time he really hated that banker and he knew it was illogical he hated somebody else too the unknown lover of the girl who lay in bed directly above him also he hated seamark and stern bitterness was fast taking over mark slade destroying the peace for which he had striven these past few weeks as he turned off the light he was glad that he had accepted lee hammertons offer somewhere sometime somebody was going to have to pay the price for what they had all done to him and this opportunity was as good as any to start his campaign of vengeance chapter five the hammerton estate in hertfordshire comprised some five hundred acres the majority of the land was leased to tenant farmers but as the alfa romeo with lee at the wheel sped down the treelined avenue which led to the large georgian mansion slade caught a glimpse of the circuit it rested in a hollow to the right of the house an ovalshaped tarmac track that encompassed perhaps twenty acres of otherwise useless scrubland a steep bank rose at the rear where it joined a belt of thick corsican pines which appeared to overshadow the whole area a stark contrast of the work of nature and the efforts of mankind the former seeming to frown disapprovingly over the latter thats it lee had noticed the direction of her companions glance the hammerton private circuit a surface that matches both riverside and daytona all thats lacking is the glamour slade said nothing he checked a reply and instead turned his attention towards the large halftimbered residence a magnificence that was spoiled by signs of neglect moss grew liberally on the roof and parapets some tiles were missing and weeds sprouted over the terrace drive it reminded him of the hammerton curse a place like this brooding over grounds that were a wilderness had you believing in it he shivered involuntarily weve been too busy with racing since my father died she seemed to read his thoughts ive asked john clyde my general manager to get the contractors in to give the place a facelift to try to bury the past they climbed out of the car and slade followed lee in the direction of one of the side entrances there had been no rain here and the sun cast its autumnal warmth over the landscape woodpigeons cooed softly in the tall trees but there was no other sign of life the hammerton place had a distinct air of desolation about it an atmosphere that was almost evil i expect everybodys in the sheds with the cars lee said as she opened a door and stepped into a long gloomy corridor ill show you to your room and then well go down and ill introduce you to the hammerton team slades room on the first floor overlooked the circuit the furnishings were luxurious but lee noted his eyes taking in a layer of dust on an ornately carved dressingtable staff are a problem here she muttered somewhat apologetically so john clyde tells me we have to manage as best we can in fact some of the rooms on the second floor are never used at all thats the trouble with motorracing so much else gets overlooked slade gazed appreciatively around him two wardrobes a large dressingtable and a double bed offered him more than basic requirements his feet sank into the thick carpet and he wondered idly what famous names had stayed in that very same room over the years possibly even royalty in days long gone floors that had been trodden by the infamous jasper hammerton in those faroff days of feudal supremacy over a peasant population thisll do fine for me he said make yourself at home lee replied moving across to the bowwindow and gazing down onto the black oval ribbon in the hollow below youll be here for some time we dont leave for america until after christmas and she whirled round suddenly aware that they were no longer alone in the room a tall man stood just inside the open door the lush carpeting having rendered his approach virtually inaudible oh john she recovered from her surprise you gave me quite a shock slade looked at the newcomer tall and straight dark hair with a few flecks of grey in it brushed straight back from his receding forehead pale blue eyes and a thin pencil moustache gave him a debonair appearance accentuated by an expensively tailored suit the jacket of which was unbuttoned hands thrust deep into trouser pockets this is john clyde lee hammerton regained her composure john mark slade hell be with us from now until we return from america the two men regarded each other steadily but it was siade who stepped forward with outstretched hand the other almost reluctant to disturb his relaxed almost arrogant posture well well this is a surprise slade had the feeling that clyde was mocking him mark slade the mark slade there was nothing to be learned from those clear blue eyes the thin lips alone formed into a token smile the long slim fingers held but did not squeeze the outstretched hand clyde looked questioningly at lee as though demanding an explanation and at the same time reprimanding her for not having advised him of slades visit beforehand mark will be staying here in an advisory capacity john lees voice was low almost condescending and once again slade had the impression that her air of selfconfidence was little more than a front that masked the loneliness and uncertainty of an orphaned millionairess i thought it might be as well to have him around in view of recent events im sure mr slade has been threatened himself on numerous occasions clyde extricated himself from the handshake and stepped back nevertheless i hope he will enjoy his stay slade felt uncomfortable almost embarrassed as though he had been caught trespassing the others attitude annoyed him too the constant use of the third person like a surgeon discussing a forthcoming operation without direct reference to the patient i was concerned when you didnt return last night clyde turned to lee there are some letters to be signed and they can wait lee snapped as though determined to exert her authority i am free to come and go as i please john ill pop into the office later and sign them and also perhaps youd chase the contractors up before this place falls to bits john clyde withdrew nodding to them both yet conceding nothing lee closed the door with a long sigh that was supposed to be one of annoyance but slade detected something much deeper something which he could not explain fully the girl had her inheritance but she had not the power which her father had wielded underneath her facade she was very frightened john clyde is a bit of a nuisance at times she walked across to the window and looked out again nevertheless hes invaluable and i couldnt do without him hes managed both the estate and the team for the past ten years even dad pandered to him at times i guess he just considers hes responsible for me to him im still the fifteenyearold schoolgirl who used to go and watch the mechanics working on the cars slade made a simple mathematical calculation lee hammerton was twentyfive she looked younger by three or four years he decided that she was covering up a lot of things in her endeavour to make the top flight and carry on where craig hammerton had left off she needed help much more than she was prepared to admit td better introduce you to the lads she turned back to him and he saw that her brief moment of indecision was gone she was in command again outwardly anyway the sheds where the cars were garaged and maintained had once been stables adjoining the house itself little structural alteration had been necessary for their new purpose the close proximity of the circuit adding to their advantage slade followed in lees footsteps her lithe form a perfect coordination of every muscle as she walked her bearing proof of her upbringing posture learned at a finishingschool in paris once again he experienced an amusement followed by something else as he remembered her admission to having a lover it was only natural he decided her ambition in life was opposed to marriage yet she had the same bodily desires as every other woman she had to have somebody to satisfy them mark slade found himself wishing that he could have been that man they reached the first stable and with surprisingly little effort lee hammerton dragged the door back the runners moving easily and quietly they stepped inside the shed was large two interior walls having been knocked down in order to convert the three small stables into one spacious room slade was surprised at the neatness of it all rows of dexion shelving with equipment and spare parts laid out in an organised fashion in complete contrast to the seamark workshops four cars occupied the centre of the rough concrete floor all chevys three in various stages of rebuilding the fourth a squat solid chunk of metallic power a combination of ugliness and beauty glinting in the light of an overhead bulb four overallclad figures were bent over it their concentration such that they had not even noticed the entrance of mark slade and lee hammerton grubby white clothing grease and oil stained merging them into uniformity green lettering emblazoned across their shoulders hammerton boys i want you to meet mark slade four heads jerked round at lees words bodies straightening and turning in unison eyes squinting in an effort to adjust to the gloom beyond the bright circle of light curiosity amazement searching looks instant recognition in only one case chris fogg the exseamark man regarded slade steadily wiry of build with sharp aquiline features jetblack greasy hair falling below his neckline fogg might have been mistaken for an arab at first glance until he spoke his cockney accent tinged with surprise well this is a turn up for the books he laughed as though to reassure himself heard youd become a hermit mate livin in a cave out in the sticks something like that slade replied evenly his gaze sweeping over the others as lee introduced each one with an informal gesture frank wylie the chief mechanics build belied his height overall buttons strained a ruddy complexion that could have been caused by exposure to the elements but was more likely due to high bloodpressure broad features that were spoiled by thin lips already forming into a mirthless smile that denoted frequent sarcasm a man who enforced his position by belittling others billy wagstaffe short and sinewy a ready smile young too young slade decided the grin denoted a genuineness also a naivety a hard worker but one who would never make the top grade a scapegoat when things went wrong a whipping boy for the likes of wylie steve kilby selfassured goodlooking long blond hair styled to conform with the fashion that the media and public demanded clean cut features deep blue eyes that shone with recklessness and a zest for dangerous living a muscular body that even the shapeless creased suit of overalls could not hide easy moving like a beast of prey a suppleness that would react instantly to any situation he had the nerve slade decided and the rest would come with experience but not for a year or two yet the kind of man women fell for the sort who took advantage of anything that came his way pleased to meet you mark nodded smiling wondering what each of them was thinking they resented his presence his name perhaps not billy wagstaffe but certainly the others it was only natural mark will be with us until we get back from the states lee sensed their automatic rejection of a nearchampion brought into their midst in view of these recent threats i thought it would be as well to have somebody around to keep an eye on things the rest of you will concentrate on winning thats it kilby broke the uneasy atmosphere patting the crimson bonnet of the completed chevy you wont get much better than that she did a hundredandsixty last week reckon we can better that now well find out tomorrow anyway slade moved closer to the car outwardly there was little to distinguish it from any of the seamark chevys except for the hammerton on the windshield and sides yet he knew that it was beneath the bonnet where it counted most the individual tuning of specifications determining whether or not the machine stood a chance a factor that was second only to the man behind the wheel and luck slade walked around the car low on the ground six inches clearance at the most perfectly balanced heavy tyres that would be reduced to smouldering rubber after a couple of laps he wondered how fast wylie and wagstaffe could make the change that was another vital point so many things controlled the narrow margin between winning and losing he was curious to view the engine but on no account would he lift the bonnet without being invited to do so satisfied wylies sarcasm was materialising quickly cant say slade countered quickly never did judge books by their covers there was no invitation to inspect the engine slade bent and examined the tyres as though the idea had never even occurred to him she handles a treat kilby said fancy trying a couple of laps in the morning mark slade stiffened his fists clenched and he could feel the dampness on his palms followed by a tingling feeling up and down his spine stomach muscles contracting a rising nausea he sensed a taunt a deliberate challenge but kilby could not possibly know thats not my job he scarcely recognised his own voice im not here to drive he wondered why he was here he cursed himself for being a fool at the same time consoling himself that it was because of yvonne like a oncevictorious gladiator he had stepped back into the arena instead of accepting his freedom he had left and then returned without realising it like some evil force had lured him here for its own purpose id like you to test it lee added slade conducted a minute unseeing examination of the treads his brain spinning refusing to supply an instant excuse he told kilby again youre the driver youve got to handle her at riverside id like to watch her first the blond driver replied it was as though there was a sudden conspiracy against mark slade he wanted to scream out christ no not for anything ive lost my bloody nerve instead he said well have to see the bonnet was being opened he was being forced to look mentally drawing back as a condemned man might upon viewing the gallows wylie was talking explaining the modifications pointing here and there with an oily finger showing off his skill lacing it with sarcasm as he sensed himself in the role of master a nearchampion his pupil slade stood there but he neither saw nor heard instead he remembered crossways the soothing drone of tractors the haven which had somehow been wrested from his grasp christ he was a bloody fool the bonnet was closed again the others stood around in a circle looking at him awaiting his verdict he nodded seems ok he did not know whether it was or not the proof will be in the testing damn it hed put the onus on himself again individual components are built and installed under each drivers supervision so that the components rather than the cars become each mechanics metier kilby might have been reciting some verse learned parrotfashion each car is tested and balanced at each circuit the aim being to achieve an optimum laptime with a minimum change in technique from car to car slade turned to lee wed better leave these guys to finish off he said she nodded and he followed her out pausing to close the door behind them the late afternoon sun was already obscured by dark clouds as though the rainfall had followed them down from crossways and had caught up with them at last even as they walked back to the house the first few heavy spots began to fall damn lee held out her hands looking skywards thisll grease the circuits up for testing it might rain at riverside too slade replied best to test on a wet surface you dont have any fears about dry ones then fears fears fears realisation of his words closed in on him hell he wasnt going to drive on any circuit again ever how much longer would he have to keep on telling himself that id like you to do a couple of laps in the car lee hammerton followed him back to his room im no testdriver you were within a fraction of winning an iroc that was last february i havent driven for months im right out of touch oh i dont want you to try and get it up beyond onehundredandsixty she walked into his room and across to the window staring down at the glistening black tarmac in the hollow the rain now falling steadily just a nice steady couple of laps say around the ton theres no point that wouldnt prove anything im not asking you to prove anything its just well im sort of superstitious i know it sounds silly but but id feel a lot happier at riverside if i knew that the mark slade had driven our car once sort of okayed it if you know what i mean thats your mechanics job christ her superstitions were getting the better of her she was as jumpy as hell maybe but id still like you to try it out for me christen it please mark suddenly her arms were around his neck pulling his face down to her upturned pouted lips his brain whirled madly incapable of absorbing everything that had happened since his arrival an invitation a pressing one to drive again and now this everything inside him seemed to snap like a hawser that has undergone a tremendous strain breaking up strand by strand until finally it was totally severed no longer was he capable of fighting against anything their lips met she dictating the kiss brushing lightly against him at first then crushing her mouth against his her tongue pushing and forcing a penetration her fingernails digging into his back through his nylon shirt his arms came up encircled her held her tightly to him and then somehow they were sprawling on the coverlet of the double bed still embracing kissing passionately a storm of emotion matching that of the elements outside slade did not care about anything any more except lee he had wanted to sleep with her on the previous night she had wanted him to he had rejected her sent her upstairs to an empty bed she was giving him a second chance crushing her body against his groaning aloud with pleasure as she sensed his hardness stabbing at her then just as suddenly as she had thrown herself at him she broke away struggling to extricate herself from his hold im sorry she turned her head away her voice husky i shouldnt have done that mark please forgive me please try and forget that it ever happened slade supported himself on an elbow looking up at her it should have happened last night he said so why not now because because still she would not look into his face because i mustnt i asked you down here for a reason and it wasnt to make love to me because of your lover you mean he sensed the cruelty in his own voice regretting it but unable to avoid it she had deliberately set man against man driver against driver in a contest for her own pleasure for some moments she did not answer him i dont have a lover any more she breathed at last oh slade raised an eyebrow since when i told him it was all over between us before i set off for crossways she said i didnt expect to find him here when i got back hes still around though waiting hoping still prepared to work for me thats devotion by anybodys standards to drive for you she started was it that obvious i guessed it was kilby slade had not guessed until now a wild guess more of a process of elimination five men were on the premises with her day and night kilby was the obvious choice none of the others fitted because they werent lee hammertons type a woman gets lonely on her own she has to have a man was that what you wanted me for nor she answered him with such vehemence that he knew she was speaking the truth i asked you to come here because of the threats the hammerton curse a troubleshooter nothing more that isnt the way its turning our now i didnt want it to be like this not yet anyway id have slept with you last night though just once because i needed to i phoned yvonne after youd gone to bed slade admitted her lover answered the phone so youve changed your mind about her now i dont know ill see what the situation is like when we get back from america you want her back badly dont you yes suppose she doesnt want you then i guess ill have to manage without her and youll deny yourself a woman for the next five months i dont know you dont seem to know either first you want me then you dont im sorry she flung herself back down beside him but made no move to embrace him again i dont understand myself half the time all my life ive had one lover after another nothing serious not on my part anyway some of them didnt see it that way though steve doesnt appear to bear me any resentment i know john clyde does though he was bitter towards steve kilby so youve had clyde as a lover too only for a short time you couldnt really say he was a lover i never let him do anything we came pretty close a couple of times but i suppose i couldnt have thought anything of him or else i would have slept with him it was as though there was some kind of barrier between us it happened after dad died id got nobody john ran the place everything revolved around him life would have been very easy if id married him he asked me at least a dozen times but i always said no i guess hes still hoping ill change my mind hes changed lately though i can sense the bitterness a kind of hopelessness but still hoping if you know what i mean hell stick around just like steve kilby will mark slade nodded he did not understand lee hammerton though his thoughts turned to yvonne and the five months that lay ahead maybe then he would be forced to write finis he would go back to crossways a hermit less than fortyeight hours ago he had resigned himself to just that then this lovely darkhaired girl had driven in and turned his new life upside down now he was mark slade troubleshooter it was crazy there was always the chance that she had set it all up that there had been no threats and she just wanted mark slade almost an iroc winner the hammerton curse had come in handy for her purpose if so he had fallen right into the trap and the mesh was closing tightly over him five months and he probably wouldnt want yvonne back his thoughts turned to the testdrive on the morrow and he closed his eyes beads of sweat starting to form on his brow no way could he drive again one did not retrieve lost nerve like stooping down to pick up a dropped handkerchief her warm sweet breath fanned his face and he felt her nearness an arm draped around him a hand resting on his thigh the beginning of yet another arousement im sorry mark about what messing you about i was messed about long before you showed up sometimes a man reaches a point of no return yet refuses to admit it even to himself i could help you return to what whatever you wanted it isnt driving no way all right but you cant take it out on yourself for the rest of your life weve got five months ahead of us during which were going to see each other practically every day it wont be easy not for me anyway and when that five months is up if you want to go back to her i wont try to stop you i promise his hand found hers guiding her fingers onto the hardness which was thrusting upwards with renewed zest inside his trousers she squeezed and rubbed he moaned softly closing his eyes mark what will you promise me one small favour it depends i have a habit of breaking my word i cant even rely on myself will you test the chevy for me tomorrow just a couple of laps he stiffened and began to sweat again her fingers moved nimbly he heard his zip run then tensed for a different reason as her sensitive fingertips began to caress his naked pulsing flesh just a couple of laps no more his fear was being swamped by a sensation far greater a tidal wave of passion and lust that had been trapped somewhere within him for far too long the fingers of her other hand were undoing his shirt buttons fumbling with his waistband he eased himself up so that she could slide the garments from his eager body now she was starting to take off her own clothes he saw the firmness of her breasts the shapeliness of her thighs with the mysterious dark v in between she was naked embracing him again just a couple of laps no more no need to drive fast no need ever to drive again afterwards slade looked up at her as she sat astride him her dark eyes were still asking pleading and that flicker of fear was still there all right his voice was no more than a whisper just a couple of laps then the warmth of her love swallowed him up claiming him their bargain forgotten temporarily as their mutual needs demanded satisfaction chapter six lee hammerton was astride a horse she couldnt see it because it was pitch dark but she could sense the power of the animal beneath her the way it tensed its mighty muscles as though it were even now preparing to throw her she tried to scream but no sound came she clutched at the flimsy reins with sweaty hands felt them starting to slip from her grasp her terror was escalating she didnt know how she came to be in the saddle no recollections of mounting or even where she was just blackness all around a clip taken from some movie so you didnt know what had gone before but you were terrified of what was to come a whirlpool of sensations as she felt the horse starting to rear neighing wildly as though it were in terrible pain and sought to take revenge on its rider the sound vibrated in her brain she was yelling but the words had got lost somewhere theres something under the saddle a thorn just like they did to but youre edwina youre going to die battered and broken by flailing hooves like your brother was the bastard child in your womb destroyed because it never should have been conceived im not edwina im lee it is no matter the curse shall claim the hammertons of each generation you will all die suddenly lee felt herself airborne a human cannonball fired into the air spinning her stomach seeming to rise up so that hot bile stifled her scream aware of the maddened plunging mount below waiting to pulp her with its hooves when she fell falling a rush of icy air bracing herself for the inevitable impact it didnt come still falling faster and faster oh god shed been tossed to an unbelievable height finally that sickening bonejarring thud as she landed rolling over and over finally coming to rest on her back and staring up into that awful equine countenance eyes that burned like coals in the darkness with an insatiable hate cavernous mouth wide and flecked with foam hooves aloft waiting savouring her destruction you will all die she managed to close her eyes but could not shut out that awful bestial expression and this time she also managed a long piercing scream tried to cover her head with her arms in a futile attempt to protect it from the inevitable skullshattering blows she prayed that it would be quick wanted to die something struck her but it was a sharp stinging slap across her face bringing a cry of pain from her lips her eyes dropped open and she stared in disbelief it was no longer dark the glare from the lamp on the bedside table hurt her eyes but she did not close them the face that looked down upon her was neither equine nor angry it was human and the expression was one of concern youve had a nightmare mark slade relaxed his grip on her wrists take it easy everythings ok i know lee hammerton nodded tried to smile but it was a bad one this time she groped for him pulled him down to her hold me close mark she closed her eyes flinched as she remembered edwina hammertons adultery and the price the longdead girl had had to pay for it and the wheel of illfortune was gaining momentum fast it had stopped raining by the time mark slade and lee hammerton left the house and walked in the direction of the circuit the following morning the sky was still overcast and the day promised to be damp and dismal lees hand rested in his but once they came in sight of the tarmac track she withdrew it almost as though she feared that either clyde or kilby would learn of her relationship with the exseamark driver slade was aware of the dampness inside his shirt he was grateful to lee for having spent the whole night with him for a variety of reasons now he must face stark reality for once he could not go back on his word somehow he had to force himself behind that wheel he owed it to her somebody had to beat the legendary curse two laps no more his last bow away from the glamour in a place so remote that his fans would never know anything about it the chevy camaro was already on the hammerton circuit four overallclad figures clustered around it slade recognised the members of the team only john clyde was absent i wouldve thought your manager would have wanted to see how the test goes he commented to lee hell be along in a minute she replied and turning round nodded back the way they had come here he comes now we have a local woman who comes in daily she cooks the main meal and does a bit of cleaning if she has time i expect john wanted a word with her first clyde was walking quickly and caught them up as they descended the grassy bank leading down to the tarmac below he grunted a greeting falling into step with them obviously unwilling to engage in trivial conversation slade was glad the last thing he wanted to do was to talk he was sweating freely now his shirt and trousers clinging to his body a fear beginning to creep over him which wasnt wholly due to the prospect of sitting behind the wheel again lee had had a bad time last night the chevy looked much smaller now that it was out in the open but his knowledge of the machine was such that he was already experiencing the unleashing of its power the shuddering vibration the squeal of tortured rubber the smell of burned oil and the claustrophobic fear of being trapped helplessly in that hurtling metal coffin sudden death and instant cremation being the penalty for one slight error of judgement suddenly the hammerton curse seemed more than an ageold rumour by driving for lee slade was putting himself at its mercy shes rarin to go wylie stepped back glancing from kilby to slade as though questioning which of them was going to test the car looks good kilby stared at the chevy shaking his head from side to side as though unable to believe that at last their project was finished well soon see how good she really is though slade hesitated his breathing so shallow that he had to exert conscious effort to work his lungs the way he always was before a race only now it was a thousand times worse in this quiet hollow his only spectators the towering fir trees above everything was deathly still six pairs of eyes focused upon him watching waiting almost as though they knew his secret he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand subconsciously aware that sweat was oozing from every pore in his body he was trembling too kilby handed him goggles rubberframed flexible ones with unbreakable glass they would cause less distortion of vision in fine weather than a visor slade put them on billy wagstaffe passed him a pair of gloves he pulled them on slowly taking his time flexing his fingers stalling several hundred operations of the gearlever would be necessary even on a small circuit such as the hammerton one he knew too how he would grip that wheel how his stomach would churn wylie was talking technicalities slade was not listening he did not need to he knew exactly what to expect but it did not lessen the mounting fear within him his instincts were yelling to him to back out to get away from this place back to crossways his pride urged him to stay youve conned em all so far youve still got some conning to do just this once start her up and lets listen to her his voice seemed to come from far away totally unrecognisable wylie halfhesitated then leaned over into the chevy seconds later the engine roared into life dropped to a steady tickover and the chief mechanic straightened up his natural resentment at obeying an expected request only too obvious mark slade reached his peak of terror and passed it he was a robot now numbed in mind and body yet still capable of driving that car two laps his final farewell the others stood back but he did not glance at them as he slid into the crimson chevy camaro he had to think of other things whilst the rest of him functioned as an automaton three minutes and it would all be over he could see clyde the manager had a stopwatch in his hand it was crazy they didnt have to time him he would only be cruising all part of the conditioning process slades fears told him you try to escape a woman lures you back they show you a car trick you into getting behind the wheel youre trapped youve lost your nerve anything could go wrong and if it does youll panic this place the people and everything connected with it is cursed slade forced himself to throw the gearstick and as the car shot forward he was shouting his words lost in the deafening roar heard only by the hobgoblin of fear perched on his shoulder damn it im as good as they come the best around second at daytona hurtling black tarmac the acrid stench of scorching rubber and burnt oil the scenery a blur unrecognisable keep your eyes on the track youre in the lead a multitude of faces every one of them a ghoul scenting death hoping damn em all ill live ill live daytona again another chance elation drowned fear a complete lap one down one to go and still alive the speedometer and revcounter responded mph slade sensed that something was wrong before he was physically aware of it nothing that he could pinpoint more like a gleeful cackle from the hobgoblin of fear a warning of impending doom he was easing up down to loomph before catastrophe struck he no longer had control of the chevy the steering wheel spun uselessly in his hands like a kiddies roundabout car at the funfair his reflexes took over where his brain ceased to function the bend loomed up before him and he knew that he couldnt take it the wheels were on an erratic crazy course only the shape of the car preventing it from overturning immediately zigzagging and swerving towards the steep bank below the firs he hunched his body in the way that fallen jockeys do hoping that the flailing hooves would miss there was nothing slade could do many would have prayed he did not he was a fatalist he would come out of it either alive or dead the choice was not his the front wheels hit the bank with a shuddering jolt his head went back the impact lessened by the crashhelmet and a floating sensation engulfed him the chevy was airborne twisting roaring its wounded anger as though trying to defy the gravitational pull winning hesitating falling back losing a brief thought one that went as quickly as it came a human body crushed beyond recognition in a strawbaler oh god another jarring thud slades forehead struck something solid and again his protective headgear saved him from a fractured skull dazed and shaken he was scarcely aware of what was happening the chevy rolled slid then embarked upon a series of backward somersaults slade knew that it had jumped the bank maybe cleared fifteen or twenty yards and now it was bent on returning to the circuit before it came to a standstill a heap of crumpled metal suicidal in its own way as though willing an inferno to destroy its selfinflicted injuries over and over screaming metal that gremlins maniacal laughter ringing in the drivers ears slade cursed aloud he was still alive and even more amazing still conscious the car hit the tarmac bounced once then lay still on its side wisps of smoke trickling skywards the fuse was lit any second it would go up a sheet of blinding flame then nothing cremation slade lay there dazed remembered what had happened to justin hammerton now it was his own turn the curse he forced every muscle in his body to respond to his confused brain somehow he managed to heave himself upwards crouching securing a hold with his hands using his biceps in the manner of one practising pullups on a horizontalbar in the gymnasium something caught at his feet but he kicked himself free a red haze shimmered before his eyes and darkness threatened to close in merciful but fatal rest a minute eyes closed breathe deeply try again choking smoke oh jesus this was the way justin went starting to panic he held on to that last breath his eyes streamed as though ammonia had been squirted into them he was balanced precariously on some kind of narrow ledge the blackness threatened to return and with it came a sensation of vertigo heat too any second there was a screaming in his brain logic attempting to overcome blind panic roll now before its too late which way he was perched on a pinnacle only two choices open to him roll the wrong way and youre back in your coffin the other and youll hit the tarmac he tried to open his eyes but he could not see thick black smoke was billowing up all around him he rolled away from the heat and his body thudded onto solid tarmac he was still conscious immobile unseeing only his hearing remained voices shouting lee hammerton screaming for her nightmare was becoming reality strong hands seized him dragged him he felt the hard surface beneath him grazing his legs the voices were much fainter now the blackness yawned like a huge abyss inviting him to plunge into its soothing oblivion a blinding orange flash seared his sightless eyeballs the explosion tore at his eardrums the hands dragging him released him and he fell forward it was then that the hovering blackness closed in and claimed him slade had no idea how long he had been unconscious or where he was cool linen soothed his body and after a time he mustered sufficient courage to open his eyes he was in a darkened room the curtains were drawn and the light which filtered through the chinks made him wince and turn his head away he tested every limb and discovered to his amazement that he could still move both arms and legs his neck was stiff his head ached abominably but he could see through those smarting eyes he was alive it was a miracle it came as a surprise to discover that he was not alone in the room a slight movement in the darkest corner attracted his attention and squinting through narrowed eyelids he discerned a shapely female figure straightening up from the chair where she had been sitting mark lee hammerton breathed a long sigh of relief how are you feeling rough he forced a grin tried to sit up but flopped back onto the pillows where the hell am i my room she squatted beside him on the bed and her hand found his i thought you might as well stay here what happened the car seemed to go out of control did you black out or something no he paused trying to recollect those hellish seconds before the crash no i didnt black out something went wrong tracking id say at a rough guess impossible she snapped frank wylie went over everything last night in his final check before testing it couldnt have been well it was he replied and judging by the way it went without warning id say itd been fixed by somebody who knew their business ive experienced tracking trouble before and ive always had enough warning to enable me to stop there was none this time one moment everything was fine the next i was hellbent on a course for disaster well soon tell though as soon as i can get down there and have a look at the wreck no chance her face was strained how you got out of that alive ill never know i couldnt believe it when i saw you scrambling out of that heap of buckled scrap it was already on fire before you got clear it exploded as we were dragging you away the blast knocked us all flat thank god nobody else was hurt apart from a few scratches and bruises i think the police should examine whats left even if it is only a charred shell sladesaid it isnt just a case of sabotage its attempted murder no she gripped his hand not the police under any circumstances thats why i hired you i dont want anything to do with the law were already labelled as drugsmugglers in their eyes and anyway they cant fight the hammerton curse nobody can if id been killed youdve had the cops here whether you liked it or not well you werent killed thank god she bent over and kissed him wed never prove anything against seamark anyway theyre too clever to leave clues behind but i dont think it was them i believe it was something far more insidious and what if it wasnt seamark then its pointless trying to investigate but suppose it was aimed directly at me chances are ill be killed next time the warning is plain enough get out slade before it happens again next time you might not be so lucky dont forget seamark have a score to settle with me as well and other people too if you stop to think about it oh rubbish she stood up now who the hell would want to do a thing like that to you except seamark cruises quite a few guys he grinned but in a place like this we can narrow it down a bit a jealous lover a ruthless driver in fear of losing his place in the big team perhaps a plant from a rival team or maybe just a plain mechanic who doesnt fancy working under me thats ridiculous she snapped in other words youre saying that it could have been any one of the five guys who comprise my team its a possibility kilby wants to drive at riverside fogg was until recently a seamark man too your chief mechanicmade it plain he didnt like me around ok then lets begin with a process of elimination lee hammerton spoke indignantly first neither kilby nor john clyde know that we slept together last night foggs on the level i swear it he hates seamark cruises wylie might not like you but hes dead straight wagstaffe is only a boy youre naive underneath your bluff slade thought but did not voice it kilby or clyde could easily have found out where lee hammerton spent the previous night a driver with an attempt at the top flight within his grasp might resort to anything if he saw his opportunity being jeopardised there was every possibility that fogg was the seamark undercover man he had never demonstrated a show of morality before so why now why come to hammerton when there were bigger and better jobs around for a skilled man even driving he had tested for seamark cruises wylie was deep nasty and sarcastic wagstaffe was the sort of youth who would be easily led particularly where a substantial bribe was concerned it could have been any one of them all of them in fact there was no way of knowing yet or it could have been none of them i take it you didnt call a doctor he asked no she shook her head and sat down on the bed again if you hadnt regained consciousness soon i would have phoned for one john clyde examined you he studied medicine in his younger days but didnt get his degree he said there was nothing broken just concussion you collect failures dont you he smiled wryly john was unlucky she replied bitterness creeping into her voice he nearly made the grade like me slade answered i nearly made it but not quite i failed once so i opted out youve got a chip on your shoulder she said id give anything to know why you really got out how long was i unconscious he asked quickly fighting against a sudden desire to confess to the world at large that mark slade had lost his nerve a couple of hours youd better stop where you are tilt morning anyway you dont encourage doctors either maybe youre the one with the chip on your shoulder perhaps youve just got it in for the mythical system and youre trying to prove something by qualifying at riverside i owe it to both my father and my brother anyway the fact remains that my number one car has been written off we start work gutting and rebuilding the number two tomorrow theres time just and suppose our mysterious enemies sabotage number two there wont be time to start from scratch again then so wed better make sure that nothing untoward befalls number two thats what i hired you for and so far i havent made a very good job of my post as troubleshooter have i i even crashed your car on a testcircuit it wasnt your fault and you damned well know it i take it youll stay on wont you mark he did not reply at once you wont leave will you the uncertainty was back in her voice no he sighed i guess not all the same i must be crazy if someones after my blood im setting myself up as a sitting duck youre doing it for yvonne thats emotional blackmail well you are arent you im not sure who then he struggled up onto an elbow his face upturned towards hers their lips met lightly at first then crushed together tongues probing and entwining until they both fell back on the bed thanks mark she sighed i hoped that was how you felt only until we get back from the states so youre just on hire then cant say i dont even know myself but until we either make it or fail in the iroc grids weve got to keep our wits about us whoever fixed that tracking is sure to try again and next time i may not be so lucky i want you to know just in case pray god it doesnt happen again she winced as guilt flooded over her she had no right to involve anybody in the hammerton past what security precautions do you take at night i presume the cars are locked up slade asked oh sure who has the key it hangs in the hall so anybody could help themselves anybody in the team certainly sometimes wylie and fogg work in the evenings the cars have to be accessible for work at all times well in future ill keep the key slade said if they want to work on the cars at night then ill be around ill also sleep in the sheds perhaps youd fix me up with a campbed is it really necessary her tone was one of disappointment it is vital in fact i dont think it matters tonight but once work is commenced on number two im not going to let it out of my sight why not draw up a rota they could all take turns just me sweetheart i dont trust anybody except you all right have it your own way i take it your family had some guns sporting or otherwise my father and brother shot regularly theres a gallyon sidelock in the gunroom my father also had a browning automatic i should have handed it in to the police really but as he didnt have a firearms certificate for it and as you hate the sight of a policeman slade grinned you naturally did not in that case id like to borrow it i presume theres some ammunition around theres a full box unopened in fact ill get it for you in the morning thanks im sorry youll be sleeping with the cars so am i maybe i could fix us up with a double campbed no chance he said i dont want you around if trouble blows likewise id be obliged if you would lock yourself in your room at night would you like me to wear a chastitybelt you can keep the key of that too if you like a few suits of armour might not come amiss he murmured or bulletproof vests trouble is we dont know whether the enemy is within or without its no good raising the drawbridge if the attacking force is already hidden in your own dungeons marcus seamark regarded the man seated on the opposite side of his desk without speaking the chairman of seamark cruises chewed steadily on the long dead cigar the butt a pulp of havana tobacco that would have been impossible to draw upon the bulky redfaced man with the totally bald pink head smoked cigars incessantly exclusively those of best cuban quality he only chewed them when uncontrollable rage seethed within him proof of his current mood was only too evident in the heavy glass ashtray where two more halfsmoked ones lay their ends mutilated and soggy stern attempted to hide his fear tall and thin sallowfaced he might have been mistaken for a solicitors clerk in more conventional clothing yet even those men the epitome of humility and respectability did not wear suits tailored in savile row normally suave and ruthless stern licked cracked and dried lips and drummed on his knee with the fingers of his left hand he knew that he was the scapegoat the fall guy seamark paid handsomely for success he also rewarded failure in his own way and in seamarks eyes stern had failed the blueprint seamarks small deepsunken eyes mirrored the fire which burned inside his huge frame where is it i dont know stern spread his hands wide swallowing hard so that his adams apple bobbed up and down it was kept in the workshops its just gone what dyou mean gone seamarks voice sunk almost to an inaudible whisper why wasnt it kept in the safe there there was no need of course there was need especially now that its been stolen the mechanics were working from it no they werent they want to now and it cant be found wasnt even missed how longs it been gone it i saw it myself a fortnight ago a fortnight it was kept in a drawer nobody was interested the hell they werent so they took the trouble to steal it why wasnt it photocopied stern swallowed again the action becoming increasingly harder because of the dryness of his throat it was foggs job to see to that he worked on the design along with dyson it was your responsibility you are team manager stem you carry the can i dont tolerate ballsups of this nature especially of this importance the blueprint was left lying around like yesterdays paper it wasnt photocopied although even if it had been the loss of the original would have been serious enough dysons attempting to redraw it hes working on a reconstruction from memory of course stern nodded togg has been gone a fortnight seamark mused which in itself is more than just a coincidence neither can it be a coincidence that mark slade has also thrown in his lot with hammerton stern waited then relief surged over him as the other dropped the dead cigar into the ashtray selected another from the cedarwood box by his elbow pierced it and held the match with a steady hand seamark only smoked when his anger was gone the period of chewing was over we need it back without delay the fat mans voice was guttural with a rage that had cooled phone me tomorrow and make sure the news is good it should not be too difficult after all hammerton are not seamark are they i dont need to tell you whom to send but remember you carry the can stern i wont tolerate losing slade and the blueprint both have the means whereby victory can be gained at daytona far rather that both were destroyed than that we compete against them chapter seven neither wylie nor chris fogg looked up as slade entered the workshop on the following morning both were examining the second gutted chevy camaro the charred remains of the first one were piled in the far corner only billy wagstaffe appeared to notice mark slades arrival mornin mr slade he straightened up grinning pushing his protective goggles up onto his forehead howre you feelin this morning a bit stiff slade turned his attention to the other two mechanics but apart from that im all right wyiie turned round his dark goggles hiding the expression in his eyes only his lips forming into a token smile which held no welcome going to give this one a testdrive when weve got it ready slade he leered patting the basic chassis of the number two camaro maybe slade spoke slowly sensing a disadvantage in not being able to read the others eyes and maybe not id like to have a look at whats left of number one first though help yourself wylie waved a hand in the direction of the remnants of the testdrive crash and then turned back to his work mark slade walked across to the pile of blackened and twisted metal it bore little resemblance to the car which he had driven on the previous day already some of the few serviceable parts had been removed for installation in the new chevy he rummaged through the wreckage for a few minutes then stood back a puzzled expression on his face wheres the tracking gone he asked his voice low his gaze focused unwaveringly on wylie and fogg should be there the chief mechanic answered him without looking up we havent used it well it isnt search me its got to be somewhere why should anybody take it if it wasnt any good dont ask me thats just what i am doing and ive already told you i havent any bloody idea whats happened to it its been removed cut away with a hacksaw thats the only way it could be got out of there valuable is it a collectors item slade tensed his fists clenched somehow he held himself in check i want to look at it he said softly youre welcome to look around but i cant help you any further weve got work to do and time is short were the cars locked up last night slade asked couldnt say wylie picked up an acetylene torch and slade was forced to turn his head away his eyes were still sore from the smoke which had poured into them during those few seconds when his life had hung in the balance the slidingdoor opened smoothly and steve kilby stepped inside he nodded to mark slade that trackings missing from the number one car slade said any ideas not a clue the blond driver shrugged his shoulders important is it to me it is i want to know if anybody worked on the wreckage between the time of the crash yesterday and this morning apart from these two mechanics nobody as far as i know kilby replied the key was in its usual place in the house if anybody wanted it it was there for the taking so i gather mark slade raised his voice so that the mechanics busy on the replacement car could hear him also well from now onwards i am keeping the key i shall be sleeping in here with the cars so if anybody wants to work on them they wont be hindered it shouldnt make any difference to anybody the acetylene torch was switched off wylie laid it down and looked at slade the dark lenses screening his eyes but that did little to disguise the resentment which exuded from him even before he spoke and who the bloody hell dyou think you are he snarled im the chief mechanic here kilbys driving at riverside what he says goes nobody else is going to bugger us about the keys kept in the house if you dont like it you can go and get your cards slades voice was quiet yet its impact was like a whiplash miss hammertons orders somebodys trying to stop us from competing at riverside and im here to see that they dont succeed from now onwards youll do as i say and it wont interfere with the work in any way got it four pairs of eyes were fixed on slade surprise resentment certainly animosity from wylie he could not be sure about kilby clyde wouldnt like it either if anybody wants to get out nows the time slade looked at each of them in turn well im driving at riverside kilbys reply was a challenge in itself i know slade said and its my job to see that you get there in one piece just dont hinder the work wylie turned away abruptly switching on his welding gear concealing his hatred behind a barrier of dazzling light fogg and wagstaffe pulled their goggles down again mark slade left the workshop and made his way back towards the house the gloves were off now everybody knew how they stood but that did not solve the mystery of the missing trackrod there was no doubt in his mind now that the car had been sabotaged someone had deliberately tried to kill him and that person had returned sometime during the night to remove all evidence of his crime seamark cruises well from now onwards mark slade vowed security was going to be much tighter if they made a second attempt they wouldnt find it quite so easy as they had done on the previous occasion lee hammerton was in her late fathers study mark slade entered closing the door behind him his gaze sweeping over the shelves of dusty calfbound volumes on the far wall the ornately carved desk the mahogany guncupboard lee herself and finally coming to rest on the blueblack automatic pistol which she held in her hand she smiled and held it out towards him butt foremost this do there was uncertainty bordering on fear in her voice bullets dont stop spooks though she attempted a laugh but it failed he took it from her and examined it weighing it in his hand one and a half pounds of solid streamlined death seven inches in length an international police weapon as well as being adaptable to any other purpose the cold steel was strangely soothing giving him a sensation of equality against the odds which he faced john brownings belgium model was the choice of many craig hammerton had obviously given some thought to its purchase maybe he knew one day he might need it hope i dont have to use it he checked the unopened box of ammunition on the desk breaking the seal to ensure that the carton was full i hope you dont too she moved close to him taking the pistol and laying it on the desk she slipped her arms around him i dont like this business at all mark she shuddered her head ached and her pulses were drumming like the hooves of a horse a crazed beast of death neither do i he smiled at her and i dont think even you guessed that the going would get so rough when you hired me the name of mark slade wont frighten em off thats certain well just have to hope that they wont be so keen on getting in the way of hot lead from a browning otherwise youd better get ready to call the police in no she said not that well make it by the way the tracking has been removed from the wrecked chevy my god her fingernails dug into him how it has the makings of an inside job someone was evidently busy in the workshop during the night any chance of an outsider getting the key from the hall theyd have to know where it was kept the doors are all locked at night a lock is no obstacle to a trained housebreaker where do the team sleep the west wing they wouldnt necessarily hear anything but you surely dont think that theres a link man he concluded well its a possibility that cannot be overlooked at this stage one thing weve got to remember is that were not up against a bit of skulduggery and burglary whoever fixed your car intended to kill me he would have done so if id been going flat out as he no doubt assumed i would be it was only the fact that i was cruising at between thirty and forty milesperhour below maximum speed that im here now what are you going to do well as ive already told you im not going to be very far away from those cars and im going to check the rebuilding stage by stage wylie and fogg wont like that but i cant take any chances i think the car will be the primary target if they sabotage this one were really lumbered thats why im going to mooch about the grounds a bit after dark i could be a sitting duck in the workshop and ill take charge of the key from this moment on the mechanics will probably want to work until ten or eleven each night theyll have to in fact if were going to meet the deadline ill lock the shed up then whether im inside or outside in the meantime ill turn in and get some rest ill need all the sleep lean get ill be around if you want me she kissed him and disengaged herself slade went upstairs to his room his head was throbbing again and he doubted very much whether he would sleep much lee hammerton remained in the study reclining in the leather upholstered swivel chair eyes closed her thoughts centred on slade she was uneasy a kind of premonition that something was going to happen she wondered if either her father or her brother had felt this way or her fated ancestors she started as the door swung open moving noiselessly on its welloiled hinges expelling her breath in a loud sigh of relief as she recognised the tail debonair figure of john clyde sorry if i startled you he moved into the room leaving the door open behind him i thought id better have a word with you slades been throwing his weightaround in the workshop the mechanics dont like it and neither do i for that matter the last thing we want is an atmosphere of friction if were going to get that car ready in time well theyll have to put up with it she snapped hes acting on my orders hes been telling them hes taking charge of the key and that hell be sleeping in there at nights thats right damn it hes making a melodrama out of the whole thing just because he crashed he didnt crash the car was fixed sabotaged now somebodys nicked the tracking making sure that not the slightest trace was left of their crime somebody took the key from the hall and got in the workshop last night john how do the explain that except by admitting that somebodys after our blood the hell they did clyde stroked his angular jaw and leaned up against the desk seamark cruises arent pulling any punches or maybe it isnt them at all justin was killed through no apparent mechanical fault you dont need to remind me john lee hammerton paled so were my ancestors jasper hammerton and his son i keep trying to tell myself that its seamark behind it all but too many unexplained things have been happening lately i think you made a mistake by bringing mark slade here clyde became sullen if he was going to drive for us then fair enough but all he seems to be doing at the moment is attracting trouble and alienating the men we need him john we havent got time to keep looking over our shoulders after all we dont want to involve the police do we no clyde stepped back towards the open door but apart from a couple of telephone threats nothing happened until slade arrived maybe theres a link the managers lower lip curled in a leer meaning well somebody removed that tracking it was slade who crashed the car weve only his word for what happened youre being ridiculous john lee hammertons voice carried a note of anger td take his word for anything no matter what and hes in charge of security precautions please remember that youve enough to do with all the arrangements for riverside and we hope daytona theres an awful lot wants doing to this place as well the sooner those contractors move in the better ill like it god id like to sell up move somewhere else shake the hammerton dust off my heels i phoned them this morning he halfturned in the doorway they cant make it before the spring at the earliest well get on to somebody else ive shopped around theres no chance of getting anybody any earlier lee was seething with anger as she listened to the receding footsteps of her general manager john clyde was invaluable yet at times he could be exceedingly exasperating all the same she needed him almost as much as she needed mark slade but for a different reason she rose and went outside the rain clouds of the previous day had disappeared leaving in their wake a blue sky and sunlight which glinted on the rich brown foliage of autumn dead leaves rustled beneath her feet in the freshening breeze she turned easterly away from the house heading in the opposite direction to the circuit for once she wanted to divorce herself from the atmosphere of motorracing the giant chestnut trees in the horseshoeshaped wood dominated the scene the remaining leaves a mixture of yellow golden and dark brown as they prepared to surrender to the encroaching winter only the tall pines never seemed to alter their greenery defying the severest weather one or two bent and twisted into grotesque shapes one in particular bearing evidence of its stamina struck by lightning at some time and then whilst still struggling to survive it had been almost uprooted by a freak gale yet it still lived a crippled veteran soldier refusing to lie down and die in a way it reminded her of mark slade never knowing when it was beaten a fit of nostalgia assailed her as she took the winding path beneath the tall trees nobody had come here regularly since her father and justin had shot this very covert somewhere a cock pheasant shouted as though declaring the place a sanctuary mocking her reminding her of happier times she made a detour to avoid a wall of cruel briars treading a narrow track which led through some rhododendrons and silver birch finally arriving back on the main ride woodpigeons clattered noisily out of the branches above alarmed at this intrusion of their daily tranquillity suddenly she stopped listening footsteps somebody was following her walking quickly heedless of clinging brambles and obstructing bracken fear gripped her never before had she encountered anybody upon these infrequent solitary rambles there was a disturbing urgency about the others movements as though whoever it was had followed her stealthily into the heart of the wood and now there was no further need for furtive progress she was trapped ahead of her lay the remainder of the wood outside of which was an expanse of grassland with no human habitation in sight behind her instinct was to run but her reasoning told her that it was futile she turned and stood with her back to the knotted trunk of a centuryold oak tree trembling not so much as a broken bough with which to defend herself the foolishness of wandering alone in the grounds had not even occurred to her now it was too late she thought of mark slade asleep in his bed and wished vainly that he could have been with her her pursuer was close now barely ten yards away crashing through the undergrowth breathing heavily only a bend in the path obscuring him from her vision then she saw him and the sight of those offwhite greasestained overalls brought a gasp of relief to her lips and a weakness to her legs so that they almost refused to support her weight steve kilby her cry was strangled her fingernails digging into the bark of the tree lee he was breathless after the distance he had covered in spite of his fitness his face was flushed hair awry eyes darting from side to side as though he feared either pursuit or a hidden watcher there was a desperation about him which she had never seen before lee ive got to talk to you well you could have spoken to me in the house without scaring me half to death out here she was fast recovering from her brief ordeal and now anger was flooding over her what the hells up with you steve i want to know whats going on he gulped his chest heaving what on earth dyou mean this slade guy ok i can accept orders even from him but theres something between you two youre sleeping together and who told you that kilbys gaze dropped to the carpet of leaves on which both of them stood i heard he said who from does it really matter yes it does i own this place and im damned if im going to stand for all and sundry poking their noses into my business all right all right he drew the back of his hand across his forehead it was john clyde who told me how the hell does he know ive no idea but you know clyde as well as i do snooping about the place at all times missing nothing what if we did spend the night together its got nothing to do with anybody else even you kilby bit his lip and lee sensed a lessening of his aggression ok so im just peeved about it can you blame me i told you we were through steve as far as thats concerned anyway because of slade no youd never met him before and yet within three days youre sleeping with him correction i spent one night with him from now on hell be sleeping with the cars and whos going to drive at riverside you are steve ill believe it when im at the wheel ive been kicked out of your bed so im fully expecting to be booted out of the driving seat you neednt worry about that slade doesnt want to drive in an iroc so he says i know him he wont i had to chivvy him into doing that testlap you want to think yourself lucky steve if youd been driving youdve been killed because youdve been going much faster mark slades determined to make the break hes here as troubleshooter thats all and god knows we need him and as your lover kilby added that remains to be seen i just want to know how i stand as you always have number one driver to the hammerton team if you want to quit i wont stop you but i hope you wont steve kilby shuffled his feet in the dead leaves looking down at them im staying he said just keep slade off my back thats all i ask hes in charge of security precautions her dark eyes bored into his and your job is to qualify at riverside maybe win at daytona thats the way it is no compromises he nodded and without further comment turned and retraced his steps walking slowly deep in thought lee hammerton waited a few minutes before she followed him she was badly shaken it might not have been kilby who had followed her into the wood the night was dark and starless unbroken black cloud moving in from the west the wind had strengthened since dusk and when it dropped slade knew that it would rain he was grateful for the thickness of the poloneck sweater its charcoal grey blending with the shadows and rendering him almost invisible the weight of the automatic in his hippocket was comforting and crouching in the bushes from where he could see the lighted window of the workshop he sensed a distinct advantage it was almost like laying an ambush providing that the enemy was human he shook off a shudder he must not let his imagination run riot the automatic was fully loaded and there were spare cartridges in his other pocket he wondered whether he would use the weapon and if so how discriminately no man can lightly consider the prospect of killing a fellow human even a murderer warning shots maybe he did not know he would not until it came to the crunch he knew that frank wylie was in there alone working on the second chevy slade had looked in earlier and told him he would lock up later ill be around slade had said put the light out when youve finished wylie had just nodded not even sarcasm it went deeper than that now resentment certainly possibly hatred slade changed position seeking refuge from the wind behind the trunk of a lone elm from here he could still see the lighted window occasionally the chief mechanic as he crossed behind it slade made a mental note to go into town the following morning and buy some more substantial footwear sneakers were not ideal for outdoor vigils on an autumn night his thoughts moved on to fogg and wagstaffe he wondered why they were not assisting wylie as far as he knew neither had left the house they were staying in their rooms rather than doing a stint of overtime another case of resentment but against whom himself or wylie the present attitude of the hammerton team was not conducive to winning an international race of champions maybe it was ail his own fault kilby too where was he had slade been in the drivers position he would have been constantly at wylies side supervising learning noting the way every iroc specification was built into that engine it was the only way to win a driver had to regard his car as a wife living with it sleeping with it trying to understand the way it responded to his every touch kilbys was a lukewarm relationship slade told himself that it was none of his business it wasnt his job to win an iroc for lee hammerton he just had to get her there and back safely all the same he could not stop himself from thinking about her the beginning of an arousement which he fought to dispel erotic dreams had been the downfall of more than one sentry over the years altering the whole course of battles then he stiffened the night was black but something to his left was even blacker darker than the shadows cast across the chipped forecourt in front of the house a bush swaying in the wind there were no bushes in that direction only a crumbling ornamental wall slades eyes narrowed trying to penetrate the gloom he wondered if craig hammerton had ever used infrared binoculars if so he would borrow them tomorrow a break in the cloud formation so slight that it permitted barely a couple of seconds of faint starlight but it was enough for slade there was somebody crouching along that wall creeping steadily in the direction of the workshop slade was already moving forward keeping to the edge of the bushes testing each step before he put his full weight on the ground scuffling dead twigs aside with his toe knowing that any sound he made would be carried on the wind to the intruder his hand rested on the butt of the automatic still in his pocket the night surged back again darker than ever the wind lashing spots of rain onto his unprotected head he could no longer see the intruder but he knew he was there instinctively slade was circling taking a course that would bring him up to that wall he would follow it along come up behind the man and then slade never got round to working out what he would do when he closed in on the other he was still ten yards from the furthermost end of the wall when a crushing weight descended on his back throwing him onto the cracked paving slabs powerful arms pinioning his own his face grazed by the rough surface temporarily dazed he tasted blood and then his reflexes took over his assailant was large and powerful pulling slades arms behind his back kneeling on his legs strength like that could snap a mans neck once the arms were pinioned freeing the initial hold and and leaving a hand spare for the coup de grace slade relaxed every nerve in his body a deliberate feint his attacker grunted in surprise leaning forward it was at that moment that mark slade tensed and powered backwards using every muscle above the waist his head catapulting upwards a sharp crack as bone met bone the crushing of a nose the relaxing of the hold and a sharp cry of pain slade scrambled to his knees rolling over again as a wild blow caught him on the shoulder as he fell he kicked out and had the satisfaction of feeling the toe of a sneaker sink deeply into a fleshy area within that patch of darkest shadow the other fell back and lay still slade dropped into a crouch as heavy footsteps came towards him the man by the wall was coming to the aid of his colleague get the bastard a nasal croak from the one on the ground who was now struggling up into a sitting position then slade remembered his gun his hand dropped to his hippocket closed over the serrated butt and for a brief second he did not know whether he was capable of drawing a gun on another man a stab of flame showed in the darkness a slug whined viciously a foot or so to the right of his body followed almost immediately by a crashing report heavier than a probably a slade pulled his pistol clear of the pocket in one fast coordinated movement thumb pushing forward the safety catch finger squeezing the trigger two reports almost instantaneous both men firing wildly blindly angrily another bullet sang its heavy message of death above his head the gunman had fired at the answering flash slade held his fire it would have been all too easy to shoot the man on the ground but the exdriver would probably have paid the supreme penalty a split second later he waited not moving where are you fred ere the bleeders broke me nose keep still ill get him slade was tempted to shoot in the direction of the second thugs voice but he could not be sure whether the man was standing up or crouching he would not get a second chance a bullet would answer the flash of his gun if he missed he waited lights came on in the house at the rear of the two attackers silhouetting them plainly easy targets from where mark slade crouched and they could not see him he raised his pistol supporting his right wrist with his left hand taking a bead holding his breath pistol practice in the forces had never been as easy as this squeeze he chickened out of the second pressure he let his breath out in a gush and lowered his weapon murder wasnt his line he couldnt do it both men were on their feet now glancing in the direction of the house where people were appearing in the lighted doorway slade recognised clyde with fogg and wagstaffe close behind him lee was peering over their shoulders only steve kilby was missing the workshop door was pulled back too and frank wylie was standing in the open shielding his eyes in an effort to see what was happening clyde was running forward the others following slade brought up his gun again and he knew full well that if either of the silhouetted gunmen attempted to shoot he would gun them down he would murder to prevent murder come on fred dont lets ang around the larger of the two was clasping his hands to his face as he broke into an ungainly run after the other slade stood watching until the night had swallowed them up the wind and driving rain masking all sounds of their retreat he slipped his gun back into his pocket maybe he could have stopped them but only by either shooting them down or else risking a gun battle in which stray bullets would rake the surrounding area and lee hammerton was amongst the advancing party whats happening john clyde came to a halt only a couple of yards from slade head thrust forward cautious apprehensive couple of guys tried to shoot me slade walked towards the others they missed are you all right mark lee rushed forward pushing ahead of her manager right enough slade wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and tasted blood again theyve gone and theres no point in trying to follow them anway were all getting soaked so lets go back inside therell be nothing more doing out here tonight wheres kilby mark slade asked as lee bathed his grazed face in the bathroom he went into town earlier she found some sticking plaster and taped a strip over a cut on the bridge of his nose as she worked she told him of her meeting in the woods with her exlover he hates my guts slade winced at the stinging sensation of tcp lotion but that doesnt excuse his absence his job is in the workshop with wylie twentyfour hours a day if necessary fogg and wagstaffe too theyll knuckle down to it lee said just let this little rebellion blow itself out i dont want to antagonise them further anyway what dyou reckon those thugs had in mind tonight well they were heading for the sheds and they were armed one can only conclude that it was a fullscale onslaught to put us out of business and they were most certainly outsiders lee cut another strip of adhesive plaster they were slade admitted a couple of tame gorillas obeying orders but who sent em its the guys behind it i want lee those two have been sent packing but ill warrant there are plenty more where they came from we cant afford to relax for one minute one consolation at least the enemy is tangible lee hammerton did not reply for her the night hid a thousand inexplicable terrors which it was impossible to explain to mark slade chapter eight slade was in town shortly after nine oclock on the following morning he parked lee hammertons alfa romeo close to the busy shopping precinct and then set about purchasing his various needs without delay he did not like being away from the hammerton estate subconsciously he experienced a feeling of guilt over his absence logically he had to admit to himself there was little chance of their enemies attempting anything in broad daylight yet it was the unknown factor which worried him the feeling that they had a spy a saboteur in their midst there was always the possibility also that there were two separate forces working against them they were not even certain that the nocturnal gunmen had been sent by seamark cruises it was a strong possibility but there was no proof the most worrying of all recent happenings as far as slade was concerned was the overnight removal of the tracking from the wrecked chevy camaro either it was a deliberate attempt to kill him by a member of the hammerton team and most of them held a personal grudge against him or else it was a diabolically clever and daring plot by a rival team seamark cruises heading the list of suspects a third alternative was a combination of the two a saboteur in the pay of the opposition who worked with hammerton and knew their every move slade bought a pair of thick rubbersoled outdoor shoes incorporating both solidity and stealth a navy blue anorak which would provide excellent camouflage during the nocturnal hours and returned to the parked car he felt strangely naked without the comforting weight of the automatic pistol in his hippocket but it would have served no purpose and been extremely unwise to have carried it in a public place the last thing he wanted was to invite the attention of the law the traffic was heavy in that small market town a newly installed oneway system creating additional confusion amongst motorists and it was fully twenty minutes before he was on the country road again heading back the way he had come he maintained a steady thirtyfive mph there were no other vehicles in sight but he was reluctant to increase his foot pressure on the accelerator every nerve in his body was rigid and at each bend he slowed perceptibly the old fears were back again a slow climbing tenseness bringing with it the memories of the crash on the hammerton circuit the uncontrollable zigzag course the impact the heat and the smoke evil elfin laughter mocking him inside his own brain now it was a thousand times more vivid the purring of the engine bringing it all home to him crawling round bends sweating he noticed a car approaching from behind seeing it first in the offside wingmirror then watching it in the driving mirror a beige hillman avenger characterless a fellow shopper perhaps a company representative there was nothing to distinguish it from a thousand other cars on the road except the way it hung back slade had dropped to thirty mph and only then did the sweating ease up he wiped his clammy hands on his trousers and focused his attention on the car at his rear it could easily have overtaken him he could see the two men in the front seats hunched shapes behind the green sunvisor faceless somehow sinister the avenger increased its speed on a stretch of straight road and now it was barely twenty yards behind him there was ample space and opportunity for the driver to overtake the slowmoving alfa romeo but still it maintained its steady course it was only then that realisation dawned upon mark slade that he was being followed he sensed it and began to sweat again he knew that he could have outdistanced the avenger in a matter of minutes that would have been all too easy but it would not have served any purpose the men would come again probably under cover of darkness he wished that he had put the automatic in the car unarmed and helpless his only weapon was speed something which he feared almost as much as another attack a movement from the vehicle behind caught his eye in the mirror the man in the passenger seat had the window down and was leaning out arm extended a snubnosed blueblack object clenched in his fist a pistol aimed at the alfa romeo slade ducked accelerating at the same instant not hearing the shot only the shattering of his rear window followed by something ploughing into the facia and the splintering of glass as the speedometer disintegrated the car responded immediately but as it built up speed the alfa romeo was swerving crazily slade wrenched on the wheel having to use sheer force to prevent the vehicle from plunging into the hedge on the opposite side of the road bringing it back nearside wheels on the soft grass verge slewing again fighting desperately for control he knew that the second shot had hit the rear offside tyre two more slugs whistled through the smashed window ripping into the upholstery one jarring his body as it lodged in the back of the drivers seat the alfa romeo skidded sideways again and slade knew that he could control it no more the front wheels struck the verge and bounced upwards a slowmotion replay of the disastrous last ride of lee hammertons number one chevy camaro it embarked upon a downhill course bumping its way down a steep grassy bank miraculously not overturning tearing its way through a straggling hawthorn hedge ripping the obstructing stools out of their roots then came to a halt still upright in a field of growing swedes mark slade was out of the car in an instant glancing behind him seeing the avenger parked on the roadway two men emerging a thickset one and a smaller thinner one both had automatics slade ran away from the road taking an erratic course falling and stumbling through the closelysown slippery swedes in danger of spraining an ankle at any second two more shots rang out resonant reports which echoed in the quiet of the countryside whining slugs cutting through the foliage around his feet desperation spurred him to even greater efforts he knew that with every yard he put between himself and his attackers the better were his chances of escaping unscathed a is inaccurate at a range in excess of twenty yards unless in the hands of a skilled marksman and these men were shooting wildly only an unlucky bullet would bring him down but luck it seemed these days was not a plentiful commodity in the hammerton camp he bounded on slipped picked himself up and wished that he had changed out of his sneakers into his new shoes which would have given him a better foothold he glanced behind him as he ran the men were through the hedge and into the field stopping to reload which gave him an advantage of several yards he had no alternative but to keep on running the field was a large one possibly fifteen acres sloping gently upwards to where a long narrow wood stood on the horizon some two hundred yards away it was his only chance perhaps he could lose his pursuers in there if a bullet did not cut him down before he reached it they continued to follow him but now they were not shooting almost as though they were confident of running him down a pack of hounds knowing the exact course which their quarry will take aware that it will be a simple matter to run the fleeing fox to earth in a blind covert slade was breathing heavily by the time he reached the wood one last look behind him revealed that his pursuers were about eighty yards away picking their way carefully through the thickly sown swedes not hurrying he pushed on into the wood the rides were well looked after trimmed and levelled by heavy machinery the undergrowth on either side dense and straggling flattened in places where teams of beaters had forced their way through on shooting days an unpleasant aroma assailed his nostrils reminiscent of decaying flesh as though some wounded animal had crawled in here to die subconsciously he noted that it came from masses of fungi black with flies a variety known as stinkhorn which grows in dank woodlands it gave off a stench like decomposing corpses and he shuddered uncontrollably instinctively he was making a detour determined to get away from the main ride brambles clutching viciously at his trousers ripping through the material tearing the skin as he paused to extricate himself from a length of pernicious briar he heard the two men entering the wood they made no attempt at stealth it was unnecessary guns at the ready they would brash out every square inch until they flushed their prey slade realised the importance of silence on his own part perhaps he had made a mistake by seeking sanctuary in this covert and his best chance would have been to run the gauntlet of fire in the open relying on his own fitness to enable him to outdistance his pursuers it was too late now any further progress would reveal his position for it was impossible to move quietly amidst clinging brambles and dying bracken there was no chance of moving swiftly he dropped to his knees and then gently eased his body down onto the ground lying full length he could hear his heart pounding wildly like some form of jungle telegraph bracken and briars shielded him temporarily the gunmen were systematic in their search they did not plunge immediately upon the course he had taken instead they retreated to the furthest point of the wood broke off branches with which to beat down the undergrowth and began to advance slowly fifteen yards or so apart their step measured automatics at the ready slade tried to work out a plan and gave it up he was as helpless as though he had been trapped in the car when it had left the road one man perhaps he could have surprised and overpowered but not two spaced as they were always within sight of each other he cursed himself for having left his own automatic behind shots out here would go unnoticed they were all part of the rural scene nobody would pay the slightest attention to them he raised his head slightly and experienced a surge of relief the searchers had passed by the nearest one the big fellow some twenty yards away but slades exultation was little more than a temporary reprieve they were sweeping round again in a circle which would bring them up on his side of the wood pheasants clattered in alarm striking up through the branches and gliding down to the swede field below surprised no doubt that no charges of shot followed their escape mark slade pressed himself flat his face against the soft ground he had virtually resigned himself to death as surely as if he faced a firingsquad another five yards and they would spot him they would gun him down where he lay five seconds of life left his thoughts turned to yvonne and lee hammerton there were an awful lot of things he would have liked to clear up unsaid words which would never be spoken now it was too late he could hear the heavy asthmatic breathing of the large man a metallic click the safety catch of the being pushed forward slade closed his eyes tightly he would not hear the report you never heard the one that got you hed read somewhere one split second of pain and then oblivion easy nothing to be frightened of really he braced himself holding his breath a shattering report deafening echoing crazy he should not have heard it nor the echoes neither did he feel anything he did not move perhaps the first shot had missed he prepared himself for the second amazed that he was not afraid of dying after all two shots almost simultaneous one close the other some distance away acrid fumes that had him choking even as he opened his eyes and turned his head dont move keep right there or ill blast you to hell slades expression was one of blank astonishment his brain was incapable of coping with the situation the big gunman lay face downwards only a yard or so away a hole the size of a hubplate in his left side the wound jagged and deep the fawn mackintosh splattered with crimson a sound to slades left attracted his attention the second man was running stumbling clutching at trees for support face and clothing bloodied staggering somehow managing to keep going a third man a total stranger dominated the scene tall well over six feet he was clad in a suit of loosefitting plusfours thick kneelength stockings accentuating the bagginess of the trousers his features were clean cut and weather beaten a floppy porkpie hat casting a shadow over the upper part of his face slades attention though was focused on the longbarrelled shotgun the wisps of smoke trickling from the muzzle noting the expertise with which two spent cases were flipped from the breech and replaced by live cartridges all in the same movement a gunman but of a different kind a gamekeeper you guys came to the wrong place the gamekeepers voice was loaded with menace the gun barrels trained unwaveringly on mark slade poachins one thing but when somebody comes to my woods with fortyfives they gotta be taught a lesson specially when they gets ideas about shootin at me this ones ad it tother wont get far now i reckon youd better get to your feet mister move slowly nothin sudden then well take a walk back to my place and fetch the cops in to clean this little lot up selfdefence thats what it was i gotta right to defend meself now aint i confidence starting to drain with the awful realisation of what he had done slade detected a slight change of attitude in the other this man had killed ruthlessly in the heat of battle and now he was beginning to give some thought to the consequences im not with them slade said as he began to walk ahead of the keeper they were going to kill me birds of a feather the other grunted none of you woulda been up ere if youd been up to any good still the policell sort it out now walk a bit quicker and keep your ands where i can see em it was a full twenty minutes before they came in sight of the gamekeepers cottage a small stone building situated beneath a grassy knoll surrounded by kennels housing barking dogs and rows of empty pens which had contained pheasant poults throughout the summer months a youth wearing a red and blue checked shirt and mauve jeans came towards them the facial resemblance between father and son was only too obvious to slade you got one of em then dad the younger man welcomed any form of excitement which broke the monotony of daily game keeping duties aye and theres a couple more up in the coldharbour wood the gamekeeper did not go into details take this and watch this feller carefully keep im ere and dont let im get too close any trouble in the legs they aint just ordinary poachers ill phone the police the youth seized the offered twelvebore eagerly snapping back the hammers and slade experienced a sense of acute uneasiness he did not like the way the barrels were trained on his chest nor the manner in which those adolescent hands trembled with nervous excitement take it easy kid he spoke softly hoping to reassure the other tm not going anywhere and that gun might go off if youre not careful itll bloody well go off if youre not careful the gamekeepers son spat with contempt some of the spittle landing on the barrels of the gun just stand still and maybe youll be all right slade tried to relax he could hear the gamekeeper talking inside the house but he could not discern the words he did not need to he knew only too well what was being said five minutes later much to mark slades relief the gamekeeper came back outside and took the gun from his son copsll be here in a few minutes he spoke gruffly ambulance as well in the meantime we just wait out here within ten minutes both police and ambulance had arrived a cream and red austin westminster crime car containing four uniformed officers and a volvo saloon with a detectiveinspector and two cid men in plainclothes after a brief consultation with the gamekeeper the youth was instructed to lead all but the senior officer and a detective up to coldharbour wood the ambulance followed in the wake of the volvo bumping over the rough bridle path which led up from the keepers cottage the detectiveinspector a thickset pallid humourless individual motioned to slade and the gamekeeper to step inside the cottage the interior was sparsely furnished the daylight restricted by the small windows the quarried floor uncarpeted slade wondered where the gamekeepers wife was perhaps he was a widower or else divorced the place certainly showed the absence of female household organisation your face seems familiar sir the cid inspector scrutinised slade closely his brow furrowed as though trying to recollect photographs from criminal files slade the exdriver winced wondering if he would ever be able to slip into obscurity it would certainly take time mark slade not the mark slade i guess theres only one unfortunately ah yes of course sir youve changed somewhat since i last saw you on telly but id recognise you anywhere that beard youre growing had me fooled for a moment the detectiveconstable produced a notepad and ballpoint pen every movement swift an exaggerated alertness designed to lower the morale of those whom he interviewed a young man no more than twentytwo or three his uniform already discarded and eager for further promotion now sir the inspector turned to the gamekeeper perhaps you would care to give us a statement first if we could just have your name walter jackson the guardian of the fields and coverts responded with a new sense of selfimportance i was out lookin at me traps when i card some shots from down by the road i says to meself thems poachers walter and as i went to investigate the pheasants started gettin up out o coldharbour wood so i says to meself walter the buggers are in there after your pheasants i went into the wood moving quiet like and all of a sudden i saw them two blokes which two the two that are in the wood now sir they both ad guns pistols the one the big feller saw me and turned and ad a crack at me christ i felt the wind from that slug past me cheek so i give im a barrel there and then e dropped and is mate was just takin a bead on me so i give it im too i see the inspector glanced at the constable who was writing furiously and how does mr slade figure in this e was with em the gamekeeper turned towards slade with a gloating expression on his face lyin in the bracken e was oping i wouldnt see im but i spotted im and thats why es ere now had he got a gun didnt appear to ave jackson answered with a note of disappointment could ave id it or throwed it away though i see the officer regarded slade steadily perhaps you can explain your presence in the wood mr slade theres nothing much to it slade was grateful that he had not been carrying the after all im working with the hammerton team now and i was just on my way back there from town when this hillman avenger came up behind me and started shooting they burst both my rear tyres and i went off the road and into a field of swedes the men were still shooting at me so i made a run for it i thought id dodge em in that wood but it was soon clear that i hadnt much chance of getting away then mr jackson appeared on the scene and there was a bit of a shootout one fellow was killed and the other got away but he was hit badly hmm the cid man seated himself on the corner of the scrubbed table and began to fill a blackened briar pipe with long stranded tobacco from a polythene pouch and why did these men attack you mr slade ive no idea youve cut yourself theres sticking plaster on your face i took a knock in the workshops have you any idea who these men are not a clue ive never seen em before they were interrupted by the sound of vehicles the police had returned already jacksons son following the plainclothes officer who came in to make his report nasty mess up there sir ive cordoned it off and left wilson up there sir a nasty job no sign of the second fellow check the road banks a hillman avenger you said mr slade what colour registration number beige i didnt get the number a pity nevertheless banks get down there and see if the cars gone mr slades car will have to be checked by the forensic experts so nothing must be moved the inspector made a telephone call to his office his tone was abrupt authoritative as he asked for more men to be sent out any chance of me going back to the hammerton place slade asked ive told you all i know and i dont reckon i can do much more by staying here hmm the other was determined to make a major concession of his agreement to slades request i suppose not but of course we shall have to interview you again also there will be an inquest so i hope youre not thinking of going anywhere in the near future im not going anywhere and right now i dont even have a car to get me back to the hammerton place the one in the field incidentally is miss hammertons i was using it ill get someone to run you back but youll have to hang around until banks returns sergeant banks returned within a quarter of an hour tightlipped shaking his head as he entered the cottage no sign of the car sir the avenger i mean not a trace not even a tyre track the alfa romeo has undoubtedly got some slugs embedded in it one looks to have lodged in the back of the drivers seat i see the inspector lit his pipe for the third time well we cant do much more until the experts have gone over everything in the meantime banks perhaps youd take mr slade back to the hammerton place my god lee hammerton buried her face in her hands as slade concluded his story in the study its not safe to go outside they deliberately tried to murder you in broad daylight that much is only too plain slades expression was grim either they got a tipoff that id gone into town or else they were watching this place saw me leave followed me and struck on the way back look mark lee rested her hand in his i cant ask you to stay on any longer were up against something far bigger than i even dreamed of when i asked for your help three days and youve escaped death three times out there on the track the gunmen in the night and now this look why dont you just go back to crossways and forget that the hammerton team ever existed i had no right to ask you to come here the old curse has come back with a vengeance its got nothing to do with the hammerton curse you or yvonne now his voice trembled and his lips were compressed into a thin bloodless line these bastards have crashed me twice not to mention shooting at me and somebodys going to have to pay for that i let a man escape because i didnt know whether or not i could gun anybody down or if i did whether id be able to live with myself afterwards i know now god help the next guy who gives me a chance to put a slug in his skull maybe theyll ease up a bit now that theyve failed to kill you i hope to christ they dont he squeezed her hand until she almost cried out such was the intensity of his grip anyway now youve got the cops horning in on it whether you like it or not how much do we tell them enough but not too much dont forget they may well question the team we cant hide the fact that the first chevy crashed but we can leave them to draw their own conclusions from that im also certain in my own mind that the two guys who tried to rub me out in that wood were the same two who came here in the night a desperate last throw maybe before reporting back to their boss seamark id go along with you there but im not satisfied that its quite as straightforward as it seems even if they have got one of their own mob planted in here i get the feeling that this whole things too deep for just seamark dont ask me why its just a hunch but i intend to stick around and find out as for those two thugs ones copped it and the other wont be taking much interest in things for a while they might have wrecked one of our cars but were also taking toll of their ranks even if we did have to rope in a triggerhappy gamekeeper to help us unwittingly now i could do with something to eat and some shuteye before i get any more interruptions from either cops or robbers chapter nine mark slade was awakened from a heavy slumber by lee hammerton in the late afternoon the police are here she leaned over him their lips touching theyve interviewed me and everybody else as well theyve been pretty helpful really and they also seem to think that somebody is out to stop us getting to the states ive dropped the name seamark cruises to them with a loud clang and theyre going to make a few enquiries and good luck to em if they can find anything out slade grinned wryly seamark is a pastmaster at covering up they want to see you again ill be right down she waited whilst he dressed and then accompanied him downstairs detectiveinspector king and his assistant the cid constable who had taken slades statement earlier that day were in the study they nodded but neither smiled you didnt tell me youd had a brush with a couple of thugs recently kings tone was reproaching neither did you mention that you had crashed on a testdrive it wasnt a testdrive slade snapped i was merely getting the feel of the car over a couple of laps which you didnt finish a fault with the tracking and very conveniently for somebody that tracking has disappeared there may be no connection we think there is also weve identified the dead man thats interesting anybody we know it depends in which social circles you mix his real name is fred hine in londons east end hes known as the snipe served a fiveyear stretch for manslaughter the line between murder and manslaughter is so fine these days that its an even bet which side one lands on a hired gun in melodramatic terms not very clever and not a particularly good marksman either we wanted to question him about another shooting but i guess its too late for that now he had a partner a tall thin guy known as benny the leg according to walter jacksons description of the second man in coldharbour wood it was benny all right id give anything to know just where hes gone to ground we picked up the hillman avenger in colney heath it was reported stolen in hertford yesterday the drivers seat was saturated with blood so benny has the choice of either dying in hiding or else seeking medical attention and being picked up well just have to wait and see by the way mr slade you were until recently seamark cruises number one driver thats right tell me the inspector paused to light his pipe yet again why did you leave a successful team and if youll forgive me for saying so join an almost unknown one the implication the suspicion was not lost on slade id finished with seamark before i came here i quit driving yet youre still driving im not here as a driver you were at the wheel of miss hammertons car when it crashed youve got it all wrong inspector irritation was creeping into mark slades voice i was merely doing a very casual couple of laps or almost because she asked me to i have no intention of ever driving a racing car again then why have you joined the hammerton team im here in an advisory capacity temporarily after we get back from the states ill be leaving i see king picked up his hat and dropped his stubborn pipe into the pocket of the raincoat draped over his arm well ill be getting back to the station youll be required to attend the inquest mr slade and well let you know how our enquiries go if only we could get our hands on benny the leg whilst hes still alive wed soon find out whose pay hes in in fact an awful lot might be cleared up lee stood in the window with mark slade and watched the police car disappear from view down the drive who told king about the missing tracking slade murmured it could have been any one of the boys he interviewed them separately and hes already suspecting me of having some deep involvement with seamark cruises oh dont be ridiculous mark hes suspicious all right it figures i suppose especially to a nonracing person in his eyes i could have done a first class stuntjob written your car off faked a fight with those two thugs and whilst gaining your confidence and admiration wrecked the whole hammerton setup and i need your help more than ever now her voice was husky the last thing i wanted was the police hanging around i know the hammerton name is still on their records oh god mark this whole business is getting under my skin the family cycle of evil has come round again ill go and see how work is progressing on the car he walked towards the door times running out for everybody his flesh goosepimpled right up into the nape of his neck for the first time mark slade was beginning to believe in the hammerton curse shotgun wounds are generally more horrific in appearance than in reality except in instances where the victim has received a charge at close range at a distance of fifty yards the spread of pellets is greater than the penetration of the tiny spherical balls often they lodge in the skin cause superficial bleeding and intense discomfort but are seldom fatal except in the absence of medical attention when lead poisoning is liable to set in after three or four days benny the leg even with his limited intelligence knew that he was not going to die immediately he was weak through loss of blood and shotgun pellets were lodged in his anatomy from his shoulder blades down to his ankles he was gasping for breath when he reached the avenger on the road and as he fell into the driving seat he grunted with pain instinctively hunching himself forward so that there was less pressure on his wounds he drove fast eager to be away from the area heading towards colney heath for it was there that he and the snipe had been instructed to report after their bid to kill mark slade after a journey that seemed an eternity of blinding pain he parked the car in a side street and sat still for a while it was less than ten minutes walk to his destination but to have driven there in a stolen car would have brought the wrath of the man whom he knew as mr patterson upon his head benny the leg was well aware that he was only too conspicuous in his bloodsoaked clothing to have ventured forth would doubtless have invited the attention of passers by and then the law at one stage he was almost on the verge of panic darkness was several hours away and every minute that he remained where he was he risked discovery the seat upon which he sat was saturated with blood it dripped steadily onto the uncarpeted floor then the tartan blanket on the back seat the one which he and the snipe had used as they sat out a long nocturnal vigil gave him an idea perhaps if he carried it clumsily untidily draped over one shoulder one end trailing on the ground screening his back he could make the short journey undetected his whole body seemed to be on fire he felt dizzy and as he struggled and squelched his way out of the car he almost fainted he glanced up and down the street again there was nobody about the blanket thrown over his right shoulder he lurched off up the pavement his confidence rose his step became swifter for a short time then slowed as the pain intensified with each movement of his thin shotspattered legs it seemed an eternity before he saw the house recognising it instantly by the way it stood back from those on either side of it residential respectable to all outward appearances probably mr patterson was a wellknown public figure in this small community benny the leg slouched up the narrow gravelled drive stumbled almost fell in the extensive porch and finally located and pressed the bell with a long bloodcaked forefinger he leaned against the wall eyes closed knowing that he must fight off oblivion for another minute or two after that it would not matter mr patterson would look after him benny could even delay reporting their failure in his present predicament his senses reeled he heard footsteps approaching from somewhere inside the building then a bolt being withdrawn and the door opened benny had only seen mr patterson once before and on that occasion it had occurred to him that this vulturelike man had the bearing of a prosecuting solicitor eyes that missed nothing narrowed and darting a quick sharp tongue with a ready answer and counteranswer benny had been the recipient of such treatment in a court of law on more than one occasion and he knew that he was no match for patterson patterson did not speak he saw and understood at a glance noting the fallen bloodied blanket which told its own story he stood back motioning for benny to enter the woodentiled hall another gesture directing him towards a closed door at the far end benny tried to speak but an unintelligible gurgle rasped and died in his throat his feet slid on the polished surface and only a supporting hand of surprising strength prevented him from falling it maintained its grip leading him up to that door the other hand opening it darkness lay beyond total blackness without even a glimmer of light it offered tranquillity a haven of peace into which a wounded wild animal could crawl to lick its wounds the guiding hand was now pushing shoving benny fell forward anticipated a floor beneath him but instead found himself falling bouncing sliding falling again steps round and uneven sloped steeply downwards with no supporting handrail only smooth brickwork on either side down down twisting every bone in his body jarred the smarting wounds bringing him excruciating pain an intended scream was little more than a gurgle of frothing bloody spittle cut short by a jagged uneven surface that dug and cut into his body mounds that shifted beneath him miniature avalanches choking dust that made his eyes smart clogged his lungs and nostrils the brief shaft of light from the open doorway above vanished the click of the lock having an air of finality about it benny the leg realised that he was in a coalcellar he did not know why patterson had imprisoned him there he did not care all he wanted to do was to sleep he welcomed the drowsiness his resistance ebbing from him his paincrazed brain unable to differentiate between sleep and death he did not care anyway the long fingers of the man known as patterson trembled as he dialled the number he too was only a link in the chain but in every instance he was the first to experience the buffeting from the controlling mechanism before passing it on down to those below him the full force of it was always spent on him he was gulping and swallowing the moment those only too familiar thick nasal tones answered him his confused brain seeking an avenue of escape a means by which the blame could be laid upon another of the big mans minions he considered blaming the man lying in the coalcellar below then changed his mind he himself carried the can the boss had already made that clear he could only cringe and apologise for yet another failure fogg and wagstaffe were alone in the workshop when slade entered there was no sign of either wylie or kilby slade stood just inside the doorway watching the two mechanics at work their backs were towards him and such was their similarity of build that it was difficult to identify them individually until fogg turned round oh his expression clouded its you yes slade said its me where are wylie and kilby no idea fogg turned back to his work didnt ask slade walked across to the car and stood looking down at the halfbuilt chevy noting its rugged streamlined appearance even in the early stages of construction where are the other two this time his question was addressed to the younger man teabreak wagstaffe grinned he was not the type to harbour grudges like to check the trackin foggs invitation was muttered scarcely audible yet it held an echo of the chief mechanics sarcasm ive told you before slade snarled if you dont like taking orders from me you can get out now all right all right just dont keep getting on my back i want to check the tyre stock you guys concentrate on the car i know as well as you do how much importance is placed on tyres since ive been here nobodys mentioned them weve got it in hand goodyears they came this morning slade moved across to the tyre racks on the far wall and began to rip away the corrugated wrappings fogg and wagstaffe were ignoring him the former regarding this attention to detail as superfluous something which was left to the mechanics consultation with the driver being a mere formality riverside was ten weeks away and slade was already concerning himself with something that could have waited until a few days before their departure for the states fogg decided mark slade had a fetish about tyres he had never revealed it before perhaps not himself wholly aware of the reverence which he paid them at seamark cruises there had been no need for more than a cursory surveillance stern was a tyre fanatic knew everything there was to know about them there was no chance of the wrong tyres being fitted at any time here it was different slade lacked faith and also feared a deliberate error perhaps kilby suffering the fate at riverside which had been intended for himself by some unknown person on the hammerton circuit he was taking no chances he embarked upon a close scrutiny of the tyres all goodyears reliable the carcase material made from nylon different cord gauges according to the type of racing the cords sealed by a rubber coating designed to stop them rubbing together and causing excessive heat the tread compounds were composed of both synthetic and natural rubber carbon black oils and resins a science in itself years of research terminating in the nearperfect tyre the difference between winning and losing living or dying slade noted the crossply construction vital to formula one racing totally efficient more so even than radials crucial in areas of speed where the drivers reaction had to be instantaneous telling him a whole lot more than any set of dials and instruments in their initial use these tyres would reach optimum temperature and then undergo a slight change in structure hardening so that they began at the softest working operational level reached their peak and then exceeded it pressures generally were around psi when the tyres were hot somewhere between f it was necessary for them to be recording temperatures above f before working properly tyres running over f in the pits were running hot facts and figures that would remain with mark slade throughout his life even if he never drove again it was like swimming once one learned to swim one never forgot and that was not all tyres were not omnipotent on the circuit the weather was the deciding factor he checked to ensure that there were tyres for both dry and wet circuits slade recalled the fi in the midsixties when he was still a mechanic in the pits he wondered if they would ever succeed in manufacturing a compromise tyre it was a possibility before the advent of slicks and low profiles cars went much slower in the wet all drivers demand the ultimate and that could only be achieved when the tyre companies made optimum tyres for both wet and dry surfaces two different tyres might not seem to be the answer to the majority of drivers the ultimate was in achieving the quickest cartyre combination there were so many things that could go wrong with a tyre maybe that was the seed of fear within slade that had germinated and bloomed the knowledge that however good he was there was nothing he could do about a faulty tyre the tread might grain or shred finely on the outer surface caused by the compound not being strong enough in shear and that usually happened on abrasive surfaces or when the car was oversteering they might blister too something which generally occurred when the tyres were way over their optimum operating temperature wide tyres slade murmured his approval designed to cope with the amount of power produced by racing cars and also the stopping power demanded he remembered cars which had been run with tyres which were too wide at both front and rear and either were likely to become bogged down a tyrelimiting regulation would have been fatuous tyres had evolved according to the regulations of the cars tyres were built according to a line of chassis which displayed common traits slade knew that even these tyres the most uptodate designed especially for formula one racing would not last a full mile race as many as three sets might be necessary the tyres the chevy camaro kilby wylie fogg and wagstaffe not to mention john clyde all had to play their part to the fullest even then it might not be enough slade carried the full responsibility keeping the saboteurs at bay his was the overall responsibility he sighed partly satisfaction partly frustration the tyres were al even seamark would not have better yet the knowledge that they might never make riverside worried him it wasnt so much the seamark threat the skulduggery but rather the inexplicable happenings such as his first crash and then the removal of the tracking a kind of personal poltergeist that was forever present something he could not fight against the hammerton curse he glanced across at fogg the arrogance the sarcasm were foreign to the mechanics nature they were a coverup for something slade knew only too well what it was like to put on a front wear a false personality he had done it himself for years longer than he had realised it was the subconscious masking of fear and slade realised at that moment that chris fogg was afraid the two mens eyes met fogg was the first to drop his gaze and slade walked out into the late afternoon sunshine he wondered about a lot of things soon it would be night again a meal a change of clothes and then the long vigil would begin once more that night the sky was clear the stars shone brightly and the grass crunched beneath slades feet as he left the house there would be a heavy frost before morning he looked through the window into the workshop they were all there fogg wylie wagstaffe steve kilby and john clyde clyde was talking the others listening slade could not hear the words but he knew they concerned tyres by the way the team manager was gesticulating towards the racks of tyres from which some of the outer wrappings had been torn away mark slade moved away the automatic bumped against his hip but it was small comfort for the long cold hours which lay in front of him he decided to patrol the area in the immediate vicinity of the house and outbuildings making a wide circle which would take him parallel to the road in one place eventually bringing him back to the workshop it was a night for keeping on the move he took his time and it was fully an hour before he reached the road standing back in a clump of silver birch trees watching a stream of passing cars partially mesmerised by their headlights traffic was exceptionally heavy tonight every driver having a particular destination in mind caring not for the problems of others slade saw an mgb overtaking dangerously cutting in between two lorries pulling out again and narrowly missing an oncoming truck even as a spectator on a freezing night he felt the beads of sweat beginning to form on his forehead crazy bastard he thought he tried to understand the mentality of the driver of that sports car maybe he was playing at formula one living out his fantasies in all probability one day he would kill himself and somebody else as well nobody would know the real reason it troubled slades conscience the driver could have been emulating somebody maybe himself thats what comes of being in the top flight he decided you never know how many deaths youve got on your conscience youre responsible the sooner they forget you the better let them identify with somebody else he was moving away from the road when he heard the scream one sharp electrifying yell of terror that seemed to hang in the night air something far more sinister about it than any burst of firing he broke into a run the scream had come from the direction of the house no cars were parked on the road so whoever it was had come from the opposite direction across country he was aware of the pounding of his pulses the way his stomach knotted into a ball his legs threatened to buckle under him but he kept running it took slade less than five minutes to reach the rear of the house he stopped in amazement at the scene which greeted him he saw the hammerton team clustered outside the workshop bathed in the light from the window and the open door a huddled body was lying on the ground whats happened four heads turned at slades approach four faces portraying shock and horror the man on the ground was lying face downwards it was impossible to recognise him slade began a process of elimination glancing from one to the other conducting his own mute rollcall wylie clyde kilby fogg he thought oh god it has to be waggy its wagstaffe clyde straightened up his features strained visibly trembling the bastards bludgeoned him lees phoning for an ambulance slade knelt beside the prostrate junior mechanic a cursory glance told him that the other was dead hed seen death too many times to be mistaken but nothing so horribly brutal as coldblooded as this something warm and sticky touched his hand where he supported himself on the ground a dark thick stream was oozing out from under the fallen man forming a pool in a slight hollow where the concrete was uneven the skull was battered to a bloody pulp of flesh and splintered bone the features totally unrecognisable slade felt the bile rising in his throat thought he would throw up there and then behind him he heard clydes whisper god its as though the poor devils been trampled to death by a horsed mark slades flesh went cold sure enough if you could steel yourself to look closely without vomiting you could discern the shape of the wounds in the battered head hoofmarks as though a horse had reared and plunged an evil heavilyshod beast bent in destruction in those seconds slade remembered lee hammertons dream the manner in which one of her ancestors had died two centuries ago in truth the cycle of evil had returned anybody see anything slade asked we were all inside the workshop clyde said waggy went out to go back to his room we heard him scream never saw anything you were out there wylie spoke slowly the implication only too clear if anybody saw anything itd be you i just heard the scream slade stood up somebody cover him up until the ambulance gets here he hurried across to the house as he entered he heard lees voice in the study followed by the sound of the receiver being replaced mark her face was white and she was lying back in the chair as slade entered theyve got i know he closed the door leaned against it is he im afraid so oh god slade pulled the automatic from his pocket and dropped it onto the desk i think itd be best if you put this back where it came from for the time being he sighed wylies already making it known that i was out there somewhere when waggy was killed she dropped the pistol into the drawer and asked why waggy he never did anybody any harm they wouldnt gain anything by killing him ever noticed the similarity in build between fogg and wagstaffe now you come to mention it yes but i see no significance except that from a distance especially to an ambusher who would only see his intended victim silhouetted against the light from the workshop it would be exceedingly difficult to distinguish between the two men even if you knew them both then you think i dont know its only an idea but if fogg is a seamark plant then why should they decide to murder him this whole business is becoming too damned complicated is the iroc really the motive for everything thats happened so far wed better withdraw she said before somebody else gets killed i should have done it earlier no were going to the states at any cost now we owe it to waggy lee as well as to your father and justin dyou think theydve backed down i guess youre right mark then they heard the approaching police cars and the ambulance slade decided to leave it to the police to explain to lee hammerton how waggy had died it was something he didnt want to have to put into words part two riverside and daytona chapter ten slade was only too well aware that the police were likely to be around for some considerable time detectiveinspector king struggled again to light his stubborn pipe as he interviewed the exdriver in the study the same plainclothes constable writing copiously as they talked and you say you were in the grounds after dark when wagstaffe was killed mr slade thats right it seems rather a strange occupation wandering about in the grounds after dark doesnt it like i told you im here to keep an eye on things i didnt figure id do any good stopping in the workshop and you didnt do much good where you were either kings eyes were boring into slades humourless searching for some flicker of uncertainty and where exactly were you when you heard him scream down by the road i thought that maybe anybody with designs on the hammerton team or its cars would come from that direction apparently they didnt they came across country maybe youll be able to find some footmarks in the soft earth as soon as it gets light or should i say hoof marks my men have everything in hand king replied curtly why dyou think the killer picked on the young mechanic what would anybody stand to gain by murdering wagstaffe i think they mistook him for somebody else slade said or rather something did who fogg and why should anybody want to kill fogg that i cant tell you except that hes an exseamark man and so are you mr slade maybe they wouldve liked to have killed me too but it just happened i wasnt around your accusations are loaded against seamark cruises i think you are allowing old prejudices to cloud your reasoning i have questioned both seamark himself and his manager stern they have absolutely no motive for trying to stop the hammerton team competing indeed from what i have seen they are a very professional setup and have no cause to fear any competition either here or in the states we dont know do we slades voice was terse they are professional certainly i drove for em i know but we dont know what their engines are like specifications vary from year to year alway improving always going one better than the previous iroc last years winner would not qualify this time if his specifications hadnt been improved upon an advance of two or three milesperhour can make all the difference that still doesnt explain why they should resort to sabotage and murder king was becoming impatient i am satisfied that in no way are they connected with recent happenings the detectiveinspector stood up well i dont think you can help us much more at the moment i shall be glad though if you will make yourself available for questioning at any time my men will be on the premises until further notice slade went back up to his room lee hammerton was already there lying stretched out on the bed hands behind her head staring at the ceiling its true her voice trembled was scarcely audible the police have told me how how waggy died his skull crushed by a horses hooves an animal that isnt flesh and blood sent to destroy us thats ridiculous slade snapped and i dont think even detectiveinspector king believes in phantom horses i certainly dont its some kind of trick perpetrated by seamark a dual motive to scare hell out of you and also to kill fogg except that they got waggy by mistake if waggy had been trampled by a horse wedve certainly heard the drumming of its hooves i would probably have seen it because i was out there in the grounds but you didnt see it because it was some kind of spirit lee hammertons tone was escalating into the beginnings of hysteria none of us are safe day or night ill just have to increase my vigilance he hoped his own fear didnt show lee was right in what she said they would surely have heard or seen a horse but they hadnt and there were no horses kept within a considerable radius of the hammerton place we cant go on mark she said without looking at him ive been giving it some thought it wouldnt be fair not just to you and me but to the rest of the team no mans life is worth winning an iroc ok so we back out now youve let your father and justin down waggys died for nothing dyou think theyd have wanted us to chicken out you always have an answer she sighed but im making it quite clear to everybody that if anybody wants to quit i wont try and persuade him otherwise have you told that to john clyde yes and whats he say the same as you she bit her lower lip virtually word for word ok then its up to the rest of the team if anybody wants to quit they can otherwise we go on as before i havent been very much use to you have i its not your fault nobody could have done any better by the way theres something i want you to have she fumbled in the pockets of her jeans and withdrew a thin golden chain with a disc attached to it the light glinting on it as it swung to and fro like a pendulum scintillating hypnotising mark slade took it from her examining it a st christopher the kind worn by a host of drivers something he had never had he wasnt superstitious maybe that was the reason lee hammerton began unbuttoning his shirt took the pendant from him draped it around his neck and secured the clasp their lips met i want to keep you safe she said it was justins he wasnt wearing it the day he was killed thanks he murmured but just dont get any ideas about me driving i never gave it a thought her hand found his squeezing it lightly this inspector seems to be making an issue over the fact that you were out in the grounds somewhere when waggy was killed by the way slade lowered his voice i want to search chris foggs room at the first available opportunity perhaps youd give me cover tomorrow make sure im uninterrupted and whatever dyou hope to find there was astonishment on her face i dont know till i find it maybe nothing but if someone meant to kill him then they did it for a very good reason if i dont find anything then well be no worse off i want to ask him a few questions too but that can wait for the time being just let me know when youre ready her arms went around his neck pulling him close ill see nobody bothers you oh mark im scared to hell i just wish i could sell up forget this place and the iroc as well it was midafternoon the following day when mark slade made his way into that wing of the house where the team had their quarters a check beforehand had revealed that fogg wylie kilby and john clyde were all fully occupied in the workshop police were in evidence everywhere and now that wagstaffes body had been removed they were concentrating their efforts upon searching the grounds using trained dogs to help them in their quest for some piece of evidence however slight which might lead them to the nocturnal killer slade turned the handle of chris foggs door it was unlocked and he stepped inside closing it behind him this wing had been added a long time after the house was built and lacked much of the original charm a square featureless room confronted the exdriver the furniture was basic a single bed wardrobe bedside table and wellworn carpeting he noted with some satisfaction that neither draws nor wardrobe had locks if there was anything to be found he would find it he was wearing drivinggloves allowing sensitivity whilst at the same time ensuring that no fingerprints would be left behind in the room there was always the chance that detectiveinspect or king would check all the quarters for fingerprints and slade could well have found himself faced with an awkward situation had his own been discovered in there the room had an air of untidiness about it something which was only to be expected in a bachelor dwelling several pairs of jeans shoes and sweaters lay on and around the unmade bed a lurid tattered novel was open on the bedside table slade began his systematic search the wardrobe was crammed with more clothing only a suit being privileged with a coathanger he removed the items searched every pocket and returned them in the same order there was nothing of interest to be found mostly the contents of the pockets were grubby handkerchiefs halfempty boxes of matches and crumpled cigarettes some of which had been stubbed out and never relit slade sighed fogg had not altered in his habits since leaving seamark untidy lazy in everything that was not applicable to motorracing whatever his shortcomings though the mechanic left nothing to chance where cars were concerned they were his life nothing else mattered the drawers were filled with motoring magazines which unlike the novel were preserved in almost mint condition and sorted numerically slade began to flick through them one by one placing each issue on top of the previous one so that they could be replaced in the order in which he had found them it took him well over halfanhour to complete his task scrutinising every page finding nothing not even a pencilled note on the pages he returned them to the drawers checked some linen again without result and sighed aloud maybe he had made a mistake and fogg was on the level there was nowhere else to search it was all too easy then his gaze alighted on the carpet he knelt rolled it back from one end lifted the underlay checked the floorboards all to no avail an inspection of the other half involved the moving of both chestofdrawers and bed almost halfheartedly he set about the task if he was not thorough he would never rest easy all the same it seemed such a waste of time and effort and also he had overstayed the time limit he had given lee hammerton he had not bargained on having to check those magazines individually suddenly he stiffened staring with almost disbelief at the object which was revealed by the rolling back of the carpet a large white envelope lying in stark contrast against the dark floorboards he knelt down and picked it up it was unsealed the flap tucked inside his breathing quickened and his fingers trembled slightly as he withdrew the contents a large square of paper folded several times approximately thirty inches by thirty inches when spread out on the crumpled bed sheets slades lips pursed in a soundless whistle he had no difficulty recognising the plan of the engine at first glance identical to that of the one in the workshop down below the specifications modifications only with a difference complicated yet simplicity itself to anyone who understood the intracacies of iroc cars and engines the blueprint showed the engine and bearings lined with a substance which was unfamiliar to mark slade marked with a code gyts something undoubtedly he decided which was frictionfree and lighter than oil maybe undetectable during a final engine inspection certainly not illegal also a distinct advantage if nobody else was using it the valve springs too had a similar code marked alongside them gytw the s and the w denoted liquid and solid respectively liquid lubrication solid valves both constructed of the same weightsaving substance ingenious he wondered whether chris fogg was capable of evolving such unique and advanced technicalities the man was clever maybe he had picked the idea up from somewhere and was still working on it endeavouring to attain perfection or more likely he had stolen an almostcompleted blueprint slade folded up the engine plane and replaced it in the envelope a host of questions hammered at his brain a car modified on those lines had a ninetynine per cent chance of qualifying at riverside certainly of getting a good place in the final itself and yet why was chris fogg concealing such information from the hammerton team if he were a seamark plant then the last thing his employers would wish was this blueprint falling into the hands of any rivals so why was fogg secreting it in his room because he had stolen the blueprint from seamark cruises there could be no other possible explanation mark slade deliberated upon his next course of action he could remove the blueprint copy it instruct the hammerton team to work on it there was only one snag the substance possibly plastic but there were a score or more variations he did not know what the code represented if fogg had not revealed it so far he would not be likely to do so once he knew how slade had obtained it reluctantly slade placed the envelope back on the floorboards rolled the carpet over it and pushed back the furniture taking care that the castors rested in their previous indentations he left the room and hardly had he closed the door behind him than he heard footsteps coming up the stars a slow measured tread in about five seconds whoever it was would appear on the landing in full view of himself he knew it was not fogg the step was too heavy one of the other members of the team police silently moving on the balls of his feet keeping to the strip of frayed carpeting which ran down the length of the corridor he crossed to a door that stood ajar a toilet he entered and pushed the bolt home leaning up against the wall sweating listening the newcomer made no effort at stealth slade heard heavy soled boots on bare floorboards and for a second he feared that the other might be intent upon visiting the toilet in which case he would probably wait upon finding it engaged and sooner or later slade would have to emerge and be recognised slade could furnish an explanation for his presence in this part of the building but it would not be believed he had his own quarters and toilet and there was no reason for him to be here thus it was with considerable relief that mark slade heard the footsteps pause some distance away then a door open and close curiosity surged over him the man had gone into chris foggs room yet it was not the mechanic of that he was certain the tread was too heavy slade knew also that he had to leave whilst he had the opportunity he could not risk discovery he would watch from a vantage point elsewhere in the house and discover the identity of the intruder when he followed from the teams quarters swiftly again following the length of carpet he reached the stairs and descended not a sound came from foggs room it would have been foolhardy to have remained behind listening he hurried down to the spacious hall opposite him was the study it would have been a simple matter to remain hidden in there whilst still being able to observe the flight of stairs leading to the west wing ah mr slade just the man im looking for slade cursed under his breath as the study door opened and detectiveinspector king stood framed in the doorway those shrewd eyes settling on him id like a word with you mr slade mark slade had no option other than to step inside the room groaning inwardly as he watched the other close the heavy oak door shutting out the view of the wide staircase opposite sit down mr slade slade lowered himself into one of the leatherupholstered chairs opposite the desk fighting to hide the frustration and impatience which he felt you seem to have an obsession with seamark cruises mr slade king spoke bluntly a veiled reprimand i dont think you would have made a very good detective you are apt to allow your feelings to overrun your logic i am satisfied that seamark cruises are not involved in this business then youve come up with an alternative not yet but were hopeful the moment we lay our hands on benny the leg a lot of things will come to light hes probably dead by now more likely hes lying up somewhere hell have to come out sooner or later though we dont know how badly he was wounded shotgun wounds are often superficial especially at ranges over fifty yards mark slade stiffened his ears had detected the sound of footsteps heavy measured ones descending the staircase from the west wing as i was saying mr slade but slade was not listening he was on his feet eager to open that door now that the unexpected short interview was apparently at an end still trying not to appear too eager to be out in the hall well get him though mr slade im confident that there will be one or two arrests before the week is out king was between slade and the door turning the handle easing it open slowly too slowly an inch at a time slade caught a glimpse of a soiled white suit of overalls through the gap but his restricted vision did not enable him to recognise the wearer slow scraping footsteps across the tiled floor followed by the opening and closing of the outer door too late mark slade groaned silently to himself his chance was gone whoever it was would be back in the workshop by now he was certain of only one thing that it was a member of the hammerton team who had trespassed in foggs room the question was which one of them had it been he did not bother going back to the workshop instead he made his way upstairs to his own room knowing that he would find lee hammerton there she looked up as he entered consternation on her face god i was worried about you she moved quickly to his side i was keeping watch from the study when that damned copper came back and said he wanted to use the room for interviewing i had no option other than to come up here he told her briefly what had happened id give anything to know who was poking about in foggs room slade muttered it could be the key to this whole business does whoever it was know about the existence of this blueprint and more to the point has he now found it and taken it but whats fogg doing with it anyway id say he nicked it from seamark cruises before he left slade mused nevertheless ive got to know if the intruder found it and theres only one way to find that out youre not going back up there its a chance ive got to take i cant keep a lookout for you with that damned inspector still in the study well have to trust to luck ill come with you he thought hard for a moment then said well i suppose theres no harm in it come on lets hope they dont decide to take a teabreak in the workshop and fogg has cause to come back to his room they hesitated outside chris foggs room slade whispered you stop out here in the corridor give me warning if you hear anybody coming up the stairs she nodded her assent and he turned the handle the door opened and he entered then pulled up in amazement my god he muttered the room untidy before was now in total chaos clothing and magazines were strewn everywhere and the bed had been pulled into the centre of the room the carpet was rolled back displaying bare boards nothing more the envelope had gone what is it lee hammerton stepped inside oh christ i see what you mean damnation slade wrung his hands together in frustration and disappointment i could have had the bloody thing for the taking instead i put it back and now somebodys stepped in and nicked it what the hells going on in here mark slade and lee hammerton whirled round in their surprise they had relaxed their vigilance they had not heard the approach of the man in greasy overalls and thicksoled rubber pumps who stood framed in the doorway his face a mask of fury just what the bloody hells the meaning of this chris fogg snarled chapter eleven the meaning of this mark slade regarded chris fogg coldly is that the blueprint which you nicked from seamark cruises has been whipped from under our noses by somebody else about ten minutes ago foggs arms dropped to his sides and his dark complexion paled he leaned against the doorpost and muttered oh christ suppose you tell us all about it slade said then maybe we can help each other no the other seemed to recover with surprising swiftness after his initial shock i think you owe me an explanation whats the idea of this he spread his arms indicating the strewn room a blueprint slade stroked his beard eyeing the other as he spoke confident taking his time a blueprint of a chevy engine but with certain modifications that could be instrumental in winning a race so you found it the mechanic searched the pockets of his overalls produced a halfsmoked cigarette and lit it ok then what have you done with it nothing slade said t put it back under the carpet where i found it that was about twenty minutes ago during that time someone else has been up here taken your room apart and eventually found what he was looking for who there are only three possibilities wylie kilby or clyde i heard whoever it was come upstairs and i hid in the loo to avoid detection i was hoping to identify him when he came downstairs but unfortunately i was collared by the cid bloke i caught a glimpse of the thief or rather part of his overalls as he passed the study door i couldnt identify him but he was definitely wearing hammerton overalls but thats crazy it cant be chris fogg looked at slade and lee hammerton in total bewilderment all three of them were in the workshop with me the whole time none of them left youre sure absolutely ive just left them now then who could it have been lee addressed her question to slade where do you keep the overalls his voice was low his eyes narrowed they hang in one of the outhouses the one opposite the workshop every so often the dirtiest are collected for laundry so it would be possible for a stranger to help himself well yes i suppose so so long as he kept a lookout to make sure that nobody was about which is precisely what he did slade breathed walked right in here dressed like a mechanic found the blueprint and walked right out again with it but how would he know where to look lee asked disbelief on her face it doesnt make sense hed know all right slades gaze was focused on fogg if somebody steals something from you the first place you look if you want it back is on their premises in this case chriss quarters meanin defiance returned to chris fogg his body tensing jaw jutting arrogantly meaning you stole it from seamark cruises and they wanted it backbadly slade replied they have just carried out their most daring coup in broad daylight with this place crawling with cops and theyve succeeded fogg was silent for a moment and then much to the amazement of the other two he burst out laughing whats so damned funny mark slade snapped the blueprint chris fogg leaned back against the doorpost theyve got it but a lot of good itll do em why because its the original the experimental one the mechanic searched the pockets of his overall once more finally producing a grubby folded piece of paper which he held aloft with a show of jubilation this is the one they shouldve had youd better explain slade sighed shaking his head at the moment im lost and there are an awful lot of things id like cleared up better close that door just in case there are other seamark spies crouching on the stairs disguised in hammerton overalls fogg stepped into the room closing the door behind him that blueprint he began the original one i mean the basic idea was mine and if id had any sense idve kept my mouth shut about it and offered it to somebody else instead i discussed it with stern he asked me to work on it with dyson from seamark cruises point of view the project was completed as far as the drawingboard was concerned all that remained was for it to be tested so you quit and took it with you well it was mine they werent going to pay me a penny for it i was under contract as an employee and my wages covered any work that i might do for them i let em think it was completed in fact idve saved myself and everybody else one helluva lot of trouble if id just copied the blueprint and left it where it was dyson isnt clever enough to work out by himself the necessary adjustment needed in order to coordinate a liquid and solid substance that was the difficult part the combination of an engine and bearing lining in conjunction with valve springs one thou out and you might as well enter an ordinary road car at riverside plastic yeah weightsaving as well as frictionfree well almost as near as makes no difference and seamark didnt photocopy the blueprint no that was sterns fault i guess seamarks kicked his arse until its black and blue for that they were worried after you left mark martinll never make the grade not at iroc level anyway i reckon they started to panic theyd sooner have you dead than competing against them likewise they dont want my engine and valve modifications used against them with me dead they probably figured it might mean my process being overlooked if i hadnt already passed it on and anyway this blueprint even the finished one wouldnt be any good without me maybe now that theyve got the original theyll cut out the roughstuff and concentrate on working on their cars until they find out theyre wasting their time if we went to the police with this we could put seamark and stern away for a very long time slade said theyd be so busy answering charges of murder attempted murder sabotage felony and a host of others that theyd never make it in time for the iroc no if you bring the cops in on this youll get no cooperation from me ill swear blind that i never worked on a blueprint for seamark cruises and they wont contradict that its lees word and mine against yours chris maybe but try me and see if you start a legal wrangle you wont get to the states either another thing seamark cruises are a worldwide organisation theyd get you one way or another im just hoping that now that they think theyve got the blueprint theyll ease up on us i shouldve let em get it before only trouble was i hadnt finished working on it didnt know if i could improve on the existing formula anyway that wouldnt have stopped em trying to rub you out mark even with a frictionfree engine they dont want to drive against you they seem to have overlooked one crucial factor slade glanced at lee as he spoke im not driving in any iroc for either seamark or hammerton theyll never believe you can give up racing fogg said as long as youre drawing breath and not working for them youre a threat to them marcus seamark wants to win at daytona its his lifelong ambition theres something else slade regarded fogg steadily you as a runofthemill testdrivermechanic have invented something which is revolutionary you couldve made a fortune on a drawingboard what the hell are you doing in the workshop wearing a suit of oily overalls maybe ive got the technology fogg answered but thats not the way i want it i messed about drawing up that blueprint just to see if it worked its still got to be proved in practice even if it revolutionised formula one racing it wouldnt give me a grain of satisfaction unless i was at the wheel of the winning car so you want to drive lee muttered thats all i ever wanted to do i reckon with practice and experience i could make it eventually nobodys got time to persevere with a learner not at this level anyway they want the finished product maybe id do better starting all over again elsewhere i dont know its a long process so i settled for the pits serving in heaven rather than reigning in hell i suppose i see lee hammerton sighed and what happens to the completed blueprint now fogg was silent for a moment staring at the folded sheet of paper in his hands contemplating battling with logic conscience and a host of other emotions well slade spoke sharply whats going to happen to it then weve every right to know whilst youre employed here at the moment youre the bait for every gunman and thug in the area and other people are getting hurt as well waggy wouldnt have died if it hadnt been for your bloody invention fogg lapsed into a sullen silence then said i havent made my mind up about the blueprint the original will screw seamark up for sure although theyll probably find that out during testing then theyll probably be out for my blood again maybe dyson will be able to solve the problem not a chance crossword puzzles are about his limit what about a driver theyll get somebody make no mistake about that theyll buy the best thats going they wont risk martin we still want to know what youre going to do about that blueprint chris maybe i ought to burn it forget all about it goon then put your cigarette to it and lets all watch it go up in smoke fogg hesitated finally he shook his head and said no i reckon not i guess id like to see it play its part in seamarks downfall for waggys sake if for no other reason youll be paid for it lee broke in it hasnt been tested yet i guess i cant make any deals until its been proved but ill help with the modifications to the engine one thing though it wont help me to become a driver will it even if hammerton wins at daytona lee and slade looked at each other both thinking of a blondhaired driver who might just make it particularly with a frictionfree engine to assist him kilby drives in both the grids and the finals lee hammerton spoke slowly uncertainly i cant go back on my word over that and if he wins hell be a world champion there was bitterness in foggs voice you wont be able to replace him then nobody in their right mind replaces an iroc winner i cant win no way thats how its been all along youll be the guy who won it from the drawingboard thats not the way i want it i shall need more than one top driver chris win at daytona and were really in the top flight therell be the belgian gp also the japanese coming up afterwards steve cant manage everything the name hammerton will expand cars entered everywhere ill see you get your chance all right he nodded reluctantly ill take you at your word i can see trouble brewing with wylie though he wont like my idea one little bit hes a nasty bastard one other thing slades eyes bored into chris fogg that crash of mine whilst i was lapping the tracking had been sabotaged any ideas no the reply was instantaneous frank that one really has me puzzled seamark couldnt have known you were going to drive mark none of us did not even kilby thought youd take the wheel at the last minute there wouldnt have been any logic in anybody sabotaging the car i wouldnt have had time to modify the engine all i can think of is the existing hatred seamark had for craig hammerton just spite doesnt add up slade muttered theres only one thing i can think of whats that somebody in the team did it then removed the evidence it looks that way but who and why nobody answered the question each one conjuring up a vision of a blondhaired driver on the fringe of greatness and a rugged impatient sarcastic chief mechanic selfish motives petty by comparison with those of seamark cruises but were they big enough to commit murder for and did a centuriesold curse have the power to use these people to fulfil its own evil ill make a start on the engine modifications fogg pulled the door open and stepped out into the corridor well all go down and talk it over lee glanced at slade and he sensed that she needed his support once again he nodded and wondered absently how she would cope if he returned to crossways he came to the conclusion that she wouldnt chapter twelve november the summer drought was little more than a memory amidst the incessant heavy rain the police were no longer to be seen around the hammerton estate apart from infrequent visits by detectiveinspector king the cid man refused to admit defeat even though the killer of billy wagstaffe had never been apprehended and benny the leg appeared to have vanished like an autumnal mist in the warm rays of morning sunlight were still following up a number of leads he told lee hammerton curtly on one of his visits of course i cant say more at this stage but were hopeful of having some good news for you before long lee hammerton continued to hope until her faith in the law finally ran out mark slade resumed his constant nocturnal vigilance the permanently residing in his hippocket but it seemed as though seamark had called off his pack always though there was the feeling that one night they would strike again and slade wasnt taking any chances he knew that the price for one moment of laxity could be instant death you had the feeling that in the background the latent forces of evil were gathering for a final terrible assault its the inside man who worries me he told lee one afternoon as they lay together in the warmth of her bed we can build a bastion to protect us from seamark and all the time theres an undetected cancer in our midst well things have been pretty quiet lately she groaned aloud with contentment as he rolled back on top of her crushing her naked body beneath his own and tomorrow we test the car once this idea of foggs had been proved we can concentrate all our efforts on riverside but i cant get the feeling out of my system that something is going to happen before long soon they were shuddering together clutching desperately at each other making up for all the lonely nights that had gone before and those that would surely follow mark slade knew that he was dreaming subconsciously he was aware of the closeness of lees naked body the comfort of the luxurious quilt against his own bare skin but somewhere a horse was cantering breaking into a gallop its hooves striking hard stone with an increasing momentum and it was very close reluctantly he forced himself out of a deep slumber clawed his way up to a sitting position the chill air bringing back reality with a harshness he could not remember what the dream had been about one of those that fades frustratingly with waking hed been horse riding somewhere galloping blindly along in total darkness clinging desperately to the mane of a halfwild steed expecting any moment to be flung from the saddle as the beast stepped into a pothole and lost its footing being pursued sheer madness but it was only a dream he was safe in bed with lee oh god he could still hear those hoofbeats he tensed felt lee rousing herself clutching at his arm mark theres somebody outside riding there could be no doubt about it on the wide drive below the bedroom window a horse was being ridden in circles speeding up now it was neighing in pain as though its flanks were being raked by cruel spurs rearing snorting being brought back under control because its rider was more than its match slade swung himself out of bed knew hed have to take a look felt his legs trembling as he padded across to the window heard lee hammerton following him instinctively on his guard peering out cautiously so that he did not present an easy target to some gunman lurking in the bushes opposite oh my god lee caught her breath thought for one awful moment that she was going to faint she clutched at mark aware that he too was tensing at the awful scene which confronted them mark its the accursed hammerton horseman the family harbinger of doom mark stared tried to tell himself that it was a continuation of his dream a spectral pursuer on horseback finally having run them down the horse had swung round to face them prancing eyes rolling wildly its jetblack coat foamflecked but it was not at the animal that mark and lee stared but at its rider a hunched figure starkly outlined in the faint starlight long flowing garments that belonged to a bygone age a broadbrimmed hat that bathed the features in shadow but you sensed the hideousness of that face without actually seeing it you felt the power that emanated from the horseman an evil force that hit you like an invisible ray chilling the flesh and goosepimpling the skin seconds that seemed an eternity everything suddenly in slowmotion a raised hand and an extended forefinger pointing singling out the watchers above in what could only be interpreted as a grim warning mark slade felt himself flinching wanting to look away but it was as though the other had hypnotised him a mounted ancient mariner demanding the attention of his audience then the horse was wheeling again turning into shadows that rendered it a dark indistinguishable shape swallowing it up a plunging of hooves again dying away until only the echoes of its departure lingered on the still night air vibrating that that was how waggy died lee hammerton whispered hoarsely still straining her eyes into the shadows which seemed to have moved forward as though the dark night was determined to screen its own kind i i dont believe it slade muttered but knew that he could not dispute the evidence of his own eyes out there he had seen the hammerton curse for himself and witnessed only a short time ago the evidence of its vengeance a body pulped by pounding deathdealing hooves jasper hammertons son had died that way too and now the spectral murderer had returned to deliver its final warning somebody was going to die the cycle of ancient death was not yet complete but were still going to riverside and on to daytona slade pulled himself together knew that for lees sake he had to fight they would not be spared by withdrawing from the iroc chapter thirteen the number two chevy camaro had all the magnificence of its predecessor identical in appearance yet beneath its bonnet lurked an untried power a sleeping monster awaiting the moment of wakefulness when it would unleash its fury slade sensed its potential in the same way that a particular horse attracts the attention of a jockey nothing that one could put ones finger on he decided just something you feel he stood back watching not listening to the last minute instructions which wylie fogg and john clyde were giving to steve kilby lee had an arm draped around her drivers shoulders slade experienced a pang of jealousy tried to fight it off but could not it was her rightful place out there with kilby they kissed a brief peck but it hurt slade deeply damn it im only the hired troubleshooter he tried to convince himself she means nothing to me but he knew that he lied to himself and that made it worse slade was the one person whom slade could not deceive he forced his mind back to the test testing had always been an integral part of racing involvement if you were honest with yourself you knew whether you stood a chance whether it was worth going on the grids and finals were but a formality in which the human element decided nerve came into its own then and once again slade was reminded that he had lost his his memory went back to riverside in the days when he was still in the pits an upandcoming twentyfour yearold brm and honda running compound tests there the tyre war goodyear firestone and dunlop spending fortunes evaluating tyres with their leading teams and as a result those teams had flourished drivers were paid to test their cars a situation that was entirely novel and not even the might of the mercedes team was able to match the hundreds of miles that were being squeezed into tyretests in the sixties it was then that the importance of tyres as a function of vehicle performance was first acknowledged and that racing drivers seeking an added advantage realised that they had to be more than just fast drivers they had to work in close conjunction with the tyre companies in a quest for information and statistics they had to know what their cars were doing every inch of the way and why they performed as they did that was testing it was no different now not all of the current formula one teams could afford to test on such a scale mostly it was done how hammerton were doing it now on a private circuit every one of those present knowing that everything depended upon timing and performance slade tried to divorce himself from the proceedings this was none of his concern his business concerned the pistol in his pocket a state of vigilance at all times what happened on the track was of no interest to him in the end he gave up and admitted to himself that it was he cared as much as any of them it was just that he would not have taken kilbys place just watching was causing him to sweat he felt everything that went on inside steve kilby the tension the surge forward the gathering of speed deafening suffocating rubber and oil fumes searing the lungs everything a blur eyes glued on the track going into a bend coming out of it faster faster still wary of bunching cars even though there were none reliving the old fears mph it had to go faster slade could see that speedometer and revcounter as surely as though he had been in the driving seat a long association with fast speeds registering in his brain with far more accuracy than any precisionmade gauge could have done still faster mph the limit it would go no further it was just a question of being able to hold it there and still stay on the circuit round again still holding easing only on the bends but picking up more quickly each time kilby had the feel of the chevy now three laps four slade did not know how many the driver had been instructed to complete five back onto the straight coming in towards the starting and finishing point clyde was flagging kilby was slowing it was all over slade did not converge on the stationary chevy with the rest of them he did not need to hear kilby and clyde tell each other that success was theirs foggs success most of all though he did not want to witness that congratulatory kiss between lee and kilby he walked on back to the house he wondered absently if seamark cruises had finished testing yet it cant be sterns features were twisted with rage as he surveyed the blackened litre engine frictionfree the bearings are right down to the copper on less than three laps well you can see for yourself the lanky darkhaired driver goggles pushed up onto his forehead tossed his helmet nonchalantly onto a nearby bench watched it roll and bounce to the floor but made no effort to retrieve it the stupid bastard who thought this one up ought to be crucified what went wrong stern addressed the plump touslehaired dyson you worked from the original blueprint absolutely dyson was more than puzzled he was afraid and his fear went further than the team manager seamark would have to be told and the ruthless owner of seamark cruises did not tolerate failure and always there had to be a scapegoat then the whole fucking thing was a white elephant stern snarled something fogg dreamed up fine in theory disastrous in practice if itd been possible it wouldve been done before rickson the south african driver removed his gloves tossed them in the direction of his protective headgear i couldve told you that you were wasting your time the sooner that engines restored to normal specifications the better you wont beat a hundred and sixtyfive mph i can tell you that and ive driven chevys as much as anybody stern checked his retort rickson was the best that money could buy better even than slade above all the south african less than a week out of johannesburg had the streak of ruthlessness so vital to seamark cruises in its quest for world supremacy the new idea had failed it didnt really matter money had lured the best driver into their team it would also be instrumental in securing first placing at daytona riverside was but a stepping stone money won irocs you got what you paid for and seamark paid plenty stern decided that he was glad that the plastic substitute had proved a failure it would be likewise with hammerton fogg and slade between them would not be able to contrive a victory he told seamark so and also filled him in on the fate of benny the leg too much time effort and money had been wasted on something which had turned out to be worthless seamark did not agree his vendetta against craig hammertons daughter was not yet at an end it would be continued on the other side of the atlantic he ordered the man known as mr patterson to vacate the house in colney heath and to prepare for their journey to california chapter fourteen th january riverside california the most famous oval circuit in the world mark slade left the airfield in a taxi together with lee hammerton the chevy still had to be unloaded from the dcs and transported to the circuit john clyde would supervise that slade felt hesitant about letting the car out of his sight but likewise he wanted to see lee safely installed in her hotel his responsibilities were divided between his two charges in england he had been able to watch over both at the same time here in the states it was going to be much more difficult he thought about seamark cruises again they had flown in two or three days ago maybe hammerton should have arrived earlier clyde saw to all the arrangements it was too late now anyway he tried to push all thoughts of disaster out of his mind he hoped that they had left all that behind in england the hotel room was large and luxurious a curtained alcove containing both bath and shower air conditioning maintained a steady f and there was both radio and television beside the bed lee strolled to the window and grimaced when she looked out onto a towering block of flats i feel like a prisoner she said couldnt you stay with me for just one night mark no he spoke emphatically but was unable to disguise the reluctance in his halfsmile im not leaving the car we dont have another to fall back on if anything happens to this one most teams have three or four seamark probably have more hammerton just one solitary chevy i know she sat down on the edge of the bed john clyde budgets our motorracing strictly in dads day we always had more than one car john says weve got to win something before we pour more capital into the racing side i guess he knows best hes a qualified chartered accountant by the way theres something you should know yes john asked me again to marry him just before we left england i thought hed abandoned the idea long ago but it seems hes still hoping it was the way he asked me though sort of well almost pleading i couldnt help but feel sorry for him and what did you tell him slade was surprised at the note of urgency in his own voice the way he tensed lee noticed it and laughed oh oh my jealous mark she reached up for him pulling him down beside her i told him no of course you didnt think id tell him any different did you i suppose not but well im going to walk right out of your life when we get back to england and at least john clyde has something to offer you a partnership a husband who is your manager runs everything knows the ropes dont be silly she rolled backwards taking him with her her long slim fingers starting to undo the buttons of his shirt are you really going to walk out just like that mark those were the terms he stiffened as her hands travelled even further down his body a kind of verbal contract it finishes after daytona riverside if we dont qualify at least its supposed to im offering you an extension she undid his waistband and slid a hand inside and downwards until she located that which she sought you dont have to leave mark if you do itll only be to make a martyr of yourself thats what you were doing up there in your seclusion you were forcing yourself to make the break you dont have to do it all over again do you he did not reply in no way could he put his feelings into words he did not understand them himself well she lifted herself up so that he could tug her jeans free of her body what are you going to do after daytona mark i cant answer that one because i just dont know he murmured i live from day to day if i stay it could make things difficult for you kilby and clyde may decide to opt out wylie certainly will you could find yourself without a team thats something ill chance id be prepared to to make your stay permanent i wouldnt advise it he dropped his gaze as he spoke taking in the whole of her nakedness and a lot more besides mark slade isnt very good at permanent relationships you cant judge yourself by one failure she groaned softly clutched at him eyes closed head back id risk it even if it does blow up in my face ill give you a definite answer after we taxi down onto english soil he promised before his rising passion pushed all else from his mind mark slade wondered if he could ever face being at yet another crossroads in his life once it had been yvonne or motorracing now it was lee hammerton or nothing maybe the road back to loneliness was the easiest slade watched kilby doing some practice laps on the following morning the circuit was dry conditions ideal kilby handled the car well but did not exceed mph at any one stage most of the others were touching mph but clyde and slade had agreed that it would be unwise to attract attention to the hammerton car the moment of truth would come when it really mattered and anyway it was too late to make any drastic changes the cars were only identifiable by their markings the drivers themselves hidden beneath the anonymity of protective headgear and goggles individuals in their respective performances alone slade recognised rickson only too well the arrogant style in which the seamark driver made a grand prix out of every practice mile lap slade clocked him once with his own stopwatch mph it was good but unless rickson could muster some hidden reserve slade reckoned that kilby would run out ahead of him he knew too that statistics were not to be relied upon it was nerve that would count on the day and there was always the unexpected slade wandered amongst the spectators with two days still to go the carnival atmosphere was already beginning caravans caravanettes and tents formed a colourful if untidy array redhatted iroc racequeens mingled with the crowds it was all business big business if you wanted a woman there were plenty to be had slade didnt he returned to the pits fogg and wylie were renewing a set of tyres kilby stood watching them he nodded curtly to slade and poured himself another coke spurning the luxury of hotel life are you there was no humour in the drivers smile just bitterness and biting thinly veiled sarcasm my job is to stay with the car slade retorted and wondered if kilby knew about the previous afternoon he probably guessed anyway clyde had already returned to the hotel the thought of the team managers presence so close to lee made slade feel uneasy back home it hadnt seemed to matter he wondered in which hotel the seamark team were staying no doubt seamark had booked them in at the best in town by comparison hammerton were small fry almost amateurs smallbudget competitors it was out on the circuit where it counted though if you lost you faded into obscurity if you won you really made it in a big way even the hammerton fortune could not stand many failures slade decided unsponsored teams rarely bounced back they had to qualify the pits were noisy throughout the nocturnal hours mechanics worked ceaselessly rectifying small faults which had shown up during practice slade reclined on a campbed but sleep eluded him this was a side of racing that was unfamiliar to him on previous visits to riverside the town itself had played a large part in his life the women now it was the town which claimed his woman whilst he was imprisoned by a new environment he could not get yvonne off his mind futile hopes one always wanted the unattainable rejecting the attainable lee wanted him in a way he wanted her only yvonne could make the final decision he had to speak to her just once more after that he would make his choice he dozed towards dawn and then was awoken by the roar of powerful litre engines as the practice laps began again some time later fogg and wylie arrived and through partially closed eyelids he watched them tinkering with the engine kilby came in about an hour later enjoyed your night he leered at slade slade did not reply this was no time to create additional friction amongst the team everybody was on edge it would get worse prerace tension was something in which even the most experienced drivers and mechanics got caught up even troubleshooters it appeared were not exempt the seamark team were keeping very much to themselves slade concluded that they were confident of qualifying they would be content with a placing in the first nine only in florida the following month would they go ruthlessly for the number one spot any trouble that was brewing would erupt there here it would be settled out on the circuit he went outside another day had begun lee hammerton retired to her hotel room early on the second night she had left john clyde in the bar down below he was drinking too heavily for her liking she anticipated another proposal and the embarrassment of having to refuse him yet again just when she needed him most he seemed to have changed she locked her door in accordance with slades instructions and switched on the television a local network was showing riverside the big countdown a baldheaded man was arguing that stockcar and indianapolis drivers were better than the grand prix men a fierce debate followed americans versus the europeans two riverside competitors were interviewed they agreed about the near equality of the camaros and supported the changes to the method of gridding drivers and cars hitherto everyone used to qualify for the first race over two flying laps in one of the two qualifying cars then they would reverse the finishing order following each race to form the subsequent grid at the same time the lastplaced and the firstplaced would exchange cars and so on through the field that had been in craig hammertons day now each man drew for his position at every race with twolap qualifying runs taking place at each new venue so that only for the second riverside race did the field reverse itself thus the equality was probably closer to any type of motoring event than ever before although it was argued by others that the iroc did not produce a true world motorracing champion the current drivers faced two rounds on a road course and two on an oval the roadracers felt that they were at a slight disadvantage at daytona these men also argued that the stockcar drivers had an advantage in the bulky camaros the argument raged the stockcar drivers claimed that they had never been consistently successful in the iroc and that chevy camaros did not handle like their nascar machines the interviewer concluded that for the iroc to maintain its reputation it was necessary for more roadracers to take part and that past competitions had shown that the americans were every bit as good as the europeans lee switched off she still had a lot to learn she paid too much attention to the glamour and she was glad that the television authorities had not asked her to appear on any local network she would have asked mark slade to go along in her place he understood the finer aspects of formula one maybe one day he would teach her one day her train of thought was interrupted by a knock on the door uncertainty flooded over her who is it she could scarcely manage a whisper she remembered john clyde when she had left him had he needed the alcoholinspired courage to come up with yet another proposal of marriage its me steve relief she crossed the room and unlocked the door the fairhaired driver stepping inside at once he smiled his breath fanned her face and there were no alcoholic fumes whats the matter he flung himself into an armchair without being invited to do so youre as white as death i i thought it was somebody else slade no annoyance replaced fear clyde she did not answer and he laughed trouble with you lee is that youve got too many boyfriends around shut up she faced him arms akimbo dark eyes flashing angrily if youve come here on legitimate business then i have he placed his fingertips together and regarded her steadily our business i thought i told you you did but now im going to have my say you need me lee i need you to drive my car thats only half of it everything rests on me out there i can either make you or break you what dyou mean youre running this team on a shoestring agreed youre the hammerton millionairess but youre small fry compared with some of the sponsored teams out here seamark for instance nevertheless without me youre jackedup i dont know what youre getting at she snapped but youre not indispensable steve fogg can drive and mark slade came second in the finals last year he laughed again a hollow sound and crossed his legs in a deliberately relaxed posture arrogance exuded from him foggs no driver another two or three years with practice maybe slade wont drive for you he would if i asked him noooo a smug smile leering taunting slade wont drive again hes kidded all of you along but it takes another driver to spot what his trouble is it stands out a mile i recognised it the day he crashed on the circuit back home and i reckon thats why he crashed he removed the tracking afterwards so that nobody would discover that there was nothing wrong with it he put that story round about sabotage as cover for himself go on she did not want to hear the explanation but she felt compelled to listen hes lost his nerve he didnt want to drive that day but he had to prove himself in your eyes he tried to get away with a steady cruising speed but the very fact of being in a car again panicked him you saw what happened take it from me not even you could get him out there on saturday youre lying try me and see why are you telling me all this like i said i want to know how i stand and itd better be good even fogg couldnt win for you in spite of his frictionfree invention its all over between us steve if it is then you havent got a driver you said youd stay and drive for me i gave you the option to quit that was back home out here its different this is riverside the golden californian circuit where dreams are either made or broken im calling the tune thats blackmail now thats a word i dont like shall we call it a bargain to our mutual interest what dyou want me to do nothing any different from what we used to do lee only more permanent she lowered herself onto the edge of the bed she was trembling violently and nausea welled up inside her you dont need slade he went on hes brought you nothing but bad luck ever since he came on the scene without dragging him and fogg into the team you wouldnt have hotted up this feud with seamark get rid of them and seamark ill leave you alone john clydes asked me to marry him she did not know why she said it perhaps it was an attempt to build a frail barrier between herself and this exlover maybe just to create a diversion protect herself as well as mark slade steve kilby laughed again longer and louder this time hes twenty years older than you fancy yourself as an old mans darling hes invaluable so am i now lets talk business get clyde and slade off my back ill even make a sporting offer if i dont win the iroc ill walk right out and youll never set eyes on me again on the other hand if i win it youre a bastard people have called me a lot worse than that you forced the issue in the first place remember the night you seduced me she turned her head away you told me a lot of things then he said a lot of promises im just making sure you keep em youd better win at daytona then steve she looked up at him in the meantime he gestured towards the bed a little payment on account she watched him undress as though transfixed every inch of that superb body so familiar to her she made no move to resist as he helped her off with her clothes his kisses hot and passionate hers cold and unresponsive he did not appear to notice they rolled into bed and he switched off the light neither of them heard the stealthy footsteps moving away from the door down the corridor towards the elevator nor the heavy breathing of one who fought to control a mounting rage within himself a man with the thought of murder uppermost in his mind chapter fifteen saturday everybody seemed to be up and about earlier than usual slade was awakened just as dawn was breaking and busied himself with a final check of the car before the others arrived he nodded his approval and made his way out to one of the breakfaststalls as wylie arrived slade was surprised at his own nervousness eating a hamburger and drinking coffee only because he knew that he had to even in his current role he could not escape the atmosphere of the big day he bought some cigarettes it was a long time since he had last smoked but suddenly he felt the craving for tobacco the smoke tasted sour but nevertheless he inhaled it with relish shortly before ten oclock he checked out and made his way back to the hotel there were four hours to go before the race and he needed to see lee the door of her room was locked and it was some moments before she answered his knock at first glance he knew that something was wrong her hair was unbrushed and straggling eyes redrimmed dark lines below them her complexion deathly white what the hells wrong he snapped nothing she turned her head away i didnt sleep prerace nerves i get em too you know he knew that she was lying also that she was very frightened youve had another threat havent you no then somethings happened i tell you its just nerves he fell silent whatever the trouble was she wasnt going to confide in him that worried and hurt him ok so its nerves he lit another cigarette maybe id better stop here and watch the race with you on closedcircuit tv no mark id rather you remained in the pits very well ill stop with you tonight chris can sleep with the car for a change id rather you stayed with the car look he drew on his cigarette and slowly exhaled twin streams of smoke from his nostrils somethings wrong thats why im around so why are you keeping it to yourself i told you its nothing mark and id feel a lot happier if you would stop with the car twentyfour hours a day at least until we know whether or not weve qualified if we qualify then i cant take any chances until after daytona otherwise we go back to england all right he knew that in no way could he force her to tell him what was troubling her ill be down at the circuit if you want me and keep your door locked he turned to go hesitating willing her to kiss him but she had turned back to the mirror and was brushing her silky dark hair he took the elevator down to the ground floor suddenly dark clouds were piling up on his horizon again and he told himself there was only one place for him crossways he had been a fool to let a woman sway his decision to shut himself away by two oclock tension was running at feverpitch in the pits even the most experienced drivers men who came back year after year were snapping and snarling orders at their mechanics and there would be no letup until the flag went down for the start of the race then concentration would take over anxiety of a different kind an argument developed in the hammerton pit slade could not get the gist of it over the roar of engines as the cars prepared for their warmingup laps kilby had made some remark to wylie and the latters temper flared john clyde intervened his features dark with anger mouthing insults which were lost in the noise all lipreading but fists were clenched raised fogg stepped in between wylie and clyde slade eased himself off his seat they could not afford an exchange of blows at this stage then just as quickly as it had begun the quarrel died shouted words were replaced by sullen looks and kilby eased the chevy out of the pits slade went outside and watched the lap glad to get away from the atmosphere inside he saw kilby complete a circuit fogg and wylie walking towards him as he returned fearing lest some minor trouble might have arisen but kilby scarcely allowed the wheels to roll to a halt before he was easing forward towards the grid everything was all right slade heaved a sigh of relief and heard the hooter blaring its fiveminute warning he glanced up at the minutes board checked the second hand on his wristwatch the hooting sounded again three minutes to go one minute he hoped that kilby had already started his countdown for the official minute was not always sixty seconds mechanics were moving away from the cars silence all engines switched off an eternity crammed into a few seconds drivers gazed at the track ahead stared into the crowd looked back at the pits every one of them a loner the lessexperienced bit nails stroked chins clasped hands behind their heads some yawned mostly the top professionals not because of tiredness nor for effect but because the trained body knew how to prepare itself for the task ahead by taking in extra oxygen engines were started all switches were checked to ensure that they were in an on position drivers noting the fortyfive seconds left adjusting goggles thirty seconds gears engaged watches consulted again five seconds the starters flag was raised engine revs increased and were maintained at around the flag fell the chevys surged forward and the prerace tension had evaporated slades eyes narrowed and for some two or three seconds he lost sight of the hammerton car amongst the sixty competitors then he picked kilby out but it was slade who was sitting behind that wheel only his body remaining in the pits as he projected himself into that hurtling crimson car watching the track the other cars checking the tachometer so that he did not overrev before changing up revs held in reserve aware that the instrument did not register a true reading sweating all else forgotten bunching allowing a safety margin taking the inside at the first bend guarding against being overtaken in this position watching those coming up on the outside now spreading out a breathing space driving consistently alert for any inexperienced competitors who might spin reflexes anticipating evasive action before there was even a hint of trouble driving on the right overtaking on the left using the slipstream of other cars to gain a little more speed one lap completed minutes the frictionfree engine modification was paying off ten seconds short of the riverside record and another sixty laps to go one helluva longtime slade was aware that john clyde was at his side but neither acknowledged the others presence everything else was forgotten except for that one car out there and the other fiftynine which might foul it up one hour a dozen or more had dropped out the rest were thinning a natural seeding process seamark were up front twenty other famous names setting the pace only one outsider now hammerton slade gripped a handrail it was a steering wheel his hands were clammy his clothes clinging damply to his body clyde had gone back to the pits but slade was not aware of it slades nerve had gone but still he drove blindly instinctively following an impossible course defying everything fiftynine laps two to go down to fifteen cars now back to the grids hypnotised dazed still in with a chance impossible a reversal of placings kilby was going to make it it was all over slade clung to that handrail he wanted to go back to the pits he could not move deafening applause people trooping back to their caravans and tents slade stayed where he was trembling violently the impact of it all hit him seamark versus hammerton at daytona the dream was alive a nightmare for himself no way could he go back to the hammerton team just yet neither could he face lee this time he would be unable to hide his secret anybody who saw him would guess he was glad that he had altered his image people passed him without recognising him he fell in behind a group of hippies who were heading for the exit riverside city was a refuge for a lot of people right now he lit a cigarette drawing the smoke deep into his lungs it no longer tasted bitter he needed more and more another craving took hold of him eventually he found a bar it was crowded and he merged with the drinkers after a time he wondered why he had not sought solace in whisky before it blurred the past and the present veiled the future the race was a distant memory he didnt know whether or not kilby had won probably not the method of gridding was confusing he couldnt be sure a dream that was all it was so was lee hammerton but in a different way some time later he wondered if he could find her hotel he decided to try he was surprised to discover that it was night when he stepped out into the street holding onto a wall for support the bright neon lighting dazzling him he vomited he could not find the hotel he could not remember its name his head throbbed and he needed to sleep anywhere sleep oblivion a poorly lit subway offered a refuge from the blinding artificial light several slumbering bodies lay in the shadows his foot caught against one and he fell he tried to rise but could not there was no reason to he closed his eyes and slept it was midday sunday when mark slade stirred everything came back to him slowly the race hammerton had qualified he groaned his head still throbbed but now he could remember the name of the hotel the subway was deserted the hoboes had left to go about their business of daily existence he climbed up into the street above the bright sunlight making him squint shielding his eyes until his vision adjusted he needed another cigarette and fumbled through his pockets not even a crumpled empty packet remained nothing at all the subway dwellers had searched him thoroughly the city was crowded mostly tourists completing their weekend now that the race was over many would make the mile trek to florida slade wanted to forget a lot of things particularly the race and the whisky it was a long time since he had been drunk but never quite to that extent it took him twenty minutes to find the hotel twice taking wrong turns and having to ask passersby then he saw the tall building grotesque in appearance rising tall and straight above the new city crowds thronged the entrance he began to push his way through them then came to an abrupt halt with two stoicfaced uniformed policemen barring his way hold it get back nobody goes inside words that were being repeated automatically at intervals unbuttoned holsters displaying something more positive with which to enforce the verbal barricade if necessary two white patrol cars and a navyblue van were drawn up to the kerbside in front of the entrance the crowd was growing a blaring siren announced the arrival of further federal reinforcements slades hangover disappeared instantly as fear began to creep back goosepimpling his spine tightening his stomach muscles something had happened in there and he had to find out what it was he moved forward get back there the nearest policeman produced a truncheon from somewhere and looked as though he wanted an excuse to use it ive got to go in there slade said nobody goes in or out not until the chief says so now back my names mark slade and mines jesus christ slade stepped back looking about him dozens of pairs of eyes were focused on him this was one moment when he wished that somebody would step forward and say hey thats mark slade nobody did the old image was already dead the foyer doors swung open and two whitecoated figures banged their way clumsily into the street balancing a stretcher precariously between them a blanket hid the still form which lay on it slade stepped forward again instinctively but that same policeman seemed to have anticipated such a move you lookin for a split cranium feller the truncheon was raised and slade halted who is it piss off before we run you in the second officer strode across now scatter all of you hold it everybody stopped including the officers a tall sanguinefaced man stepped out from the lobby a uniform would have been superfluous his worn grey suit crumpled and creased as though he slept in it regularly labelled him as homicide somewhere he had a badge and id card he seldom had to use either whats the matter with this bum he spoke to the first policeman in clipped tones says hes gotta go in there chief and has he now it was slade who was being addressed in third person federal jargon adw mister thats what its all about if you got anythin constructive to offer spit it out if not get the hell out of here my names mark slade slades eyes followed the stretcher which was being bundled unceremoniously into the back of the mortuary van im with the hammerton team then youd better come inside sergeant a thickset uniformed officer appeared instantly in the hotel doorway take this guy up to captain ferris room room was an apartment suite on the third floor off the corridor adjacent to lee hammertons room it was crowded a policeman guarded the doorway and it was clear to slade that nobody went in or out unless authorised to do so on the way up in the elevator he had attempted to question his companion about the body on the stretcher but the only answers had been unintelligible grunts he gave up before they reached the third floor somehow he had managed to contain the frustration which was threatening to explode into blind panic that huddled lifeless shape yet there were five hundred people staying in this hotel a chance of it being relief flooded over mark slade when he saw lee hammerton on the opposite side of the room amidst a sea of unfamiliar faces staff and guests from this floor had all been herded in here this was interrogation federalstyle a gun on the door more down below you told them all you knew they told you nothing and if your story didnt fit mark lee hammerton rushed across the room an expression of abject despair transforming into one of relief mark where on earth have you been we were worried sick about you john clyde said he hadnt seen you since after the race yesterday and would somebody mind telling me whats going on slade was aware that everybody was looking at them a sudden hush having fallen over the entire room its murder mark lees voice trembled little more than a whisper punctuated by strangled sobs somebodys oh god its too horrible to think about steve kilbys steve kilbys what he slipped an arm about her pulling her close cursing everybody silently for not having the good manners to look away or to resume their conversations hed dead mark somebodys murdered stevel or something his head was all crushed like waggys as though a horse had slade felt that he should have said oh god or how terrible instead he just stood there saying nothing his reactions everything deserting him he wasnt religious he hadnt been inside a church for years but silently he offered up thanks that it hadnt been lee theyre interrogating everybody lee went on oblivious to her audience everybody off this floor and all our team they wanted to know where you were theyre circulating your description right now to all city patrols where have you been mark i got drunk he said and did not believe it himself somewhere in the room there was a titter of female laughter you mean you just took off and celebrated our qualifying all on your own something like that howd it happen and when they found him this morning one of the staff went to serve coffee in his room before breakfast he was im glad i didnt see it they said he was unrecognisable his head had been beaten in so that oh cod mark the curse has followed us to the states i cant stand any morev she was on the verge of hysteria slade drew a deep breath and tried to steady himself and all because we qualified for the finals he muttered seamark didnt waste any time it has to be them there cant be any other explanation where were you last night mark i dont know he hesitated some subway i doubt whether i could find it again i was blotto there were some hoboes dossing down there they mustve frisked me while i was still spark out took my cigarettes and loose change is is that the truth mark her eyes were wide and pleading her lips pressed against his ear so that nobody else in the room could hear yes he nodded and attempted to smile its the truth then thats good enough for me her sigh of relief was audible i just hope you can convince the police i know what theyre thinking guilty until proved innocent ill have a damned good try he said theyve interviewed fogg and wylie she steered him back towards the window both have gone back to the pits to pack the car up ready for the trip to daytona i told them to stop with it all the time john clydes in the next room with this captain ferris an adjoining door opened and john clyde stepped back into the room slade could see beyond him the temporary interrogation quarters uniformed officers one plainclothes man typified by a square jaw and closecropped hair he was jacketless a gleaming badge pinned to his blue shirt sleeves rolled up captain luke ferris riverside police department homicide division send this slade guy in next the harsh nasal tones reached mark slade before the wiry sergeant had a chance to jerk a thumb doorwards so youre slade a statement not a question slade nodded hearing the door close behind him sensing policemen moving to his side then stiffening as trained hands patted his pockets and checked for anything that might have been concealed beneath either trousers or shirt ferris indicated a chair one was always at a disadvantage when seated weve been looking for you slade what were your movements between hours yesterday and hours today slade looked across into a pair of expressionless grey eyes they seemed to bore into him liedetectors i left the racetrack after the end of the race he spoke slowly confidently determined not to be harassed i was feeling pretty washedup why you won i know i guess it was the tension of youre a driver you werent even driving this time and yet you got all bugged up into a state its worse when you dont drive you dont work off the tension whered you go i came back into the city why not back to the pits i needed to cool off whered you go a bar what bar ive no idea just a bar a sleazy one maybe i could find it again i dont know ferris exchanged glances with the officers standing behind slade his expression said we got a lyin punk here and he aint too smart neither slade hoped that he appeared unruffled inside him a turmoil raged he could have done with a cigarette and some more whisky nobody offered him either ok ferris leaned back in his chair a relaxed posture designed for the benefit of those whom he questioned you went to this bar you dont know what it was called or whether you could find it again what then i started drinking heavily whisky what time did you leave it was dark when i left whattime i dont know you gotta watch i didnt look at it i didnt need to i was drunk you was drunk ferris dwelt on the words then snapped whered you go when you left the bar i just wandered around like i told you i was drunk my head ached and i needed to sleep there were some hoboes dossed down in a subway i slept there and when i awoke it was midday they had stolen my cigarettes and loose money but didnt take your watch slade stared at his wristwatch christ it would have been that much easier if they had taken that too perhaps they were frightened of waking him no apparently they didnt take my watch he said of course they fucking didnt ferris leaned across the table towards slade his jaw thrust out smiling with all the vindictiveness he could muster because youre still wearing it just as suddenly the homicide captain relaxed back in his chair his slow drawl taking over from the staccato verbal attack and when you woke up and discovered that they hadnt stolen your watch because you were still wearing it what did you do then i came straight here why i guess it was the obvious place to come but youre not booked in here the rest of your team are why not you my job is security the car so you boozed in some mythical bar and spent the night in an equally mythical subway thats security a mirthless sarcastic smile i told you i was all washedup i came here to see miss hammerton listen slade ferris drummed on the table with a bony forefinger a guy was rubbed out here adw that means assault with a deadly weapon i dont go for this crap about phantom horses splitting a guys skull with their hooves this is riverside my division there aint no horses in the city limits and there aint no spooks evidence shows that kilby was murdered between two and three am whilst you were sleeping off your booze in some subway well need your dabs slade also weve got a few points to iron out i guess wed better do that down at police headquarters lee hammerton clutched at john clydes arm as the adjoining door opened again and mark slade emerged a police officer on either side of him captain ferris bringing up the rear down below the police cordon broke up the excitement was over for the day a press photographer photographed slade as he was hustled into the waiting patrol car the kind of photograph that was all too common these days his editor might or might not use it it all depended on the ensuing police statement pm lee hammerton and john clyde looked up in surprise as a weary mark slade walked into the formers hotel room oh thank god theyve let you go mark lee embraced him and he noticed the dampness of her cheeks the black rings round her eyes which seemed to have sunk back into their sockets a kind of parole i guess slade threw himself fulllength onto the bed our very own detectiveinspector king could learn a thing or two about interrogation from these guys they talk you round in everdecreasing circles and then go all the way back again they said theyll want to see me again no doubt theyve got a tail on me what are they doing about seamark clyde passed slade a cigarette theyll question stern slade sighed but as we all know thats been tried before without success and in the meantime we all hang around here i guess itll only be a week or so at the most its almost a month until the finals we can practise on the circuit here youre forgetting one thing mark lee dropped her gaze to the carpet even if we go to daytona we dont have a driver ive been talking it over with john and contrary to what i said earlier im determined to race at daytona slade closed his eyes he was trying to think of something to say in the end he said i guess well have to rely on chris fogg at least we have engine advantage you know thats not the answer mark lee hammertons tone was a mixture of reproach and pleading theres only one answer i want you to drive for me at daytona he sighed closed his eyes again and murmured the deal was that i didnt drive that was agreed the only reason i came along we didnt figure on this happening though it was always on the cards that any one of us might get injured or killed oh mark please she gave way to desperation please say youll drive at daytona he shook his head eyes still closed afraid to open them and look at her remembering everything that had gone on inside him on the previous day no he said thats just the one thing i cant do for you lee not even if it means pulling out of daytona chapter sixteen there was silence in the hotel room for some moments at last it was john clyde who spoke id better get down to the racetrack he moved towards the door if you want me you know where to find me it was some time after the team manager had gone before lee spoke again theres something ive got to tell you mark she looked at him willing his eyes to open and meet her own steve kilby was blackmailing me the devil he was slade sat bolt upright and how long had that been going on a couple of days since that time you looked all shot up and told me youd sooner i slept with the car than you she nodded he didnt give me any choice said hed blow it for me if i didnt play it his way a permanent relationship in which you didnt figure nor anybody else just him and me and you were willing to go along with him i was stalling mark when i watched the race on telly i found myself praying that he wouldnt qualify and yet he didnt spend last night with you no i guess he thought he had me all sewn up anyway and one night was neither here nor there he was blinded by the sudden rise to fame everybody down in the bar wanted to buy him a drink he just basked in the glory and the last i saw of him he was pretty well stoned i guess he never even heard whatever it was came into his room and and ferris wont accept anything except an adw you havent answered my question mark she spoke nervously twisting her fingers together i need you to drive for me just this once ive already told you no he said you take after your father he never took no for an answer i think i know why youre fighting shy of the circuit do you kilby told me something else about you kilby knew nothing about me he said he could tell that any racing driver who worked alongside another could tell what was going on in that guys mind and what did he reckon was going on in my mind slade licked his lips he said you d lost your nerve slade stiffened and closed his eyes again the impact of her words jarring him like a physical blow his breathing became so shallow that he thought it was going to stop altogether well she sat down beside him her hand seeking his finding it squeezing it gently have you lost your nerve mark if so id rather you told me id understand it wouldnt make any difference between us but id rather know i guess kilby was shrewder than i gave him credit for slade sighed but still did not open his eyes idve conned em all if it hadnt been for you lee you tempted me back the atmosphere yesterday i didnt believe it could do that to me i was out there driving the chevy my nerve gone and still driving afterwards i was a mental and physical wreck thats why i went and got drunk that and and the fact that you virtually gave me the brushoff im sorry she leaned over and kissed him her face wet and salty against his oh god im sorry mark i never guessed what i was doing to you if only youd said id have understood i tried to get out before it was too late even i dont know why i came back kilby said that you crashed on my circuit because you panicked that it was you who removed the tracking so that nobody would ever know that there wasnt anything wrong with it thats a lie he spoke sharply and opened his eyes meeting her gaze that car was sabotaged the fact that my nerve had gone had nothing to do with it i believe you she said but it seems that seamark have beaten us in the end i only wish this captain ferris could pin steves murder on them id feel a whole lot easier it would stop me thinking about not much chance of that slade smiled wanly seamark cruises are a big organisation theyd probably got it all worked out beforehand that if hammerton did qualify then kilby had to be removed from the racing scene that means as far as theyre concerned theres only me left im their biggest threat the last thing theyd guess is that my nerve has gone maybe they were looking for me too last night maybe my drunken spree saved me from getting my head staved in as well im glad you told me mark she stretched out alongside him her head nestling against his shoulder ive got to pull out of daytona now i cant ask you to drive i cant let you take the risk the sooner seamark know the sooner theyll let us alone maybe ill sell up altogether and that way put an end to the curse of my ancestors no he spoke slowly gazing directly up at the ceiling above its too late to pull out now if you do that then kilby will have died for nothing even if he did try to blackmail you his life will have been wasted billy wagstaffes too then theres your father and justin to think of if theres such a thing as life after death and they can see you now theyll be proud of hammerton in the finals at daytona and with a chance of pulling off an iroc but i dont have a driver mark maybe i could persuade chris or try it myself i have testlapped perhaps with the engine advantage even i might get a placing dont be stupid he said harshly you wouldnt stand an earthly nor would chris i guess theres only one thing for it ill drive no she sat up looking down at him gratitude and fear mingling in her expression i wont let you mark as soon as the police agree to let us fly home well make tracks ill get john clyde to make arrangements for the return flight no you wont there was a firmness about him now a hint of the former iroc driver emerging from the enshrouding uncertainty and fear t meant what i said ill drive for one helluva lot of reasons you cant youve lost your nerve we both know it even watching the race yesterday shacked you i mean it it wont be easy i cant even promise that i wont back out at the last minute but god ill do everything i can to make it itll be my last race though my final bow ill need a lot of help promise me that youll help me to make the break afterwards a complete break and that means going back to my place in the hills as soon as we get back to england trying to readjust all over again youll have to face the music for me make it plain to everybody the press especially that mark slade wont drive again ever if thats the way you want it her cheeks were wet again but im not asking you to do it now mark youre volunteering its my choice he lay back trembling slightly relieved by having made a decision and uncertain because he was unsure of being able to keep his promise first thing im going to do is to buy a razor and get rid of this face fungus i like beards she ran her fingers through the growth of hair on his face itll always grow again he grinned suddenly but if im going to be out there at daytona then folks are going to see the real mark slade again one last glimpse hair a bit shorter than it used to be but i guess that wont matter ill reconstruct the old image and then destroy it completely afterwards ill inform john clyde she swung herself off the bed and made for the door not trusting herself to look back she knew that she had to take her gratitude with her out of that room mark slade would not thank her for it she realised only too well that lee hammerton was not the sole reason for his decision to make one final brief comeback chapter seventeen on tuesday morning slade steeled himself to try a practice lap on the riverside circuit there was no sign of the other eight qualifying teams for the finals they had already left for florida hammerton had no option other than to remain behind the riverside police were constantly present watching questioning seamark as mark slade had predicted had provided the necessary alibis for every one of their team they were in the clear as far as captain ferris was concerned ferris hinted that he was treating the murder as a case of homicide by persons unknown not necessarily connected with the hammerton team slade was questioned again but this time it appeared to be no more than a formality there were always threats where national sporting events were concerned sometimes by cranks other times by political factions seeking to create an atmosphere of mayhem and murder there were known extremist groups active in california it could have been one of them slade forced himself to drive he vomited beforehand in the toilets sweated profusely at speeds of over mph and endured nightmares as he tossed restlessly on his campbed during the nocturnal hours but in no way was he backing down now it was selfinflicted torture and he knew it would get worse as the days went by a week later the hammerton team arrived at daytona there was still a fortnight remaining until the finals of the iroc but already the atmosphere was warming up riverside was bigtime daytona was bigger the ultimate a hour race on a mile circuit laps amounting to miles two banked curves killers if you didnt take them right slade sweated just looking at this oval infield circuit the very same course he had once tried to forget attempting to obliterate it from his memory now he was back nothing had changed only himself it was here his nerve had finally cracked he needed it back badly he knew that was an impossibility but he had to drive all the same they booked in at their hotel four rooms lee hammerton frank wylie chris fogg and john clyde as at riverside slade would stay with the car they could not afford to take any chances now the tension was rising to a crescendo slade could sense it not only in himself but in all those around him drivers and mechanics alike the gaily painted caravans and tents around the track now created a macabre setting a fagade that seemed to hide a brooding evil this time the climax would not be over in a matter of an hour and a half it was a full span of twentyfour hours which they faced beginning in daylight continuing through the blackness of night and then terminating in a gruelling finish amongst those cars which were left not all of the nine would still be out there when dawn broke that was what worried slade most those hours of darkness would be hell claustrophobic trapped alone in the car with his worst fears mingled a thousand times that same hobgoblin taunting him again a familiar of the legendary hammerton curse as mark slade entered lee hammertons hotel room one morning less than a week before the race he knew without any doubt that her terror was back in full force a deathly pale complexion eyes redrimmed after a sleepless night hands that shook i dreamed again she closed her eyes and shuddered i was watching a race a horse race i couldnt see the riders faces but i knew that amongst them was jasper hammerton his mount slipped fell threw him under the hooves of the following horses oh god mark they did to him what something did to waggy and steve and then i saw his face it wasnt jasper it was your its just a dream mark felt beads of cold sweat starting to break out on his forehead things have been playing on your mind naturally weve got to try and forget them both of us and concentrate on winning at daytona but we dont really have a chance do we i mean were the rank outsiders one car a skeleton team not even a reserve driver which is why were going to win he kissed her dark silky hair we have the advantage of a frictionfree engine i have as much experience as any of those other drivers but your nerve sometimes there are factors which can overcome even a lost nerve temporarily of course such as such as hatred for the bastards who crashed me tried to shoot me up murdered waggy and steve kilby im boiling to get back at em now and i can hit em hardest by depriving em of a world championship dyou think they had inside information at any time the plant you talked about they could have done maybe they still have but theres only five of us left theres still a possiblity his expression was grim his body taut maybe well know better after the race right now though im going to have a few words with somebody who stern oh my god dyou have to get involved with them i guess we are already i just want to let him know that were not scared of seamark cruises theyre booked in at a hotel down the street i checked on them be careful mark i intend to be he kissed her stood up and strode towards the door in fact im looking forward to this meeting theres a number of things ive got to get out of my system before i can race again stern was alone in his hotel room his eyes narrowed with suspicion and surprise when he answered the door to slades knock but he quickly recovered his suave composure well if it isnt mark slade he stepped back holding the door open for the other to enter come for his old job back but too late im afraid ricksons our number one driver but we can always use an extra reserve youve got it all wrong slade ignored the offer of a seat i wouldnt work for seamark cruises again in any capacity just a social call then stern gave a hollow laugh called to wish us well the italians and the french are our most dangerous rivals but i reckon we can pip them no i didnt come for that either slades voice was quiet only the veins standing out on his neck and forehead betraying the anger which seethed inside him about your threats threats sterns eyes widened amazement superb acting this time you wont get away with it stern two murders wagstaffe and kilby maybe the copsll get something on you maybe they wont just pull your horns in you might not be so lucky next time especially with me youre crazy the hammerton team is cursed everybody knows that stern glanced about him nervously noting that slade barred his way to the door there was a bellpush by the bed he wondered if he could make it physically he was no match for this powerfully built man who faced him he backed away a step thats slander but there are only the two of us stern slade hissed your word against mine this is just a friendly warning call your murderers off well settle this out there on the circuit it was never meant to be settled any other way oh no i dont take kindly to people who sabotage my car even when im only testlapping nor to thugs who try to gun me down whatve you done with that guy the gamekeeper wounded benny the leg i think hes known as i suppose one day theyll find his body in the thames or lying in some disused quarry ill call the police stern took a step towards the bellpush but it was only a token movement he checked licked his lips nervously please yourself slade turned back to the door his fingers resting on the handle i intend to be around for a long time to come but if anything else happens to any of the hammerton team the car or any attempt is made on myself then ill really come gunning for you get out stern was trembling visibly im on my way slade paused with the door half open just remember though cool it stern and tell seamark too this vendetta of his against the hammerton family concerns me now im the front man a few minutes later the seamark team manager was frantically dialling a call the engaged tone caused him to slam the receiver down with a force that threatened to shatter the entire telephone he gave way to a fit of cursing he left the hotel and hailed a cab seamark was staying in an hotel on the other side of town and he had to be informed of the confrontation without delay chapter eighteen the day of the iroc finals dawned dull and grey there had been no rain for five days but the weather experts predicted showers within the next twentyfour hours rain on a track which had been dry hitherto spelled out hazardous conditions for the drivers oil slicks would form on the surface from leaks during practice laps with no time for them to wash away slade was giving the chevy a final check when fogg and wylie arrived followed a few minutes later by john clyde the latters face was strained as though he had not slept the movement of every limb an effort fogg produced an old blackboard the improvised signalling board which they had used at riverside edged with fluorescent paint dont signal from the pits slade told him i might have difficulty in picking you out stand fifty yards or so away from the others im not particularly interested in laptimes not at the start anyway i must know my position though and how many seconds im behind the car in front and ahead of the one behind mark it clearly if it starts to rain itll be difficult to see the board through the spray fogg nodded likewise ill signal to you slade continued if i need to come into the pits on the next time round slade had already placed the basic tools and parts in readiness plugs and spanners wire tape and screwdrivers these were things he liked to supervise himself knowing that it could turn a retirement into a placing lee informs me that she will be watching the race on television in her room clyde grunted it seems rather hard that she cant be here in her rightful place i told her to stay put slade snapped and to keep her door locked we cant afford to take any chances i would have thought that if seamark were going to try any tricks theyd be directed against either you or the car clyde showed his resentment towards a matter which he obviously considered should have been left to his judgement as team manager seamark are likely to try anything slade replied we must guard against any eventuality slade went out on one last practice lap cruising at a steady mph he sweated his mouth was dry even with chewing gum just a few more hours an eternity the worst part he wanted something to do something to occupy his mind it wasnt easy everything that had to be done was done all that was left was the waiting crowds were pouring in the main stands were already packed to capacity coffee and liquor stalls were busy and the best places had long been taken by the caravanners and campers slade stood surveying the milling scene from the pits twentyfour hours of deafening noise lay ahead choking fumes no chance for even the most bored spectator who had been persuaded to come along against his or her will to sleep the excitement was mounting some were not there just for the thrills of racing secretly they hoped for the sight of blood a spectacular crash a blazing inferno it was always the way and slade hoped that he would not be the one to oblige these racetrack ghouls the craving for tobacco and whisky had left him in a way this was not as bad as riverside he decided there although he had projected himself into the hammerton car he was relying on kilby it wasnt the same as having to take full responsibility whatever happened this time it would be his own doing almost mechanically he went through the procedure leading up to the three oclock deadline it was as though some numbing force was rendering him insensible to everything around him yet allowing his reactions to function normally a highspeed robot he wondered how long it would last all he asked was twentyfour hours after that it didnt matter now they were at the grids wylie and fogg still checking the hooter the fiveminute warning one minute slade had lost all sense of time wylie was saying something the driver saw the chief mechanics lips move the words lost in the roar of nine engines revving up slade didnt know what wylie was saying it didnt matter it was too late now mechanics moved away from the cars and slade felt the loneliness of the racing driver he stared at the track ahead found himself yawning that was a good sign somehow his body had remembered to relax itself he checked all the switches engaged gear consulted his watch the starters flag was raised revs at the flag fell and the cars surged away accelerating changing up nothing had altered for mark slade it might have been a continuation of last year a race that had never ended trembling sweating he saw the seamark car setting the pace bright yellow hugging the inside behind it was the blue italian then the red swiss he was fourth he checked on those behind all bunching there was a very long way to go positions did not matter at this stage it was consistency that counted the pace car led the way for well over a lap the italian was closing the gap the swiss dropping back the blue car riding high on the banking took the lead but by the end of the next lap the fastest cars were lapping the slowest in anything less than an iroc lapping slower cars at daytona was a hazard but this time there was no amateur element to impede the professionals time and again positions changed cars riding the banking only to find their path obstructed by others dropping back fighting a wheeltowheel duel being forced to take to the grass or to bump their way clear by lap eighteen slade was lying second the swiss now in the lead the seamark car was level with him rickson using the hammerton slipstream to slight advantage the italian had fallen back along with parbello an americansponsored team by lap twentyfive the italian had crawled into the pits the engine cutting out the fuel pickup system refusing to take the last gallons but eventually he rejoined the race in eighth place now slade was sandwiched between seamark and the swiss and at one stage was lucky to escape without contact the iroc continued there was to be no letup after the first refuelling stop seamark took the leading position again slade and the italian close behind it was then that the swiss swerved on the banking sideskidded the retaining wall and had to drop out with crumpled bodywork the suspension upright and driveshaft bent now there were only eight cars left it was conceivable that more would go before the halfway stage slade hoped that he would not be amongst them he tried not to think about it positions altered little during the next hour and then the american overshot the pits and it was discovered that he had been overcome by exhaust fumes an inspection by the mechanics revealed that the exhaust pipes had cracked and it was halfanhour before the car was back on the circuit seamark led slade was a close second and now he had a double fight on his hands it seemed as though the gathering dusk was bringing back his fears no longer were the multicoloured spectators caravans and tents a gaudy background to inspire him colours merged into an indistinguishable grey turning to black it was as though there was nobody out there at all just eight speeding cars in an empty void reminiscent of a space flight when the radio communications have broken down emptiness death spreading its mantle slade saw the accident it must have been the italian he concluded the engine blowing up trailing smoke and oil across the circuit he was glad he was ahead of it impact one of the other cars had been unable to avoid it he did not know the severity of the crash but either driver would have been lucky to escape without multiple injuries six left and hammerton and seamark were still setting the pace the darkness was illuminated only by the lights from the spectators caravans coffee and liquor stalls there were some who wanted to sleep but nobody would tonight slade experienced the first twinges of panic fear is one thing panic is another he felt the urge to swing into the side clamber out of the car vault the fence and lose himself in the faceless crowd even the thought caused him to ease up momentarily on the accelerator and lose ground seconds later he was back to fullthrottle making it up again knowing that lee hammerton would be watching closely on her television set she would have noticed the lapse it would worry her he stemmed the panic by turning his thoughts to lee if he won what then a permanent relationship that entailed a host of things marriage everything depended upon yvonne she would make his decision for him one way or the other another refuelling stop wylie was alone in the hammerton pit that meant that chris fogg was taking his break there was no sign of john clyde possibly the team manager was conferring with the stewards over something slade gave wylie a hand with changing the wheels neither of them spoke slade did not ask about the accident he tried to forget that it had happened curiosity would not help him his business was driving for lee for yvonne for himself just this one last time after five hours he was leading the field from seamark yet his feeling of euphoria the smell of success at the highest level was overshadowed by something else his body was tense and sweating and that cackling gremlin laughter had taken on another meaning slades hands were clammy his mouth dry he could not get away from the foreboding which was building up fast like dark storm clouds on his horizon he recalled the hammerton curse shuddered something was going to happen before this night was ended chris fogg experienced relief at being away from the pits whereas usually he rested during those brief periods of offduty tonight he could not he always experienced restlessness during races but tonight it was more than that a creeping terror that almost had him leaving walking away from here boarding a train that would take him anywhere anywhere so long as it wasnt daytona he wandered aimlessly amongst the tents and caravans the glow of a thousand independent lights illuminating the whole scene like some bizarre rock festival he threaded his way amongst those who slept out in the open a drunk hiccoughed and sat up made him jump fogg glanced up saw that the sky was overcast hiding the stars in all probability it would rain before dawn and that wouldnt help anybody certainly not slade he wondered what went on inside slades mind fear certainly he tried to hide it but when youd mixed with drivers in the bigtime you got to recognise it like a man haunted by something he couldnt shake off the hammerton curse chris fogg felt little shivers running up and down his spine in the beginning he had laughed at the legend now suddenly it was becoming very real he found himself glancing round instinctively cringing away from the furtive figures in the shadows a voice somewhere inside him screaming at him to run and keep on running other doubts suspicions crowded his mind of course there was something between lee hammerton and slade and kilby had been involved as well who had murdered kilby seamark or fogg felt his pulses start to race slade didnt seem the type if there was a type you couldnt get away from the roar and smell of the cars from where he was he could not see the circuit as a line of caravans blocked his view he hesitated contemplated joining the throng of spectators no he didnt want to watch all he wanted to do was to get away from daytona a movement attracted his attention had him peering into the shadows people were milling jostling for better viewpoints of the race there was no reason to pay particular attention to any of them except that fogg stared his first thought that he must have been jumping to conclusions a mingled sensation of shock and surprise as he recognised the hurrying shape logically trying to tell himself that he must be mistaken but he knew he was not the other was moving with a purposefulness weaving his way between tents and sleeping bodies as though he had some definite destination in mind no hesitation yet there was a furtiveness in the way he glanced around him had fogg pressing himself back into the shadow of a nearby caravan chris fogg did not understand why but he found himself following moving fast in case he lost the other in the crowds he had no reason to follow there was nothing to prevent him from quickening his step joining up with the man in front except that intuition told him that something was wrong that tingling in his spine travelling right the way up and spreading out into his scalp a slight incline then a grassy bank some halfdozen caravans were parked on a knoll seemingly precariously perched early arrivals who had probably been there a week or more in order to secure a prominent viewpoint of the iroc their position superior even to some of the main stands facing the first bend where cars momentarily slowed superstar drivers clearly visible on every lap those who watched paying homage in their own way fogg held back puzzled lights showed in every van except the end one which was in total darkness the occupants could have been sleeping exhausted by the incessant roar of chevy engines and the squealing of tortured tyre rubber he felt the first few spots of rain on his head icy cold in spite of the night being mild and shivered again the man in front was now climbing that hillock a desperation in his movements once he looked back but the mechanic was hidden in the shadow of a tent and in that instant chris fogg knew felt his abdomen tightening into a ball wanted to spew up his fear everything figured the last piece of the jigsaw the redherrings which had fooled both detectiveinspector king and captain ferris and slade were suddenly ripped apart this was the one whom mark slade had called the sleeper god slade the reason the plan were all too clear if only mark had been here now but he wasnt he was out there dicing with death totally unaware of this new menace defenceless another killing another mystery and everybody would blame the hammerton curse the final coup was at hand fogg saw the man whom he had followed fumble a key out of his pocket and unlock the caravan door no lights came on he would not need any it was starting to rain hard as the mechanic made a run for the slope slipping and falling in his urgency clawing at tussocks of coarse grass to check his slide struggling up again it seemed an eternity before he reached the caravan leaning against it trying to listen but the roar of the cars below drowned every sound except one that scream of mortal terror had chris fogg cringing wanting to run into the night not wanting to see or know what was happening in there but his legs refused to move instantly jellified so that they no longer supported the weight of his body had him cowering on his knees listening because there was no way he could shut those awful noises out a loud report it might have been a backfire blanketed by the ensuing noises the cars were like a background symphony now an eerie whining that no longer dominated there was a horse somewhere christ it was impossible but you heard its neighing enraged equine shrieks the pounding of hooves god you could smell its sweat and excreta one last shriek of fear that was cut off by a series of dull sickening blows foggs hands were clasped to his eyes in case he should find himself compelled to watch in his mind he saw horse and rider the latter thrown to the ground and at the mercy of his plunging mount an irate beast that flailed the air with plunging hooves crashing them down with unbelievable ferocity pounding that body again and again until it was an unrecognisable crimson morass only then backing off and snorting its triumph eyes glowing redly in the darkness foaming at the mouth the sound of the cars was back louder than before the screaming that of the tyres as they took the bends the stench the fumes from their exhausts the pounding noises from the watchers full daylight it had been raining hard for some time because chris foggs overalls were saturated and clinging to his chilled body the iroc would be in its closing stages now he should have been back at the pits hours ago maybe it was already too late to go back the caravan door was swinging loosely in the slight breeze fogg tried to look away but he couldnt his hands hovered across his eyes but something seemed to prevent his fingers from shutting out the scene within that caravan oh jesus god it was awful blood splattered the walls crimson rivulets running down and forming a pool on the floor starting to congeal smashed and splintered fittings made a pathetic attempt to hide that pulped bloody form and failed the skull almost cleaved in two the mouth a twisted cavity frozen into that last scream of sheer terror eyes bulging like inflated bubbles that would surely burst at any second dead but reflecting the ultimate in mortal terror chris fogg was retching unable to drag himself away those devastating wounds hed seen them before on waggy kilby crescentshaped imprints that embedded themselves in the flesh like brandingirons the marks of a crazed horse that had taken its revenge and stamped away into the darkness he noted other things subconsciously at first then more positively the open window overlooking the circuit the twisted barrel of the highpowered rifle lying beneath it the wooden stock smashed to matchwood the telescopic sight battered almost out of recognition a box of shells was scattered amongst the wreckage chris fogg experienced a sensation of relief whatever had happened in there it meant that mark slade would live that the snipers slug would never find its mark the mechanic found himself staring into those bloody features again meeting the dead orbs with an expression of contempt and revulsion a vengeance that was beyond his own comprehension an inexplicable terrible force had materialised and destroyed john clyde chapter nineteen it was after midnight when yet another car limped into the pits an american team a stockcar driver who cursed his luck fluently the trouble was first diagnosed as a broken alternator but then it was discovered the intermediate gear between the crankshaft and the camshaft was broken now there were five seamark took the lead again with hammerton close behind on the flat slade was now using the slipstream to gain the necessary advantage it was raining heavily and all five cars were forced to reduce speed rickson was tense every driver underwent a certain amount of tension but something was disturbing his concentration he could not afford to let that happen tried to dismiss it slade was too close for his liking he had to throw him off fuck this rain and in that instant he saw the face it couldnt be there it was impossible the features were squashed against the windshield a heavily jowled face that glared at him with sheer malevolence thick lips mouthing obscenities long greying hair streamed in the wind the neck was cuffed in some kind of scarlet material like a hunting coat eyes bulged with hypnotic hate rickson tried to scream but it was as though every human function was frozen into immobility oh jesus the bastard was trying to get at him blocking his vision the car was veering to the left and all he could do was to stare into that face could not even brace himself for the inevitable impact flames everywhere fire devouring him even whilst life still coursed through his broken body oh god this was hell for sure that guy in the red hunting garb standing amidst the inferno leering as he watched was satan himself jesus the bastard really hated him suddenly the pain was fading the flames werent burning him up any more quite cool and refreshing in fact it was going darker too maybe hed be able to sleep and when he woke up hed find that there hadnt been a crash after all daytona like everything else had been just a nightmare slade winced as he saw rickson suddenly veer to the left and hit the barriers he heard the muffled roar of the explosion the car instantly bursting into flames he forced himself not to look not to think about it and then he realised that he was no longer terrified just afraid there was a difference the bleak dawn came slade moved into the pits for refuelling and another wheel change wylie attended to him again there was no sign of either fogg or clyde it was strange but he had no time to ponder over their absence he had to concentrate on winning now that seamark were out of it he should make it from midday onwards the result was a mere formality and only the unexpected could have robbed mark slade of his world championship he smiled to himself as he eased away from the finishing line and into the pits taking his time cooperating with reporters and press photographers looking for john clyde and seeing instead lee hammerton walking towards him she was smiling but she was also pale and shaken and in the background he saw the police but why lee hammerton asked for the hundredth time as she and mark slade drove away from the airport slade was in the passenger seat he had had his share of driving for the present fogg and wylie would arrive back in england the following day with the chevy well im certain clyde had no connections with seamark slade glanced at her saw that she was still pale and upset maybe well come up with something when we search his office this whole business is a kaleidoscope of motives and redherrings clyde wanted kilby out of the way because of you that was one reason he wanted to kill me too hed undoubtedly fixed the tracking on the first chevy and then removed the evidence seamarks attempts at sabotage were an ideal cover for his own activities seamark was trying to settle an old score against both you and me and win the iroc into the bargain once i was dead clyde reckoned that the way to you would be free of all obstacles but why go to all the trouble of hiring a caravan at daytona in a fictitious name and trying to shoot you in the midst of an iroc why didnt he just waylay you beforehand and she blanched stave your head in with that awful horses hoof club like he did waggys and steves and oh god i told you the hammerton curse was still alive unless somebody managed to take that club from his room pound him to death with it and then return it it can only be the curse which killed him the police at daytona are still baffled slade tried to pass it off casually maybe seamark worked something a bit too slick for us all after ricksons number came up getting away with murder is easier in the states and maybe clyde realised this he was getting desperate by then as though time was running out for him but id never have married him i turned him down on several occasions lately as you know yes but steve kilby and myself were still around then with us out of the way there was always the chance that youd change your mind he was a handsome bastard and would have been invaluable to you once you were entirely on your own ill never be able to thank you enough mark her eyes misted over chris fogg was the hero of the hour hes pretty shaken up but hell be ok i guess well never really know what happened in that caravan that night perhaps its better not to know if it was the hammerton curse at work then this time it was on our side you won the iroc though hammerton are now firmly on the map im only sorry we didnt manage to pin anything on seamark he was as much the villain of the piece as clyde was i wonder if weve heard the last of him hell certainly be too busy licking his wounds to bother about either you or me for a long time to come slade smiled i was intrigued by that gun of john clydes he mustve picked it up somewhere in daytona a luger artillery model as used by the german infantry and paratroops in both world wars a mm fitted with a wooden shoulderstock drum magazine and an infrared telescopicsight deadly and he didnt even need a silencer with all the din that was going on hed picked his spot perfect if he hadnt hit me first time he could have tried another twenty and nobody wouldve been any the wiser and who would have suspected the hammerton team manager of sniping his own driver but theres still a lot unexplained lee turned off the main road bumping down the rough drive which led to the hammerton estate i suppose ill have to chase these contractors up myself if were ever going to get this place looking shipshape again i think well have a damned good search of clydes office slade said as the car came to a halt in front of the house first though well get unpacked it was early evening before they eventually began a systematic search of the estate office a small untidy extension on the end of the west wing this place was always his sanctum lee muttered as they foraged amongst the shelves and filingcabinets even in dads day it was a kind of holy of holies nobody except john clyde really knew what was going on dad left everything to him john paid all the bills and merely submitted a balance sheet after march st and march st isnt too far away right now is it slade smiled wryly meaning i dont know yet but he was in an awful hurry over something wasnt he and judging from the general disorder of this place its no wonder that nobody else knew what was going on nevertheless lets persevere lets get all the accounts books if we can find them three hours later they were still poring over a number of ledgers and examining a file of unpaid bills cheque book stubs showed cash withdrawals far beyond the weekly wage bills lee hammertons face was white and the fingers which turned the pages were unsteady look at these bank statements she held up a looseleaf file there have been large withdrawals from the deposit account too and these interest dividends theres hardly any capital left hes been selling the shares and at the worst possible time too were on the verge of bankruptcy were slade corrected her before we won the iroc the prizemoney and everything else it entails will rectify all this but but why didnt he wait until after the race and if youd won it would still have had to come out the balance sheet this time would have been his undoing things had gone too far even to pull the wool over your eyes unless unless what unless he became your husband before the deception was discovered you mean exactly a wife cannot prosecute her husband it was his only way whether i won or not id never have married him mark maybe not but he obviously wasnt giving up i guess wed better let detectiveinspector king have a look at these books but theres tonight first she slipped an arm around him the bed wont be aired but maybe between us we can generate enough warmth the weeks passed march merged into april and then may loomed ahead the chevy was clocking a regular mph on each test on the hammerton circuit now driven by chris fogg work had also commenced on the other two cars building them up to the required specifications four extra mechanics had been taken on lee hammerton gazed down from the window of her bedroom at the untidy array of cementmixers ladders trucks and other impedimenta which littered the forecourt well its certainly a relief to get the contractors in at last she sighed and mark slade lying naked on the bed studied her shapely figure through the neartransparent neglige he told himself that he could do a lot worse however unfinished business robbed him of the peace of mind which he might otherwise have enjoyed all his life he had seemed to be dodging issues there was a certain telephone call which he had to make sometime he should have made it on their return from the united states at the end of february two months and it still lay in his mental pending file i guess youre pretty well setup now he said your father would have been proud of you am i she turned to face him a quizzical almost pleading expression on her face weve won the iroc but thats all apart from the mechanical side hammerton are slowly grinding to a standstill i dont have a manager and nor do i have a regular number one driver you havent really done much about getting either he dropped his gaze as he spoke and you havent told me what your plans are i made it clear i was finishing with driving after daytona you said that last time i came back for a special reason though what better time to finish than on the crest of the wave a world champion but you got your nerve back no not really i dispelled a few fears about certain aspects of driving but im not going back to the circuits again as it stands i really dont know whether ive regained my nerve or not id sooner it stayed that way not really knowing you can manage the team for me i never was much good at organising but your experience would be invaluable to me i could bring in a manager and you could stay on in an advisory position like before he grinned you dont need a troubleshooter now lee seamark are still around im real competition now not just craig hammertons daughter they wont be satisfied with second placings well he reached for his shirt and trousers if they trouble you you can always give me a ring i think maybe i wont get that phone disconnected after all youre youre really going back to crossways well he concentrated on buttoning his shirt and tucking it into his trousers theres a lot needs to be done to my place too there were some nettles i was about to scythe down when you arrived and stopped me i guess theyll have a pretty good growth on them by now mark she came back and sat on the bed beside him her hand resting on his arm why dont you just stick around you dont have to do anything to justify your existence id like that tell you what he kissed her and stood up ill just go downstairs and make a phone call then ill give you a decision one way or the other hows that all right dont be too long about it though she lay back on the bed listening to his footsteps receding down the stairs the opening and closing of the study door she heard him dialling then after a time the sound of his muffled voice the words inaudible to her in the end she gave up trying to eavesdrop mark slade would come back in due course and tell her whether he was staying or leaving this time his decision would be final no way would she change his mind but she knew in her own heart he would be staying he still had something to prove to himself she thought about yvonne again and started to get dressed
