the osprey and the shark by clark ashton smith december an osprey who had sighted a plump turbot glided to the surface of the waves and at that very same moment a shark arose in pursuit of the selfsame fish the turbot saw them both and the shark and the osprey looked at each other if i could fly like that and plunge in from the heavens nothing could evade me thought the shark if i could swim and dive and dwell under water as he does everything would be at my mercy thought the osprey in the meanwhile the turbot had gotten too far away for either of them to ever catch it
