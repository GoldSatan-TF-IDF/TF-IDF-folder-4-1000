the last hieroglyph clark ashton smith the world itself in the end shall be turned to a round cipher old prophecy of zothique nushain the astrologer had studied the circling orbs of night from many farseparated regions and had cast with such skill as he was able to command the horoscopes of a myriad men women and children from city to city from realm to realm he had gone abiding briefly in any place for often the local magistrates had banished him as a common charlatan or elsewise in due time his consultants had discovered the error of his predictions and had fallen away from him sometimes he went hungry and shabby and small honor was paid to him anywhere the sole companions of his precarious fortunes were a wretched mongrel dog that had somehow attached itself to him in the desert town of zulbhasair and a mute oneeyed negro whom he had bought very cheaply on yoros he had named the dog ansarath after the canine star and had called the negro mouzda which was a word signifying darkness in the course of his prolonged itinerations the astrologer came to xylac and made his abode in its capital ummaos which had been built above the shards of an elder city of the same name long since destroyed by a sorcerers wrath here nushain lodged with ansarath and mouzda in a halfruinous attic of a rotting tenement and from the tenements roof nushain was wont to observe the positions and movements of the sidereal bodies on evenings not obscured by the fumes of the city at intervals some housewife or jade some porter or huckster or petty merchant would climb the decaying stairs to his chamber and would pay him a small sum for the nativity which he plotted with immense care by the aid of his tattered books of astrological science when as often occurred he found himself still at a loss regarding the significance of some heavenly conjunction or opposition after poring over his books he wouid consult ansarath and would draw profound auguries from the variable motions of the dogs mangy tail or his actions in searching for fleas certain of these divinations were fulfilled to the considerable benefit of nushains renown in ummaos people came to him more freely and frequently hearing that he was a soothsayer of some note and moreover he was immune from prosecution owing to the liberai laws of xylac which permitted all the sorcerous and mantic arts it seemed for the first time that the dark pianets of his fate were yielding to auspicious stars for this fortune and the coins which accrued thereby to his purse he gave thanks to vergama who throughout the whole continent of zothique was deemed the most powerful and mysterious of the genii and was thought to rule over the heavens as well as the earth on a summer night when the stars were strewn thickly like a firey sand on the black azure vault nushain went up to the roof of his lodgingplace as was often his custom he took with him the negro mouzda whose one eye possessed a miraculous sharpness and had served well on many occasions to supplement the astrologers own rather nearsighted vision through a wellcodified system of signs and gestures the mute was able to communicate the result af his observations to nushain on this night the constellation of the great dog which had presided over nushains birth was ascendant in the east regarding it closely the dim eyes of the astrologer were troubled by a sense of something unfamiliar in its configuration he could not determine the precise character of the change till mouzda who envinced much excitement called his attention to three new stars of the second magnitude which had appeared in close proximity to the dogs hindquarters these remarkable novae which nushain could discern only as three reddish blurs formed a small equilateral triangle nushain and mouzda were both certain that they had not been visible on any previous evening by vergama this is a strange thing swore the astrol oger filled with amazement and dumbfoundment he began to compute the problematic influence of the novae on his future reading of the heavens and perceived at once that they would exert according to the law of astral emanations a modifying effect on his own destiny which had been so largely controlled by the dog he could not however without consulting his books and tables decide the particular trend and import of this supervening influence though he felt sure that it was most momentous whether for his bale or welfare leaving mouzda to watch the heavens for other prodigies he descended at once to his attic there after collating the opinions of several oldtime astrologers on the power exerted by novae he began to recast his own horoscope painfully and with much agitation he labored throughout the night and did not finish his figurings till the dawn came to mix a deathly grayness with the yellow light of the candles there was it seemed but one possible interpretation of the altered heavens the appearance of the triangle of novae in conjunction with the dog signified clearly that nushain was to start ere long on an unpremeditated journey which would involve the transit of no less than three elements mouzda and ansarath were to accompany him and three guides appearing successively at tbe proper times would lead him toward a destined goal so much his calculations had revealed but no more there was nothing to foretell whether the journey would prove auspicious or disastrous nothing to indicate its bourn purpose or direction the astrologer was much disturbed by this somewhat singular and equivocal augury he was illpleased by the prospect of an imminent journey for he did not wish to leave ummaos among whose credulous people he had begun to establish himself not without success moreover a strong apprehension was roused within him by the oddly manifold nature and veiled outcome of the journey all this he felt was suggestive of the workings of some occult and perhaps sinister providence and surely it was no common traveling which would take him through three elements and would require a triple guidance during the nights that followed he and mouzda watched the mysterious novae as they went over toward the vmst behind the brightflaming dog and he puzzled interminably over his charts and volumes hoping to discover some error in the reading he had made but always in the end he was compelled to the same interpretation more and more as time went on he was troubled by the thought of that unwelcome and mysterious journey which he must make he continued to prosper in ummaos and it seemed that there was no conceivable reason for his departure from that city he was as one who awaited a dark and secret summons not knowing whence it would come nor at what hour throughout the days he scanned with fearful anxiety the faces of his visitors deeming that the first of the three starpredicted guides might arrive unheralded and umecognized among them mouzda and the dog ansarath with the intuition of dumb things were sensible oe the weird uneasiness felt by their master they shared it palpably the negro showing his apprehension by wild and demoniac grimaces and the dog crouching under the astrologers table or prowling restlessly to and fro with his halfhairless tail between his legs such behavior in its turn served to reconfirm the inquietude of nushain who deemed it a bad omen on a certain evening nushain pored for the fiftieth time over his horoscope which he had drawn with sundrycolored inks on a sheet of papyrus he was much startled when on the blank lower margin of the sheet he saw a curious character which was no part of his own scribbling the character was a hieroglyph written in dark bituminous brown and seeming to represent a mummy whose shroudings were loosened about the legs and whose feet were set in the posture of a long stride it was facing toward that quarter of the chart where stood the sign indicating the great dog which in zothique was a house of the zodiac nushains surprise turned to a sort of trepidation as he studied the heiroglyph he knew that the margin of the chart had been wholly clear on the previous night and during the past day he had not left the attic at any time mouzda he felt sure would never have dared to touch the chart and moreover the negro was little skilled in writing among the various inks employed by nushain there was none that resembled the sullen brown of the character which seemed to stand out in a sad relief on the white papyrus nushain felt the alarm of one who confronts a sinister and unexplainable apparition no human hand surely had inscribed the mummyshapen character like the sign of a strange outer planet about to invade the houses of his horoscope here as in the advent of the three novae an occult agency was suggested vainly for many hours he sought to unriddle the mystery but in all his books there was naught to enlighten him for this thing it seemed was wholly without precedent in astrology during the next day he was busied from morn till eve with the plotting of those destinies ordained by the heavens for certain people of ummaos after completing the calculations with his usual toilsome care he unrolled his own chart once more albeit with trembling fingers an eeriness that was nigh to panic seized him when he saw that the brown hieroglyph no longer stood on the margin but was now placed like a striding figure in one of the lower houses where it still fronted toward the dog as if advancing on that ascendant sign henceforth the astrologer was fevered with the awe and curiosity of one who watches a fatal but inscrutable portent never during the hours that he pondered above it was there any change in the intruding character and yet on each successive evening when he took out the chart he saw that the mummy had strode upward into a higher house drawing always nearer to the house of the dog there came a time when the figure stood on the dogs threshold portentous with mystery and menace that were still beyond the astrologers divining it seemed to wait while the night wore on and was shot through with the gray wefting of dawn then overworn with his prolonged studies and vigils nushain slept in his chair without the troubling of any dream he slept and mouzda was careful not to disturb him and no visitors came to the attic on that day so the morn and the noon and the afternoon went over and their going was unheeded by nushain he was awakened at eve by the loud and dolorous howling of ansarath which appeared to issue from the rooms farthest corner confusedly ere he opened his eyes he became aware of an odor of bitter spices aad piercing natron then with the dim webs of sleep not wholly swept from his vision he beheld by the yellowy tapers that mouzda had lighted a tall mummylike form that waited in silence beside him the head arms and body of the shape were wound closely with bitumencolored cerements but the folds were loosened from the hips downward and the figure stood like a walker with one brown withered foot in advance of its fellow terror quickened in nushains heart and it came to him that the shrouded shape whether lich or phantom resembled the weird invasive hieroglyph that had passed from house to house through the chart of his destiny then from the thick swathings of the apparition a voice issued indistinctly saying prepare yourself o nushain for i am the first guide of that journey which was foretold to you by the stars ansarath comering beneath the astrologers bed was still howling his fear of the visitant and nushain saw that mouzda had tried to conceal himself in company with the dog though a chill as of imminent death was upon him and he deemed the apparition to be death itself nushain arose from the chair with that dignity proper to an astrologer which he had maintained through ali the vicissitudes of his lifetime he called mouzda and ansarath from their hidingplace and the two obeyed him though with many cringings before the dark muffled mummy with the comrades of his fortune behind him nushain turned to the visitant i am ready he said in a voice whose quavering was almost imperceptible but i would like with me certain of my belongings the mummy shook his mobled head it were well to take with you nothing but your horoscope for this alone shall you retain in the end nushain stooped above the table on which he had left his nativity before he began to roll the open papyrus he noticed that the hieroglyph of the mummy had vanished it was as if the written symbol after moving athwart his horoscope had materialized itself in the figure that now attended him but on the charts nether margin in remote opposition to the dog was the seablue heiroglyph of a quaint merman with carplike tail and head half human half apish and behiad the merman was the black hieroglyph of a small barge nushains fear for a moment was subdued by wonder but he rolled the chart carefully and stood holding it in his right hand come said the guide your time is brief and you must pass through the three elements that guard the dwellingplace of vergama from unseasonable intrusion these words in a measure confirmed the astrologers divinations but the mystery of his future fate was in no wise lightened by the intimation that he must enter presumably at the journeys end the dim house of that being called vergama whom some considered the most secret of all the gods and others the most cryptical of demons in all the lands of zothique there were rumors and fables regarding vergama but these were wholly diverse and contradictory except in their common attribution of almost omnipotent powers to this entity no man knew the situation of his abode but it was believed that vast muititudes of people had entered it during the centuries and millenniums and that none had returned therefrom ofttimes had nushain called upon the name of vergama swearing or protesting thereby as men are wont to do by the cognomens of their shrouded lords but now hearing the name from the lips of his macabre visitor he was filled with the darkest and most eery apprehensions he sought to subdue these feelings and to resign himself to the manifest will of the stars with mouzda and ansarath at his heels he followed the striding mummy which seemed little hampered if at all by its trailing cerenents with one regretful baekward glance at his littered books and papers he passed from the attic room and down the tenement stairs a wannish light seemed to cling about the swathings of the mummy but apart from this there was no illumination and nushain thought that the house was strangely dark and silent as if all its occupants had died or had gone away he heard no sound from the evening city nor could he see aught but closeencroaching darkness beyond the windows that should have gazed on a little street also it seemed that the stairs had changed and lengthened giving no more on the courtyard of the tenement but plunging deviously into an unsuspected region of stifling vaults and foul dismal nitrous corridors here the air was pregnant with death and the heart of nushain failed him everywhere in the shadowcurtained crypts and deepshelved recesses he felt the innumerable presence of the dead he thought that there was a sad sigh ing of stirred cerements a breath exhaled by longstiffened cadavers a dry clicking of lipless teeth beside him as he went but darkness walled his vision and he saw nothing save the luminous form of his guide who stalked onward as if through a natal realm it seemed to nushain that he passed through boundless catacombs in which were housed the mortality and corruption of all the ages behind him still he heard the shuffling of mouzda and at whiles the low frightened whine of ansarath so he knew that the twain were faithful to him but upon him with a chill of lethal damps there grew the horror of his surroundings and he shrank with all the repulsion of living flesh from the shrouded thing that he followed and those other things that moldered round about in the fathomless gloom half thinking to hearten himself by the sound of his own voice he began to question the guide though his tongue clove to his mouth as if palsied is it indeed vergama and none other who has summoned me forth upon this journey for what purpose has he called me and in what land is his dwelling your fate has summoned you said the mummy in the end at the time appointed and no sooner you shall learn the purpose as to your third question you would be no wiser if i should name the region in which the house of vergama is hidden from mortal trespass for the land is not listed on any terrene chart nor map of the starry heavens these answers seemed equivocal and disquieting to nushain who was possessed by frightful forebodings as he went deeper into the subterranean charnels dark indeed he thought must be the goal of a journey whose first stage had led him so far amid the empire of death and corruption and dubious surely was the being who had called him forth and had sent to him as the first guide a sere and shrunken mummy clad in the tombs habiliments now as he pondered these matters almost to frenzy the shelfy walls of the catacomb before him were outlined by a dismal light and he came after the mummy into a chamber where tall candles of bhck pitch in sockets of tarnished silver burned about an immense and solitary sarcophagus upon the blank lid and sides of the sarcophagus as nushain neared it he could see neither runes nor sculptures nor hieroglyphs engraven but seemed from the proportions that a giant must lie within the mummy passed athwart the chamber without pausing but nushain seeing that the vaults beyond were full of darkness drew back with a reluctance that he could not conquer and though the stars had decreed his journey it seemed to him that human flesh could go no farther prompted by a sudden impulse he seized one of the heavy yardlong tapers that burned stilly about the sarcophagus and holding it in his left hand with his horoscope still firmly clutched io the right he fled with mouzda and ansarath on the way he had come hoping to retrace his footsteps through the gloomy caverns and return to ummaos by the tapers light he heard no sound of pursuit from the mummy but ever as he fled the pitch candle flaring wildly revealed to him the horrors that darkness had curtained fmm his eyes he saw the bones of men that were piled in repugnant confusion with those of fell monsters and the riven sarcophagi from which protruded the halfdecayed members of innominate beings members which were neither heads nor hands nor feet and soon the catacomb divided and redivided before him so that he must choose his way at random not knowing whether it would lead him back to ummaos or into the untrod depths presently he came to the huge browless skull of an uncouth creature which reposed on the ground with upwardgazing orbits and beyond the skull was the monsters moldly skeleton wholly blocking the passage its ribs were cramped by the narrowing walls as if it had crept there and had died in the darkness unable to withdraw or go forward white spiders demonheaded and large as monkeys had woven their webs in the hollow arches of the bones and they swarmed out interminably as nushain approached and the skeleton seemed to stir and quiver as they seethed over it abhorrently and dropped to the ground before the astrologer behind them others poured in a countless army crowding and mantling every ossicle nushain fled with his companions and running back to the forking of the caverns he followed another passage here he was not pursued by the demon spiders but hurrying on lest they or the mummy overtake him he was soon halted by the rim of a great pit which filled the catacomb from wall to wall and was overwide for the leaping of man the dog ansarath sniffing certain odors that arose from the pit recoiled with a mad howling and nushain holding the taper outstretched above it discerned far down a glimmer of ripples spreading cirdewise on some unctuous black fluid and two bloodred spots appeared to swim with a weaving motion at the center then he heard a hissing as of some great cauldron heated by wizard fires and it seemed that the blackness boiled upward mounting swiftly and evilly to overflow the pit and the red spots as they neared him were like luminous eyes that gazed malignantly into his own so nushain turned away in haste and returning upon his steps he found the mummy awaiting him at the junction of the catacombs it would seem o nushain that you have doubted your own horoscope said the guide with a certain irony however even a bad astrologer on occasion may read the heavens aright obey then the stars that decreed your journey henceforward nushain followed the mummy without recalcitrance returning to the chamber in which stood the immense sarcophagus he was enjoined by his guide to replace in its socket the black taper he had stolen without other light than the phosphorescence of the mummys cerements he threaded the foul gloom of those profounder ossuaries vhich lay beyond at last through caverns where a dull dawning intruded upon the shadows he came out beneath shrouded heavens on the shore of a wild sea that clamored in mist and cloud and spindrift as if recoiling from the harsh air and light the mummy drew back into the subterrane and it said here my dominion ends and i must leave you to await the second guide standing with the poignant seasalt in his nostrils with his hair and garments outblown on the gale nushain heard a metallic clangor and saw that a door of rusty bronze had closed in the cavernentrance the beach was walled by unscalable cliffs that ran sheerly to the wave an each hand so perforce the astrologer waited and from the torn surf he beheld erelong the emergence of a seablue merman whose head was half hmnan half apish and behind the merman there hove a smll black barge that was not steered or moved by any visible being at this nushain recalled the hieroglyphs of the seacreature and the boat which had appeared on the margin of his nativity and unrolling the papyrus he saw with wonderment that the figures were both gone and he doubted not that they had passed like the mummys hieroglyph through all the zodiacal houses even to that house which presided over his destiny and thence mayhap they had emerged into material being but in their stead now was the burning hieroglyph of a firecolored salamander set opposite to the great dog the merman beckoned to him with antic gestures grinning deeply and showing the white serrations of his sharklike teeth nushain went forward and entered the barge in obedience to the signs made by the seacreature and mouzda and ansarath in faithfulness to their master accompanied him thereupon the merman swam away through the boiling surf and the barge as if oared and ruddered by mere enchantment swung about forthwith and warring smoothly against the wind and wave was drawn straightly over that dim unnamable ocean half seen amid rushing foam and mist the merman swam steadily on before time and space were surely outpassed during that voyage and as if he had gone beyond mortal existence nushain experienced neither thirst nor hunger but it seemed that his soul drifted upon seas of strange doubt and direst alienation and he feared the misty chaos about him even as he had feared the nighted catacombs often he tried to question the mercreature concerning their destination but received no answer and the wind blowing from shores unguessed and the tide flowing to unknown gulfs were alike filled with whispers of awe and terror nushain pondered the mysteries of his journey almost to madness and the thought came to him that after passing through the region of death he was now traversing the gray limbo of uncreated things and thinking this he was loth to surmise the third stage of his journey and he dared not reflect upon the nature of its goal anon suddenly the mists were riven and a cataract of golden rays poured down from a highseated sun near at hand to the lee of the driving barge a tall island hove with verdurous trees and light shellshaped domes and blossomy gardens hanging far up in the dazzlement of noon there with a sleepy purling the surf was lulled on a low grassy shore that had not known the anger of storm and fruited vines and fullblown flowers were pendent above the water it seemed that a spell of oblivion and slumber was shed from the island and that any who landed thereon would dwell inviolable for ever in sunbright dreams nushain was seized with a longing for its green flowery refuge and he wished to voyage no farther into the dreadful nothingness of the mistbound ocean and between his longing and his terror he quite forgot the terms of that destiny which had been ordained for him by the stars there was no halting nor swerving of the barge but it drew still nearer to the isle in its coasting and nushain saw that the intervening water was clear and shallow so that a tall man might easily wade to the beach he sprang into the sea holding his horoscope aloft and began to walk toward the island and mouzda and ansarath followed him swimming side by side though hampered somewhat by his long wet robes the astrologer thought to reach that alluring shore nor was there any movement on the part of the merman to intercept him the water was midway between his waist and his armpits and now it lapped at his girdle and now at the kneefolds of his garment and the island vines and blossoms drooped fragrantly above him then being but a step from that enchanted beach he heard a great hissing and saw that the vines the boughs the flowers the very grasses were intertwined and mingled with a million serpents writhing endlessly to and fro in hideous agitation from all parts of that lofty island the hissing came and the serpents with foully mottled volumes coiled crept and slithered upon it everywhere and no single yard of its surface was free from their defilement or clear for human treading turning seaward in his revulsion nushain found the merman and the barge waiting close at hand hopelessly he reentered the barge with his followers and the magically driven boat resumed its course and now for the first time the merman spoke saying over his shoulder in a harsh halfarticulate voice not without irony it would seem o nushain that you lack faith in your own divinations however even the poorest of astrologers may sometimes cast a horoscope correctly cease then to rebel against that which the stars have written the barge drove on and the mists closed heavily about it and the noonbright island was lost to view after a vague interim the muffled sun went down behind inchoate waters and clouds and a darkness as of primal night lay everywhere presently through the torn rack nushain beheld a strange heaven whose signs and planets he could not recognize and at this there came upon him the black horror of utmost dereliction then the mists and clouds returned veiling that unknown sky from his scrutiny and he could discern nothing but the merman who was visible by a wan phosphor that clung always about him in his swimming still the barge drove on and in time it seemed that a red morning rose stifled and conflagrant behind the mists the boat entered the broadening light and nushain who had thought to behold the sun once more was dazzled by a strange shore where flames towered in a high unbroken wall feeding perpetually to all appearances on bare sand and rock with a mighty leaping and a roar as of blown surf the flames went up and a heat like that of many furnaces smote far on the sea swiftly the barge neared the shore and the merman with uncouth gestures of farewell dived and disappeared under the waters nushain could scarcely regard the flames or endure their heat but the barge touched the strait tongue of land lying between them and the sea and before nushain from the wall of fire a blazing salamander emerged having the form and hue of that hieroglyph which had last appeared on his horoscope and he knew with ineffable consternation that this was the third guide of his threefold journey come with me said the salamander in a voice like the crackling of fagots nushain stepped from the barge to that strand which was hot as an oven beneath his feet and behind him though with paipable reluctance mouzda and ansarath still followed but approaching the flames behind the salamander and half swooning from their ardor he was overcome by the weakness of mortal flesh and seeking again to evade his destiny he fled along the narrow scroll of beach between the fire and the water but he had gone only a few paces when the salamander with a great fiery roaring and racing intercepted him and it drove him straight toward the fire with terrible flailings of its dragonlike tail from which showers of sparks were emitted he could not face the salamander and he thought the flames would consume him like paper as he entered them but in the wall there appeared a sort of opening and the fires arched themselves into an arcade and he passed through with his followers herded by the salamander into an ashen land where all things were veiled with lowhanging smoke and steam here the salamander observed with a kind of irony not wrongly o nushain have you interpreted the stars of your horoscope and now your journey draws to an end and you will need no longer the services of a guide so saying it left him going out like a quenched fire on the smoky air nushain standing irresolute beheld before him a white stairway that mounted amid the veering vapors behind him the flames rose unbroken like a topless rampart and on either hand from instant to instant the smoke shaped itself into demon forms and faces that menaced him he began to climb the stairs and the shapes gathered below and about frightful as a wizards familiars and keeping pace with him as he went upward so that he dared not pause or retreat far up he climbed in the fumy dimness and came unaware to the open portals of a house of gray stone rearing to unguessed height and amplitude unwillingly but driven by the thronging of the smoky shapes he passed through the portals with his companions the house was a place of long empty halls tortuous as the folds of a seaconch there were no windows no lamps but it seemed that bright suns of sikver had been dissolved and diffused in the air fleeing from the hellish wraiths that pursued him the astrologer followed the winding halls and emerged ultimately in an inner chamber where space itself was immured at the rooms center a cowled and muffled figure of colossal proportions sat upright on a marble chair silent unstirring before the figure on a sort of table a vast volume lay open nushain felt the awe of one who approaches the presence of some high demon or deity seeing that the phantoms had vanished he paused on the rooms threshold for its immensity made him giddy like the void interval that lies between the worlds he wished to withdraw but a voice issued from the cowled being speaking softly as the voice of his own inmost mind i am vergama whose other name is destiny vergama on whom you have called so ignorantly and idly as men are wont to call on their hidden lords vergama who has summoned you on the journey which au men must make at one time or another in one way or another come forward o nushain and read a little in my book the astrologer was drawn as by an unseen hand to the table leaning above it he saw that the huge volume stood open at its middle pages which were covered with a myriad signs written in inks of various colors and representing men gods fishes birds monsters animals constellations and many other things at the end of the last coiumn of the righthand page where little space was left for other inscriptions nushain beheld the hieroglyphs of an equalsided triangle of stars such as had lately appeared in proximity to the dog and following these the hieroglyphs of a mummy a merman a barge and a salamander resembling the figures that had come and gone on his horoscope and those that had guided him to the house of vergama in my book said the cowled figure the characters of all things are written and preserved all visible forms in the beginning were but symbols written by me and at the last they shall exist only as the writing of my book for a season they issue forth taking to themselves that which is known as substance it was i o nushain who set in the heavens the stars that foretold your journey i who sent the three guides and these things having served their purpose are now but infoliate ciphers as before vergama paused and an infinite silence returned to the room and a measureless wonder was upon the mind of nushain then the cowled being continued among men for a while there was that person called nushain the astrologer together with the dog aasarath and the negro mouzda who followed his fortunes but now very shortly i must turn the page and before turning it must finish the writing that belongs thereon nushain thought that a wind arose in the chamber moving lightly with a weird sigh though he felt not the actual breath of its passing but he saw that the fur of ansarath cowering close beside him was ruffled by the wind then beneath his marvelling eyes the dog began to dwindle and wither as if seared by a lethal magic and he lessened to the size of a rat and thence to the smallness of a mouse and the lightness of an insect though preserving still his original form after that the tiny thing was caught up by the sighing air and it flew past nushain as a gnat might fly and following it he saw that the heiroglyph of a dog was inscribed suddenly beside that of the salamander at the bottom of the righthand page but apart from this there remained no trace of ansarath again a wind breathed in the room touching not the astrologer but fluttering the ragged raiment of mouzda who crouched near to his master as if appealing for protection and the mute became shrunken and shriveled turning at the last to a thing light and thin as the black tattered wingshard of a beetle which the air bore aloft and nushain saw that the hieroglyph of a oneeyed negro was inscribed following that of the dog but aside from this there was no sign of mouzda now perceiving clearly the doom that was designed for him nushain would have fled from the presence of vergama he turned from the outspread volume and ran toward the chamber door his worn tawdry mbes of an astrologer flapping about his thin shanks but softly in his ear as he went there sounded the voice of vergama vainly do men seek to resist or evade that destiny which turns them to ciphers in the end in my book o nushain there is room even for a bad astmloger once more the weird sighing arose and a cold air played upon nushain as he ran and he paused midway in the vast room as if a wall had arrested him gently the air breathed on his lean gaunt figure and it lifted his graying locks and beard and it plucked softly at the roll of papyrus which he still held in his hand to his dim eyes the room seemed to reel and swell expanding infinitely borne upward around and around in a swift vertiginous swirling he beheld the seated shape as it loomed ever higher above him in cosmic vastness then the god was lost in light and nushain was a weightless and exile thing the withered skeleton of a lost leaf rising and falling on the bright whirlwind in the book of vergama at the end of the last column of the righthand page there stood the hieroglyph of a gaunt astrologer carrying a furled nativity vergama leaned forward from his chair and turned the page
