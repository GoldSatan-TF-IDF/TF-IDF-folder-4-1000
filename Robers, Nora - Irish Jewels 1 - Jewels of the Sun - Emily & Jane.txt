chapter one obviously without question shed lost her mind being a psychologist she ought to know all the signs were there had been there hovering and humming around her for months the edginess the short temper the tendency toward daydreaming and forgetfulness thered been a lack of motivation of energy of purpose her parents had commented on it in their mild youcandobetterjude way her colleagues had begun to glance at her covertly with quiet pity or unquiet distaste shed come to detest her job resent her students find a dozen petty faults with her friends and her family her associates and superiors every morning the simple task of getting out of bed to dress for the days classes had taken on the proportions of scaling a mountain worse a mountain she had absolutely no interest in seeing from a distance much less climbing then there was the rash impulsive behavior oh yes that was the final tipoff steadyasshegoes jude frances murray one of the sturdiest branches on the family tree of the chicago murrays sensible and devoted daughter of doctors linda and john k murray quit her job not took a sabbatical from the university not asked for a few weeks leave but quit right in the middle of the semester why she didnt have the faintest idea it had been as much a shock to her as to the dean to her associates to her parents had she reacted in this manner two years before when her marriage had shattered no indeed shed simply continued her routine her classes her studies her appointments without a hitch even while shuffling in the lawyers and neatly filing the paperwork that symbolizes the end of a union not that thered been much of a union or a great deal of hassling for the lawyers to legally sever it a marriage that had lasted just under eight months didnt generate a great deal of mess or trouble or passion passion she supposed was what had been missing if shed had any william wouldnt have left her flat for another woman almost before the flowers in her bridal bouquet had faded but there was no point in brooding over it at this late date she was what she was or had been what she was she corrected god only knew what she was now maybe that was part of it she mused shed been on some verge had looked down at the vast dark sea of sameness of monotony of tedium that was jude murray shed pinwheeled her arms scrambled back from the edge and run screaming away it was so unlike her thinking about it gave her such sharp palpitations she wondered if she might be having a heart attack just to cap things off american college professor found dead in leased volvo it would be an odd obituary perhaps it would make it into the irish times which her grandmother so loved to read her parents would be shocked of course it was such an untidy public embarrassing kind of death completely unsuitable naturally theyd be heartbroken as well but overall they would be puzzled what in the world was the girl thinking of going off to ireland when she had a thriving career and a lovely condo on the lakeside they would blame grannys influence and of course they would be right as they had been right since the moment shed been conceived in a very tasteful mating precisely one year after theyd married though she didnt care to imagine it jude was certain that her parents lovemaking was always very tasteful and precise rather like the wellchoreographed and traditional ballets they both so enjoyed and what was she doing sitting in a leased volvo that had its stupid wheel on the stupid wrong side of the car and thinking about her parents having sex all she could do was press her fingers to her eyes until the image faded away this she told herself was just the sort of thing that happened when you went crazy she took a deep breath then another oxygen to clear and calm the brain as she saw it she now had two choices she could drag her suitcases out of the car go inside the dublin airport and turn the keys back in to the leasing agent with the carrotred hair and the milewide smile and book a flight home of course she had no job but she could live off her stock portfolio very nicely for quite some time thank you she also no longer had a condo as shed rented it to that nice couple for the next six months but if she did go home she could stay with granny for a while and granny would look at her with those beautiful faded blue eyes full of disappointment jude darling you always get right to the edge of your hearts desire why is it you can never take that last step over i dont know i dont know miserable jude covered her face with her hands and rocked it was your idea i come here not mine what am i going to do in faerie hill cottage for the next six months i dont even know how to drive this damn car she was one sob away from a crying jag she felt it flood her throat ring in her ears before the first tear could fall she let her head roll back squeezed her eyes tight shut and cursed herself crying jags temper tantrums sarcasm and otherwise rude behavior were merely various ways of acting out shed been raised to understand it trained to recognize it and she would not give in to it on to the next stage jude you pathetic idiot talking to yourself crying in volvos too indecisive too goddamn paralyzed to turn on the ignition and just go she huffed out another breath straightened her shoulders second choice she muttered finish what you started she turned the key and sending up a little prayer that she wouldnt kill or maim anyone including herself on the drive eased the car out of park she sang mostly to keep herself from screaming every time she came to one of the circles on the highway that the irish cheerfully called roundabouts her brain would fizzle shed forget her left from her right visualize plowing the volvo into half a dozen innocent bystanders and belt out whatever tune jumped into her terrified brain on the route south from dublin to county waterford she shouted show tunes roared out irish pub songs and at a narrow escape outside the town of carlow screeched out the chorus of brown sugar loud enough to make mick jagger wince after that it calmed down a bit perhaps the gods of the traveler had been shocked enough by the noise to step back and stop throwing other cars in her path maybe it was the influence of the ubiquitous shrines to the blessed virgin that populated the roadside in either case the driving smoothed out and jude began almost to enjoy herself roll after roll of green hills shimmered under sunlight that glowed like the inside of seashells and spread back and back into the shadows of dark mountains the hulk of them rambled against a sky layered with smoky clouds and pearly light that belonged in paintings rather than reality paintings she thought as her mind wandered so beautifully rendered that when you looked at them long enough you felt yourself slipping right into them melting into the colors and shapes and the scene that some master had created out of his own brilliance that was what she saw when she dared take her eyes off the road brilliance and a terrible stunning beauty that ripped the heart even as it soothed it again green impossibly green the fields were broken by rambling walls of rough hedges or lines of stunted trees spotted cows or shaggy sheep grazed lazily in them figures on tractors putted over them here and there they were dotted with houses of white and cream where clothes flapped on lines and flowers burst with wild and careless color in the dooryards then wonderfully inexplicably there would be the ancient walls of a ruined abbey standing proud and broken against the dazzling field and sky as if waiting for its time to come round again what would you feel she wondered if you crossed the field and walked up the smooth and slick steps left standing in those tumbling stones would you could you feel the centuries of passing feet that had trod those same steps would you as her grandmother claimed be able to hear if only you listened the music and voices the clash of battles the weeping of women the laughter of children so long dead and gone she didnt believe in such things of course but here with this light with this air it seemed almost possible from the ruined grandeur to the charmingly simple the land spread out and offered thatched roofs stone crosses castles then villages with narrow streets and signs written in gaelic once she saw an old man walking with his dog on the side of the road where the grass grew tall and a little sign warned of loose chippings both man and hound wore little brown hats that she found absolutely charming she kept that picture in her mind a long time envying them their freedom and the simplicity of their routine they would walk every day she imagined rain or shine then go home to tea in some pretty little cottage with a thatched roof and a welltended garden the dog would have a little house of his own but would most usually be found curled at his masters feet by the fire she wanted to walk those fields with a devoted dog too just to walk and walk until she felt like sitting then to sit and sit until she felt like standing it was a concept that dazzled her doing what she wanted when she wanted at her own pace and in her own way it was so foreign to her that simple everyday freedom her great fear was to finally find it nip the silvered edge of it with her fingertips then bungle it as the road wound and ribboned around the coast of waterford she caught glimpses and stretches of the sea blue silk against the horizon turbulent green and gray as it spewed against a wide sandy curve of beach the tension in her shoulders began to slide away her hands relaxed a bit on the wheel this was the ireland her grandmother had spoken of the color and drama and peace of it and this jude supposed is why shed finally come to see where her roots had dug before being ripped free and replanted across the atlantic she was glad now she hadnt balked at the gate and run back to chicago hadnt she managed the best part of the threeandahalfhour drive without a single mishap she wasnt counting the little glitch at that roundabout in waterford city where shed ended up circling three times then nearly bashing into a car full of equally terrified tourists everyone had escaped without harm after all now she was nearly there the signs for the village of ardmore said so she knew from the careful map her grandmother had drawn that ardmore was the closest village to the cottage thats where she would go for supplies and whatever naturally her grandmother had also given her an impressive list of names people she was supposed to look up distant relatives she was to introduce herself to that jude decided could wait imagine she thought not having to talk to anyone for several days in a row not being asked questions and being expected to know the answers no making small talk at faculty functions no schedule that must be adhered to after one moment of blissful pleasure about the idea her heart fluttered in panic what in gods name was she going to do for six months it didnt have to be six months she reminded herself as her body tensed up again it wasnt a law she wouldnt be arrested in customs if she went back after six weeks or six days or six hours for that matter and as a psychologist she should know her biggest problem lay in struggling to live up to expectations including her own though she accepted that she was much better with theories than action she was going to change that right now and for as long as she stayed in ireland calm again she switched on the radio the stream of gaelic that poured out had her goggling poking at the buttons to find something in english and taking the turn into ardmore instead of the road up tower hill to her cottage then as soon as she realized her mistake the heavy skies burst open as if a giant hand had plunged a knife into their heart rain pounded the roof gushed over her windshield while she tried to find the control for the wipers she pulled over to the curb and waited while the wipers gaily swished at the rain the village sat on the southern knob of the county kissing the celtic sea and ardmore bay she could hear the thrash of water against the shore as the storm raged around her passionate and powerful wind shook the windows whined threateningly in the little pockets where it snuck through shed imagined herself strolling through the village familiarizing herself with it its pretty cottages its smoky crowded pubs walking the beach her grandmother had spoken of and the dramatic cliffs the green fields but it had been a lovely sunwashed afternoon with villagers pushing rosycheeked babies in carriages and flirtyeyed men tipping their caps to her she hadnt imagined a sudden and violent spring storm bringing wild gusts of wind and deserted streets maybe no one even lives here she thought maybe it was a kind of brigadoon and shed fumbled in during the wrong century another problem she told herself was an imagination that had to be reeled in with distressing regularity of course people lived here they were just wise enough to get the hell out of the rain the cottages were pretty lined up like ladies with flowers at their feet flowers she noted that were getting a good hard hammering just now there was no reason she couldnt wait for that lovely sunwashed afternoon to come back down to the village now she was tired had a bit of a tension headache and just wanted to get inside somewhere warm and cozy she eased away from the curb and crept along in the rain petrified that she would miss the turn yet again she didnt realize she was driving on the wrong side of the road until she narrowly missed a headon collision or to be perfectly accurate when the oncoming car missed her by swerving around her and blasting the horn but she found the right turn which she reminded herself should have been impossible to miss given the stone spear of the great round tower that topped the hill through the rain it lanced up guarding the ancient and roofless cathedral of saint declan and all the graves marked with stones that tipped and tilted for a moment she thought she saw a man there wearing silver that glinted dully wetly in the rain and straining to see she nearly ran off what there was of a road nerves didnt make her sing this time her heart was pounding too violently to allow it her hands shook as she inched along trying to see where he was what he was doing but there was nothing but the great tower the ruins and the dead of course there hadnt been anyone there at all she told herself no one would stand in a graveyard in the middle of a storm her eyes were tired playing tricks she just needed to get somewhere warm and dry and catch her breath when the road narrowed to little more than a muddy track bordered on both sides by manhigh hedgerows she considered herself well lost and hopeless the car jerked and bumped over ruts while she struggled to find some place to turn around and head back there was shelter in the village and surely someone would take pity on a brainless american who couldnt find her way there was a pretty little stone wall covered with some sort of bramble that would have been picturesque at any other time then a skinny break that turned out to be someones excuse for a driveway but she was too far past it when she realized what it was and was terrified to attempt backing up and maneuvering in the mud the road climbed and the ruts became second cousin to ditches her nerves were fraying her teeth clicking audibly as she negotiated another bump and she seriously considered just stopping where she was and waiting for someone to come along and tow her all the way back to dublin she groaned aloud with relief when she saw another break she turned in with a coat of paint to spare then simply laid her forehead against the wheel she was lost hungry tired and had to pee rather desperately now she was going to have to get out of the car in the pouring rain and knock on a strangers door if she was told the cottage was more than three minutes away shed have to beg for the use of a bathroom well the irish were known for their hospitality so she doubted that whoever answered the door would turn her away to relieve herself in the hedgerows still she didnt want to appear wildeyed and frantic she tipped down the rearview mirror and saw that her eyes usually a calm and quiet green were indeed a bit wild the humidity had frizzed her hair so that it looked as though she had some wild barkcolored bush on her head her skin was dead pale a combination of anxiety and fatigue and she didnt have the energy to dig out her makeup and try to repair the worst of it she tried a friendly smile that did manage to convince the dimples to flutter in her cheeks her mouth was a little too wide she thought just as her eyes were a little too big and the attempt was much closer to a grimace than a grin but it was the best she could do she grabbed her purse and shoved open the car door to meet the rain as she did she caught a movement in the secondstory window just a flutter of curtain that had her glancing up the woman wore white and had pale pale hair that tumbled in lush waves over her shoulders and breasts through the gray curtain of rain their eyes met briefly no more than an instant and jude had the impression of great beauty and great sadness then the woman was gone and there was only the rain jude shivered the windy wet cut clean to the bone and she sacrificed her dignity by loping to the pretty white gate that opened into a tiny yard made glorious by the rivers of flowers flowing on either side of a narrow white walk there was no porch only a stoop but the second story of the cottage pitched over it and provided much welcome cover she lifted a brass knocker in the shape of a celtic knot and rapped it against a rough wooden door that looked thick as a brick and was charmingly arched while she shivered and tried not to think of her bladder she scanned what she could from under her shelter it was like a dolls house she thought all soft white with forestgreen trim the manypaned windows flanked by shutters that looked functional as well as decorative the roof was thatched a charming wonder to her a wind chime made up of three columns of bells sang musically she knocked again more sharply now damn it i know youre in there and tossing manners aside she stepped out in the rain and tried to peer through the front window then she leaped back guiltily when she heard the friendly beepbeep of a horn a rusty red pickup with an engine that purred like a contented cat pulled in behind her car jude dragged dripping hair out of her face and prepared to explain herself when the driver popped out at first she took it to be a trim and tiny man with scarred muddy boots a filthy jacket and worn work pants but the face that beamed at her from under a dungbrown cap was definitely female and very nearly gorgeous her eyes were as green as the wet hills surrounding them her skin luminous jude saw tendrils of rich red hair tumbling out of the cap as the woman hurried forward managing to be graceful despite the boots youd be miss murray then thats fine timing isnt it it is well im running a bit behind today as mrs duffys grandson tommy stuffed half his building blocks down the loo again then flushed away it was a hell of a mess altogether hmmm was all jude could think to say as she wondered why she was standing in the rain talking to a stranger about blocked toilets cant you find your key my key to the front door well ive mine so well get you in and out of the wet that sounded like a wonderful idea thank you jude began as she followed the woman back to the door but who are you oh i beg your pardon im brenna otoole brenna shot out a hand gripped judes and shook briskly your granny told you didnt she that id have the cottage ready for you my gran the cottage jude huddled under the overhang my cottage this is my cottage it is yes if youre jude murray from chicago brenna smiled kindly though her left brow had arched youll be more than a bit tired by now ill wager after your trip yes jude rubbed her hands over her face as brenna unlocked the door and i thought i was lost appears youre found ceade mile failte she said and stepped back so jude could enter first a thousand welcomes jude thought she knew that much gaelic and it felt like a thousand when she stepped into the warmth the foyer hardly wider than the outside stoop was flanked on one side by stairs polished by time and traffic an arched doorway to the right led to the little living area pretty as a picture with its walls the color of fresh biscuits honeytoned trim and lace curtains warmly yellowed with age so that everything in the room looked washed by the sun the furniture was worn and faded but cheerful with its blue and white stripes and deep cushions the gleaning tables were crowded with treasures bits of crystal carved figures miniature bottles rugs were scattered colorfully over the wideplanked floor and the stone fireplace was already laid with what jude thought must be hunks of peat it smelled earthy and of something else faint and floral its charming isnt it jude pushed at her hair again as she turned a circle like a playhouse old maude she liked pretty things something in the tone had jude stopping her circle to look back at brennas face im sorry i didnt know her you were fond of her sure everyone loved old maude she was a grand lady shell be pleased youre here looking after the place she wouldnt want it standing alone and empty should i show you about then so you have your bearings id appreciate it but first im desperate for the bathroom brenna let out a quick laugh a long ride from dublin theres a little powder room right off the kitchen my dad and i put it in for her out of a closet only three years back straight that way it is jude didnt waste any time exploring little was exactly the word for the half bath she could have rapped her elbows on the side walls by crooking her arms and lifting them but the walls were done in a pale pretty rose the white porcelain gleamed from fresh scrubbing and there were sweetly embroidered fingertip towels hung neatly on the rack one glance in the oval mirror over the sink told jude that yes she looked every bit as bad as shed feared and though she was of average height and build beside the fairylike brenna she felt like a galumphing amazon annoyed with herself for the comparison she blew her frizzed bangs off her brow and went back out oh i would have gotten those already the efficient brenna had unloaded her luggage and hauled it into the foyer youve got to be ready to drop after your travels ill get your things upstairs i imagine youll want old maudes room its pleasant then well put the kettle on so you can have some tea and ill start your fire its a damp day as she spoke she carried judes two enormous suitcases up the stairs as if they were empty wishing shed spent more time in the gym jude followed with her tote her laptop and her portable printer brenna showed her two bedrooms and she was right old maudes with its view of the front gardens was the more pleasant but jude got only a hazy impression for one look at the bed and she succumbed to the jet lag that dropped into her body like a lead weight she only half listened to the cheerful lilting voice explain about linens heat the vagaries of the tiny fireplace in the bedroom as brenna set the peat to light then she followed as if walking through water as brenna clattered downstairs to put on tea and show her how the kitchen operated she heard something about the pantry being freshly stocked and how she should do her marketing at duffys in the village when she needed supplies there was more stacks of peat outside the back door as old maude had preferred it but wood as well in case she herself preferred that and how the telephone had been hooked back up again and how to light the fire in the kitchen stove ah there now youre asleep on your feet sympathetic brenna pressed a thick blue mug into judes hands take that on up with you and have a liedown ill start the fire down here for you im sorry i cant seem to focus youll do better after some sleep my numbers here by the phone if youre needing anything my familys barely a kilometer from here my mother and dad and four sisters so if theres anything you need youve only to call or come by the otooles yes i four sisters brenna laughed again as she led jude back down the hall well my dad kept hoping for a boy but thats the way of it surrounded by females he is even the dog up you go now thank you so much really im not usually so vague well its not every day you fly over the ocean now is it do you want anything before i go no i she leaned on the banister blinked oh i forgot there was a woman in the house where did she go a woman you say where in the window she swayed nearly spilled the tea then shook her head clear there was a woman in the window upstairs looking out when i got here was there now yes a blond woman young very lovely ah that would be lady gwen brenna turned slipped into the living room and lit the stack of peat she doesnt show herself to just everyone where did she go oh shes still here i imagine satisfied that the peat had caught brenna rose brushed off the knees of her trousers shes been here three hundred years give or take shes your ghost miss murray my what your ghost but dont trouble yourself about her she wont be after harming you any hers is a sad tale and a story for another time when youre not so tired it was hard to concentrate judes mind wanted to shut down her body to shut off but it seemed important to clear up this one point youre trying to say the house is haunted sure and its haunted didnt your granny tell you i dont believe she mentioned it youre telling me you believe in ghosts brenna lifted her brow again well did you see her or didnt you there you are she said when jude merely frowned have yourself a nap and if youre up and about later come on down to gallaghers pub and ill buy you your first pint too baffled to concentrate jude merely shook her head i dont drink beer oh well now thats a bloody shame brenna said sounding both shocked and sincere well good day to you miss murray jude she murmured it and could do nothing but stare jude then brenna flashed her gorgeous smile and slipped out the door into the rain haunted jude thought as she started up the stairs with her head circling lazily several inches over her shoulders fanciful irish nonsense god knew her grandmother was full of fairy stories but thats all they were stories but shed seen someone hadnt she no the rain the curtains the shadows she set down the tea that shed yet to taste and managed to pull off her shoes there werent any ghosts there was just a pretty house on a charming little hill and the rain she fell facedown on the bed thought about dragging the spread over her and tumbled into sleep before she could manage it and when she dreamed she dreamed of a battle fought on a green hill where the sunlight flashed on swords like jewels of faeries dancing in the forest where the moonlight lay as tears on the leaves and of a deep blue sea that beat like a heart against the waiting shore and through all the dreams the one constant thing was the sound of a womans quiet weeping chapter two contents prev next when jude woke it was full dark and the little peat fire had burned down to tiny ruby lights she stared at them her eyes bleary with sleep her heart leaping like a wild stag in her throat as she mistook the embers for watching eyes then her memory snapped into place her mind cleared she was in ireland in the cottage where her grandmother had lived as a girl and she was freezing she sat up rubbing her chilled arms then fumbled for the bedside lamp a glance at her watch made her blink then wince it was nearly midnight her recovery nap had lasted close to twelve hours and she discovered she was not only cold she was starving as well she puzzled over the fire a moment since it seemed basically out and she didnt have a clue how to get it going again she left it alone and went down to the kitchen to hunt up food the house creaked and groaned around her a homey sound she told herself though it made her want to jump and look over her shoulder it wasnt that she was thinking about even considering the ghost brenna had spoken of she just wasnt particularly used to homey sounds the floors of her condo didnt creak and the only red glow she might come across was the security light on her alarm system but she would get used to her new surroundings brenna was as good as her word jude discovered the kitchen was well stocked with food in the dollsize fridge in the narrow little pantry she might be cold she mused but she wouldnt starve her first thought was to open a can of soup and buzz it up in the microwave so with can in hand she turned around the kitchen and made a shocking discovery there was no microwave well jude thought thats a problem nothing to do but rough it with saucepan and stove she supposed then hit the next dilemma when she realized there was no automatic can opener old maude had lived not only in another country jude decided as she pushed through drawers but another century she managed to use the manual can opener that she found and put the soup in a pan on the stove after choosing an apple from the bowl on the kitchen table she walked to the back door and opened it to a swirling mist soft as silk and wet as rain she could see nothing but the air itself the pale gray layers of it shifting over the night there was no form no light only the wisps and shapes the mist chose to make of itself shivering she took one step out and was instantly cloaked in it the sense of solitude was immediate and complete deeper than any shed ever known but it wasnt frightening or sad she realized as she held an arm out and watched the mist swallow her hand to the wrist it was oddly liberating she knew no one no one knew her nothing was expected of her except what she asked of herself for tonight one wonderful night she was absolutely alone she heard a kind of pulse in the night a low drumming beat was it the sea she wondered or was it just the mist breathing even as she started to laugh at herself she heard another sound quiet and bright a tinkling music pipes and bells flutes and whistles enchanted by it she nearly left the back stoop nearly followed the magic of the sound into the fog like a dreamer walking in sleep wind chimes she realized with another little laugh a bit nervous around the edges now it was only wind chimes like the pretty bells at the front of the house and she must still be half asleep if shed considered dancing out of the house at midnight and wandering through the fog to follow the sound of music she made herself step back inside firmly shut the door the next sound she heard was the hiss of the soup boiling over damn it she rushed to the stove and switched off the burner whats wrong with me a twelveyearold could heat up a stupid can of soup for gods sake she mopped up the mess burned the tips of two fingers then ate the soup standing up in the kitchen while she lectured herself it was time to stop bumbling around to yank herself back in line she was a responsible person a reliable woman not one who stood dreaming into the mist at midnight she spooned up the soup and ate it mechanically a duty to her body with none of the foolish pleasure a midnight snack allowed it was time to face why shed come to ireland in the first place time to stop pretending it was an extended holiday during which she would explore her roots and work on papers that would cement the publishing end of her not very stellar university career shed come because shed been mortally afraid she was on the verge of some kind of breakdown stress had become her constant companion gleefully inviting her to enjoy a migraine or flirt with an ulcer it had gotten to the point where she wasnt able to face the daily routine of her job to the point where she neglected her students her family herself more worse she admitted where she was coming to actively dislike her students her family herself whatever the cause of it and she wasnt quite ready to explore that area the only solution had been a radical change a rest falling apart wasnt an option falling apart in public was out of the question she wouldnt humiliate herself or her family whod done nothing to deserve it so she had run cowardly perhaps but in some odd way the only logical step shed been able to think of when old maude had graciously passed on at the ripe old age of a hundred and one a door had opened it had been smart to walk through that door it had been responsible to do so she needed time alone time to be quiet time to reevaluate and that was exactly what she was going to do she did intend to work she would never have been able to justify the trip and the time if she hadnt had some sort of plan she intended to experiment with a paper that combined her family roots and her profession if nothing else documenting local legends and myths and conducting a psychological analysis of their meaning and purpose would keep her mind active and give her less time for brooding shed been spending entirely too much time brooding an irish trait her mother claimed and the thought of it made jude sigh the irish were great brooders so if she felt the need to indulge from time to time shed picked the best place in the world for it feeling better jude turned to put her empty bowl in the dishwasher and discovered there wasnt one she chuckled all the way upstairs to the bedroom she unpacked meticulously putting everything away in the lovely creaky wardrobe the wonderful old dresser with drawers that stuck she set out her toiletries admired the old washbasin and indulged in a long shower standing in the clawfoot tub with the thin plastic curtain jangling around her on its tarnished brass hooks she dived into flannel pajamas and a robe before her teeth started chattering then got down to the business of lighting bricks of peat surprised at her success she lost twenty minutes sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her knees smiling into the pretty glow and imagining herself a contented farmers wife waiting for her man to come in from the fields when she snapped back from her daydream she went off to explore the second bedroom and consider its potential as an office it was a small room boxlike with narrow windows facing front and side after some deliberation jude chose to set up facing south so she could see the rooftops and church steeples of the village and the broad beach that led down to the sea at least she assumed that would be the view once daylight broke and the fog lifted the next problem was what to set up on as the little room had no desk she spent the next hour hunting up a suitable table then hauling that from the living room up the stairs and placing it exactly in the center of the window before she hooked up her equipment it did occur to her that she could write on the kitchen table by the cozy little fire with the wind chimes singing to her but that seemed too casual and disorganized she found the right adaptor for the plug booted up then opened the file that she intended to be a daily journal of her life in ireland april faerie hill cottage ireland i survived the trip she paused a moment laughed a little it sounded as though shed been through a war she started to delete it start again then she stopped herself no the journal was only for herself and she would write what came into her mind as it came the drive from dublin was long and more difficult than id imagined i wonder how long it will take me to grow used to driving on the left i doubt i ever will still the scenery was wonderful none of the pictures ive seen begin to do the irish countryside justice to say its green isnt enough verdant somehow isnt right either it well shimmers is the best i can do the villages seem charming and so unbelievably tidy that i imagined armies of elves slipping in every night to scrub the sidewalks and polish the buildings i saw a bit of the village of ardmore but it was pouring rain by the time i arrived and i was too tired to form any real impressions other than that habitual tidiness and the charm of the wide beach i came across the cottage by sheer accident granny would call it fate of course but it was really just blind luck its so pretty sitting here on its little hill with flowers flooding right up to the front door i hope i can care for them properly perhaps they have a bookstore in the village where ill find books on gardening in any case theyre certainly thriving now despite the damp chill in the air i saw a woman thought i saw a woman at the bedroom window looking out at me it was an odd moment it seemed that our eyes actually met held for a few seconds she was beautiful pale and blond and tragic of course it was just a shadow a trick of the light because there was no one here at all brenna otoole a terrifyingly efficient woman from the village pulled up right after me and took things over in a way that was somehow brisk and friendly and deeply appreciated shes gorgeous i wonder if everyone here is gorgeous and has that rough mannish demeanor some women can adopt so seamlessly and still be perfectly female i imagine she thinks im foolish and inept but she was kind about it she said something about the house being haunted which i imagine the villagers say about every house in the country but since ive decided to explore the possibility of doing a paper on irish legends i may research the basis for her statement naturally my time clock and my system are turned upside down i slept the best part of the day away and had a meal at midnight its dark and foggy out the mist is luminous and somehow poignant i feel cozy of body and quiet in my mind its going to be all right she sat back let out a long sigh yes she thought it was going to be all right at three am when spirits often stir jude huddled in bed under a thick quilt with a pot of tea on the table and a book in her hand the fire simmered in the grate the mist slid across the windows she wondered if shed ever been happier and fell asleep with the light burning and her reading glasses slipping down her nose in the daylight with the rain and mist whisked away by the breeze her world was a different place the light glowed soft and turned the fields to an aching green she could hear birds which reminded her that she needed to dig out the book shed bought on identifying species still at the moment it was so nice just to stand and listen to that liquid warbling it didnt seem to matter what bird was singing so long as it sang walking across the thick springy grass seemed almost like a sacrilege but it was a sin jude couldnt resist on the hill beside the village she saw the ruin of the once grand cathedral dedicated to saint declan and the glorious round tower that ruled over it she thought briefly of the figure shed thought shed seen there in the rain and shivered foolish it was just a place after all an interesting and historical site her grandmother and her guidebook had told her about the ogham inscriptions inside and the romanesque arcading she would go there and see for herself and to the east if memory served beyond the cliff hotel was the ancient saint declans well with its three stone crosses and stone chair she would visit the ruins and the well climb the cliff path and perhaps walk around the headland one day soon her guidebook had assured her the views were spectacular but today she wanted quieter simpler things the waters of the bay shimmered blue as they flowed into the deeper tones of the sea the flat wide beach was deserted another morning she thought she would drive to the village just to walk alone on the beach today was for rambling over the fields just as shed imagined away from the village with her eyes on the mountains she forgot shed only meant to check on the flowers to orient herself to the area just around the cottage before she attended to practical matters she needed to arrange for a phone jack in the spare bedroom so she could access the net for research she needed to call chicago and let her family know she was safe and well certainly she needed to go into the village and find out where she could shop and bank but it was so glorious out with the air gentle as a kiss the breeze just cool enough to clear the last of the travel fatigue from her mind that she kept walking kept looking until her shoes were wet from the rainsoaked grass like slipping into a painting she thought again one animated with the flutter of leaves the sounds of birds the smell of wet growing things when she saw another house it was almost a shock it was nestled just off the road behind the hedgerows and rambled front back and sideways as if different pieces of it had been plopped down carelessly on a whim and somehow it worked she decided it was a charming combination of stone and wood juts and overhangs with flowers rioting in both the front yard and the back beyond the gardens in the rear was a shed what her grandmother would have called a cabin with tools and machines tumbling out the door in the driveway she saw a car covered with stonegray paint and looking as though it had come off the assembly line years before jude had been born a big yellow dog slept in a patch of sunlight in the side yard or she assumed it slept it was on its back with its feet in the air like roadkill the otooles house jude wondered then decided it must be so when a woman came out the back door with a basket of laundry she had brilliant red hair and the widehipped sturdy frame that jude would imagine in a woman required to carry and birth five children the dog proving she was alive rolled over to her side and thumped her tail twice as the woman marched to the clothesline it occurred to jude that shed never actually seen anyone hang clothes before it wasnt something even the most dedicated of housewives tended to do in downtown chicago it seemed like a mindless and thereby soulsoothing process to her the woman took pegs from the pocket of her apron clamped them in her mouth as she bent to take a pillowcase from the basket snapped it briskly then clamped it to the line the next item was dealt with in the same way and shared the second peg fascinating she worked down the line without any obvious hurry with the yellow dog for company emptying her basket while what she hung billowed and flapped wetly in the breeze just another part of the painting jude decided she would title this section country wife when the basket was empty the woman turned to the facing line and unhooked clothes already hanging and dry folding them until her basket was piled high she cocked the basket on her hip and walked back into the house the dog prancing behind her what a nice way to spend the morning she thought and that evening when everyone came home the house would smell of something wonderful simmering in the kitchen some sort of stew jude imagined or a roast with potatoes browned from its juices the family would all sit around the table one crowded with bowls and plates wonderfully mismatched and talk about their day and laugh and sneak scraps to the dog who begged from under the table large families she thought must be a great comfort of course there was nothing wrong with small ones she added immediately feeling guilty being an only child had its advantages shed gotten all her parents attention maybe too much of their attention a little voice murmured in her ear considering that voice very rude she blocked it out and turned to return to her cottage and do something practical with her time because she felt disloyal she immediately phoned home with the time difference she caught her parents before they left for work and squashed her guilt by chatting happily telling them she was rested enjoying herself and looking forward to this new experience she was well aware that they both considered her impulsive trip to ireland a kind of experiment a quick fortyfivedegree turn from the path shed been so content to pursue for so long they werent against it which relieved her they were just puzzled she had no way to explain it to them or to herself with family on her mind she placed another call there was no need to explain anything to granny murray she simply knew lighter of heart jude filled her grandmother in on every detail of the trip her impressions her delight with the cottage while she brewed a pot of tea and made a sandwich i just had a walk she continued and with the phone braced on her shoulder set her simple lunch on the table i saw the ruins and the tower from a distance ill have a closer look later its a fine spot granny told her theres a lot to feel there well im very interested in seeing the carvings and the arcading but i didnt want to wander that far today i saw the neighbors house it must be the otooles ah michael otoole i remember him when he was just a lad a quick grin mick had arid a way of talking you out of tea and cakes he married that pretty logan girl mollie and they had five girls the one you met brenna shed be the oldest of the brood hows she faring pretty mollie well i didnt go over she was busy with laundry youll find no ones too busy to take a moment jude frances next time youre roaming you stop in and pay your respects to mollie otoole i will oh and gran amused she smiled as she sipped her tea you didnt tell me the cottage was haunted sure and i did girl havent you listened to the tapes or read the letters and such i gave you no not yet and youre thinking there goes granny again with her makebelieve you just go through the things i sent along with you the storys there about lady gwen and her faerie lover faerie lover so it was said the cottage is built on a faerie hill with its raft or palace beneath and she waits for him still pining because she turned off happiness for sense and he losing it for pride thats sad jude murmured well it is still its a good spot the hill for looking inside yourself to your hearts desire you look inside yours while youre there right now im just looking for some quiet take as much of it as you need theres plenty to go around but dont stand back too long and watch the rest of the world lifes so much shorter than you think why dont you come out gran stay here with me oh ill come back but this is your time now pay attention to it youre a good girl jude but you dont have to be good all the time so youre always telling me maybe ill find some handsome irish rogue and have a reckless love affair it wouldnt hurt you any put flowers on cousin maudes grave for me will you darling and tell her ill come see her when im able i will i love you gran jude didnt know where the time went shed meant to do something productive had really intended to go out to play with the flowers for a few minutes to pick just a handful to put in the tall blue bottle shed found in the living room of course shed picked too many and needed another bottle there didnt seem to be an actual vase in the house then it had been such fun sitting on the stoop arranging them and wishing she knew their names that shed whiled away most of the afternoon it had been a mistake to carry the smaller squat green bottle up to her office to put on the table with her computer but shed only meant to lie down for a minute or two shed slept for two solid hours on top of the little bed in her office and woke up groggy and appalled shed lost her discipline she was lazy shed done nothing but sleep or piddle for more than thirty hours now and she was hungry again at this rate she decided as she foraged for something quick in the kitchen shed be fat slow and stupid in a week she would go out drive down to the village shed find a bookstore the bank the post office shed find out where the cemetery was so that she could visit old maudes grave for her grandmother which is what she should have done that morning but this way it would be done and she could spend the next day going through the tapes and letters her grandmother had given her to see if there was a paper in them she changed first choosing trim slacks a turtleneck and a blazer that made her feel much more alert and professional than the thick sweater and jeans shed worn all day she attacked her hair attack was the only term she could use to describe what she had to do to tame it into a thick bound tail when all it wanted to do was frizz up and spring out everywhere at once she was cautious with makeup shed never been handy with it but the results seemed sufficient for a casual tour of the village a glance in the mirror told her she didnt look like a dayold corpse or a hooker both of which could and had happened on occasion taking a deep breath she headed out to attempt another session with the leased car and the irish roads she was behind the wheel reaching for the ignition when she realized shed forgotten the keys ginkgo she muttered as she climbed back out youre going to start taking ginkgo after a frustrated search she found the keys on the kitchen table this time she remembered to turn a light on as it might be dark before she returned and to lock the front door when she couldnt remember if shed locked the back one she cursed herself and strode around the cottage to deal with it the sun was drifting down in the west and through its light a thin drizzle was falling when she finally put the car in reverse and backed slowly out into the road it was a shorter drive than she remembered and a much more scenic one without rain lashing at the windshield the hedgerows were budded with wild fuchsia in drops red as blood there were brambles with tiny white flowers that she would learn were blackthorn and freesia hazed and yellow with spring as the road turned she saw the tumbled walls of the cathedral on the hill and the spear of the tower lording over the seaside village no one walked there eight hundred years they had stood that jude thought was a wonder of its own wars feast and famine through blood and death and birth the power remained to worship and to defend she wondered if her grandmother was right and if so what one would feel standing in their shadow on soil that had felt the weight of the pious and the profane what an odd thought she decided and shook it off as she drove into the village that would be hers for the next six months chapter three contents prev next inside gallaghers pub the light was dim and the fire lively thats how the customers preferred it on a damp evening in early spring gallaghers had been serving and pleasing its customers for more than a hundred and fifty years in that same spot by providing good lager or stout a reasonable glass of whiskey that wasnt watered and a comfortable place to enjoy that pint or glass now when shamus gallagher opened his public house in the year of our lord with his good wife meg beside him the whiskey might have come cheaper but a man has to earn his pence and his pound however hospitable he may be so the price of the whiskey came dearer than once it had but it was served with no less a hope of being enjoyed when shamus opened the pub hed sunk his lifes hopes and his lifes savings into it there had been more thin times than thick and once a gale wind had whipped over the sea and lifted the roof clean off and carried it to dungarvan or so some liked to say when theyd enjoyed more than a glass or two of the irish still the pub had stood with its roots dug into the sand and rock of ardmore and shamuss first son had moved into his fathers place behind the old chestnut bar then his son after him and so forth generations of gallaghers had served generations of others and had prospered well enough to add to the business so more could come in out of the damp night after a hard days work and enjoy a pint or two there was food as well as drink appealing to body as well as soul and most nights there was music too to appease the heart ardmore was a fishing village and so depended on the bounty of the sea and lived with its capriciousness as it was picturesque and boasted some fine beaches it depended on the tourists as well and lived with their capriciousness gallaghers was one of its focal points in good times and bad when the fish ran fast and thick or when the storms boiled in and battered the bay so none dared venture out to cast nets its doors were open smoke and fumes of whiskey steam from stews and the sweat of men had seeped deep into the dark wood so the place forever carried the smell of living benches and chairs were covered in deep red with blackened brass studs to hold the fabric in place the ceilings were open the rafters exposed and many was the saturday night when the music was loud enough that those rafters shook the floor was scarred from the boots of men the scrape of chair and stool and the occasional careless spark from fire or cigarette but it was clean and four times a year needed or not it was polished glossy as a company parlor the bar itself was the pride of the establishment a rich dark chestnut bar that old shamus himself had made from a tree folks liked to say had been lightningstruck on midsummers eve in that way it carried a bit of magic and those who sat there felt the better for it behind the bar the long mirrored wall was lined with bottles for your pleasure and all were clean and shiny as new pennies the gallaghers ran a lively pub but a tidy one as well spills were mopped dust was chased and never was a drink served in a dirty glass the fire was of peat because it charmed the tourists and the tourists often made the difference between getting by and getting on they came thick in the summer and early fall to enjoy the beaches sparser in winter and at the dawn of spring but they came nonetheless and most would stop in at gallaghers to lift a glass hear a tune or sample one of the pubs spiced meat pies regulars trickled in soon after the evening meal as much for conversation or gossip as for a pint of guinness some would come for dinner as well but usually on a special occasion if it was a family or if it was a single man because he was tired of his own cooking or wanted a bit of a flirt with darcy gallagher who was usually willing to oblige she could work the bar or the tables and the kitchen as well but the kitchen was where she least liked to be so she left that to her brother shawn when she could get away with it those who knew gallaghers knew it was aidan the eldest who ran the show now that their parents seemed bent on staying in boston most agreed he seemed to have settled down from his wanderlust past and now tended the family pub in a manner that would have made shamus proud for himself aidan was content in where he was and what he did hed learned a great deal of himself and of life during his rambles the itchy feet were said to come from the fitzgerald side as his mother had before she married traveled a good bit of the world with her voice paying the fare hed strapped on a knapsack when he was barely eighteen and traveled throughout his country then over into england and france and italy and even spain hed spent a year in america being dazzled by the mountains and plains of the west sweltering in the heat of the south and freezing through a northern winter he and his siblings were as musical as their mother so hed sung for his supper or tended bar whichever suited his purposes at the time when hed seen all he longed to see he came home again a welltraveled man of twentyfive for the last six years hed tended the pub and lived in the rooms above it but he was waiting he didnt know for what only that he was even now as he built a pint of guinness drew a glass of harp and tuned in with one ear to the conversation in case he was obliged to comment part of him sat back patient and watchful those who looked close enough might see that watchfulness in his eyes eyes blue as a lightning bolt under brows with the same dark richness as the prize bar where he worked he had the rawboned face of the celts with the wild good looks that the fine genes of his parents had blended with a long straight nose a mouth full and shamelessly sensual a tough takeapunch chin with just a hint of a cleft he was built like a brawler wide of shoulder long of arm and narrow of hip and indeed he had spent a good portion of his youth planting his fists in faces or taking them in his own as much he wasnt shamed to admit for the fun of it as for temper it was a matter of pride that unlike his brother shawn aidan had never had his nose broken in battle still hed stopped looking for trouble as hed grown from boy to man he was just looking and trusted that hed know what it was when he found it when jude walked in he noticed first as a publican and second as a man she looked so tidy with her trim jacket and boundback hair so lost with her big eyes scanning the room as a doe might consider a new path in the forest a pretty thing he thought as most men do when they see an attractive female face and form and being one who saw many faces in his career he noted the nerves as well that kept her rooted to the spot just inside the door as if she might turn and flee at any moment the look of her the manner of her captured his interest and a low and pleasant hum warmed his blood she squared her shoulders a deliberate move that amused him and walked to the bar good evening to you he said as he slid his rag down the bar to wipe up spills whats your pleasure she started to speak to ask politely for a glass of white wine then her smiled a slow lazy curving of lips that inexplicably set her insides a fluttering and turned her mind into a buzzing mess of static yes she thought dimly everyone was gorgeous here he seemed in no particular hurry for her answer only leaned comfortably on the bar bringing that truly wonderful face closer to hers cocking his head and his brow at the same time are you lost then darling she imagined herself melting just sliding onto the floor in a puddle of hormones and liquid lust the sheer embarrassment of the image snapped her back to herself no im not lost could i have a glass of white wine chardonnay if its available i can help you with that but he made no move to just then youre a yank then would you be old maudes young american cousin come to stay in her cottage awhile yes im jude jude murray automatically she offered her hand and a careful smile that allowed her dimples a brief appearance in her cheeks aidan had always had a soft spot for dimples in a pretty face he took her hand but didnt shake it he only held it as he continued to stare at her until she swore she felt it her bones began to sizzle welcome to ardmore miss murray and to gallaghers im aidan and this is my place tim give the lady your seat where are your manners oh no thats but tim a burly man with a mass of hair the color and texture of steel wool slid off his stool beg your pardon he shifted his gaze from the sports event on the television over the end of the bar and gave her a quick charming wink unless youd rather a table aidan added as she continued to stand and look mildly distressed no no this is fine thank you she climbed onto the stool trying not to tense up as she became the center of attention it was what troubled her most about teaching all those faces turned to hers expecting her to be profound and brilliant he finally released her hand just as she expected it to dissolve in his and took the pint glass from under the tap to slide it into welcoming hands and how are you finding ireland he asked her as he turned to take a bottle of wine from the mirrored shelf its lovely well theres no one here will disagree with you on that he poured her wine looking at her rather than the glass and hows your granny oh jude was amazed that hed filled the glass perfectly without so much as a glance at it then set it precisely in front of her shes very well do you know her i do yes my mother was a fitzgerald and a cousin to your granny third or fourth removed im thinking so that makes us cousins as well he tapped a finger on her glass slainte cousin jude oh well thank you she lifted her glass just as the shouting started from the back a womans voice clear as church bells accused someone of being a bloody blundering knothead with no more brains than a turnip this was answered in irritated male tones that hed rather be a bleeding turnip than dumb as the dirt it grew in no one seemed particularly shocked by the shouts and curses that followed nor by the sudden crash that had jude jolting and spilling a few drops of wine on the back of her hand that would be two more of your cousins aidan explained as he took judes hand yet again and efficiently dried it my sister darcy and my brother shawn oh well shouldnt someone see whats the matter the matter with what she only goggled as the voices in the back rose you throw that plate at my head you viper and i swear to you ill the threat ended on a vicious curse as something crashed against the wall seconds later a woman swung out of the door behind the bar carrying a tray of food and looking flushed and satisfied did you nail him darcy someone wanted to know no he ducked she tossed her head sending a cloud of ravenblack hair flying temper suited her her kerry blue eyes snapped with it her generous mouth pouted she carried the tray with a sassy twitch of hip to a family of five crowded at a low table and when she served bending down to catch whatever the woman at the table murmured to her she threw back her head and laughed the laughter suited her just as well as the temper jude noted ill be taking the price of the plate out of your pay aidan informed her when she strolled over to the bar thats fine then worth every penny more if id hit the mark the clooneys are needing two more cokes a ginger ale and two harps a pint and a glass aidan began to fill the order darcy this is jude murray from america come to stay in old maudes cottage pleased to meet you the temper was quickly replaced by a lively interest in darcys eyes the pout gave way to a quick and dazzling smile are you settling in well yes thank you its chicago isnt it where youre from do you love it there its a beautiful city and loaded with fine shops and restaurants and the like what do you do in chicago for your living i teach psychology taught jude thought but that was too hard to explain especially since attention had once again focused on her do you now well and thats very handy darcys beautiful eyes gleamed with humor and just a touch of malice perhaps you could examine my brother shawns head when youve time theres been something wrong with it since birth she picked up the tray of drinks aidan nudged toward her then grinned at him and it was two plates i missed both times but i nearly caught him at the ear the second round she sauntered off to serve drinks and take orders from the tables aidan exchanged glasses for pounds set another two under the taps for building then lifted a brow at jude is the wine not to your taste what she glanced down noting that shed barely sipped at it no its nice she drank to be polite then smiled so her dimples fluttered shyly to life again lovely actually i was distracted you neednt worry about darcy and shawn shawns fast on his feet true enough but our sisters an arm like a bullet if shed meant to hit him she likely would have jude made a noncommittal sound as someone in the front corner began to play a tune on a concertina ive cousins in chicago this came from tim who continued to stand behind her waiting patiently for his second pint the dempseys mary and jack you wouldnt happen to know them no im sorry jude shifted on her stool tipped her face up to his chicagos a big place my cousin jack and i were boys together and he went over to america to work with his uncle on his mothers side in a meatpacking plant been there ten years now and complains bitter about the wind and the winters but makes no move to come back home he took the pint from aidan with a thanks and slid the coins for it over the bar aidan youve been to chicago havent you passed through mostly the lakes a sight and seems big as the sea the wind coming off its like knives through the skin and into the bone but you can get a steak there if memory serves that will make you weep with gratitude that god created the cow he was working as he spoke filling another order for his sisters tray keeping the taps going opening a bottle of american beer for a boy who looked as if he should still be sucking on milk shakes the music picked up a livelier pace now when darcy lifted the tray from the bar this time she was singing in a way that made jude stare with admiration and envy not just at the voice though it was stunning enough with its silverbright clarity but at the kind of ease of self that would allow someone to simply break into song in public it was a tune about dying an old maid in a garret which jude concluded from the glances of the males in the room ranging from the clooney boy of about ten to an ancient skeleton of a man at the farthest end of the bar was a fate darcy gallagher would never face people joined in the chorus and the taps began to flow more quickly the first tune blended into a second with barely a change of rhythm aidan picked up the lyrics singing of the betrayal of the woman wearing the black velvet band so smoothly that jude could only stare he had a voice as rich as his sisters and as carelessly beautiful he pulled a pint of lager as he sang then winked at her as he slid it down the bar she felt heat rush into her face the mortification of being caught openly staring but she trusted the light was dim enough to mask it she picked up her glass hoping she looked casual as if she often sat in bars where song broke out all around her and men who looked like works of art winked in her direction and discovered her glass was full she frowned at it certain that shed sipped away at least half the wine but as aidan was halfway down the bar and she didnt want to interrupt his work or the song she shrugged and enjoyed the full glass the door of what she assumed was the kitchen swung open again she could only be grateful that no one was paying attention to her because she was sure she goggled the man who came through it looked as though hed stepped out of a movie set some film about ancient celtic knights saving kingdoms and damsels he had a loose and lanky build that went well with the worn jeans and dark sweater his hair was black as night and wove its way over the collar of the sweater eyes a dreamy lake blue sparkled with humor his mouth was like aidans full and strong and sensual and his nose was just crooked enough to spare him from the burden of perfection she noted the nick on his right ear and assumed this was shawn gallagher and that he hadnt ducked quite quickly enough he moved gracefully across the room to serve the food he carried on the tray then in a lightning move that made jude catch her breath and prepare for the battle he grabbed his sister yanked her to face him then spun her into a complicated dance what kind of people jude wondered could swear at each other one minute then dance around a pub together laughing the next the patrons whistled and clapped feet pounded the dance whirled close enough to jude for her to feel the breeze of spinning bodies then when it stopped darcy and shawn cozily embraced and grinned at each other like fools after hed kissed his sister smartly on the mouth he turned his head and studied jude in the friendliest of manners well who might this be come out of the night and into gallaghers this is jude murray cousin to old maude darcy told him this is my brother shawn the one in dire need of your professional help ah brenna told me shed met you when you arrived jude f murray from chicago whats the f for aidan wanted to know jude swiveled her head to look at him found it was just a little light frances she saw lady gwen shawn announced and before jude could swivel her head back again the pub had gone quiet did she now aidan wiped his hands on his cloth set it aside then leaned on the bar well then there was a pause an expectant one fumbling jude tried to fill it no i just thought id seen it was raining she picked up her glass drank deeply and prayed the music would start again aidans seen lady gwen walking the cliffs jude stared at shawn then back at aidan youve seen a ghost she said in carefully spaced words she weeps as she walks and as she waits and the sound of it stabs into your heart so it bleeds from the inside out part of her simply wanted to ride on the music of his voice but she blinked shook her head but you dont actually believe in ghosts he lifted that handsome eyebrow again why wouldnt i because they dont exist he laughed a rich and rolling sound then solved the mystery of her never empty glass by topping off the wine ill be wanting to hear you say that after living here another month didnt your granny tell you the story of lady gwen and carrick of the faeries no well actually i have a number of tapes she made for me and letters and journals that deal with legends and myths im ah considering doing a paper on the subject of irish folklore and its place in the psychology of the culture isnt that something he didnt trouble to hide his amusement even when he saw the frown cloud over her face to his mind she had as pretty a pout as hed ever seen youve come to a good place for material for such a fine project you should tell her about lady gwen darcy put in and other stories aidan you tell them best i will then another time if youre interested jude frances she was miffed and she realized with some distress just a little drunk mustering her dignity as best she could she nodded of course id like to include local color and stories in my research id be happy to set up appointments at your convenience his smile came again slow easy devastating oh well were not so very formal around here ill just come around one day and if youre not busy ill tell you some stories i know all right thank you she opened her purse started to get out her wallet but he laid a hand over hers theres no need to pay the wines on the house for welcome thats very kind of you she wished she had a clue as to just how much welcome shed put into her bloodstream see that you come back he said when she got to her feet im sure i will good night she scanned the room since it seemed polite to make it a blanket statement then looked back at aidan thank you good night to you jude frances he watched her leave absently getting a glass as another beer was called for a pretty thing he thought again and just prim enough he decided to make a man wonder what it would take to relax her he thought he might enjoy taking the time to find out after all he had a wealth of time she must be rich darcy commented with a little sigh aidan glanced over why do you say that you can tell by her clothes all simple and perfect the little earrings she had on the hoops those were real gold and the shoes were italian or ill marry a monkey he hadnt noticed the earrings or the shoes just the overall package that understated and neat femininity and being a man he had imagined loosening that band shed wrapped around her hair and setting it free but his sister was pouting so he turned and flicked a finger down her nose she may be rich darcy my darling but shes alone and shy as you never are money wont buy her a friend darcy pushed her hair back over her shoulder ill go by the cottage and see her youve a good heart she grinned and picked up her tray you were looking at her bum when she left he grinned back ive good eyes after the last customer wandered his way home and the glasses were washed the floor mopped and the doors locked aidan found himself too restless for sleep or a book or a glass of whiskey by his fire he didnt mind that last hour of the day spent alone in his rooms over the pub often he treasured it but he treasured just as much the long walks he was prone to take on nights where the sky was thrown open with stars and the moon sailed white over the water tonight he walked to the cliffs as they were on his mind it was true enough what his brother had said aidan had seen lady gwen and more than once standing high over the sea with the wind blowing her pale hair behind her like the mane of a wild horse and her cloak billowing white as the moon overhead the first time hed been a child and initially had been filled with excited terror then hed been moved beyond measure by the wretched sound of her weeping and the despair in her face shed never spoken but she had looked at him seen him that he would swear on as many bibles as you could stack under his hand tonight he wasnt looking for ghosts for the spirit memory of a woman whod lost what she loved most before shed recognized it he was only looking for a walk in the air made chilly by night and sea in a land hed come back to because nowhere else had ever been home when he climbed up the path he knew as well as the path from his own bed to his bath he sensed nothing but the night and the air and the sea the water beat below its endless war on rock light from the half moon spilled in a delicate line over black water that was never quite calm here he could breathe and think the long thoughts he rarely had time for in the daytoday doing of his work the pub was for him now and though hed never expected the full weight of it it sat well enough on his shoulders his parents decision to stay in boston rather than to remain only long enough to help his uncle open his own pub and get it over the first six months of business hadnt come as that much of a surprise his father had missed his brother sorely and his mother had always been one for moving to a new place theyd be back not to live perhaps but they would be back to see friends to hold their children but gallaghers pub had been passed on from father to son once again since it was his legacy he meant to do right by it darcy wouldnt wait tables and build sandwiches forever he accepted that as well she stored her money away like a squirrel its nuts when she had enough to content her shed be off shawn was happy enough for the moment to run the kitchen to dream his dreams and to have every other female in the village pining over him one day he would stumble over the right dream and the right woman and that would be that as well if aidan intended gallaghers to go on and he did he would have to think about finding himself a woman and going about the business of making a son or a daughter for that matter as he wasnt so entrenched in tradition he couldnt see passing what he had on to a girl but there was time for that thank jesus after all he was only thirtyone and he didnt intend to marry just for responsibility there would be love and passion and the meeting of minds before there were vows one of the things hed learned on his travels was what a man could settle for and what he couldnt you could settle for a lumpy bed if the alternative was the floor and be grateful but you couldnt settle for a woman who bored you or failed to stir your blood no matter how fair her face as he was thinking that he turned and looked out over the roll of land over to the soft rise where the white cottage sat under the sky and stars there was a thin haze of smoke rising from the chimney a single light burning against the window jude frances murray he thought and found himself bringing her face into his mind what are you doing in your little house on the faerie hill reading a good book perhaps one with plenty of weight and profound messages or do you sneak into a story with fun and foolishness when no ones around to see its image that worries you he mused that much hed gotten from the hour or so shed spent on one of his stools what are people thinking what do they see when they look at you and while she was thinking that he mused she was absorbing everything around her that she could see or hear he doubted she knew it but hed seen it in her eyes he thought he would take some time to find out what he thought of her what he saw in her and what was real shed already stirred his blood with those big sea goddess eyes of hers and that sternly bound hair he liked her voice the preciseness of it that seemed so intriguingly at odds with the shyness what would she do pretty jude he wondered if he was to ramble over now and rap on her door no point in frightening her to death he decided just because he was restless and something about her had made him want sleep well then he murmured sliding his hands into his pockets as the wind whirled around him one night when i go walking it wont be to the cliffs but to your door then well see what we see a shadow passed the window and the curtain twitched aside there she stood almost as if shed heard him it was too far away for him to see more than the shape of her outlined against the light he thought she might see him as well just a shadow on the cliffs then the curtain closed again and moments later the light went out chapter four contents prev next reliability jude told herself began with responsibility and both were rooted in discipline with this short lecture in her head she rose the next morning prepared a simple breakfast then took a pot of tea up to her office to settle down and work she would not go outside and take a walk over the hills though it was a perfectly gorgeous day she would not wander out to dream over the flowers no matter how pretty they looked out the window and she certainly wasnt going to drive into the village and spend an hour or two roaming the beach however compelling the idea though many might consider her notion of exploring the legends handed down from generation to generation in ireland a flighty idea at best it was certainly viable work if approached properly and with clear thinking the oral storytelling art as well as the written word was one of the cornerstones in the foundation of culture after all she couldnt bring herself to acknowledge that her most hidden most secret desire was to write to write stories books to simply open that carefully locked chamber in her heart and let the words and images rush out whenever that lock rattled she reminded herself it was an impractical romantic even foolish ambition ordinary people with average skills were better off contenting themselves with the sensible researching detailing analyzing were sensible things shed been trained to do things she thought with only a whisper of resentment shed been expected to do the subject matter shed selected was rebellion enough so she would explore the psychological reason for the formation and perpetuation of the generational myths particular to the country of her ancestors ireland was ripe with them ghosts and banshees pookas and faeries what a rich and imaginative wonder was the celtic mind they said the cottage stood on a faerie hill one of the magic spots that hid the gleaming raft below if memory served she thought the legend went that a mortal could be lured or even snatched into the faerie world below the hill and kept there for a hundred years and wasnt that fascinating seemingly rational ordinary people on the cusp of the twentyfirst century could actually make such a statement without guile that she decided was the power of the myth on the intellect and the psyche and it was strong enough powerful enough that for a little while when shed been alone in the night shed almost almost believed it the music of the wind chimes and the wind had added to it she thought now songs she mused played by the air were meant to set the mind dreaming then that figure standing out on the cliffs the shadow of a man etched against sky and sea had drawn her gaze and caused her heart to thunder he might have been a man waiting for a lover or mourning one a faerie prince weaving magic into the sea very romantic she decided very powerful and of course obviously whoever it had been whoever would walk windwhipped cliffs after midnight was lunatic but she hadnt thought of that until morning for the punch of the image had her sighing and shivering over it into the night but the lunacy for lack of a better word was part of the charm of the people and their stories so she would use it explore it immerse herself in it revved she turned to her machine leaving the tapes and letters alone for the moment and started her paper they say the cottage stands on a faerie hill one of the many rises of land in ireland under which the faeries live in their palaces and castles its said that if you approach a faerie hill you may hear the music that plays in the great hall of the castle under the deep green grass and if you walk over one you take the risk of being snatched by the faeries themselves and becoming obliged to do their bidding she stopped smiled of course that was all too lyrical and well irish a beginning for a serious academic paper in her first year of college her papers had been marked down regularly for just that sort of thing rambling not following the point of the theme neglecting to adhere to her own outlines knowing just how important grades were to her parents shed learned to stifle those colorful journeys still this wasnt for a grade and it was just a draft shed clean it up later for now she decided she would just get her thoughts down and lay the foundation for the analysis she knew enough from her grandmothers stories to give a brief outline of the most common mythical characters it would be her task to find the proper stories and the structure that revolved around each character of legend and then explain its place in the psychology of the people who fostered it she worked through the morning on basic definitions often adding a subtext that crossreferenced the figure to its counterpart in other cultures intent on her work she barely heard the knocking on the front door and when it registered she blinked her way out of an explanation of the pisogue the irish wise woman found in most villages in earlier times hooking her glasses in the neck of her sweater she hurried downstairs when she opened the door brenna otoole was already walking back to her truck im sorry to disturb you brenna began no youre not how could a woman wearing muddy work boots intimidate her jude wondered i was in the little room upstairs im glad you stopped by i didnt thank you properly the other day oh its not a problem you were asleep on your feet brenna stepped away from the gate walked back toward the stoop are you settling in then you have all you need yes thanks jude noticed that the faded cap brenna squashed down over her hair carried a small winged figure pinned just over the bill more faeries jude thought and found it fascinating that such an efficient woman would wear one as a charm ah would you like to come in have some tea that would be lovely thanks but ive work still brenna seemed content to linger on the little garden path i only wanted to stop and see if youre finding your way about or if theres anything youd be needing im back and forth on the road here a time or two a day i cant think of anything well actually i wonder if you can tell me who i contact about getting a telephone jack put into the second bedroom im using it as an office and ill need that for my modem modem is it your computer now her eyes gleamed with interest my sister mary kate has a computer as shes studying programming in school youd think shed discovered the cure for stupidity with the thing and she wont let me near it are you interested in computers i like knowing how things work and shes afraid ill take it apart which of course i would for how else can you figure out how a thing works after all she has a modem as well and sends messages to some cousins of ours in new york and friends in galway its a marvel i suppose it is and we tend to take it for granted until we cant use it i can pass your need on to the right party brenna continued theyll have you hooked up sooner or later she smiled again sooner or laters howtis but shouldnt be more than a week or so if it is i can juryrig something thatll do you thats fine i appreciate it oh and i went into the village yesterday but the shops were closed by the time i got there i was hoping to find a bookstore so i could pick up some books on gardening books on it brenna pursed her lips imagine she thought needing to read about planting well i dont know where youd find such a thing in ardmore but you could likely find what youre looking for over in dungarvan or into waterford city for certain still if you want to know something about your flowers here youve only to ask my mother shes a keen gardener ma is brenna glanced over her shoulder at the sound of a car well heres mrs duffy and betsy clooney come round to say welcome ill move my lorry out of your street so they can pull in mrs duffy will have brought cakes brenna added shes famed for them she waved cheerfully to the two women in the car just give a shout down the hill if youve a need for something yes i oh god was all jude could think dont leave me alone with strangers but brenna was hopping back in her truck she zipped out with what jude considered a reckless and dashing disregard for the narrow slot in the hedgerows or the possibility however remote of oncoming traffic then squeezed fender to fender with the car to chat a moment with the new visitors jude stood mentally wringing her hands as the truck bumped away down the road and the car pulled in good day to you miss murray the woman behind the wheel had eyes bright as a robins and light brown hair that had been beaten into submission she wore it in a tight helmet of waves under a brutal layer of spray it glinted like shellack in the sun she popped out of the car ample breasts and hips plugged onto short legs and tiny feet jude pasted a smile on her face and dragged herself toward the garden gate like a woman negotiating a walk down death row as she rattled her brain for the proper greeting the woman yanked open the rear door of the car chattering away to jude and to the second woman who stepped out of the passenger side and it seemed to the world in general im kathy duffy from down to the village and this is betsy clooney my niece on my sisters side patty mary my sister works at the food shop today or shedve come to pay her respects as well but i said to betsy this morning why if she could get her neighbor to mind the baby while the two older were in school wed just come on up to faerie hill cottage and say good day to old maudes cousin from america she said most of this with her rather impressive bottom currently covered by the eyepopping garden of red poppies rioting over her dress facing jude as she wiggled into the back of the car she wiggled out again face slightly flushed with a covered cake dish and a beaming smile you look a bit like your grandmother kathy went on as i remember her from when i was a girl i hope shes well yes very thank you ah so nice of you to come by she opened the gate please come in i hope we gave you time enough to settle betsy walked around the car and jude remembered her from the pub the night before the woman with her family at one of the low tables somehow even that vague connection helped i mentioned to aunt kathy that i saw you at the pub last night at gallaghers and we thought you might be ready for a bit of a welcome you were with your family your children were so well behaved oh well betsy rolled eyes of clear glass green no need to disabuse you of such a notion so soon youve none of your own then no im not married ill make some tea if youd like she began as they stepped inside the front door that would be lovely kathy started down the hall obviously comfortable in the cottage well have a nice visit in the kitchen to judes surprise they did she spent a pleasant hour with two women who had warm ways and easy laughs it was simple enough to judge that kathy duffy was a chatterbox and not a little opinionated but she did it all with great good humor before the hour was over judes head swam with the names and relations of the people of ardmore the feuds and the families the weddings and the wakes if there was something katherine anne duffy didnt know about any soul who lived in the area during the last century well it wasnt worth mentioning its a pity you never met old maude kathy commented for she was a fine woman my grandmother was very fond of her more like sisters than cousins they were despite the age difference kathy nodded your granny she lived here as a girl after she lost her parents my own mother was friends with the pair of them and both she and maude missed your granny when she married and moved to america and maude stayed here jude glanced around the kitchen alone thats the way it was meant she had a sweetheart and they planned to marry oh what happened his name was john magee my mother says he was a handsome lad who loved the sea he went for a soldier during the great war and lost his life in the fields of france its sad betsy put in but romantic too maude never loved another and she often spoke of him when we came to visit though hed been dead nearly threequarters of a century for some kathy said with a sigh theres only one none comes before and none after but old maude she lived happy here with her memories and her flowers its a contented house jude said then immediately felt foolish but kathy duffy only smiled and nodded again it is yes and those of us who knew her are happy one of her own is living here now its good youre getting around the village meeting people and acquainting yourself with some of your kin kin youre kin to the fitzgeralds and there are plenty of them in and around old parish my friend deidre whos in boston now was a fitzgerald before she married patrick gallagher you were at their place last night oh yes aidans face immediately swam into judes mind the slow smile the wildly blue eyes were cousins of some sort seems to me your granny was first cousin to deidres greataunt sarah or maybe it was her greatgranny and they were second cousins well hardly matters now the oldest gallagher lad kathy paused long enough to nibble on one of her cakes you had your eye on him at one time didnt you betsy i might have glanced his way a time or two when i was a lass of sixteen betsys eyes laughed over her cup and he mightve glanced back as well then he went off on his rambles and there was my tom when aidan gallagher came back well i might have glanced again but only in appreciation for gods creation he was a wild one as a lad and theres a look about him that says he could be again kathy sighed ive al ways had a soft spot for a wild heart in a man have you no sweetheart in the states then jude no she thought briefly of william had she ever considered her husband her sweetheart no one special if theyre not special what would the point be no point at all jude thought later when she showed her guests to the door she couldnt claim hed been her great love as john magee had been to maude they hadnt been special to each other she and william they should have been and for a time hed been the focus of her life shed loved him or had believed she loved him damn it shed wanted to love him and had given him her best but it hadnt been good enough it was mortifying knowing that knowing how easily how thoughtlessly hed broken still fresh vows and dismissed her from his life but neither she could admit would she have grieved for him for seventy years if hed died in some heroic or tragic fashion the fact was if william had died in some freak accident she could have been the stalwart widow instead of the discarded wife and how horrible it was to realize shed have preferred it that way what had hurt more she wondered now the loss of him or the loss of her pride whichever was true she wouldnt allow such a thing to happen again she wouldnt simply fall in line into marriage then out again because it was asked of her this time around she would concentrate on herself and being on her own not that she had anything against marriage she thought as she loitered outside her parents had a solid marriage were devoted to each other it might not have had that cinematic wildly passionate scope some imagined for them selves but their relationship was a fine testament to a partnership that worked perhaps shed pretended she would have something near to that with william a quiet and dignified marriage but it hadnt hit the mark and the fault was hers there was nothing special about her she was more than a little ashamed to admit that shed simply become a habit to him part of his routine meet william for dinner wednesday night at seven at one of three favored restaurants on saturday meet for a play or a film followed by a late supper followed by tasteful sex if both parties are agreeable extend evening to a healthy eight hours sleep followed by brunch and a discussion of the sunday paper that had been the pattern of their courtship and marriage had simply slipped into the scheme of it and it had been so easy really to end the pattern altogether but god god she wished shed done the ending that shed had the guts or the flair for it a torrid affair in a cheap motel moonlighting as a stripper running away to join a motorcycle gang as she tried to imagine herself slithering into leather and hopping on the back of a motorcycle behind some burly tattooed biker named zero she laughed well now sure thats a fair sight for a man on an april afternoon aidan stood at the break in the hedgerows hands comfortably in his pockets grinning at her a laughing woman with flowers at her feet now some might think being where we are that theyd stumbled across a faerie come out to charm the blossoms to blooming he strolled toward the gate as he spoke paused there and she was certain shed never seen a more romantic picture in her life than aidan gallagher with his thick rich hair ruffled by the breeze his eyes a clear wild blue standing at the gate with the distant cliffs at his back but youre no faerie are you jude frances no of course not without thinking she lifted a hand to make sure her hair was still tidy i ah just had a visit from kathy duffy and betsy clooney i passed them on the road when i was walking this way they said you had a nice hour over tea and cakes you walked from the village its not so very far if you like to walk and i do she was looking just a bit distressed again aidan mused as if she wasnt quite sure what to do about him well he supposed that made them even but he wanted to make her smile to watch her lips curve slow and shy and her dimples come to life are you going to ask me into your garden or would you rather i just kept walking no sorry she hurried to the gate and reached for the latch just as he did his hand closed over hers warm and firm so they lifted the latch together what were you thinking of that made you laugh oh well since he still had her hand she found herself backing up just something foolish mrs duffy left some cakes and theres still tea he couldnt recall ever having seen a woman so spooked just by speaking to him but he couldnt say that her reaction was entirely displeasing testing he kept her hand in his continued forward as she walked back and i imagine youve had your fill of both for now truth is i need the air from time to time so i go on what people call aidans rambles unless youre in a hurry to go back in we could just sit on your stoop awhile his free hand reached out pressed her hip and stopped her retreat youre about to step on your flowers he murmured a shame it would be to crush them underfoot oh cautious she edged away im clumsy i wouldnt say so a bit nervy is all despite the odd pleasure of seeing her flustered he had an urge to smooth those nerves away and put her at ease with his fingertips curled to hers he shifted turned her with such fluid grace she could only blink to find herself facing the other way i wondered he went on as he led her toward the stoop if youre interested in hearing the stories i know for your paper yes very much she let out a relieved breath and lowered herself to the stoop i started on it this morning the paper trying to get a feel for it formulate an outline the basic structure she wrapped her arms around her knees then tightened them as she glanced over and saw him watching her what is it he lifted a brow its nothing im listening i like listening to you your voice is so precise and american oh she cleared her throat stared straight ahead again as if she had to keep a close eye on the flowers so they didnt escape where was i the structure of it the different areas i want to address the fantasy elements of course but also the social cultural and sexual aspects of traditional myths their use in tradition as entertainment as parables as warnings in romance warnings yes mothers telling children about bog faeries to keep them from wandering into dangerous areas or relating tales of evil spirits and so forth to influence them to behave there are as many more actually grotesque legends as there are benevolent ones which do you prefer oh well she fumbled a little both i suppose depending on the mood do you have many many what moods i think you do you have moody eyes there he thought thats made her look in my direction again those long liquid pulls started up again in her belly so she looked away again quickly no actually im not particularly moody anyway hmmm you have babies being snatched from their cradles and replaced with changelings children devoured by ogres in the last century weve changed passages and endings in fairy tales to happyeverafter when in reality their early forms contained blood and death and devouring psychologically it mirrors the changes in our cultures and what parents want their children to hear and to believe and what do you believe that a storys a story but happyeverafter is less likely to give a child nightmares and did your mother tell you stories of changelings no the idea of it had jude laughing but my grandmother did in a very entertaining fashion i imagine you tell an entertaining one too ill tell you one now if youve a mind to walk down to the village with me walk she shook her head its miles no more than two suddenly he wanted very much to walk with her youll work off mrs duffys cakes then ill feed you supper we have beggarmans stew on the menu tonight and it sits well ill see you get a ride home after a bit she slid her gaze toward him then away again it sounded wonderfully spontaneous just stand up and go no plans no structure which of course was exactly why it wouldnt do thats tempting but i really should work a little longer then come tomorrow he took her hand again drawing her to her feet as he rose we have music at gallaghers of a saturday night you had music there last night more he told her and a bit more structured youd say i suppose some musicians from waterford city the traditional sort youll enjoy it and you cant write about irelands legends can you without its music so come down to the pub tomorrow night and ill come to you on sunday come to me he smiled again slow deliberate delightful to tell you a story for your paper will sunday in the afternoon do for you oh yes that would be fine perfect good day to you then jude frances he strolled to the gate then turned his eyes were bluer more intense when they met hers held hers come on saturday i like looking at you she didnt move a muscle not when he turned to open the gate not when he walked through and down to the road not even after he was well beyond the high hedge and away looking at her what did he mean by that exactly was that some sort of casual flirtation his eyes hadnt looked casual she thought as she began to pace up and down the narrow path of course how would she know really when this was only the second time shed seen him that was probably it just an offhand kneejerk flirtation from a man used to flirting with women more when you considered the situation a friendly remark id like to see you in the pub on saturday come on by she murmured thats all he meant and damn it all to hell and back why do i have to pick everything apart annoyed with herself she strode back into the house closed the door firmly any sensible woman would have smiled at him when hed said it flirted back a little it was a harmless even conditioned response unless you were a neurotic tightass which jude f murray is exactly what you are a neurotic tightass you couldnt just open your idiot mouth and say something like ill see what i can do i like looking at you too oh no you just stand there like hed shot you between the eyes jude stopped holding up both hands shutting her eyes now she wasnt just talking to herself she was scolding herself as if she were two different people taking deep breaths she calmed herself and decided she really wanted another of those little frosted cakes just to take the edge off she marched into the kitchen ignoring the prissy little voice in her head that told her she was compensating with oral gratification yeah so what when some gorgeous man she barely knew had her hormones erupting she was damn well going to comfort herself with sugar she snatched up a cake with pale pink frosting then whirled around at the loud thud against the back door at the sight of the hairy face and long teeth she cut loose with a squeal and the cake sailed up bounced off the ceiling then landed with a plop frosting side down at her feet it took her only the amount of time the cake was airborne to realize it wasnt a monster at the back door but a dog jesus jesus christ whats with this country every two minutes somethings coming to the door she dragged her fingers through her hair setting curls free then she and the dog eyed each other through the glass she had big brown eyes and jude decided they looked hopeful rather than aggressive her teeth were showing true but her tongue was lolling out so what choice did they have huge paws had already smeared the glass with mud but when she let out a friendly woof jude caved as she moved to the door the dog disappeared but there she was when jude opened it sitting politely on the back stoop thumping her tail and gazing up at her youre the otooles dog arent you she seemed to take this for an invitation and shoved her way in to clomp around the kitchen spreading mud then she did jude the favor of cleaning up the dropped cake before walking to the fire and sitting on her haunches again i didnt feel like starting the fire in here today she walked over holding out her hand to see what the dog would do about it when she sniffed it politely then gave it a nudge with her nose so it landed on her head jude laughed clever arent you obligingly she scratched between her ears shed never had a dog though her mother had two illtempered siamese cats that were pampered like royalty she imagined the dog had visited old maude regularly had curled up by the kitchen fire and kept the old woman company from time to time did dogs feel grief when a friend had died she wondered then remembered shed yet to keep her promise to take flowers to maudes grave shed inquired about the location in the village the night before maude was buried east of the village above the sea beyond the path that ran near the hotel and back to the ruins and the oratory and the well of saint declan a long and scenic walk she mused on impulse jude pulled the flowers shed put on the kitchen counter out of their bottle then cocked her head at the dog want to go visit old maude the dog gave another woof got to her feet and as they walked out the back door together jude wondered who was leading whom it felt very rural and rustic as she hiked over hills with the yellow dog flowers in her hand for an ancestors grave jude imagined it as part of her weekly routine the irish country woman with her faithful hound paying respects to a distant cousin it would be something she would make a habit well if she actually had a dog and really lived here it was soothing being out in the air and the breeze watching the dog race off to sniff at god knew what catching all those glorious signs of spring in the blooming hedges the quick dart and trill of a bird the sea rumbled the cliffs brooded as she approached the steeply gabled oratory the sun shot through the clouds and splashed over the grass and the stone the three stone crosses stood casting their shadows with the well holding its holy water under them pilgrims had washed there she remembered from her guidebook and how many she wondered had secretly poured a bit of water on the ground for the gods hedging their bets why take chances she thought with a nod shed have done both herself it was a peaceful place she thought and a moving one that seemed to understand life and death and what connected them the air seemed warmer almost like summer despite the wind with the fragrance of flowers that scattered through the grass and lay on the dead suddenly wild and sweet she heard the hum of bees and birdsong the sound of it clear and musical and ripe the grass grew tall and green and just a little wild over uneven ground a handful of small rough stones she noted that marked ancient graves settled into it and with them the single new old maude had chosen to be buried here nearly alone on a hill that looked over the gameboardneat village the blue skirt of sea and the roll of green that led to mountain tucked into a stone shelf in the ruins was a long plastic pot filled with deep red flowers the sight of them touched judes heart so often people forgot she thought but not here here people remembered and honored those memories with flowers for the dead maude alice fitzgerald the simple marker read wise woman had been carved under her name and below that the dates of her long long life it was an odd epitaph jude mused as she knelt beside the gentle slope there were flowers there already a tiny clutch of early violets just beginning to fade jude lay her bouquet beside them then sat back on her heels im jude she began your cousin agness granddaughter the one from america im staying in your cottage for a while its really lovely im sorry i never met you but granny used to talk about the times you spent together in the cottage how you were happy for her when she married and went to america but you stayed here at home she was a fine woman with her heart leaping into her throat jude jerked her head up and looked into deep blue eyes it was a handsome face young and smooth he wore his black hair long nearly to his shoulders his mouth tipped up at the corners in a friendly fashion as he stepped closer to face jude across the grave i didnt hear you i didnt know you were here one walks soft on a holy place i dont mean to frighten you no only half to death she thought you just startled me she pushed at the hair the wind had loosened and sent dancing around her face you knew maude sure and i knew old maude a fine woman as i said who lived a rich and generous life its good that youre bringing flowers to her for she favored them theyre hers out of her garden aye his smile widened that makes them all the better he laid his hand on the head of the dog that sat quietly at his side jude saw a ring glint on his finger some deep blue stone that winked in a heavy setting of silver youve waited a long time to come to your beginnings she frowned at him blinking against the sun which seemed stronger now strong enough to make her vision waver oh you mean to come to ireland i suppose i have its a place where you can look into your heart and see what matters most his eyes were like cobalt now intense hypnotic then choose he told her choose well jude frances fortisnt only you wholl be touched by it the scent of flowers grass earth whirled in her head until she felt drunk from it the sun blinded her shooting up fiery facets that burned and blurred the wind rose a sudden dazzling burst of energy she would have sworn she heard pipes playing rising notes flying on that fast wind i dont know what you mean woozy she lifted a hand to her head closed her eyes you will i saw you in the rain dizzy she was so dizzy on the hill with the round tower that you did weve been waiting for you waiting who the wind stilled as quickly as it had risen and the music faded away into silence she shook her head to clear it im sorry what did you say but when she opened her eyes again she was alone with the quiet dead and the big yellow dog chapter five contents prev next aidan didnt object to paperwork he bloody well hated it but three days a week rain or shine he spent an hour or more at the desk in his upstairs rooms laboring over orders and overhead payroll and profits it was a constant relief to him that there was a profit hed never concerned himself overmuch with money before gallaghers had been passed into his hands and he often wondered if that was part of the reason his parents had pushed it there hed had a fine time living from hand to mouth when hed traveled scraping by or just scraping he hadnt saved a penny or felt the need to responsibility hadnt precisely been his middle name after all hed grown up comfortable enough and certainly hed worked his share during his childhood and adolescence but mopping up serving pints and singing a tune was a far cry from figuring how much lager to order what percentage of breakage thank you very much sister darcy the business could bear the juggling of numbers into ledgers and the calculation of taxes it gave him a headache every blessed time and he had no more love for sitting inside with books than he had for having a tooth pulled but he learned and as he learned he realized the pub meant more to him because of it yes parents were clever creatures he decided and his knew their son he spent time on the phone with distributors trying to wangle the best price that he didnt mind so much as it was a bit like horse trading and something he discovered an aptitude for it pleased him that musicians from dublin from waterford from as far away as clare and galway were not only willing but pleased to do a turn at gallaghers he took pride in knowing that in his four years at the head of it hed helped polish the pubs reputation as a place for music and he expected the summer season when the tourists flowed in to be the best theyd had but that didnt make the adding and subtracting any less a chore hed thought about a computer but then hed have to learn the goddamn thing he could admit without shame that the very idea of it frightened him beyond speech when he broached the idea to darcy that she could perhaps learn the ins and outs of it shed laughed at him until tears ran down her pretty cheeks he knew better than to ask shawn who wouldnt think to change a lightbulb if he was reading in the dark he wasnt about to hire the chore out not when gallaghers had managed its own since the doors had opened so it was either continue to labor with pencil and adding machine or gather the courage to face technology he imagined jude had knowledge of computers he wouldnt mind having her teach him a thing or two hed certainly enjoy he thought with a slow smile returning the favor in a different area altogether he wanted his hands on her hed already wondered what he would find in taste in texture in that lovely wide mouth of hers it had been some time since a woman had put this hum in his blood and he was enjoying the anticipation of it the wondering of it she put him in mind of a young mare not quite sure of her legs one who shied at the approach of a man even as she hoped for a nice gentle stroke it was an appealing combination that hesitant manner with the clever mind and educated voice he hoped she would come that evening as hed asked her he hoped shed wear one of her neat outfits with her hair tidied back so he could imagine the pleasure of mussing her up if jude had had a clue where aidans thoughts were traveling she would never have found the courage to leave the cottage even without that added complication shed changed her mind about going half a dozen times it would be impolite not to after shed been asked it would look as if she expected his time and attention it was simply a nice way to spend a friendly evening she wasnt the type of woman who spent evenings in bars her own vacillation irritated her so much she decided to go on principle for one hour she dressed in stonegray slacks and jacket jazzing them up with a vest with thin burgundy stripes it was saturday night after all she thought and added silver earrings that dangled cheerfully there would be music she remembered as she toyed with going crazy and adding a pair of thin silver bangle bracelets she had a secret and passionate love affair with jewelry as she slipped the bangles on her wrist she thought of the ring the man in the cemetery had worn that flash of sapphire in deeply carved silver so out of place in the quiet countryside hed been so odd she thought now coming and going so quietly it was almost as if shed dreamed him but she remembered his face and voice very clearly as clearly as that sudden burst of scent the quick kick of wind and the dizziness just a sugar crash she decided all those cakes shed eaten had leaped into her system and then away leaving her momentarily giddy she shrugged it off leaning forward to the mirror to make sure she hadnt smeared her mascara she would probably see him again in the pub tonight or when she took flowers to maude the next time with her bracelets jangling cheerfully and giving her confidence she headed downstairs she remembered her keys before she got all the way to the car this time which she considered good progress just as she considered it a good sign that her palms didnt sweat while she negotiated the road in the dark pleased with herself anticipating a quiet and enjoyable evening she parked at the curb just down from gallaghers smoothing her hair as she went she walked to the door breathed in pulled it open and was nearly knocked back again by the blast of music pipes fiddle voices then the wild roar of the crowd on the chorus of whiskey in the jar the rhythm was so fast so reckless it was a blur of sound and that sound grabbed her yanked her inside then surrounded her this wasnt the dark quiet pub shed stepped into before this one was crowded with people spilling over at the low tables jammed into the bar milling about with glasses full and glasses empty the musicians how could only three people make such a sound were shoehorned into the front booth taking the space over in their workingmens clothes and boots as they played like demon angels the room smelled of smoke yeast and saturdaynight soap for a moment she wondered if shed walked into the wrong place but then spotted darcy her glorious cloud of dark hair tied back with a sassy red ribbon she carried a tray loaded with empty glasses bottles overflowing ashtrays while she flirted skillfully with a young man whose face was as red as her ribbon with embarrassed delight and whose eyes were filled with desperate admiration catching judes eye darcy winked then gave the infatuated young man a pat on the cheek and nudged her way through the crowd pubs lively tonight aidan said youd be coming in and to keep an eye out for you oh that was nice of him of you i wasnt expecting so much the musicians are favored around here and they draw a good crowd theyre wonderful they play a fine tune yes darcy was more interested in judes earrings and wondered where shed bought them and what the price might have been here now just keep in my wake and ill get you to the bar safe enough she did just that winding and wending nudging now and then with a laugh and a comment addressed to this one or that one by name she headed for the far end of the bar where she slipped her tray through bodies to the order station good evening mr riley sir darcy said to the ancient man at the very last stool good evening to you as well young darcy he spoke in a reedy voice smiled at her out of eyes that looked half blind to jude as he sipped his thick dark guinness if you marry me darling ill make you a queen then marry we will saturday next for a queen i deserve to be she gave him a pretty kiss on his papery cheek will riley let the yank here have your seat next to your grandda pleasure the thin man hopped off the stool and beamed a smile at jude youre the yank then sit down here next to me grandda and well buy you a pint the lady prefers wine aidan the glass already in his hand stepped into her vision and offered it yes thank you well then put it on will rileys tab aidan and well drink to all our cousins across the foam that ill do will he spread that slow smile over jude said stay awhile wont you then moved off to work she stayed awhile because it seemed polite she drank toasts to people shed never heard of because it required little effort on her part she had a conversation with both rileys about their relations in the states and their own visits there though she knew she disappointed them both when she admitted shed never been to wyoming and seen an actual cowboy she listened to the music because it was wonderful tunes both familiar and strange both rousing and heartbreaking flowed through and over the crowd she let herself hum when she recognized the song and smiled when old mr riley piped out words in his thin voice i was sweet of heart on your cousin maude mr riley told jude but she was only for johnny magee rest his soul he sighed deep and sipped his guinness in the same fashion and one day when i went to her door with my hat in my hand once again she told me id marry a lass with fair hair and gray eyes before the year was out he paused smiling to himself as if jude thought looking backward she leaned closer to hear him over the thunder of music and before a month had passed i met my lizzie with her fair hair and gray eyes we were married in june and had nearly fifty years together before she passed on thats lovely maude she knew things his faded eyes looked into judes the good people often whispered in maudes ear did they jude said amused now oh aye and you being her blood they may come whispering in yours see that you listen ill do that for a time they sipped companionably and listened to the music then tears filmed judes eyes when darcy slipped her arm around the old mans bony shoulders and matched her glorious voice to his on a song of endless love and loss when she saw brenna pouring whiskey and pulling the taps behind the bar jude smiled for once the cap was missing and brennas mass of red curls tumbled down as they chose i didnt know you worked here oh now and again when theres need whats your pleasure there jude oh this is chardonnay but i really shouldnt but she was talking to brennas back and before she knew it the woman had turned around and filled her glass again weekends can be busy at gallaghers brenna went on and ill lend a hand over the summer season as well its fine music tonight isnt it its wonderful and hows it all going then mr riley my darling its going well pretty brenna otoole and when are you going to be my bride and stop my heart from aching in the merry month of may smoothly she replaced his empty pint with a full one watch this rogue mind you jude or hell be after toying with your affections take the other end will you brenna aidan slipped behind her tugged on her bright hair ive a mind to work down here so i can flirt with jude ah theres another rogue for you the place is full of them shes a pretty one mr riley put in and aidan winked at jude which one of them mr riley sir all of them mr riley wheezed out a laugh and slapped his thin hand on the bar sure and ive never seen a female face that wasnt pretty enough for a pinch the yank here has witchy eyes you mind your step aidan lad or shell put a spell on you maybe she has already he cleared glasses put them in the sink under the bar got fresh ones for the tap have you been out of a midnight jude frances picking moonflowers and whispering my name i might she heard herself say if i knew which were moonflowers this made mr riley laugh so hard she feared hed topple off his stool aidan only smiled served his pints took the coin then he leaned close watched her eyes go wide and her lips tremble apart in surprise ill point out the moonflowers for you the next i come to call well hmmm so much for snappy repartee she decided and gulped down some wine either the wine or the intimacy of the look he sent her went straight to her head she decided she would have to approach both with a bit more caution and respect this time when aidan lifted the bottle she shook her head and put her hand over her glass no thanks ill just have water now you want the fizzy sort fizzy oh yes that would be nice he brought it to her in a short glass with no ice to speak of she sipped it watching as he set two more glasses under taps and began the methodical process of building a guinness it takes an awfully long time she said more to herself than him but he glanced over one hand still maneuvering the taps only as long as it takes to make it right one day when youre in the mood for it ill build you a glass and youll see what youre missing by sipping that french business there darcy swung back to the bar set down her tray a pint and a half smithwick pint of guinness and two glasses of jamesons and when youre done there aidan jack brennans come to his limit ill see to it what time do you have jude frances time she stopped staring at his hands they were so quick and clever and glanced down at her watch lord its after eleven i had no idea her hour had stretched into nearly three i need to get back aidan gave her an absent nod a great deal less than shed hoped for and filled his sisters order while jude searched for the money to pay for her drinks my grandsons paying mr riley laid a fragile hand on her shoulder hes a good lad you put your money away darling thank you she offered a hand to shake then found herself charmed when the old man lifted it to his lips i enjoyed meeting you she slid off her stool sent a smile to the younger riley both of you without darcy to clear the path getting to the door was a little more problematic than getting to the bar had been when she got there her face was flushed from the heat of bodies and her blood dancing to the hot lick of the fiddle she considered it one of the most entertaining evenings of her life then she stepped outside into the cool night air and saw aidan just as he ducked under the violent swing of an arm the width of a tree trunk now jack he said in reasonable tones as a giant of a man with shocking red hair bunched hamlike fists again you know you dont want to hit me ill do it ill break your interfering nose this time by jesus aidan gallagher who are you to tell me i cant have a fucking drink in the fucking pub when ive a fucking mind to youre well and truly pissed jack and you need to go home now and sleep it off lets see if you can sleep this off he charged and while aidan prepared to pivot and easily avoid the bull rush jude let out a short scream of alarm it took only that to distract aidan enough to have jacks wild punch connect well hell aidan wiggled his jaw blew out a breath as jacks lumbering charge sent the man sprawling facedown on the sidewalk are you all right terrified jude rushed over skirting the sprawled form that was approximately the size of a capsized ocean liner your mouths bleeding does it hurt this is awful she fumbled in her bag for a tissue as she stuttered aidan was irritated enough to tell her the blood was as much her fault for screaming as it was jacks for throwing the punch but she looked so pretty and distressed and was already dabbing at his painfully cut lip with the tissue he started to smile and as that hurt like twice the devil he winced oh what a bully we need to call the police for what to arrest him he attacked you sincerely shocked aidan gaped at her now why would i want to have one of my oldest friends arrested just for bloodying my lip friend sure hes just nursing a broken heart with whiskey which is foolish but natural enough the lass he thought he loved went off with a dubliner two weeks ago last wednesday so hes taken to drinking out his sorrows the past few days then causing a ruckus he doesnt mean anything by it he hit you in the face perhaps if she said it slowly clearly the meaning would get through he said he was going to break your nose thats only because hes tried to break it before and hasnt found success hell be sorry for it in the morning nearly as sorry as hell be because his aching head wont just roll off his shoulders and leave him in peace aidan did smile now but cautiously were you worried for me darling apparently i shouldnt have been she said it primly and balled up the bloody tissue as you appear to enjoy brawling in the street with your friends was a time i enjoyed brawling in the street with strangers but with maturity i prefer my friends he reached out as hed been wanting to and toyed with the ends of her boundback hair and i thank you for having concern for me he stepped forward she stepped back and he sighed one day you wont have quite so much room to back away and i wont have poor drunk jack at me feet to deal with philosophically he bent down and to judes astonishment picked up the enormous semiconscious man and swung him handily over his shoulder is that you then aidan aye jack did i break your nose no you didnt but you bloodied my lip a bit fucking gallagher luck theres a lady present you knothead oh begging pardon youre both ridiculous jude decided and turned away to march to her car jude my darling aidan grinned hissed as his lip split again ill see you tomorrow say at halfone he only chuckled when she continued to walk heels clicking briskly then turned to give him a fulminating look as she got into her car is she gone now jack wanted to know shes going but not far aidan murmured as she drove decorously down the street no she wont go far men were baboons obviously jude shook her head tapped her finger on the wheel in a disapproving manner as she drove home drunken brawls on the street were not amusing pastimes and anyone who thought they were was in dire need of therapy god hed made her feel like an idiot standing there grinning at her while she dabbed at the blood on his mouth and babbled an indulgent grin she thought now from the big strong man to the foolish fluttery female worse she had been foolish and fluttery when aidan had tossed that enormous man over his shoulder as if he was a bag of feathers her stomach had definitely fluttered if she hadnt tightened up that very instant and stalked away she might well have whimpered in admiration mortifying and had he been the least bit embarrassed at getting a fist planted in his face in front of her no indeed had he blushed to introduce the drunken fool at his feet as an old and close friend no he had not he was very likely behind the bar again right this minute entertaining his customers with the story making them laugh over her scream of alarm and trembling hands bastard she sniffed once and felt better for it by the time she pulled in the drive shed convinced herself that shed behaved in a scrupulously dignified and reasonable manner it was aidan gallagher whod been the fool moonflowers indeed she slammed the door of her car sharply enough to send the echo ringing down to the valley after huffing out another breath and smoothing down her hair she headed for the gate and when her gaze was drawn up she saw the woman in the window oh god the blood drained out of her head she felt each individual drop of it flow out moonlight shimmered gently on the pale fall of hair on the white cheeks against the deep green eyes she was smiling a beautiful heartwrenching smile that hooked judes soul and all but ripped it out gathering courage she shoved the gate back and ran for the door when she yanked it open it occurred to her that shed neglected to lock it someone had gone in while shed been in the pub she told herself that was all her knees trembled as she dashed up the stairs the bedroom was empty as was every other room when she hurried through the house all that was left was the faint sighing scent of woman uneasy she locked the doors and when she was in her bedroom again she locked that as well from the inside after she undressed and huddled in bed she left the light burning it was a long time before she slept and dreamed of jewels bursting out of the sun and tumbling through the sky to be caught in a silver bag by a man riding a winged horse white as snowfall they swooped out of the sky over the fields and mountains the lakes and rivers the bogs and the moors that were ireland across the battlements of castles and the humble thatched roofs of cottages with the white wings of the horse singing against the wind they came to a flashing stop hooves striking ground at the front of the cottage on the hill with its white walls and deepgreen shutters and flowers spilling from the door she came out to him her hair the palest of golds around her shoulders her eyes green as the fields and the man with hair as dark as hers was light wearing a silver ring centered with a stone no less brilliant than his eyes leaped from the horse he walked to her and spilled the flood of jewels at her feet diamonds blazed in the grass these are my passion for you he told her take them and me for i would give you all i have and more passion isnt enough nor are your diamonds her voice was quiet contained and her hands stayed folded at her waist im promised to another ill give you all ill give you forever come away with me gwen and a hundred lifetimes ill give you tisnt fine jewels and lifetimes i want a single tear slipped down her cheek as bright as the diamonds in the grass i cant leave my home wont change my world for yours not for all your diamonds for all your lifetimes without a word he turned from her and mounted his horse and as they rose up into the sky she walked away into the cottage leaving the diamonds on the ground as if they were no more than flowers and so they became flowers and covered the ground with fragrance humble and sweet chapter six contents prev next jude awoke to the soft steady patter of rain and the vague memory of dreams full of color and motion she was tempted to snuggle under the covers and slide back into sleep to find those dreams again but that seemed wrong overindulgent more productive she decided to create and maintain a routine a rainy sunday morning could be spent on basic housekeeping chores after all she didnt have a cleaning service here in ardmore as she had in chicago on some secret level she actually looked forward to the dusting and mopping the little tasks that would in some way make the cottage hers she supposed it wasnt very sensible of her but she actually enjoyed rooting through the cleaning supplies selecting her rags and cloths she spent a pleasant portion of the morning dusting and rearranging the knickknacks old maude had scattered all over the house pretty painted fairies elegant sorcerers intriguing chunks of crystal had homes on every tabletop and shelf most of the books leaned toward irish history and folklore but there were a number of wellworn paperbacks tucked in old maude had liked to read romance novels jude discovered and found the idea wonderfully sweet rather than a vacuum jude unearthed an oldfashioned upright sweeper and hummed along with its squeaky progress over rug and wood she scrubbed down the kitchen and found a surprising glow of satisfaction when chrome and porcelain gleamed gaining confidence as she went she wielded her polishing cloth in the office next she would get to the boxes in the tiny closet soon she promised herself perhaps that evening and shed ship off to her grandmother anything that seemed worthwhile or sentimental enough to keep she stripped the bed in her room gathered the rest of the laundry she found it slightly embarrassing that shed never done laundry before in her life but surely it couldnt be that complex a skill to learn it occurred to her that she should have started the wash before she started the cleaning but shed remember that next time in the cramped room off the kitchen she found the basket which she realized she should have taken upstairs in the first place and dumped the laundry in it she also discovered there was no dryer if she wasnt mistaken that meant she had to hang clothes out on a line and though watching mollie otoole as she did so had been enjoyable doing it herself for herself would be a little more problematic shed just have to learn she would learn jude assured herself then clearing her throat she took a hard look at the washing machine hardly new it had a spray of rust spots over the white surface the controls were simple you got cold water or hot and she assumed if you wanted something clean you used hot and plenty of it she read the instructions on the box of detergent and followed them meticulously the sound of water pouring into the tub made her beam with accomplishment to celebrate she put on the kettle for tea and treated herself to a handful of cookies from the tin the cottage was tidy her cottage was tidy she corrected everything was in place the laundry was going so now there was no excuse not to think about what shed seen the night before the woman at the window lady gwen her ghost there was no reasonable way to deny shed seen that figure twice now it had been too clear so clear she knew she could even with her rudimentary skills sketch the face that had watched her from the window ghosts they werent something shed been brought up to believe in though part of her had always loved the fancy of her grandmothers tales but unless she had suddenly become prone to hallucinations shed seen a ghost twice now could it be shed tumbled off the edge of the breakdown that had been so worrying her when she left chicago but she didnt feel so unsteady now she hadnt had a tension headache or a queasy stomach or felt the smothering weight of oncoming depression in days not since shed stepped over the threshold of faerie hill cottage for the first time she felt good she decided after a quick mental check alert calm healthy even happy so she thought either shed seen a ghost and such things did exist which meant readjusting her thinking to quite an extent or shed had a breakdown and the result of it was contentment she nibbled thoughtfully on another cookie and decided she could live with either situation at the knock on the front door she quickly brushed crumbs from her sweater and glanced at the clock she had no idea where the morning had gone and she had deliberately put aidans promised visit out of her head apparently he was here now that was fine theyd work in the kitchen she decided shoving pins back into her hair as she walked down the hall to the door despite her initial well chemical reaction to him her interest in him was purely professional a man who fought with drunks on the street and flirted so outrageously with women he barely knew had no appeal to her whatsoever she was a civilized woman who believed in using reason diplomacy and compromise to solve disputes she could only pity someone who preferred using force and bunched fists even if he did have a beautiful face and muscles that just rippled when put into use she was much too sensible to be blinded by the physical she would record his stories thank him for his cooperation and that would be that then she opened the door and he was standing in the rain his hair gleaming with it his smile warm as summer and just as lazy and she felt about as sensible as a puppy good day to you jude hello it was a testament to his effect on her that it took her a full ten seconds to so much as notice the enormous man beside him clutching flowers in his huge hand he looked miserable she noted the rain dripping off the bill of his soaked cap his wide face pale as moonlight his truckgrill shoulders slumped he only sighed when aidan rammed an elbow hard into his ribs ah good day to you miss murray im jack brennan aidan here tells me i behaved badly last night in your presence im sorry for that and hope to beg your pardon he shoved the flowers at her with a pitiful look in his bloodshot eyes id had a bit too much of the drink he went on but thats no excuse for using strong language in front of a lady though i didnt know you were there did i he said that with a slide of his eyes toward aidan and a mutinous set to his mouth no she kept her voice stern though the wet flowers were so pathetic they melted her heart you were too busy trying to hit your friend oh well sure aidans too fast for me to plant a good one on him when im under the influence so to speak his lips curved for just a moment into a surprisingly sweet smile then he hung his great head again but despite circumstances being what they were its no excuse for behaving in such a manner in front of a lady so im after begging your pardon and hoping you dont think too poorly of me there now aidan gave his friend a hearty slap on the back well done jack miss murrays too kindhearted to hold a grudge after so pretty an apology he looked back at her as if they were sharing a lovely little joke arent you jude frances actually she was but it irritated her to be so well pegged ignoring aidan she nodded at jack i dont think poorly of you mr brennan it was very considerate of you to come by and bring me flowers would you like to come in and have some tea his face brightened thats kind of you i wouldnt mind youve got places to go jack jacks brows drew together i dont particularly aye you do this and the other you take my car and be about it youll remember i told you miss murray and i have business to tend to all right then he muttered but i dont see how one bloody cup of tea would matter good day miss murray shoulders hunched cap dripping he lumbered back to the car you might have let him come in out of the rain jude commented you dont seem to be in any great hurry to ask me in out of it aidan angled his head as he studied her face maybe you hold a grudge after all you didnt bring me flowers but she stepped back to let him come inside and drip ill see that i do next time youve been cleaning the house smells of lemon oil a nice homey scent if you get me a rag ill wipe up this wet im tracking in to your nice clean house ill take care of it i have to go up and get my tape recorder and so forth well work in the kitchen you can just go ahead back all right then his hand closed over hers making her frown then he slipped the flowers out of her fingers ill put these in something for you so they dont look quite so pitiful thank you the stiffly polite tone was the only defense she could come up with against six feet of wet charming male in her hallway ill only be a minute she was barely longer than that but when she walked into the kitchen he already had the flowers in one of maudes bottles and was handily brewing a pot of tea i started a fire there in your hearth to take the chill off that all right then of course and she tried not to be annoyed that every one of the tasks hed done took her three times as long to accomplish have a seat ill pour the tea ah it needs to steep a bit yet i knew that she mumbled it as she opened a cupboard for cups and saucers we make tea in america too she turned back set the cups on the table then hissed out a breath stop staring at me sorry but youre pretty when youre all flustered and your hairs falling down mutiny ripe in her eyes she jammed pins back in violently enough to drill them into her scalp perhaps i should make myself clear this is an intellectual arrangement intellectual wisely he controlled the grin and kept his face sober sure its a fine thing to have an interest in each others minds youve a strong one i suspect telling you youre pretty doesnt change that a bit does it im not pretty and i dont need to hear it so if we can just get started he took a seat because she did then cocked his head again you believe that dont you well now thats interesting on an intellectual level were not here to talk about me my impression was that you have a certain skill as a storyteller and are familiar with some of the myths and legends particular to this area i know some tales when her voice went prim that way it just made him want to lap at her starting anywhere at all so he leaned back in his chair if it was intellectual she wanted he figured they could begin with that then move along some you may know already in one form or another the oral history of a place may shift here and there from teller to teller but the heart of it remains steady the shapeshifter is told one way by the native americans another by the villagers of romania and still another by the people of ireland but the same threads weave through while she continued to frown he lifted the pot to pour the tea himself you have santa and father christmas and kris kringle one may come down the chimney another fills shoes with candy but the basis of the legend has its roots in the same place because it does time after time country after country the intellect comes to the conclusion that the myth has its core in fact you believe in santa claus his eyes met hers as he set the pot down again i believe in magic and that the best of it the most true of it is in the heart youve been here some days now jude frances have you felt no magic atmosphere she began and turned her recorder on the atmosphere in this country is certainly conducive to the forming of myths and the perpetuation of them from paganism with its small shrines and sacrifices to the gods celtic folklore with its warnings and rewards and the addition of culture seeded in through the invasions of the vikings the normans and so on its the place aidan disagreed not the people who tried to conquer it its the land the hills and rock its the air and the blood that seeped into all of it in the fight to keep it tis the irish who absorbed the vikings the normans and so on not the other way around there was pride there that she understood and respected the fact remains that these people came to this island that they mated with the women here passed down their seed and brought with them their superstitions and beliefs ireland absorbed them too which came first the tale or the teller is that part of your study then he was quick she thought a sharp mind and a clever tongue you cant study one without studying the other who tells and why as much as whats told all right ill tell you a story that was told to me by my grandda and to him by his father and his by his for as far back as any knows for there have been gallaghers on this coast and in these hills for longer than time remembers the story came down paternally jude interrupted and was met with that quirked brow very often stories come down the generations through the mother true enough but the bards and harpists of ireland were traditionally male and its said one was a gallagher who wandered to this place singing his stories for coin and ale that he saw some of what ill tell you with his own eyes heard the rest from the lips of carrick prince of the faeries and from that told the story himself to all who cared to listen he paused noting the amused interest in judes eyes then began there was a maid known as gwen she was of humble birth but a lady in her heart and in her manner she had hair as pale as winter sunlight and eyes as green as moss her beauty was known throughout the land and though she carried herself with pride for she had a slim and pleasing form she was a modest maid who as her blessed mother had died in the birthing of her kept the tidy cottage for her aging father she did as she was bid and what was expected and was never heard to complain though she was seen from time to time walking on the cliffs of an evening and staring out over the sea as if she wished to grow wings and fly as he spoke a silent stream of sunlight shimmered through the rain through the window to lie quietly on the table between them i cant say what was in her heart aidan continued perhaps this is something she didnt know herself but she kept the cottage cared for her father and walked the cliffs alone one day when she was taking flowers to the grave of her mother for she was buried near the well of saint declan she met a man what she thought was a man he was tall and straight with dark hair waving to his shoulders and eyes as blue as the bluebells she carried in her arms by her name he called her and his voice was like music in her head and set her heart to dancing and in a flash like a lightning strike they fell in love over her dear mothers grave with the breeze sighing through the tall grass like faeries whispering love at first sight jude commented its a device often used in fables dont you believe that heart recognizes heart an odd and poetic way to put it she thought and was glad shed have the question recorded i believe in attraction at first sight love takes more youve had the irish all but drummed out of you he said with a shake of his head not so much i dont appreciate the romance of a good story she sent him a smile a hint of dimples what happened next well however heart recognized heart it was not the simple matter of a maid and a man taking hands and joining lives for he was carrick the faerie prince who lived in the silver palace under the hill where her cottage sat she feared a spell and she doubted both his heart and her own and more her heart yearned more she doubted for shed been taught to beware of the faeries and the rafts where they gathered his voice rising and falling like music on the words lulled jude into propping her elbows on the table resting her chin on her fists even so one night when the moon was ripe and full carrick lured gwen from the cottage and onto his great winged horse to fly with her over the land and the sea and show her the wonders he would give her if only she would pledge to him his heart was hers and all he had he would give her and it happened that her father wakeful with aches in his bones saw his young gwen swirl out of the sky on the white winged horse with the faerie prince behind her in his fear and lack of understanding he thought only to save her from the spell he was sure she was under so he forbade her to have truck with carrick again and to ensure her safety he betrothed her to a steady young man who made his living on the water and lady gwen a maid with great respect for her father dutifully tucked her heart away ceased her walking and prepared to be wed as was bid her now the little slash of sunlight that danced across the table between them vanished and the kitchen plunged into gloom lit only by the simmering fire aidan kept his eyes on judes fascinated by what he saw in them dreams and sadness and wishes on first hearing carrick gave way to a black temper and sent the lightning and thunder and wind to whip and crash over the hills and down to the sea and the villagers the farmers and fishermen trembled but lady gwen sat quiet in her cottage and saw to her mending he could have just taken her into the raft jude interrupted and kept her for a hundred years ah so you know something of how its done those blue eyes warmed with approval true enough he could have snatched her away but in his pride he wanted her to come to him willing in this way the gentry arent so very different from ordinary people he angled his head studying her face would you rather be snatched up and away without a choice or romanced and courted since i dont think one of the good people is going to come along and do either in my case i dont have to decide id rather know what carrick did all right then ill tell you at dawn carrick mounted his winged horse and flew up to the sun he gathered fire from it formed dazzling diamonds from it and put them in a silver sack and these flaming and magic jewels he brought to her at her cottage when she went out to meet him he spilled them at her feet and said to her ive brought you jewels from the sun these are my passion for you take them and me for i will give you all i have and more but she refused telling him she was promised to another duty held her and pride him as they parted leaving the jewels lying among the flowers and so they became flowers when jude shuddered aidan reached for her hand are you cold then no she forced a smile deliberately freed her hand and picked up her tea sipping slowly to soothe away the flutter in her throat she knew the story she could see it the magnificent horse the lovely woman the man who wasnt a man and the fiery blaze of diamonds on the ground she had seen it all of it in her dreams no im fine i think my grandmother must have told me some version of this theres more yet oh she sipped again made an effort to relax what happened next on the day she married the fisherman her father died it was as if hed held on to his life with all its pains until he was assured his gwen was safe and cared for so her husband moved into the cottage and left her before the sun rose every day to go out and cast his nets and their life settled into a contentment and order when he paused jude frowned but that cant be all aidan smiled sampled his tea like any good storyteller he knew how to change rhythm to hold interest did i say it was no indeed its not all for you see carrick he could not forget her she was in his heart while gwen was living her life as was expected of her carrick lost his joy in music and in laughter one night in great despair he mounted his horse once again and flew up to the moon gathering its light which turned to pearls in his silver bag once more he went to her and though she carried her first child in her womb she slipped out of her husbands bed to meet him these are tears of the moon he told her they are my longing for you take them and me for i will give you all i have and more again though tears of her own spilled onto her cheeks she refused him for she belonged to another had his child inside her and would not betray her vow once more they parted duty and pride and the pearls that lay on the ground became moonflowers so the years passed with carrick grieving and lady gwen doing what was expected of her she birthed her children and took joy in them she tended her flowers and she remembered love for though her husband was a good man he had never touched her heart in its deepest chambers and she grew old her face and her body aging while her heart stayed young with the wistful wishes of a maid its sad tis yes but not yet over as time is different for faeries than for mortals one day carrick mounted his winged horse and flew out over the sea and dived deep deep into it to find its heart there the pulse of it flowed into his silver bag and became sapphires these he took to lady gwen whose children had children now whose hair had gone white and whose eyes had grown dim but all the faerie prince saw was the maid he loved and longed for at her feet he spilled the sapphires these are the heart of the sea they are my constancy take them and me for i will give you all i have and more and this time with the wisdom of age she saw what she had done by turning away love for duty for never once trusting her heart and what he had done for offering jewels but not giving her the one thing that may have swayed her to him without realizing it aidan closed his fingers over judes on the table as they linked together that little sunbeam danced back and that it was the words of love rather than passion rather than longing even rather than constancy shed needed but now she was old and bent and she knew as the faerie prince couldnt not being mortal that it was too late she wept the bitter tears of an old woman and told him that her life was ended and she said that if he had brought her love rather than jewels had spoken of love rather than passion and longing and constancy her heart might have won over duty he had been too proud she said and she too blind to see her hearts desire her words angered him for he had brought her love time and again in the only way he knew and this time before he walked away from her he cast a spell she would wander and she would wait as he had year after year alone and lonely until true hearts met and accepted the gifts he had offered her three times to meet three times to accept before the spell could be broken he mounted and flew into the night and the jewels at her feet again became flowers she died that very night and on her grave flowers sprang up season to season while the spirit of lady gwen lovely as the young maid waits and weeps for love lost jude felt weepy herself and oddly unsettled why didnt he take her away then tell her it didnt matter thats not the way it happened and wouldnt you say jude frances that the moral is to trust your heart and never turn away from love she caught herself and realizing shed been too wrapped up in the tale even as her hand was in his drew back it might be or that following duty provides you with a long contented life if not a flashy one jewels werent the answer however impressive he should have looked back to see them turn into flowers flowers she kept as i said youve a strong mind aye she kept his flowers aidan flicked a finger over the petals in the bottle she was a simple woman with simple ways but theres a bigger point to the tale which would be love over the blooms his eyes met hers love whatever the time whatever the obstacles lasts theyre only waiting now for the spell to run its course then shell join him in his silver palace beneath the faerie hill she had to pull herself out of the story and into the reasoning she reminded herself the analysis legends often have strings attached quests tasks provisions even in folklore the prize rarely comes free the symbolism in this one is traditional the motherless maid caring for her aging father the young prince on a white horse the use of the elements sun moon sea little is said about the man she married as hes only a vehicle used to keep the lovers apart busily making notes she glanced up saw aidan studying her thoughtfully what its appealing the way you shift back and forth i dont know what you mean when im telling it to you youre all dreamyeyed and going soft now here you are sitting up straight and proper all businesslike putting pieces of the story that charmed you into little compartments thats precisely the point and i wasnt dreamyeyed id know better about that wouldnt i as i was the one looking at you his voice warmed again flowed over her youve sea goddess eyes jude frances big and misty green ive been seeing them in my mind even when youre not around what do you think of that i think you have a clever tongue she got up without a clue what she intended to do for lack of anything else she carried the teapot back to the stove which is why you tell a very entertaining story id like to hear more to coordinate them with those from my grandmother and others she turned back around jolted when she realized he was standing just behind her what are you doing nothing at the moment ah boxed you in now havent i he thought but kept his voice easy im happy enough to tell you tales smoothly he rested his hands on the edge of the stove on either side of her and if youve a mind to you can come into the pub on a quiet night and find others wholl do the same yes panic was beating bat wings in her stomach thats a good idea i should did you enjoy yourself last night the music mmmm he smelled of rain and of man she didnt know what to do with her hands yes the music was wonderful is it that you dont know the tunes he was close now very close and could see a thin ring of amber between the silky black of her pupils and the misty green of the iris ah i know some of them do you want more tea i wouldnt mind it why didnt you sing then sing her throat was bonedry a desert of nerves i had my eye on you most of the time you never sang along chorus or verse oh well no he really had to move he was taking all her air i dont sing except when im nervous is that the truth then watching her face he moved in sliding his body into an amazing fit against hers she knew what to do with her hands now they lifted quickly to brace against his chest what are you doing ive a mind to hear you sing so im making you nervous she managed a stuttering laugh but when she tried to shift she only succeeded in pressing more firmly against him aidan just a little nervous he murmured and lowered his mouth to nip gently at her jaw youre trembling another nip teasing and light easy now im after stirring you up not frightening you to death he was doing both her heart was rapping against her ribs ringing in her ears while he slowly nibbled his way over her jaw her hands were trapped against the solid wall of his chest and she felt marvelously weak and female aidan youre this is i dont think thats fine then a fine idea lets neither of us think for just a minute here he caught her bottom lip the wide soft wonder of it between his teeth she moaned quiet her eyes clouded dark a spear of pure and reckless lust shot straight to his loins jesus youre a sweet one his hand lifted from the stove fingers skimming over her collarbone as he held her where he wanted her he took her mouth sampling then savoring then wallowing in the taste of her even as she slid toward surrender he used his teeth to make her gasp and went deeper than hed intended still she trembled putting him in mind of a volcano poised to erupt a storm ready to strike her hands remained trapped between them but her fingers gripped his shirt now and held fast she heard him murmur something a whisper against the wall of sound that was her blood raging his mouth so hot so skilled his body so hard so strong and his hands light as moth wings on her face she could do nothing but give and give even as some shocking unrecognizable part of her urged her to take and when he drew away it was as if her world tilted and spilled her out he kept his hands on her face waited for her eyes to open focus hed intended only to taste to enjoy the moment to see but it had gone beyond intentions into something just out of his control will you let me have you her eyes were huge glazed with confusion and pleasure and nearly brought him to his knees he didnt particularly care for the sensation i what come upstairs and lie with me shock came a bare instant before she simply nodded her head i cant no this is completely irresponsible is there someone in america who has a hold on you a hold why wouldnt her brain function oh no im not involved with anyone the sudden gleam in aidans eyes had her straining back that doesnt mean im going to just i dont sleep with men i barely know at the moment i feel we know each other pretty well thats a physical reaction youre damn right he kissed her again hard and hot i cant breathe im having a bit of trouble with that myself it was against his natural instincts but he stepped away well what do we do about this then jude frances analyze it on an intellectual level his voice might have carried the musical lilt of ireland but it could still slash because she wanted to wince she straightened her shoulders im not going to apologize for not jumping into bed with you and if i prefer to function on an intellectual level its my business he closed his mouth before the snarl escaped then jammed his hands in his pockets and paced up and down the tiny room do you always have to be reasonable yes he stopped eyed her narrowly then to her complete confusion threw back his head and laughed damn it jude if youd shout or throw something we could have a nice bloody fight and end it wrestling on the kitchen floor and speaking for myself id feel a hell of a lot more satisfied she allowed herself a quiet breath i dont shout or throw things or wrestle he lifted a brow ever ever his grin came fast this time a flash of humor and challenge i bet i can change that he stepped toward her shaking his head when she backed away he caught a loose strand of her hair and tugged will you wager on it no she tried a hesitant smile i dont gamble either you walk around with a name like murray then tell me you dont gamble its a disgrace you are to your blood im a testament to my breeding ill put my money on the blood every time he rocked back on his heels considering her well id best start back a walk in the rainll clear my head she steadied herself as he took his jacket from the hook youre not angry why would i be his gaze whipped to hers bright and intense youve a right to say no havent you yes of course she cleared her throat yes but i imagine a number of men would still be angry im not a number of men then am i and added to that i mean to have you and i will it doesnt have to be today he flashed her another grin when her mouth fell open then walked to the door think of that and of me jude frances until i get my hands on you again when the door closed behind him she stood exactly where she was and though she did think of that and of him and of all the pithy lowering brilliant responses she should have made she thought a great deal more of what it had been like to be held against him chapter seven contents prev next im compiling stories jude wrote in her journal and find the project even more interesting than id expected the tapes my grandmother sent bring her here while im listening to them its almost as if shes sitting across from me or sweeter somehow as if i were a child again and she had come by to tell me a bedtime story she prefaces her telling of the lady gwen tale by stating shed never told me this story she must be mistaken as portions of it were very familiar to me while aidan was relating it to me logically i dreamed of it because the memory of the story was in my subconscious and being in the cottage tripped it free jude stopped typing pushed back drummed her fingers yes of course that was it she felt better now that shed written it down it was exactly the exercise she always gave to her firstyear students write down your thoughts on a certain problem or indecision in conversational style without filters then sit back read and explore the answers youve found so why hadnt she documented her encounter with aidan in her journal shed written nothing about the way hed caged her between the stove and his body the way hed nibbled on her as she were something tasty nothing about how she felt or what she thought oh god just the memory of it had her stomach flipping it was part of her experience after all and her journal was designed to include her experiences her thoughts and feelings about them she didnt want to know her thoughts and feelings she reminded herself every time she tried to think about it in a reasonable manner those feelings took over and turned her mind to mush besides its not relevant she said aloud she huffed out a breath rolled her shoulders and put her fingers back on the keys it was interesting to note that my grandmothers version of the lady gwen tale was almost exactly the same as aidans the delivery of each was defined by the teller but the characters details the tone of the story were parallel this is a clear case of wellpracticed and skilled oral tradition which indicates a people who respect the art enough to keep it as pure as possible it also indicates to me psychologically how a story becomes legend and legend becomes accepted as truth the mind hears again and again the same story with the same rhythm the same tone and begins to accept it as real i dream about them jude stopped again stared at the screen she hadnt meant to type that the thought had slipped into her mind and down through her fingers but it was true wasnt it she dreamed about them almost nightly now the prince on the winged white horse who looked remarkably like the man shed met at maudes grave the sobereyed woman whose face was a reflection of the one she thought shed seen had seen jude corrected in the window of the cottage her subconscious had given them those faces of course that was perfectly natural the events in the story were said to have happened at the cottage where she lived so naturally the seeds had been planted and they bloomed in dreams it was nothing to be surprised by or concerned about still she decided she was in the wrong mood for journal entries or exercises and turned off the machine since sunday shed kept very close to the cottage to work she assured herself not because she was avoiding anyone and though the work was satisfying her fueling her in a way it was time to get out she could drive into waterford for some supplies and those gardening books she could explore more of the countryside instead of just roaming the hills and fields near her house surely the more she drove the more comfortable shed be with driving solitude she reminded herself was soothing but it could also become stifling and it could make you forgetful she decided hadnt she had to look at the calendar that morning just to figure out if it was wednesday or thursday out she told herself while she hunted up her purse and her keys explore shop see people take photographs she added stuffing her camera in her purse to send to her grandmother with the next letter home maybe she would linger and treat herself to a nice dinner in the city but the minute she stepped outside she realized it was here she wanted to linger right here in the pretty garden with her view of the green fields and the shadowy mountains and wild cliffs what harm would it do to spend just half an hour weeding before she left okay she wasnt dressed for weeding but so what did she or did she not know how to do her own laundry now except for the sweater shed managed to shrink to doll size that little experiment had come off very well so she didnt know a weed from a daisy she had to learn didnt she she just wouldnt yank anything that looked pretty the air was so soft the light so lovely the clouds so thick and white when the yellow dog bounded up to dance at her gate she gave in just half an hour she promised herself as she walked over to let her in jude delighted the dog with strokes and scratches until she all but dissolved at judes feet in a puddle of devotion caesar and cleo never let me pet them she murmured thinking of her mothers snobbish cats they have too much dignity then she laughed as the dog sprawled on her back to expose her belly you just dont have any dignity at all thats what i like about you shed made a mental note to include dog treats on her supply list when brennas pickup bumped along the road and zipped into her drive well youve met betty then is that her name jude hoped her grin wasnt as foolish as it felt on her face as the dog nuzzled her nose into her hand shes very friendly oh she has a fondness for the ladies particularly folding her arms on the open window brenna rested her chin there she wondered why the woman seemed embarrassed to have been caught petting a dog so youre fond of dogs are you apparently whenever she wears out her welcome you just shove her out the gate and shell head home our betty knows a soft touch and she doesnt mind taking advantage shes wonderful company but i suppose im keeping her from your mother shes more on her mind than bettys presence at the moment refrigerators out again im heading down to kick it for her havent seen you at the pub this week oh no ive been working i havent really been out but youre heading off today she nodded her head toward judes purse i thought id drive into waterford hunt up those gardening books oh now theres no need to go all that way unless youre set on it come down the house and talk to my mother while im banging on the icebox shed enjoy that and itd keep her from badgering me with questions she wouldnt be expecting company i wouldnt want to doors always open the woman was so interesting brenna thought and hardly said more than one short string of words at a time unless you bumped and nudged at her if anyone could pry bits and pieces out of her to brennas mind it was mollie otoole come on hop in she added then whistled for the dog betty yapped once cheerfully then bounded to the truck and leaped neatly into the back jude searched for a polite excuse but everything that came to mind seemed stilted and rude smiling weakly she latched the gate and walked around the truck to the passenger side youre sure i wont be in the way not a bit of it pleased brenna beamed at her waited until she climbed in then roared backward out of the drive god what brenna slammed on the brakes forcing jude to slap her hands on the dash before her face plowed into it she hadnt had time to fasten her seat belt you ah regulating her breathing jude hastily dragged the belt around her you dont worry that a car might be coming brenna laughed a rollicking sound then gave jude a friendly pat on the shoulder there wasnt was there dont fret ill keep you in one piece those are lovely shoes she added though brenna didnt see how theyd be as comfortable as a stout pair of boots darcy wagers you wear shoes made in italy is that the truth um with a vague frown jude stared down at her neat black flats yes actually shes a keen eye for fashion darcy does loves looking through the magazines and such dreamed through them even when we were girls together shes beautiful oh she is yes the gallaghers are a fine handsome family its odd that such attractive people arent involved with anyone particularly even as she said it casually as she could she cursed herself for prying darcy has no interest never has in the local lads above a bit of flirting that is aidan she jerked a shoulder seems married to the pub since he came back else the man is very discreet shawn a frown marred brennas brow as she whipped the truck into the drive at her house he doesnt look hard enough at whats in front of his face if youre asking me the dog leaped out of the truck and raced around the back of the house the frown vanished as brenna hopped out if youre of a mind to do some shopping in waterford city or dublin darcys your girl nothing she likes better than wandering the shops and trying on clothes and shoes and playing at the paints and powders but if your stoves acting up or you find a leak in your roof she winked as she led jude to the front door you give me a call there were flowers here snugged together in color and shape into a lovely blanket outside the door trailing and tangling up a trellis spilling happily out of pots of simple red clay they seemed to grow as they chose yet there was a tidiness an almost ruthless neatness jude thought to the entrance of the house the stoop was scrubbed so clean it looked adequate as a table for major surgery and jude felt herself wince when brenna carelessly left dirt from her boots over its surface ma brennas voice rang out down the pretty hallway up the angled staircase as a fat gray cat slid out of a doorway to wind around her boots ive brought company the house smelled female was judes first thought not just the flowers or the polish but the underlying scent of women perfume lipstick shampoo the sort of candycoated fragrance young women and girls often carried with them she remembered it from college and wondered if that was why her stomach clutched shed been so miserably awkward and out of place among all those recklessly confident females mary brenna otoole ill let you know when my hearings gone and then you can shout at me mollie came down the hallway tugging off a short pink apron she was a sturdylooking woman no taller than her daughter but certainly wider her hair was only slightly less brilliant than brennas but quite a bit tidier she had a plump pretty face with an easy smile and friendly green eyes that beamed welcome even before she held out her hand so you brought miss murray to see me youve the look of your granny a dear woman she is im happy to meet you thank you the hand that clasped judes was strong and hard from a lifetime of making a home i hope im not catching you at a bad time not at all if its not one thing than for sure its another around the otooles come in and sit in the parlor wont you ill fix us some tea i dont want to put you to any trouble of course youre not mollie gave her a comforting squeeze on the shoulder as she might to any of her girls if they felt out of place youll keep me company while the lass here is in the kitchen banging and cursing brenna im telling you just as ill tell your dad when i get hold of him its time that refrigerator was hauled out of my house and another brought in i can fix it and so both of you say time and time again she shook her head as she led jude into the front parlor with its company chairs and fresh flowers its a cross to bear miss murray having those that are handy with things in your life for nothing ever gets tossed away its always i can fix it or i have a use for it make miss murray at home brenna while i see to the tea then you can have at it well i can fix it brenna mumbled when her mother was out of earshot and if i cant its good for parts isnt it parts of what brenna glanced back focused on jude again and grinned oh for this and for that or else for the other thing entirely so i hear jack brennan came to beg your pardon with a fistful of posies sunday last yes he did jude perched on her chair and looked with some envy at the way brenna slouched comfortably in hers he was very sweet and embarrassed aidan shouldnt have made him do it it was one way to pay jack back for the fat lip twinkling now she shifted in her chair hooking one booted ankle over the other how did he manage it its a rare thing for a fist slowed by whiskey to land on aidan gallagher it was my fault i suppose i called out screamed jude thought in selfdisgust i must have distracted him and then he had a fist in his face and his head was snapping back his mouth bleeding ive never seen anything like it havent you fascinated brenna pursed her lips even in a female household shed grown up with the stray fist flying it would often be her own dont they have the occasionally donnybrook in chicago it was a word that made jude smile and think for some reason of baseball not in my neighborhood she murmured does aidan often have fistfights with his customers no indeed though he started his own fair share of brawls once upon a time these days if someones reached his limit and is feeling a bit frisky aidan talks them around it most dont want to push him in any case gallaghers are known for their dark moods and black temper unlike the otooles mollie said dryly as she carted in a tea tray who are of a sunny nature night and day thats the truth brenna leaped up and planted a loud kiss on her mothers cheek ill see to your fridge ma and have it working like new for you hasnt worked like new since alice mae was born and shes fifteen this summer go on then before the milk sours shes a good girl my brenna mollie went on when brenna strolled out all my girls are will you have some biscuits with your tea miss murray i baked yesterday thank you please call me jude i will then and you call me mollie its nice to have a neighbor in faerie hill cottage again old maude would be pleased youve come as she wouldnt want the house sitting lonely no none for you you great lump mollie addressed this to the cat who leaped onto the arm of her chair she nudged him off again but not before scratching his ears you have a wonderful house i like looking at it when im walking its a hodgepodge but it suits us mollie poured the tea into her good china cups smiling as she set the pot down again my mick was always one for adding a room here and a room there and when brenna was big enough to swing a hammer why the two of them ganged up on me and did whatever they liked to the place with so many children youd need room jude accepted the tea and two golden sugar cookies brenna said you have five daughters five that sometimes seems like twenty when the lot of them are running around tame brennas the oldest and her fathers apple my maureens getting married next autumn and driving us all mad with it and her squabbles with her young man and pattys just gotten herself engaged to kevin riley and will im sure be putting us through the same miseries as maureen is before much longer then my mary kates at the university in dublin studying computers of all things and little alice mae the baby spends all her time with animals and trying to talk me into taking in every brokenwinged bird in county waterford mollie paused and when theyre not here underfoot i miss them something terrible as im sure your mothers missing you with you so far from home jude made a noncommittal sound she was sure her mother thought of her but actively miss her she couldnt imagine it not with the schedule her mother kept it jude broke off goggling as harsh vicious curses erupted from the rear of the house damn you to fiery hell you bloody snakeeyed bastard ive a mind to drop your worthless hulk off the cliffs myself brenna takes after her dad in other aspects as well mollie continued topping off the tea with a serene grace as her daughters curses and threats were punctuated by banging and crashing shes a fine clever girl but a bit short of temper so she tells me youve an interest in flowers ah jude cleared her throat as the cursing continued yes that is i dont know much about gardening but i want to keep up the flowers at the cottage i was going to buy some books thats fine then you can learn a lot from books though for brenna shed rather be tied facedown on a hill of ants than have to read about the workings of a thing prefers to rip it apart for herself still ive a bit of a hand with a garden myself maybe youd like to take a walk around with me take a look at what ive done then you could tell me what it is youve a need to know jude set down her cup id really like that fine lets leave brenna alone so she can raise the roof without us worrying itll crash down on our heads she rose hesitated could i see your hands my hands baffled jude held them out found them firmly gripped old maude had hands like yours of course they were old and troubled with the arthritis but they were narrow and fine and i imagine her fingers were long and straight and slender like yours when she was young youll do jude mollie held her hands a moment longer met her eyes youve good hands for flowering i want to be good at it jude said surprising herself and mollies eyes warmed then you will be the next hour was sheer delight shyness and reserve melted away as jude fell under the spell of the flowers and mollies innate patience those feathery leaves were larkspur that mollie said would bloom in soft and showy colors and the charming bicolored trumpets were columbine dancing around as they chose were flowers with odd and charming names like flax and pinks and ladys mantel and bee balm she knew shed forget names or mix them up but it was a wonder to be shown which bloomed in spring what would flower in summer what was hardy and what was delicate what drew the bees and the butterflies she didnt feel foolish asking what she was certain were almost childishly basic questions mollie would just smile or nod and explain old maude we would trade back and forth a clump or a cutting or some seeds so most of what i have here you have at the cottage she liked romantic flowers and me the cheerful so between us we ended up with both ill walk up your way one day if you wouldnt mind and take a look to see if theres something you need to be doing that youre not id appreciate that so much especially knowing how busy you are mollie cocked her head her face was bright as cheerful as her gardens youre a nice girl jude and id enjoy spending some time with you now and again over the gardens and youve a pretty bit of polish on you i wouldnt mind seeing some of it rub off on my brenna shes a wide heart and a clever mind but shes rough on the edges mollies gaze drifted over judes shoulder and she sighed speaking of it have you finally killed the beast then mary brenna it was a struggle a battle of sweat and tears but i won brenna swaggered around the side of the house there was a smear of grease on her cheek and a dry crust of blood over her left knuckles itll run for you now ma damn it girl you know ive my heart set on a new one ah that ones years left in it cheerfully she kissed her mothers cheek ive got to get on now ive promised to go by and see to fixing the windows in betsy clooneys house do you want to ride back with me jude or would you rather stay awhile i should get back i really enjoyed myself mollie thank you you come back whenever you want a bit of company i will oh i left my purse inside ill just run in and get it if thats all right go right on mollie waited until the door shut shes thirsty she murmured thirsty ma for doing for being but shes afraid to drink too fast its wise to take things in small sips but once in a while darcy thinks aidan has his eye on her oh is that so amused molly turned to wiggle her eyebrows at her daughter that would be some fine and fast drinking now wouldnt it darcy told me she once spied on him while he was courting the duffy girl and when hed finished kissing the lass she staggered like a drunk darcys no business spying on her brothers mollie said primly then slid her gaze back to brenna which duffy girl tell me later she added quickly when jude came out again so you had a nice visit then brenna began when they slid back into the truck your mothers wonderful on impulse jude swiveled to wave as brenna pulled out of the drive with her usual speed and enthusiasm ill never remember half of what she told me about gardening but its a good start shell like having you to talk with patty has a hand with flowers but shes got her head in the clouds over kevin riley these days and spends most of her time sighing and looking moony shes awfully proud of you and your sisters thats part of a mothers job yes but it doesnt always glow out of them jude decided youre probably used to it so you dont really notice but its a lovely thing to see being what you are brenna mused you pay more attention to such things do you learn that or do you just have it in you i suppose its both like the way i noticed that she was proud youd been able to fix the refrigerator even though she was hoping you couldnt brenna turned her head to laugh into judes eyes nearly didnt manage it this time frigging temperamental heap but the thing is my dads wheeled a deal for a brandnew one oh and a beauty it is too but we cant seal the bargain and have it delivered for another week or two so if were to keep the pleasure of the surprise that wheezing son of a bitch has to last a bit longer thats so lovely jude embraced the idea of it then tried to imagine her mothers reaction if she and her father surprised her with a new refrigerator bafflement jude imagined and not a little insult amused by the idea she chuckled if i gave my mother a major appliance as a gift shed think id lost my mind but then your mothers a professional woman as i recall yes she is and shes wonderful at her job but your mothers a professional woman too a professional mother brenna blinked then her eyes gleamed with amused pleasure oh shell like that one ill be sure to save that for the next time shes ready to kick my ass over something well look here at whats strolling up the road handsome as two devils and just as dangerous even as judes lovely relaxation sprang into one sticky ball of tension brenna was braking at the narrow drive of the cottage and leaning out to call to aidan theres a wild rover never no more he said with a wink then took the hand shed laid on the window to examine the skinned knuckles what have you done to yourself now bloody bastard refrigerator took a bite out of me he clucked his tongue lifted the scrape to his lips but his gaze drifted to jude and where are you two lovely ladies bound for im just bringing jude back from a visit with my mother and im off to betsy clooneys to bang on her windows if you or your dad has the time tomorrow the stove at the pubs acting up and shawns sulking over it one of usll have a look thanks ill just take your passenger off your hands have a care with her brenna said as he walked around the truck i like her so do i he opened the door held out a hand but i make her nervous dont i jude frances of course not she started to climb out then ruined the casual elegance shed hoped for by jerking back again because shed forgotten to unhook her seat belt before she could fumble with it aidan released it himself then simply nipped her by the waist and lifted her down since that tangled her tongue into knots she didnt manage to thank brenna again before that young woman with a wave and a grin took the truck barreling down the road drives like a demon that girl with a shake of his head aidan released jude only to take her hands you havent been down to the pub all week ive been busy not so busy now yes actually i should invite me in and fix me a sandwich when she simply gaped at him he laughed or failing that go walking with me its a fine day for walking i wont kiss you unless you want me to if thats whats worrying you im not worried well then he lowered his head got within an inch of his pleasure when she stumbled back thats not what i meant i was afraid of that but he eased away just a walk then have you been up to tower hill to look at the cathedral no not yet and with your curious mind then well walk that way and ill tell you a story for your paper i dont have my recorder slowly he lifted one of the hands he still held and brushed his lips over the knuckles then ill make it a simple one so you remember it chapter eight contents prev next he was right about the day it was a perfect one for walking the light glowed like the inside of a pearl luminous with a slight sheen of damp she could see over the hills and fields rolling toward the mountains a thin and silvery curtain that was certainly a line of rain sunlight poured through it in beams and ripples liquid gold through liquid silver it was the kind of day that begged for rainbows the breeze was just a teasing shimmer on the air fluttering leaves growing toward their summer ripeness and surrounding her with the scent of green he held her hand with the careless loosefingered grip of familiarity and made her feel simple relaxed at ease and simple words rolled off his tongue to charm her once its said there was a young maid fair as a dream was her face with skin white and clear as milk and hair black as midnight eyes blue as a lake more than her beauty was the loveliness of her manner for a kind maid was she and more than her manner was the glory of her voice when she sang the birds stilled to listen and the angels smiled as they climbed the hill the sea began to sing as backdrop or so it seemed to his story manys the morning her song would carry over the hills and the joy of it rivaled the sun he continued and tugged her along the path as they walked on the breeze turned to wind and danced merrily over sea and rock now the sound of it the pure joy of it caught the ear and the envy of a witch theres always a catch jude commented and made him chuckle sure and theres a catch if the storys a good one now this witch had a black heart and the powers she had she abused she soured the morning milk and caused the nets of the fisherfolk to come up empty though she could use her arts to disguise her vile face into beauty when she opened her mouth to sing a frogs croaking was more musical she hated the maid for her gift of song and so cast a spell on her and rendered her mute but there was a cure involving a handsome prince oh there was a cure for evil should always be confounded by good jude smiled because she believed it despite all logic she believed in the happyeverafter and such things seemed more than merely possible here in this world of cliffs and wild grass of sea with red fishing trawlers streaming over deep blue of firm hands clasped warm over hers they seemed inevitable the maid was doomed to silence unable to share the joy in her heart through her songs as the witch trapped it inside a silver box and locked it with a silver key inside the box the voice wept as it sang why are irish stories always so sad are they he looked sincerely surprised its not sad so much as poignant poetry doesnt most usually spring from joy does it but from sorrows i suppose youre right she brushed absently at her hair as the wind tugged tendrils free what happened next well ill tell you for five years the maid walked these hills and the fields and the cliffs as we walk them now she listened to the song of the birds the music of the wind in the grass the drumbeat of the sea and these she stored inside her while the witch hoarded the joy and passion and purity of the maids voice inside the silver box so only she could hear it as they reached the top of the hill with the shadow of the old cathedral the sturdy spear of the round tower aidan turned to jude whisked her hair back from her face with his fingers what happened next he asked her what tell me what happened next but its your story he reached down to where little white flowers struggled to bloom in the cracks of tumbled rocks picking one he slid it into her hair tell me jude frances what youd like to happen next she started to reach up for the flower but he caught her hand lifted a brow after a moments thought she shrugged well one day a handsome young man rode over the hills his great white horse was weary and his armor dull and battered he was lost and injured from battle and a long way from home she could see it closing her eyes the woods and shadows the wounded warrior longing for home as he moved into the forests the mists swirled in so he could hear nothing but the labored breathing of his own heart with each beat counted he understood he came closer to the last then he saw her coming toward him through the mists like a woman wading through a silver river because he was ill and in need the maid took him in and tended his wounds in silence nursed him through his fevers though she was unable to speak to comfort him her gentleness was enough so they fell in love without words and her heart almost burst from the need to tell him to sing out her joy and her devotion and without hesitation without regret she agreed to go with him to his home far away and leave behind her own her friends and family and that part of herself locked tight in a silver box because she could see it feel it even as she spoke jude shook her head moved through the tilted gravestones to lean back against the round tower the bay swept out below a spectacular blue where the red boats bobbed but she was caught in the story what happens next she asked aidan she mounted the horse with him he continued picking up the threads shed left for him as if theyd been his own bringing with her only her faith and her love and asking for nothing but his in return and at that moment the silver box still clutched in the greedy hands of the witch burst open the voice trapped inside flew out a golden stream that winged its way over the hills and into the heart of the maid and as she rode off with her man her voice more beautiful than ever sang out and the birds stilled to listen and the angels smiled again jude sighed yes that was perfect youve a way with telling a story the words thrilled her rocked her then made her feel shy all over again no not really it was easy because youd started it you filled in the middle part and in a lovely way that makes me think not all the irish has been drummed out of you after all there now he murmured pleased youve a laugh in your eyes and a flower in your hair let me kiss you now will you jude frances she moved fast caution she told herself sometimes had to be quick ducking under his arm she scooted around him youll make me forget why we walked here ive read about round towers but ive never seen one up close patience gallagher he thought and tucked his thumbs in his pockets someone was always trying to invade and conquer the jewel of ireland but were still here arent we yes youre still here she turned a slow circle studying hill and cliff and sea its a wonderful spot it feels old she stopped shook her head that sounds ridiculous not at all it does feel old and sacred if you listen well you can hear the stones sing of battle and of glory i dont think i have the ear for singing stones she wandered skirting the carved markers the graves laden with flowers and picked her way over the rough ground my grandmother told me she used to come up here and sit i bet she heard them why didnt she come with you i wanted her to she brushed her hair back as she turned to face him he fit here she thought with the old and the sacred with the songs of battle and glory where she wondered did she fit she walked inside the old ruin where the sky soared overhead for a roof i think shes teaching me a lesson how to be jude in six months or less and are you learning maybe she traced her fingers over the ogham carving and for a moment just a moment felt them tingle with heat what does jude want to be thats too general a question with too many simple answers like happy healthy successful arent you happy i her fingers danced over the stones again dropped away i wasnt happy teaching in the end anyway i wasnt good at it its discouraging not to be good at what youve chosen as your lifes work your life is far from done so youve more than time enough to choose again and ill wager you were better at it than you decided to believe she glanced up at him then began to walk out again why would you think so because in the time ive spent with you ive listened to you and learned why are you spending time with me aidan i like you she shook her head again you dont know me if i havent figured myself out yet you cant know me i like what i see so its a physical sort of attraction that quick brow quirked again and is that a problem for you then yes actually but she managed to turn and face him one im working on well i hope you work fast because i want the pleasure of you her breath clogged and had to be released slowly and deliberately i dont know what to say to that ive never had a conversation like this in my life so obviously i dont know what to say to that except something thats bound to sound incredibly stupid he frowned as he stepped toward her why would it sound stupid if its what youre thinking because i have a habit of saying stupid things when im nervous he slipped the flower stem deeper into her hair as the wind wanted to tug it free again i thought you sang when you were nervous one or the other she muttered moving backward to keep what she thought was a safe distance youre nervous now yes god knowing she was close to stuttering she held her hands up to hold him off just stop ive never had anything tie me up like this instant attraction i said i believe in it and i do but ive never felt it before i have to think about it why it was a simple matter to reach out grab her by the wrists and tug her forward against him why not just act on it when you know itll feel good your pulse is jumping his thumbs skimmed over her wrist i like feeling it leap like that seeing your eyes go cloudy and dark why dont you kiss me this time and see what happens next im not as good at it as you are now he laughed jesus woman youre quite the package let me decide for myself if youre good at it or not come on and kiss me jude whatever happens next is up to you she wanted to wanted to feel his mouth against hers again the shape and texture and flavor of it just now his lips were curved and the light of fun was in his eyes fun she thought why couldnt it just be fun with his fingers still lightly braceleting her wrists she leaned toward him and he watched her she rose onto her toes still his eyes stayed on hers tilting her head just slightly she eased up to brush her lips over his do it again why dont you so she did mesmerized when his eyes stayed open compelling hers to do the same she lingered longer this time brushing left then right fascinating experimenting she scraped her teeth lightly over his bottom lip and heard her own quiet sound of pleasure as from a great distance his eyes were so blue as vivid as the water that stretched to the horizon it seemed her world turned that single marvelous color her heart began to pound her vision to blur as it had that first time at maudes grave she said his name just one sigh then threw her arms around him the jolt rocked him to the soles of his feet the sudden heat the abrupt burst of power that whipped out of her and snaked around him like rope his hands streaked up over her hips her back into her hair to grip hard and fast the kiss changed from a coy brush and nibble to a wild war of tongues and teeth and lips where body strained to body and pulse thundered against pulse in that warm cascade of sensation she lost herself or perhaps she found the jude that had been trapped inside her like a voice locked in a silver box later she would swear she heard the stones sing she buried her face in the curve of his neck and gulped in the scent of him like water this is too fast even as she said it she locked her arms around him i cant breathe i cant think i cant believe whats going on inside my body he gave a weak laugh and nuzzled her hair if its anything to whats going on inside mine were likely to explode any second here darling we could be back at the cottage in minutes and id have you in bed in the blink of an eye i promise you wed both feel a good deal better for it im sure youre right but i cant go quite that fast or you wouldnt be jude though it cost him he drew her back to study her face more than pretty he thought now but solid as well why was it he wondered she didnt seem to know just how pretty or just how solid she was because she didnt more time and more care were needed and i like jude as ive said before you need some courting she couldnt say if she was stunned amused or insulted i certainly dont oh but you do you want flowers and words and stolen kisses and walks in soft weather its romance jude frances wants and im the one to give it to you well now look at that face he caught her by the chin as an adult might a sulky child and she decided insult won youre pouting now i certainly am not she would have jerked her face free but he tightened his grip then leaned down and kissed her firm on the mouth im the one whos looking at you sweetheart and if thats not a fine pout im a scotsman its that youre thinking im making fun of you but im not or not much anyway whats wrong with romance then id like some myself his voice went warm and rich like whiskey by the fire will you give me long looks and warm smiles from across the room and the brush of your hand on my arm a hot desperate kiss in the shadows a touch he skimmed his fingertips over the curve of her breast and all but stopped her heart in secret i didnt come here looking for romance hadnt she he thought with her myths and legends and tales looking or not youll have it on that score his mind was made up and when i make love with you the first time itll be long and slow and sweet thats a promise walk back with me now before the way youre looking at me makes me break that promise as soon as ive made it you just want to be in charge in control of the situation he took her hand again in the friendliest and most annoying of manners i suppose im accustomed to being so but if you want to take over and seduce me darling jude i can promise to be weak and willing she laughed damn it before she could stop herself im sure we both have work to do but youll come see me he continued as they walked youll sit and have a glass of wine in my pub so i can look at you and suffer god youre irish she whispered to the bone he lifted her hand and nipped her knuckle and jude by the way youre damn good at kissing hmmm was the safest response she could think of but she went to the pub and sat and listened to stories over the next days as spring took a firmer hold on ardmore jude could often be found at the pub for an hour or two in the evening or the afternoon she listened recorded took notes and as the word spread others with stories came to tell them or to be entertained by them she filled tapes and reams of pages and dutifully transcribed and analyzed them at her computer while she sipped at what was becoming her habitual cup of tea if sometimes she dreamed herself into the stories of romance and magic she thought it harmless enough even useful if she stretched things a bit after all she could understand the meanings and the motives all the better if the stories and the actions in them became more personal it wasnt as if she was going to waste time actually writing it that way an academic paper had no room for fancies or fantasies she was only exploring until she found the core of her thesis then shed tidy up the language and delete the ramblings what the hell are you going to do with it jude she asked herself what do you really think youre going to do even if you polish and perfect and hammer it until its dry as dust try to have it published in some professional journal absolutely no one reads for pleasure use it to try to kick off a lecture tour oh the idea of that happening however remote the possibility felt like an entire troop of boy scouts tying knots in her stomach for an instant she nearly buried her face in her hands and gave in to despair nothing was ever going to come of this paper this project it was selfdefeating to believe differently no one was ever going to stand around at a faculty function and discuss the insights and interests of jude f murrays paper worse she didnt want them to it was no more than a kind of therapy a way to pull her back from the edge of a crisis she couldnt even identify what good had all those years of study and work accomplished if she couldnt even find the right terms for her own crises poor selfesteem bruised ego a lack of belief in her own femininity career dissatisfaction but what was under all of that really under it blurred identity she mused maybe that was part of it shed lost herself somewhere along the line until whatever was left whatever shed been able to recognize had been so pale so unattractive that shed run from it to what here she thought and was more than a little surprised to realize that her fingers were racing over the keyboard her thoughts were speeding out of her head and onto the page ran here and here i feel somehow more real certainly more at home than i ever did in the house william and i bought or the condo i moved into after hed grown tired of me certainly more at home than in the classroom oh god oh god i hated the classroom why couldnt i ever admit it just say it out loud i dont want to do this dont want to be this i want something else nearly anything else would do how did i become such a coward and worse so pitifully boring why do i even now with no one to answer to but myself question this project when it pleases me so much when it gives me such satisfaction cant i just for this little piece of time indulge myself with something that doesnt have any solid guaranteedpractical purpose or goal if its therapy its time i let it work its not doing any harm in fact i think i hope its doing me some good i feel attracted to the writing thats an odd term to use but it fits writing attracts me the mystery of it the way words fit together on a page to make an image or a point or just to be there sounding seeing my own words on the page is thrilling theres a wonderful kind of conceit in reading them knowing theyre mine part of that terrifies me because its so incredibly exciting for so much of my life ive turned away backed away hidden away from anything thats frightening even when it is thrilling as well i want to feel substantial again i yearn for confidence and under it all i have a deep and nearly crushedout delight in the fantastic how it was nearly crushed and by whom isnt really important not now that i find the glimmer of its still there inside me enough of a glimmer for me to be able to write at least in secret that i want to believe in the legends in the myths in the faeries and the ghosts what harm is there in that it cant possibly hurt me no she thought leaning back again resting her hands in her lap of course it cant hurt me its harmless and it makes me wonder its been too long since i really let myself wonder letting out a long breath she closed her eyes and felt nothing but the sweetness of relief im so glad i came here she said aloud she rose to look out the window satisfied that shed used her writing to fight off the threat of despair her days here nights here were soothing some threatening storm inside her these little moments of joy were precious she turned away from the window wanting the air and the outdoors there she would ponder the other aspect of her new life aidan gallagher she thought gorgeous somehow exotic and inexplicably interested in solid sensible jude f murray talk about the fantastic perhaps the time spent with aidan wasnt quite so soothing she admitted though she was careful enough to arrange things so they were never alone still the lack of privacy didnt stop him from flirting from indulging himself in those long looks hed spoken of or the slow secret smiles the lazy brush of a hand over her arm her hair her cheek and what was wrong with that she asked herself as she carried a fresh bouquet of flowers over the hill to maudes grave every woman was entitled to a flirtation maybe unlike the blossoms in her hand she was a slow bloomer but better late than never she badly wanted to bloom the idea of it was as thrilling as frightening as exciting as writing wasnt it wonderful to discover that she liked being flirted with being looked at as if she was pretty and desirable for gods sake if she stayed in ireland the full six months shed be thirty before she saw chicago again so it was high time she felt pretty wasnt it her own husband had never flirted with her and if memory served his highest compliment on her appearance had been telling her she looked quite nice a woman doesnt want to be told she looks nice jude muttered as she sat down beside maudes grave she wants to be told shes beautiful sexy that she looks outrageous it doesnt matter if its not true she sighed and laid the flowers against the headstone because for the moment when the words are said and the words are heard its perfect truth then may i say youre as lovely as the flowers you carry on this fine day jude frances she looked up quickly and into the bold blue eyes of the man shed met once before in this same spot eyes she thought uneasily that she so often saw in dreams you move quietly its a place for a quiet step he crouched down with the soft grass and bright flowers adorning maudes grave between them the water of the ancient well murmured like a pagan chant and how are you faring in faerie hill cottage very well do you have family here his bright eyes clouded as they skimmed over the stones and high grass i have those i remember and who remember me i once loved a maid and would have offered her everything i had but i forgot to offer her my heart first and last forgot to give her the words when he looked up his expression was more quizzical than confident words are important to a woman arent they words are important to everyone when theyre not said they leave holes deep dark holes jude thought now where doubts and failures breed unsaid words were as painful as slaps ah but if the man youd married had said them to you you wouldnt be here today would you now when she blinked at him in shock he only smirked he wouldnt have meant them so they would have just been convenient lies you already know he wasnt the one for you a little lick of fear worked up her spine no not fear she realized breathless a thrill how do you know about william i know about this and i know about that he smiled again easily i wonder why you take upon yourself the blame for something that wasnt your doing but then women have always been a charming puzzle to me she supposed her grandmother had spoken to maude and maude to this man though she didnt care for the fact that her personal life and embarrassments had been discussed over the teapot by strangers i cant imagine that my marriage and its failure is of particular interest to you if the cold chill in her voice affected him his breezy shrug didnt show it well ive always been a selfish sort and in the long scheme of things what youve done and do may have bearing on what i most want but i apologize if ive offended you as i said women are puzzles to me i suppose it doesnt matter it does as long as you let it i wonder if you would answer a question for me depends on the question it seems a simple one to me but again its a womans perspective im wanting would you tell me jude if youd rather a handful of jewels such as this he turned over an elegant hand and mounded in it was the blinding brilliance of diamonds and sapphires the aching gleam of creamy pearls my god how would you take them as theyre offered from the man who knows he holds your heart or would you rather the words dazzled she lifted her head the fire and spark still sheened her vision but she saw how dark how fiercely intent was his gaze as he studied her she said the first thing that came into her head because it seemed the only thing what are the words and he sighed long and deep his proud shoulders slumping his eyes going soft and sad so its true then they matter so much and these he opened his fingers and let the shimmer the fire the glow of the stones sift through and sprinkle over the grave are nothing but pride she watched her breath coming short her head going light as the jewels melted into puddles of color and those puddles sprang into simple young flowers im dreaming she said softly while her head reeled ive fallen asleep youre awake if youll let yourself be he spoke sharply now with an impatience ripe and ready look beyond your nose for a change woman and listen magic is but its power is nothing beside love its a hard lesson ive learned and a long time its taken me to learn it dont make the same mistake more than your own heart lies on the line now he got to his feet while she stood frozen on his hand the stone he wore shot sparks and it seemed his skin began to glow finn save me ive to depend on a mortal to begin it all and a yank at that magic is he said again so look at it and deal with it he shot her one last look of smoldering impatience lifted both hands toward the sky in a sweeping gesture of drama and vanished into the air dreaming she thought giddily as she staggered to her feet hallucinating it was all the time she was spending listening to fairy tales all the time she spent alone in the cottage reviewing them shed told herself they were harmless but obviously theyd pushed her over some edge she stared down at the grave the new flowers in their colorful dance over the mound when a flash caught her eye she bent down reached carefully among the pretty petals and plucked out a diamond as big as a quarter real she thought struggling to steady her breathing she could see it feel the shape and the cold heat it held inside she was either crazy or shed just had her second conversation with carrick prince of the faeries shivering she rubbed her free hand over her face okay either way she was crazy then why did she feel so damn good she walked slowly fingering the priceless jewel as a child might a pretty stone she needed to write it all down she decided carefully concisely exactly how hed looked what hed said what had happened and after that she would try to get some sort of perspective on it she was an educated woman surely she would find a way to make sense of it all when she came down the slope toward her cottage she saw the little blue car in the drive and darcy gallagher just getting out darcy was wearing jeans and a bright red sweater her hair tumbled down her back like wild black silk one glance had jude sighing with envy even as she cautiously tucked the diamond into the pocket of her slacks to once she thought just once look that carelessly gorgeous that absolutely confident she fingered the jewel absently and thought it would be worth the price of diamonds darcy spotted her and shaded her eyes with the flat of one hand while she waved with the other there you are out for a walk are you its a fine day for it even if theyre calling for rain tonight ive been visiting maude and i talked to a faerie prince who left me a diamond that could probably buy a small third world country before he vanished into thin air with a weak smile jude decided shed keep that little bit of information to herself i just went a couple rounds with shawn and took a drive to cool off darcy skimmed her gaze over judes shoes casually she hoped to try to gauge how close in size they were to what she wore herself the woman darcy thought had fabulous taste in shoes youre looking a bit pale she noted when jude walked closer are you all right yes im fine selfconsciously she pushed at her hair the breeze had teased strands out of the band which she thought would make her look unkempt rather than wonderfully tousled like darcy why dont we go in and have some tea oh that would be nice but ive got to get back aidanll already be cursing me she smiled then a dazzle of charm maybe youd like to come back with me for a time and then hed be distracted with you and forget to skin my ass for walking out well i no she thought she didnt think she was up to dealing with aidan gallagher when her head was already light i really should work i have notes to go over darcy pursed her lips you really enjoy it dont you working yes surprise surprise jude thought i enjoy the work im doing now very much if it was me id find any excuse in the world to avoid working her brilliant gaze scanned the cottage the gardens the long roll of hill and id die of loneliness out here all by myself oh no its wonderful the quiet the view everything darcy shrugged a quick gesture of discontent but then youve got chicago to go back to judes smile faded yes i have chicago to go back to im going to see it one day darcy leaned back against her car all the big cities in america all the big cities everywhere and when i do ill be going first class make no mistake then she laughed and shook her head but for now id best be getting back before aidan devises some hideous punishment for me i hope youll come back when you have more time darcy shot her that dazzling look again as she climbed into her car ive the night off thank the lord ill come by with brenna later and well see what kind of trouble we can get you in you make me think you could use a bit of trouble jude opened her mouth without a clue how to respond but was saved the trouble when darcy gunned the motor and shot out into the road with scarcely more care than brenna took chapter nine contents prev next there are three maids jude wrote as she nibbled on a shortbread biscuit and each represents some particular facet of traditionally held views of womanhood in some tales two are wicked and one good as in the cinderella myth in others the three are blood sisters or fast friends poor and orphaned or caring for one sickly parent some variations have one or more of the female characters possessing mystical powers in nearly all the maidens are beautiful beyond description virtue ie virginity is vital indicating that innocence of physical sexuality is an essential ingredient to the building of legend innocence a quest monetary poverty physical beauty these elements repeat themselves in a number of perpetuated tales that become over generations legends the interference for good or ill of beings from the otherworld so to speak is another common element the mortal or mortals in the story have a moral lesson to learn or a reward to glean from their selfless behavior almost as often simple beauty and innocence are equally rewarded jude sat back and closed her eyes she struck out there didnt she since she wasnt beautiful or innocent had no particular power or skill it didnt look like she was going to be whisked away into a fairy tale with a happy ending not that she wanted to be the mere idea of coming facetoface with the inhabitants of a faerie hill or a sky castle or a witch wicked or otherwise made her shaky shaky enough she admitted to imagine jewels turning into flowers warily she slipped her hand into her pocket and pulled the bright stone out to examine it yet again just glass she assured herself beautifully faceted certainly sparkling like sunlight but glass it was one thing to accept that she was sharing the cottage with a threehundredyearold ghost that had been leap enough but she could reason that out as there had been studies on that particular phenomenon documentation parapsychology wasnt universally accepted but some very reputable scientists and respected minds believed in the energy forms that laymen called ghosts so she could deal with that she could rationalize what she had seen with her own eyes but elves and faeries and whatever no saying you wanted to believe and stating you did believe were two different matters that was when the indulgence of it all stopped being harmless and became a psychosis there were no handsome faeries wandering the hills visiting graveyards to hold philosophical discussions then becoming annoyed with people who happened by and those nonexistent faeries didnt go around tossing priceless jewels at strange american women since logic didnt seem to apply to the situation she had to assume that her imagination always a bit of a problem had tipped out of control all she had to do was yank it back on track do her work it was very possible shed had some sort of episode a fugue state during which shed incorporated various elements from her research the fact that she felt almost ridiculously healthy didnt enter into it the stress of the past few years could have caught up with her and while her body was fine her mind could be suffering she should go to a good neurologist and have a full workup to rule out a physical problem and visit a reputable jeweler to have the diamond the glass she corrected herself examined the first idea frightened her and the second depressed her so she defied logic and put both notions on hold just for a few days she promised herself she would do the responsible thing but not quite yet all she wanted to do was work to pour herself into the stories and she would resist the urge to wander down to the pub to spend the evening pretending not to watch aidan gallagher shed stay at home with her papers and notes then drive into dublin in a few days and find both jeweler and doctor shed shop buy books do a bit of sightseeing one solid evening of work she told herself after that she would take a few days to explore the countryside and the cities the villages and the hills shed take a logical step back from the stories she was gathering and studying and that would help her with her own perspective before she went to dublin at the knock on the front door her fingers fumbled on the keys of the computer and her heart jumped aidan was her first thought and that alone irritated her of course it wasnt aidan she told herself even as she dashed to the mirror to check her hair it was well after eight and hed be busy at the pub still when she hurried downstairs to answer her heart was beating just a little fast she opened the door and barely had time to blink we brought food brenna strolled in a brown grocery sack propped on her hip biscuits and crisps and chocolate and best of all wine darcy clinked the three bottles she carried as she casually booted the door closed behind her oh well jude hadnt taken darcy seriously hadnt been able to think of a reason either she or brenna would want to come over but they were already heading toward the kitchen in a flurry of movement and chatter aidan tried to have me work another shift tonight to make up for walking out today i told him to bugger it darcy said cheerfully as she set the wine on the counter the mand have me chained to the taps if i wasnt fast on my feet well need a corkscrew theres one in the got it brenna interrupted and simply shot a quick grin at jude as she plucked it out of the drawer you shouldve seen the black looks aidan sent us when we left the pub why cant you fetch her down and drink here he wants to know grumbling and muttering all the while then he sees im taking three bottles darcy continued rooting out glasses while brenna opened the wine and hes blathering on about how jude frances doesnt have much of a head for spirits and were not to get you sick like you were some puppy we were going to give too many table scraps to on the sly men are such peabrains now thats a fine thing to drink to first off with a flourish brenna poured three glasses to the tiny brains of the male of the species she stated thrusting a glass at jude and lifting her own bless them every one darcy added and drank then her eyes sparkled brilliantly at jude whod done little more than stare drink up darling then well sit around and discuss the highs and lows of our sex lives just to get better acquainted jude took one long gulp blew out a breath i wont have a great deal to contribute to that area of discussion darcy laughed a throaty sound of amusement aidans after changing all that now isnt he jude opened her mouth shut it again then decided the best thing to do with it was drink after all dont tease her so darcy brenna ripped open the bag of potato chips and dug in then winked well get her drunk first then pry it all out of her when shes drunk im going to talk her into letting me try on all her clothes they were talking so fast jude couldnt keep up my clothes youve wonderful clothes darcy dropped into a chair were not that far from coloring and size so im thinking some may fit me well enough what size shoe do you wear shoe jude looked down blankly at the half boots she wore um seven and a half medium thats american sizing let me think darcy shrugged sipped well close enough take those off and let me see how they work on me take my shoes off your shoes jude darcys eyes twinkled as she slipped off her own a couple more drinks and well try on the trousers you may as well brenna advised around another mouthful of potato chips shes a demon about clothes our darcy and shell hound you to death about it feeling as mystified as she had by maudes graveside that afternoon jude sat and took off her shoes oh darcy stroked the boot like an indulgent mother her childs cheek theyre like butter arent they she looked up her face stunning and filled with sheer female delight this is going to be fun so he has it in his head that because i let him take me to dinner a time or two and let him stick his tongue in my mouth which was not nearly as exciting as he thought it was that id be pleased and proud to strip naked and let him bounce on me sex is a fine pastime darcy continued as she licked chocolate from her fingers but half the time or more youre better off just painting your nails and watching the telly maybe its the men you let lap at you brenna gestured with her wineglass theyre all so dazzled they end up fumbling what you need darcy my girl is a man whos as bonedeep cynical and selfabsorbed and vain as you are yourself jude choked on her wine certain the insult would cause an argument but darcy merely smiled craftily and when i find him and providing hes rich as midas ill wrap him tidily around this finger here she held up her right index finger and allow him to treat me like a queen brenna snorted reached for more chips and the moment he does hell bore you to tears darcys a perverse creature she told jude thats what we love about her now me im a simple straightforward sort im after a man wholl look me straight in the eye see what and who i am she drank snickered then fall to his knees and promise me everything they never see what you are shocked jude glanced around to see whod spoken then realized she had dont they brenna wanted to know lifting her brow as she topped off judes glass yet again they see a reflection of their own perception whore or angel mother or child depending on their view theyre compelled to protect or conquer or exploit or youre a convenience she murmured easily discarded and you say im cynical darcy said with a smirk for brenna have you been discarded then jude there was a pleasant buzz in her blood a lovely spin in her head the logical part of her said it was the wine but the heart of her the needy heart said it was the company girls shed never had a foolish girl night in her life she picked up a chip examined it nibbled sighed three years ago next june i was married married both brenna and darcy leaned closer seven months later he came home and calmly told me he was very sorry but he was in love with someone else he thought it best for all parties involved if he moved out that night and we filed for divorce immediately why the cad in sympathy brenna poured wine all around the bastard not really he was honest about it fuck honesty i hope you skinned him darcys eyes sparkled with malice hardly more than six months into marriage and hes in love with someone else the snake barely waited long enough to change the sheets on the marriage bed what did you do about it do judes brows drew together i filed for divorce the next day and took him for everything he had no of course not sincerely shocked at the notion she gaped at darcy we just each took what was ours it was very civilized because darcy appeared to have been struck speechless brenna took up the torch if youre asking me civilized divorces are why there are so many bloody marriages that end in it me id rather a good fight screaming and broken crockery fists flying if i loved a man enough to vow to be part of him for life id damn well make him pay in blood and flesh if he threw me over i didnt love him the minute the words were out judes mouth dropped open i mean i dont know if i loved him my god thats just awful thats horrible i just realized it i have no idea if i loved william at all well i say he was a bastard and you should have kicked his ass then set it out for the dogs love or not darcy selected one of mollie otooles homemade brownies and bit into it with gusto i promise you this in fact i take an oath on it here and now whatever man im with whenever im with him itll be me who ends it and if he should try to close it off before im ready hell pay for it the rest of his days men dont leave women like you jude put in youre the kind of woman they leave me for she caught her breath i didnt mean i only meant dont worry yourself i think there was a compliment in there and being more pleased than offended darcy patted judes arm and im also thinking if your tongues that loose youve had enough wine that youll let me play with your clothes lets take all this upstairs jude didnt know what to make of it perhaps it was because shed never had any sisters to casually raid her closet none of her friends had shown particular interest in her wardrobe other than the usual comments on a new jacket or suit shed never considered herself especially fashionwise and tended to lean toward classic lines and good fabrics but from the muffled sounds coming from where darcys head was buried in the armoire judes wardrobe had taken on the sheen of aladdins treasure oh just look at this jumper its cashmere darcy yanked out a huntergreen turtleneck and pleasured herself by rubbing it against her cheek its a good layering piece jude began then watched openmouthed as darcy stripped off her own sweater might as well make yourself comfortable brenna stretched out on the bed crossed her ankles and sipped her wine shell be a while at this soft as a babys bum darcy all but cooed as she posed in front of the mirror gorgeous but the colors a bit deep for me more you im thinking brenna cheerfully she stripped it off and tossed it on the bed give it a look absently brenna fingered the sleeve of the sweater got a nice feel to it lowering herself to the bed jude watched darcy try on a creamcolored silk blouse ah theres more in the other bedroom darcys head came up like a wolf scenting sheep more yes um lighterweight clothes and a couple of cocktail things i brought along in case be right back now youve done it brenna spoke in dire tones as darcy dashed out of the room youll never be rid of her now setting her wine aside she flipped open the buttons of her shirt as a delighted squeal was emitted from the next room brenna rolled her eyes and tugged the sweater over her head oh this is lovely surprised by the pleasure the soft wool brought to her skin brenna got up to take a look in the mirror the way it fits it almost looks as if i have tits you have a wonderful figure though shed never be accused of vanity brenna twisted and turned in the mirror be nice to have breasts though my sister maureen got mine i think i should have had the breasts by right as the oldest you need a decent bra darcy claimed as she came back in a black cocktail dress and carrying a heap of clothes make use of what god gave you instead of letting it flop about jude this dress is brilliant but you really need to whack an inch or two off the hem im taller than you hardly a bit here put it on and lets have a look well i but darcy was already wriggling out of it faced with a woman holding out a little black number while dressed in bra and panties jude took the dress she took a deep gulp to swallow her modesty and stripped i knew you had good legs darcy said with a nod of approval why are you after hiding them in a dress like this needs a good inch off dont you think brenna still half naked darcy knelt down and folded up the hem pursing her lips as she studied the result inch and a half and you wear it with those spiky black shoes with the open toes youll be a killer she nodded then got up to try on a pair of gray pipestem trousers just put the dress over there and ill hem it for you oh really you dont have to as payment darcy said with a wicked gleam for you letting me borrow your clothes darcys a fine hand with a needle brenna assured her you dont have to worry getting into the spirit she found a charcoal blazer and topped the sweater with it try this vest to jazz it up jude suggested and dug out one with tiny checks in green and burgundy youve a good eye darcy beamed approval and added to it by giving jude a quick onearmed hug now brenna you finish that with a really short excuse for a skirt and menll be falling all over you i dont want them falling all over me you just have to boot them out of the way again when enough of them fall you just climb over their prone bodies and go on to the next darcy found a suit in slate blue and wiggled into the skirt you are going to give aidan a tumble arent you jude a tumble skirt needs to be lifted here too a tumble she continued you havent slept with him yet have you i she stepped back to pick up her wine again no no i havent didnt think so darcy swiveled to check the line of the jacket from the back figured youd have more a gleam in your eye if youd wrestled with him experimenting she scooped her hair up turning this way and that and imagined borrowing those pretty silver dangles shed seen jude wear on her ears youre going to sleep with him arent you darcy you twit youre embarrassing her why darcy let her hair fall so she could choose from two pairs of bonecolored heels were all of us female and none of us virgins nothing wrong with sex is there jude dont blush jude ordered herself you will not blush no of course not aidans supposed to be damn good at it too she laughed when jude gulped down more wine so when you do the deed with him brenna and i would appreciate some of the details as at the moment neither of us has a particular man were after tumbling with ourselves talking about sex is the next best thing to having it brenna spotted a striped shirt in the armoir and pulled it out of the three of us you look most likely to be having it in the foreseeable future the closest ive come in nearly a year is when i had to punch jack brennan for copping a feel last new years eve and im still not sure he wasnt just reaching for another pint as he claimed to be discarding the shirt she sat down in her underwear and poured more wine i for one know when a mans reaching for me or for his beer darcy cocked her head in the mirror she looked rather elegant she thought like a lady who had lovely places to go and wonderful things to do what do you wear a suit like this for jude oh for meetings lectures luncheons luncheons darcy sighed and did a slow turn in some fancy restaurant or ballroom with waiters in white jackets and this weeks miserable chicken surprise jude answered with a smile along with the most tedious luncheon speaker the committee could dig up thats just because youre used to them so used to them id live happily with the knowledge i never have to attend another i was a poor academic were you now brenna topped off judes wine before reclaiming her own sweater terrible i hated planning courses having to know the answers and judging papers on top of that the politics and the protocol then why did you do it distracted jude glanced back at darcy the woman was so confident jude thought so completely comfortable with herself even as she stood there in a cotton bra and another womans skirt how could anyone so sure of who and what she was understand what it was not to know just not to know it was expected jude said at length and did you always do what was expected jude let out a long breath and picked up her wine again im afraid so well now swept along by affection darcy grabbed judes face in her hand and kissed her well fix that by the time the second bottle of wine was emptied the bedroom was a disaster brenna had the wit to start a fire then to hunt up cheese and biscuits she sat on the floor vaguely disappointed that judes shoes were too big for her not that she had any place to wear them but they were awfully smart jude lay sprawled on the bed her head propped on her fists as she watched darcy try on endless variations of outfits the goofy expression on her own face made jude wonder if she were drunk or just soft in the head every now and then she gave a quiet hiccough the first time darcy was saying was with declan omalley and we swore we would love each other ever and a day we were sixteen and fumbling at it we did it on a blanket on the beach one night when we both snuck out of the house and let me tell you theres nothing a bit romantic about rolling around on the sand even when you are sixteen and stupid as a turnip i think its sweet jude said dreamily imagining the moonlight and the crash of waves and two young bodies gleaming with love and discovery what happened to declan omalley well forever and a day lasted about three months for the pair of us and we went on to other things two years back he got jenny duffy in trouble so they married and have a second daughter to go with the first and seem happy enough id like to have children jude rolled over to find her wine it had begun to taste like ambrosia when william and i discussed it discussed it did you brenna put in and as guardian of the bottle took judes glass to refill it oh yes in a very logical practical and civilized manner william was always civilized i think william needed a boot in the arse brenna handed the glass back ducking so the wine that slopped as jude laughed missed splashing on her hair his students call him dour powers thats his name william powers of course being a modern professional woman i kept my own name so i didnt have all that fuss with the divorce anyway what was i saying how civilized dour powers is oh yes william decided that wed wait five to seven years then if circumstances were acceptable we would discuss having a child again if we decided to go ahead with it we would research and choose the proper day care preschool facilities and once we knew the sex of the child wed determine which educational plan to put into action straight up to college college darcy turned before the babys born william was very forwardthinking for a man with his head up his bum hes probably not as bad as im making him out to be jude frowned into her wine probably hes much happier with allyson to her shock tears sprang to her eyes he just wasnt happy married to me the bastard swamped with sympathy darcy abandoned the closet and sat on the bed to wrap an arm around judes shoulders he didnt deserve you not for a bloody minute brenna agreed patting judes knee stuffy stubnosed philandering bastard youre a hundred times better than any allyson shes blond jude said with a sniffle and has legs up to her ears blond from a bottle ill wager darcy said staunchly and you have wonderful legs gorgeous legs i cant keep me eyes off them really jude swiped a hand under her nose theyre fabulous brenna gave judes calf a bolstering stroke hes probably going to bed each night steeped in regret for losing you oh hell jude exploded he was a boring son of a bitch allysons welcome to him he probably cant even get her off said darcy and jude snorted with glee well i certainly never heard the angels sing this is great she rubbed the heels of her hands over her face to dry it i never had friends to come over and get drunk and toss my clothes around before you can count on us darcy gave her a hard squeeze sometime during the third bottle of wine jude told them about what shed seen thought shed seen in the old cemetery it comes down through the blood darcy said with a knowing nod old maude had the sight and its often she talked to the good people oh come on darcy only lifted one elegant brow at judes comment and this from the woman whos just described two meetings with a faerie prince i never said that i said i met this odd man twice or thought i did im afraid i have a brain tumor brenna grimaced at the very idea nonsense youre healthy as a horse if not that if theres no physical cause then im just crazy im a psychologist she reminded them well i was one a mediocre one but still i have enough training to recognize the symptoms of a serious mental disfunction why should that be brenna demanded as far as i can tell youre the most sensible of women my ma thinks because of that and your ladylike manner youll be good for me cheerfully brenna gave jude a light punch on the shoulder and despite that i like you anyway you really do dont you of course i do and so does darcy and not just for your fine clothes of course i dont just like our jude for her clothes darcys tone radiated insult at the very idea i like her for her baubles too with that she collapsed in laughter im joking sure we like you jude youre fun to be with and a wonderful puzzle to listen to half the time thats so nice her eyes welled up again its so nice to have friends especially when youre either dying of brain cancer or acting like a raving lunatic youre neither you saw carrick of the faeries brenna announced wandering the hills above his raft until lady gwen joins him do you really believe that it seemed possible now in a way it hadnt a way she hadnt let it only a few hours before believe in faerie forts and ghosts and spells that last centuries youre not just saying that to make me feel better im not no wrapped in judes thick robe brenna dipped into what was left of the chocolate i believe in lots of things until its proved otherwise so far as i know no ones ever proved there absolutely arent faerie forts under the hills hereabouts and people say there are more often than not yes even blurred by wine judes enthusiasm was ripe as she slapped brenna on the shoulder exactly my point legends are perpetuated and often take on the sheen of truth by the repetition arthur of history becomes arthur of legend with additions of magic swords and merlin vlad the destroyer becomes a vampire the wise women the healers of villages become witches and so on the human tendency to expound to extrapolate to garnish with fantasy to make a tale more entertaining in turn makes the tale a legend that certain groups then take into their culture as fact just listen to her she sure talks fancy and fine darcy delighted to be wearing one of the cashmere sweaters pursed her lips in thought and im sure jude darling theres something in what you just said thats profound and miraculous even for one who claims to have been a mediocre psychologist but it sounds like bullshit to me at the moment did you or did you not see carrick of the faeries this very day i saw someone he didnt tell me his name and did this someone vanish into the air before your very eyes jude scowled it seemed he did but no no buts just the facts thats how its done isnt it logically speaking if he talked to you he wants something from you as i havent heard of him talking to anyone but old maude in my lifetime have you brenna no i cant say as i have were you frightened of him jude no of course not thats good then i think youd know if he meant to cause you harm or mischief i think hes just lonely and wanting his lady beside him three hundred years she said longingly its a kind of comfort to know love can last youre such a romantic brenna darcy yawned and curled up in a chair love lasts easy as long as theres yearning put the two of them together and its just as like theyd be sniping and snarling at each other in six months time youve just never had a man courageous enough to take a good hold of your heart darcy shrugged and snuggled down and i dont intend to ever give one the chance holding theirs keeps you on top of things let them get a grip on yours and youre sunk i think id like to be in love judes eyes drifted shut even if it hurt you couldnt feel ordinary if you were in love could you no but you can surely feel stupid brenna muttered and jude laughed lightly as she slipped into sleep chapter ten contents prev next tiny dancers wearing sturdy clogs were doing a brisk steptoe inside judes head when she woke she could count the beats each little shufflestompkick against her temples it was more baffling than unpleasant and her eyes twitched as she cautiously opened them hissed at the light closed then much more cautiously slitted them open again clothes were everywhere at first she thought thered been some sort of violent storm a kind of dorothy out of oz tornado that had swooped in and swirled her things every which way around the room that would have explained why she was lying crosswise half naked and facedown on the bed at a soft snuffling sound beneath the bed she caught her breath then it came fast she imagined rodents at best at worst she was sure it was one of those maniacal little dolls that come to life and carry knives and like to slash at peoples hands and feet if theyre unwary enough to let them hang over the bed at night shed had nightmares about those hideous dolls since childhood and never ever let any part of her hang over the bed just in case whatever was down there she was alone with it and had to defend herself fortunately there happened to be a navy suede pump on her pillow without questioning the why of that jude gripped the shoe like a weapon and steadied herself with gritted teeth she crawled closer to the edge of the bed peered over and prepared to do what had to be done brenna was on the floor wrapped like a mummy in judes thick robe with her head pillowed on a stack of sweaters and an empty wine bottle at her feet jude stared squeezed her eyes tightly shut then popped them open to stare again the evidence was there she thought it was irrefutable wine bottles glasses empty bowls scattered clothes she hadnt been invaded by rodents or evil dolls she had hosted a drunken party the snicker snuck up on her and she quick had to bury her face in the tangled sheets for fear of waking brenna up and then having to explain why she was hanging over the bed and laughing like a loon oh wouldnt her friends relations and associates be shocked if they could see the morningafter here holding her aching stomach she rolled over and stared happily at the ceiling the entertaining shed done in chicago had always involved scrupulously planned dinners or gettogethers with the background music as carefully selected as the proper wine and if anyone had one too many it was always dealt with discreetly the hostess never passed out on the bed no indeed but graciously saw each of her guests to the door then responsibly tidied up the disarray shed never had anyone curl up to sleep on her floor and shed never awakened the next morning with what was surely a hangover she liked it she liked it so much that she wanted to write about it in her journal right away she climbed out of bed wincing then grinning when her head pounded her very first hangover it was marvelous she tiptoed out thrilled at the thought of noting it all down in her journal then shed have a shower and make coffee make a huge breakfast for her guests guests she remembered abruptly where in the world was darcy jude had her answer the minute she stepped into her little office the lump under the covers on the little bed was bound to be darcy which meant the journal entry would have to wait a bit longer no matter jude thought amused and delighted that her new friends had felt at home enough to settle in for the night despite her aching head she all but danced into the shower it had been the best night of her life she didnt care how pathetic that sounded she thought as she ducked her head under the hot spray it had been wonderful the talk and the laughter the foolishness these two interesting women had come to her enjoyed her made her feel part of what they had together a friendship just as easy as that and none of it had hinged on where shed gone to school what she did for a living where shed grown up it was all about who she was what she had to say how she felt and not a little to do with her wardrobe she added with a giggle but her clothes were a reflection of who she was werent they at least a reflection of how she saw herself and why shouldnt she be flattered that a beautiful woman like darcy gallagher admired her clothes still smiling she stepped out to dry off then took a couple of aspirin out of the medicine cabinet she wrapped the towel around her figuring she could find something to wear just by cruising her bedroom floor then with her hair a dripping mass of curls she stepped out into the hall her first shriek could have cracked glass it certainly scored her throat and caused her abused head to reel the second came out more like a yip as she clutched at the towel and gaped at aidan sorry to startle you darling but i did knock front and back before letting myself in i was i was in the shower so i see and what a treat for the eyes she was he decided with her all pink and damp and her hair dripping in wet ropes about her shoulders a dense glossy brown it was against that pink and white skin it took all a mans will not to just step forward and take a bite somewhere you you cant just come in well the back door was unlocked as back doors usually are hereabouts he continued to smile to look directly into her eyes though it was tempting more than tempting to let his gaze go wandering and i saw brennas lorry parked in your street so i figured she and darcy were still here they are still here arent they yes but i need to fetch darcy she has the lunch shift today and she tends to forget such matters were not dressed ive seen that for myself darling and ive tried not to comment on it overly but since you mention it id like to say youre looking lovely this morning fresh as a rose and he stepped a little closer and sniffed at her twice as fragrant hows a body to sleep with all that yammering going on jude jolted as brennas voice erupted from the bedroom kiss her for sweet christs sake aidan and stop talking her ear off well now i was working my way along to it no the squeal was so foolish jude immediately wished to be buried alive the best she could do was dash to the bedroom and snatch up a sweater before shed pushed her way through the piles for trousers aidan had come in behind her mother of god what secret female ritual results in this jesus aidan put a cork in it will you me heads falling off me shoulders he crouched down beside the tangle of red hair you know wine gives you a bad head lass if you overindulge there wasnt any beer brenna muttered then whats a body to do after all i brought along the gallagher fix did you she rolled turning her white face and bleary eyes up to him and grasping at his hand truly god bless you aidan the mans a saint jude a saint i tell you there should be a monument to him in the square of ardmore when you get yourself on your feet crawl down to the kitchen i brought a jug along just in case he gave brenna a light kiss on the forehead now wheres my sister shes in my office the second bedroom jude told him with what she hoped was cool dignity as she clutched the clothes to her breast is there much breakable in there i beg your pardon aidan straightened just pay no mind to the screams and crashes ill do my best to keep the property damage to a minimum what does he mean by that jude hissed the question at brenna the moment he was out of the room even as she rushed to drag on the slacks oh brenna yawned hugely just that darcy doesnt wake cheerful at the first scream brenna clutched her head and moaned shocked jude yanked the sweater over her head and rushed toward the sound of the thumps and curses get your hands off me you blackhearted baboon ill kick your ass from here to tuesday its your ass thatll be kicked if you dont get it out of bed and to work my girl if the words and the vicious tone in which they were delivered had shocked her it was nothing to the visual impact jude burst into the room in time to see aidan his face grim and set drag darcy dressed in nothing but her bra and panties from the bed to the floor why you brute stop that this minute driven to protect her new friend jude leaped forward the order and the movement managed to distract aidan just long enough for darcy to ball her fist bare her teeth and deliver a shortarmed punch straight to his crotch jude wasnt sure the sound he made was human torn between yet another layer of shock and a wave of pure female amusement that she wasnt the least bit proud of she watched aidan crumple to his knees and darcy fall on him like a shewolf ouch jesus bloody hell he did what he could to defend himself as his sister thumped yanked and bit exactly as hed taught her and still wheezing from that first blow he finally managed to pin her one of these days darcy alice mary gallagher im going to forget youre a female and plant one on you go ahead you great bully she thrust out her chin blew her hair out of her eyes plant one now id likely break my hand on that face of yours however pretty it is its stretched over a skull made of rock then they were grinning at each other and he was rubbing his hand over her face with what surely was as much affection as exasperation jude just kept staring as they got to their feet put some clothes on you shameless hussy and get in to work darcy pushed at her tumbled hair and didnt seem in the least bothered by the recent tumble jude can i borrow the blue cashmere jumper urn yes of course oh youre a sweetheart you are she danced by giving jude a peck on the cheek dont worry ill tidy up what i can before i go oh well thats all right ill make coffee that would be lovely tea even better if you have it coffee aidan said when darcy had sauntered out the door i think you owe me a cup at least owe you he stepped toward jude thats the second time youve distracted me in battle and caused me to take a blow id have dodged otherwise oh and very well you might bite your cheek to hold back the grin but i see your eyes laughing clear enough im sure youre mistaken jude looked deliberately aside but ill make the coffee and hows your head faring this morning he asked as he followed her out and down the stairs its fine he lifted a brow no ill effects due to squeezing a bit too much of the grape maybe a little headache she was too proud of it to be embarrassed i took some aspirin ive better than that for you he rubbed a hand casually over the back of her neck miraculously hitting just the spot that made her want to purr then moved to the counter as they entered the kitchen the jar he picked up was filled with some dark and dangerouslooking red liquid gallaghers fix itll set you up right and tight it looks awful not a halfbad taste all in all though some say it needs a bit of acquiring he took a glass from the cupboard when a man serves drinks for a living hes honorbound to have a cure for the morning after its only a little headache she studied the glass he poured dubiously then drink only a little and ill fix you some breakfast you will a bit of this a bit of that and a little liemedown he nudged the glass on her she was a bit pale and her eyes were shadowed he wanted to cuddle her until she felt herself again youll wake up forgetting you had a hedonistic orgy last night it wasnt an orgy there werent any men he grinned fast and bright next time invite me here now sip a little and start the coffee and some tea as well ill see to the rest it seemed like a nice connection to the evening to have a handsome man cooking breakfast in her kitchen that was one more thing that had never happened to her before it was amazing she thought just how quickly and how completely a life could change jude sipped carefully found the brew more tolerable than expected drinking the rest she put on the kettle jude youve no sausage youve no bacon the quiet shock in his voice amused her no i dont really eat it dont eat it how do you cook breakfast because the shock wasnt so quiet now she couldnt resist fluttering at him imagine she thought flirting before breakfast usually by putting a piece of whole wheat bread in the toaster and pressing down the little lever a single piece of toast and a half a grapefruit or a cup of whatever fresh fruit i have on hand but now and then i confess i go wild and have an entire bagel with lowfat cream cheese and this is what a sensible person calls breakfast yes a healthy one yanks aidan shook his head as he took out eggs why is it you think youll live forever and why do you want to id like to know when you deny yourselves so many of the basic pleasures in life somehow i manage to get through day after day without gnawing on greasy pig meat a little testy in the morning are we well you wouldnt be if youd eat a proper breakfast but well do what we can for you she turned prepared to snarl at him but with the hand that wasnt holding the eggs he cupped the back of her neck and nudged her up against him then nipped her bottom lip before shed recovered from that he was following up the quick bite with a long soft kiss that drained what few thoughts were left in her head do you have to do that before breakfast brenna complained aye aidan ran that wonderful hand down judes spine then up again and after if i have my way about it bad enough you come in stomping about and waking a body up scowling and wearing the robe shed wrapped herself in the night before brenna headed straight for the jar and poured some gallaghers fix into a glass gulping it down she eyed aidan narrowly are you making breakfast then im about to youre looking a bit peaked this morning mary brenna do you want a kiss as well she sniffed then grinned at him i wouldnt mind it he obliged her by putting the eggs aside and stepping up to lift her off the floor by her elbows when she whooped he planted a loud smacking kiss on her lips there you have it and some roses back in your cheeks as well thats from two punches of a fix by gallagher she said and made him laugh we aim to please is my sister still on her feet shes in the shower and still cursing you as i would be if you werent so free with your kisses if god didnt want a womans lips to be kissed he wouldnt have made them so easy to reach are mere potatoes in the larder jude i think yes free with his kisses shed been warmly entertained watching the easy and affectionate byplay but now she stood worrying about just what free with his kisses meant while aidan scrubbed off some potatoes and put them in a pot to boil did that mean he just went around scooping up women with both hands he certainly had the charm for it the skill for it the looks for it what did it matter they didnt have what anyone would call a relationship she didnt want a relationship not really she just wanted to know if she was one of a pack or if for once she was something more special just once something special to someone where have you gone off dreaming aidan asked her jude jerked back ordered herself not to flush nowhere she busied herself with the coffee and tried not to feel odd when brenna rummaged through the cupboards for plates and flatware shed never had people make themselves so easily at home in her house it surprised her to realize she liked it it made her feel a part of something friendly and simple it didnt matter if brenna was efficient enough to intimidate a wellprogrammed robot it didnt matter if darcy was so beautiful every other woman looked dull by comparison it didnt even matter if aidan kissed a hundred women before breakfast every day of the week somehow within a few short weeks they were her friends and they didnt appear to expect her to be anything but what she was it was a small but precious miracle why dont i smell bacon cooking darcy demanded as she strolled in jude didnt have any aidan told her jude beamed as darcy helped herself to coffee ill get some for next time the feeling stayed with her all day the warmth and quiet joy of it over breakfast she made plans to drive to dublin and shop with darcy to have sunday dinner at the otooles and she scheduled another storytelling session with aidan she wasnt asked to come down to the pub that evening it was understood that she would and that was so much better when you were part of something she reflected you didnt need to be asked the kitchen smelled of fried potatoes and coffee the wind chime outside the door sang in the breeze as she rose to get more coffee she spotted betty outside running wildly after a bounding rabbit over hills sprinkled with wildflowers jude imprinted it all on her mind promising herself shed take the moment out again when she was feeling low or lonely later when she was alone and settling down to work it seemed to her the house still held all that warmth and energy so she wrote in her journal its odd that i never realized this is so much what i want a home a place where people i enjoy and who enjoy me will come when they like will feel comfortable and easy maybe it wasnt solitude i was looking for after all when i so rashly flew to ireland it was what ive had over these last hours companionship laughter foolishness and well romance i suppose i didnt realize it because i never let myself really wish for it now without even the wish here it is thats a kind of magic isnt it every bit as much as faeries and spells and winged horses im accepted here not for what i do or where i come from or where i went to school im accepted for who i am for who more importantly im finally letting myself become when i have dinner at the otooles i wont be shy or feel awkward ill have fun when i go shopping with darcy im determined to buy something extravagant and useless because itll be fun and when next aidan comes through my garden gate i may take him as a lover because i want him because he makes me feel something ive never felt before outrageously and completely female and because damn it itll be fun with a satisfied nod she switched documents and settled back to review some of her work scanning the screen sifting through written notes she slid into the routine of research and analysis she was deep into the study of a story on a crofters changeling when her phone rang with her mind circling the crofters dilemma she picked up the receiver yes hello jude i hope im not interrupting your work jude blinked at the screen and tuned in to her mothers voice no nothing important hello mother how are you im very well linda murrays voice was cultured and smooth and just a little cool your father and i are about to take advantage of the end of the semester were going to new york for a few days to attend an exhibit at the whitney and see a play thats nice it made her smile thinking how much her parents enjoyed each others company a perfect meeting of minds youll enjoy that very much youre welcome to fly in and join us if you like if youve had enough of country living a perfect meeting of minds jude thought again and shed never quite been able to mesh with that lovely unity i appreciate the offer but im fine i really love it here do you there was faint surprise in the tone you always took after your grandmother who sends her love by the way send mine right back to her youre not finding the cottage a bit too rustic jude thought of her initial reaction no microwave no electric can opener and grinned to herself i have everything i need there are flowers blooming outside the windows and im starting to recognize some of the birds thats nice you do sound rested i hope youre planning on spending some time in dublin while youre there theyre supposed to have marvelous galleries and of course youll want to see trinity college as a matter of fact im going to dublin for the day next week good good a little respite in the country is all well and good but you dont want your mind to stagnate jude opened her mouth shut it again then took a long breath im working on my paper now as a matter of fact im finding no end of material here and im learning to garden really thats a lovely hobby you sound happy jude im so glad to hear it its been too long since you sounded happy jude closed her eyes and felt the burgeoning resentment fade away i know youve been worried about me and im sorry i really am happy i suppose i just needed to get away for a while ill admit both your father and i were concerned you seemed so listless and dissatisfied i suppose i was both the divorce was hard on you i understand that better i think than you knew it was so sudden and so final and it took all of us by surprise it certainly took me by surprise jude said dryly it shouldnt have wouldnt have if id been paying attention perhaps not linda said and jude winced at her mothers easy agreement but that doesnt change the fact that william wasnt the man any of us thought he was and thats one of the reasons i called jude i felt it would be better if you heard this from me rather than through the gossip mill or some letter from an acquaintance what is it something inside her belly clenched is it about william is he ill no quite the contrary he appears to be thriving jude gaped at the sudden and undisguised bitterness in her mothers voice well thats fine you have a more forgiving nature than i do linda snapped back id prefer it if hed contract some rare debilitating disease or at least go bald and develop a facial twitch stunned as much by the uncharacteristic violence in her mothers voice as by the sentiment jude burst out laughing thats terrible i love it but i had no idea you felt that way about him your father and i did our best to maintain a polite front to make things easier for you it couldnt have been comfortable for you facing your mutual friends and colleagues you remained dignified we were proud of you dignity jude mused yes theyd always found pride in her dignity so how could she have disappointed them by going into wild rages or having public snits i appreciate that i think it showed enormous strength the way you held your head up and i can only imagine how much it cost you to do so i suppose leaving your position at the university and going away like this was necessary to rebuild i didnt think you understood of course we did jude he hurt you as simple as that jude realized and felt her eyes sting why hadnt she trusted her family to stand behind her i thought you blamed me why in the world would we blame you honestly your father actually threatened to strike william its so rare for that irish blood to surface and it took quite some doing to calm him down again jude tried to imagine her dignified father plowing into the dignified william but it would not compute i cant tell you how much better that makes me feel i never said anything because you seemed so determined to keep it all civilized and i hope this doesnt upset you but i dont want you to hear it from some other source judes belly seized up again what is it william and his new wife are taking advantage of semesters end as well theyre going to the west indies for a couple of weeks of all places william is cheerfully telling anyone wholl listen that they want this exotic holiday before they have to settle in jude theyre expecting a baby in october whatever had clutched in her belly sank dropped through clean to her toes i see the mans acting like a fool about it he actually has a copy of the sonogram and is showing it off like a family photo he bought her this gaudy emerald ring to celebrate hes behaving as if shes the first woman to conceive im sure hes just very happy im glad you can take it well for myself im infuriated we have several mutual friends and this well glee of his is very awkward in social situations youd think he would show more tact linda paused obviously to get her temper under control when she spoke again it was gently he wasnt worth a moment of your time jude im sorry i didnt realize that before you married him so am i she murmured please dont worry about it mother its history im just sorry its embarrassing for you oh i can manage as i said i didnt want you to hear it from someone else i can see now i neednt have been concerned that youd be upset or hurt again honestly i wasnt sure you were completely over him im relieved youre so sensible as always yes sensible jude she said even as something hot lodged in her throat absolutely in fact be sure to give him my best wishes the next time you see him ill do that i really am glad youre happy jude your father or i will be in touch once were back from new york good have a wonderful time give father my love i will when she hung up jude felt paralyzed frozen her skin was chilled her blood frigid all the warmth and pleasure the simple delight that had carried over from the morning iced up in what she assumed was despair william flying off to some charming island in the west indies with his pretty new wife sliding into sparkling blue water strolling along sugarwhite sand under a full moon with hands clasped and eyes dreamy william giddy over the prospect of fatherhood bragging about his pretty pregnant wife poring through baby books with allyson compiling lists of names pampering the mothertobe with emerald rings and flowers and lazy sunday mornings in bed with freshly squeezed orange juice and croissants she could visualize it perfectly a curse of her wellhoned imagination the characteristically buttoneddown william gleefully nuzzling the lovely madonna as they lounged on the beach the usually reserved william telling perfect strangers about the upcoming blessed event the notoriously frugal william shelling out the price of an emerald ring a gaudy one the bastard she snapped the pencil she held in two heaved both parts at the wall it wasnt until shed leaped out of her chair knocking it to the floor with a resounding crash that she realized it wasnt despair she felt it was fury blazing blistering fury her breath came in pants her fists were clenched there was nothing to pound on nothing to beat senseless the rage building inside her was so black so fierce she looked around wildly for somewhere to put it before it exploded out of her chest she had to get out to move to breathe before the force of anger came out in a scream that shattered every window in the cottage blindly she whirled toward the door and raced out down the stairs out of the house she ran over the hills until she couldnt catch her breath until her sides stung and her legs trembled a soft rain began to fall through the sunshine sparkling the air and dewing the grass the wind came up strong and sounded like a woman weeping through it like a whisper was the music of pipes finding herself on the path to ardmore jude continued to walk chapter eleven contents prev next a rainy evening at the pub had people snuggled into their chairs and doing as much dreaming as talking young connor dempsey played wistful tunes on the squeezebox while his father sipped his smithwicks and discussed the state of the world with his good friend jack brennan since jacks heart was mending now he paid as much attention to the conversation as he did his own beer from behind the bar aidan kept an eye on him nonetheless jack and connor dempsey senior often disagreed on the state of the world and occasionally felt the need to use their fists to bring the point home aidan understood the need well enough but he didnt care to have the debate rage in his place he checked the progress of the football game on the bar set now and then clare was outscoring mayo and he gave them a quick mental cheer as he had a small wager on the outcome he anticipated a quiet night and wondered if he could call upon brenna to cover for him he had an urge to see if jude would like another meal with him in a restaurant this time with flowers and candles on the table and a nice strawcolored wine in pretty glasses it would be the sort of thing she was more accustomed to he imagined than scrambled eggs and fried potatoes dished up in her own kitchen shy and sweet she might be but she was a sophisticated woman citybred and upper class the men she was used to would take her to the theater and fancy restaurants they would wear ties and wellcut suits and talk of literature and cinema in weighty tones well he wasnt exactly ignorant was he he read books and enjoyed films hed traveled more than most and had seen great art and architecture firsthand he could hold his own against any chicago dandy in conversation when he caught himself scowling he shook his head what was he doing for christs sake setting himself up in competition with some imaginary man it was pathetic the way he couldnt seem to hold three thoughts in his head unless one of them centered on jude murray it was likely just sexual frustration he decided he hadnt slid his hands over a womans body in a considerable amount of time every time he imagined doing so it was judes body under his hands and thanks to that morning he had a much clearer picture of just what that body of hers included all that soft white skin that tended to show a rosy flush so easily long slim legs and a tiny sexy mole just at the rise of her left breast she had such pretty shoulders shoulders that just seemed to cry out for the trail of a mans lips the way she shied then melted when he touched her was it any wonder he was fixated on her a man would have to be dead a decade not to be stirred a part of him one that he wasnt particularly proud of wished he could just charm her into bed and be done with it release and relief and a pleasure for both of them another part admitted just a bit uneasily that he was just as fascinated by her mind and her manner as he was by the package wrapped around it quiet and shy tidy and polite she just made a man want to keep rubbing away at the sheen of composure until he found everything that lay hidden beneath the door opened aidan glanced over casually then he looked again eyes widening in something close to shock jude stepped in no it was more a stalking she was wet down to the skin her hair wild and dripping around her shoulders her eyes were dark and though he told himself it was a trick of the light they looked dangerous he would have sworn they sent off sparks as she strode up to the bar id like a drink youre soaking wet its raining and ive been walking in it her voice was clipped with an undertone of heat she shoved at her wet heavy hair shed lost her band somewhere along the run thats the usual result can i have a drink or not sure ive the wine you like why dont you take it over by the fire there and warm yourself a bit and ill get you a towel for your hair i dont want the fire i dont want a towel i want whiskey she issued it like a challenge and dropped a fisted hand on the bar here her eyes still made his think of a sea goddess but it was a vengeful one now he nodded slowly as you like he got out a short glass and poured two fingers of jamesons into it jude snatched it up tossed it back like water her breath exploded out of the sudden fire dead center of her chest her eyes watered but stayed hot a wise man aidan kept his face carefully blank youre welcome to go upstairs to my rooms if youd like to borrow a dry shirt im fine her throat felt as if someone had raked hot needles down it but there was a rather pleasant little fire simmering in her gut now she set the glass back down on the bar nodded to it another experience had him leaning casually on the bar with some you could empty the bottle and no one was the worse for it with others you nudged them out the door before they bent their elbow once too often and there were some who needed to pour out their troubles more than they needed the publican to pour the whiskey he recognized which he was dealing with here added to that if a glass and a half of wine gave her a buzz two shots of whiskey would put her under why dont you tell me what the trouble is darling i didnt say there was any trouble i said i wanted another glass of whiskey well you wont get one here but ill make you some tea and a seat by the fire she drew in a breath then let it out with a shrug fine forget the whiskey theres a lass he patted the fist still bunched on his bar now you go and sit and ill bring you tea then you can tell me whats the matter i dont need to sit she tossed her wet hair out of her face then leaned forward as he was come closer she ordered when he obliged and their faces were only inches apart she took a handful of his shirt she spoke clearly concisely but still had the wit to keep her voice low do you still want to have sex with me i beg your pardon you heard me but it gave her a dark thrill to repeat herself do you want to have sex or not even as his nerves jangled he went hard it was beyond his power to control either reaction right this minute whats wrong with now she demanded does everything have to be planned and patterned and tied up in a damn bow she forgot to keep her voice down this time and several heads turned and eyebrows wiggled aidan laid a hand over the one still clutching his shirt and patted gently come on back in the snug why dont you jude in the what come on back here he patted her hand again then pried her fingers off with a gesture he pointed out a door at the end of the bar shawn come out here and man the bar for a moment would you he lifted the flap at the end of the bar so jude could pass through then nudged her through the door the snug was a small windowless room furnished with two sugan chairs that had been his grandmothers and a table his father had made that wobbled just enough to be endearing there was an old globe lamp that aidan switched on and a decanter of whiskey that he ignored the snug was a place designed for private conversations and private business he couldnt think of anything more private than dealing with the woman hed been fantasizing about asking him if he wanted to have sex why dont we sit down was what hed intended to say but his mouth was too busy being devoured by hers she had his back up against the door her hands fisted in his hair and her lips hotly hungrily fastened on his he managed one strangled groan then lost himself in the pleasure of being attacked by a wet and willful woman she was pressed against him jesus plastered against him and her body was like a furnace he wondered that her clothes didnt simply steam away her heart was racing or maybe it was his he felt the frantic nervous beat pound and pitch between them she smelled of the rain and tasted of his whiskey and he wanted her with a fervor that was like a sickness it crawled through him clawed at him reeled in his head burned in his throat dimly he heard his brothers voice an answering laugh the faint tune played by a young boy and he remembered barely where they were who they were jude wait the blood was roaring in his head as he tried to ease her back this isnt the place why she was desperate she needed something him anything you want me i want you enough that he would easily imagine reversing their positions and mounting her where they stood like a stallion covering a ready mare with fire in the blood and no heart at all stop now lets catch our breath here he stroked a hand over her hair a hand that was far from steady tell me whats the matter nothings the matter her voice cracked and proved her a liar why does something have to be the matter just make love with me her hands shook as she fought with the buttons of his shirt just touch me now he did reverse positions pressed her against the door and firmly took her face in his hands to lift it whatever his body was telling him his heart and mind gave different orders he was a man who preferred following the heart i might touch but ill never reach you if you dont tell me whats troubling you theres nothing troubling me she hissed at him then burst into tears oh there now darling it was less worrisome to comfort a woman than to resist one gently he gathered her in cradled her against his chest who hurt you a ghra its nothing its stupid im sorry of course its something and not stupid at all tell me whats made you sad mavourneen her breath hitched and desolate she pressed her face into his shoulder it was solid as a rock comforting as a pillow my husband and his wife are going to the west indies and having a baby what the word came out like a bullet as he jerked her back youve a husband had she sniffled and wished her head could be on his shoulder again he didnt want to keep me aidan took two long breaths but his head still reeled as though hed swallowed a bottle of jamesons or been clobbered by one you were married technically she fluttered a hand do you have a handkerchief staggered aidan dug in his pocket handed it to her i think well start back at some beginning but well get you some dry clothes and some hot tea before you catch a chill no im all right i should just be quiet well go upstairs im a mess she blew her nose savagely i dont want people to see me theres no one out there who hasnt shed a few tears of their own and some right here in this pub well go out and through the kitchen and up before she could argue he took her arm and pulled her to the door then even as the first wave of embarrassment hit he continued to pull her into the kitchen where darcy looked over in surprise why jude whatevers the matter she began then closed her mouth as aidan gave a quick shake of his head and nudged jude up a narrow staircase he opened a door at the head of it and stepped into his small cluttered living room the bedrooms through there take whatever works best for you and ill put on the tea she started to thank him apologize something but he was already moving through a low doorway there was enough tension in his wake to bow her spirits even lower she stepped into the bedroom unlike the living room it was neat as a pin and sparsely furnished she wished she had the time and the right to poke about a bit but she moved quickly to the little closet giving herself time only to scan the single bed with its navy cover the tall chest of drawers that looked old and comfortably worn at the hinges the faded rug over an agedarkened wood floor she found a shirt as gray as her mood while she changed she studied the walls there he had indulged in his romantic side she thought posters and prints of faraway places street scenes of paris and london and new york and florence stormy seascapes and lush islands towering mountains quiet valleys mysterious deserts and of course the fierce cliffs and gentle hills of his own country they were tacked up edge to edge like a fabulous eccentric wallpaper how many of those places had he been she wondered had he been to them all or had he places still to go she let out a huge sigh not caring that the sound was ripe with selfpity and carrying her wet sweater went back into the living room he was pacing and stopped when she came in she was dwarfed by his shirt and looked small and miserable and not nearly up to dealing with the emotions swinging around inside him so he said nothing not yet merely took her sweater and carried it into the bath to hang over the shower rod and drip sit down jude youve every right to be angry with me coming in this way behaving as i did i dont know how to begin to i wish youd be quiet for a minute he snapped it at her telling himself when she winced that he wasnt made of stone then he stalked into the kitchen to deal with the tea shed been married was all he could think that was quite a detail shed neglected to mention hed thought her to have had little experience with men and here shed been married and divorced and was obviously still pining for the bastard pining for some fancy man in chicago who wasnt true enough to keep his vows and all the while aidan gallagher had been pining for her if that wasnt enough to burn your ass what was he poured the tea strong and black and added a healthy drop of whiskey to his own she was standing when he came back the fingers of her hands twisted together her damp hair curled madly and her eyes were drenched ill go downstairs and apologize to your customers for what for making a scene he set the cups down and drew his brows together to study her with as much bafflement as irritation what do i care about that if we dont have a scene in gallaghers once a week we wonder why will you sit down damn it and stop looking at me as if i was about to take a strap to you he sat after she did then picked up his own tea jude sipped burned her tongue then hastily set her cup down again why didnt you tell me youd been married i didnt think of it didnt think of it his cup clattered as he snapped it down on the table did it mean so little to you it meant a great deal to me she returned with a quiet dignity that had him narrowing his eyes it meant considerably less to the man i married ive been trying to learn to live with that when aidan said nothing she picked up her tea again to give herself something to do with her hands wed known each other several years hes a professor at the university where i taught on the surface we had a great deal in common my parents liked him very much he asked me to marry him i said yes were you in love with him i thought i was yes so that amounts to the same thing no aidan thought it didnt amount to the same thing at all but he let it pass and what happened we he i should say planned it all out william likes to plan carefully considering details and possible pitfalls and their solutions we bought a house as its more conducive to entertaining and he had ambitions to rise in his department we had a very small exclusive and dignified wedding with all the right people involved meaning caterers florists photographers guests she breathed deep and since her tongue was already scalded sipped the tea again seven months later he came to me and told me he was dissatisfied thats the word he used jude im dissatisfied with our marriage i think i said oh im sorry she closed her eyes let the humiliation settle along with the whiskey in her stomach that grates knowing my first instinct was to apologize he accepted it graciously as if hed been expecting it no she corrected looking at aidan again because hed been expecting it it was hurt he felt from her now quivering waves of it that should tell you that you apologize too much maybe in any case he explained that as he respected me and wanted to be perfectly honest he felt he should tell me that hed fallen in love with someone else someone younger jude thought now and prettier brighter he didnt want to involve her in a sordid and adulterous affair so he requested that i file for divorce immediately we would sell the house split everything fiftyfifty as he was the instigator he would be willing to give me first choice in any particular material possessions i might want aidan kept his eyes on her face she was composed again eyes quiet hands still too composed to his thinking he decided he preferred it when she was passionate and real and what did you do about it nothing i did nothing he got his divorce he remarried and we all got on with our lives he hurt you thats what william would call an unfortunate but necessary byproduct of the situation then william is a donkeys ass she smiled a little maybe but what he did makes more sense than struggling through a marriage that makes you unhappy were you unhappy in it no but i dont suppose i was really happy either her head ached now and she was tired she wished she could just curl into a ball and sleep i dont think im given to great highs of emotions he too was drained this was the same woman whod thrown herself lustfully into his arms then wept bitterly in them only moments before no youre a right calm one arent you jude frances yes she whispered sensible jude so being such what set you off today its stupid why should it be stupid if it meant something to you because it shouldnt have it shouldnt have meant anything her head snapped up again and the glitter that came into her eyes didnt displease him in the least were divorced arent we weve been divorced for two years why should i care that hes going to the west indies well why do you because i wanted to go there she exploded i wanted to go somewhere exotic and wonderful and foreign on our honeymoon i got brochures paris florence bimini all sorts of places we could have gone to any of them and i would have been thrilled but all he could talk about was was she circled her hand as words momentarily failed her the language difficulties the cultural shocks the different germs for gods sake furious all over again she leaped out of the chair so we went to washington and spent hours days centuries touring the smithsonian and going to lectures hed been fairly shocked before but this one did it you went to lectures on your honeymoon cultural bonding she spat out thats what he called it she threw up her hands and began to stalk around the room most couples have impossibly high expectations for their honeymoon according to william and why shouldnt they aidan murmured exactly she whirled back her face flushed with righteous fury better to meet the minds on common ground better to go to an environment that is recognizable the hell with that we shouldve been having crazy sex on some hot beach a part of aidan was simply delighted that that hadnt occurred sounds to me like youre well rid of him darling thats not the point she wanted to tear her hair out nearly did judes irish was up now bubbling boiling in a way that would have made her grandmother proud the point is he left me and his leaving crushed me maybe not my heart but my pride and my ego and what difference does it make theyre all part of me it makes no difference at all aidan said quietly youre right no difference the fact that he agreed without a seconds hesitation only added fuel to her temper and now the bastard hes going where i wanted to go and theyre having a baby and hes thrilled when i talked about having children he brought up our careers and lifestyles the population college costs for christs sake and he made a chart a what a chart a goddamn computergenerated chart projecting our finances and health our career status and time management over the next five to seven years after that he told me if we met our goals we could consider just consider conceiving a single child but for the next several years he had to concentrate on his career his planned advancements and his stupid portfolio fury was a living thing now clawing viciously at her chest he decided when and if we would have a child he decided should that eventuality take place there would be only one if he could have managed it hed have decided on the sex of the projected baby i wanted a family and he gave me pie charts her breath hitched and her eyes filled again but when aidan rose to go to her jude shook her head frantically i thought he didnt want foreign travel and babies i thought well hes just set in his ways and hes so practical and frugal and ambitious but that wasnt it it wasnt it at all he didnt want to go to the west indies with me he didnt want to make a family with me whats wrong with me theres nothing wrong with you nothing at all of course there is she dug out his handkerchief as her voice rose and fell and broke if there wasnt id never have let him get away with it im dull he was bored with me almost as soon as we were married people get bored with me my students my associates my own parents are bored with me thats a foolish thing to say he went to her now taking her arms to give her a little shake theres nothing dull about you you just dont know me well enough yet im dull all right she sniffled then nodded for emphasis i never do anything exciting never say anything brilliant everything about me is average i even bore myself who put these ideas in your head he would have shaken her again but she looked so pitiful did it ever occur to you that this william with his bloody pie charts and cultural whatever it was is the boring one that if your students werent enthusiastic it was because teaching wasnt what you were meant to do she shrugged im the common factor jude frances whos come to ireland on her own to live in a place shes never been with people shes never met and to do work shes never done thats different why because im just running away he felt both impatience and sympathy for her boring youre not but hardheaded you are you could give a mule lessons whats wrong with running away if where you were didnt suit you doesnt it follow youre running to something else something that does suit you i dont know and she was too tired and achy to think it through ive done some running myself to and from in the end i landed where i needed to be he bent down to press a kiss to her forehead and so will you then he drew her away rubbed a tear from her cheek with his thumb now sit down here while i go clear up a few things in the pub then ill see you home no thats all right i can walk back youll not be walking in the rain and the dark and when youre feeling sad just sit and drink your tea i wont be long he left her alone before she could argue then stood on the stairs for a few minutes to get his own mind in order he was trying not to be angry with her for not telling him about the marriage he was a man who took such commitments seriously because of his faith and his own sensibilities marriage wasnt something you wound in and out of as you pleased but something that cemented you hers had crumbled through no fault of her own but she should have told him it was the principle of it and hed just have to get by it aidan warned himself hed also have to do some careful treading over the sensitive areas of her that circumstance had rubbed so raw he didnt want to be responsible for pinching where it already hurt jesus he thought rubbing the back of his neck as he headed down to the pub the woman was a bucket of work whats the matter with jude darcy demanded the minute he stepped into the kitchen shes all right she had some news from home that upset her is all he picked up the receiver on the wall phone to call brenna oh not her granny darcy set down the order shed just picked up and her eyes were full of concern no nothing like that im going to call brenna and see if she can cover for me a couple of hours i want to drive jude home well and if she cant shawn and i will manage aidan paused with the phone in his hand and smiled youre a sweetheart when you want to be darcy i like her and i think she needs a bit of fun in her life seems to be theres been precious little up to now and having her husband leave her for another woman before her bridal bouquet was dry is bound to wait now hold on a minute you knew she was married darcy lifted a brow of course she hefted the order sauntered toward the door with it its not a secret not a secret he muttered then with gritted teeth dialed brennas number the whole village likely knew but not me chapter twelve contents prev next by the time aidan came back and they walked down to his car jude had time to calm down and to review mortification didnt begin to cover it she had burst into the pub then had sexually assaulted the man in his place of business perhaps in time twenty or thirty years she estimated she would find that particular memory fascinating and even amusing but for now it was just humiliating then she had compounded that by raging weeping blubbering and cursing all in all she couldnt think of anything she might have done that could have shocked them both more unless it was stripping naked and dancing a jig on his bar her mother had congratulated her on maintaining her dignity while under terrible stress well mother she thought dont look now and after all that aidan was driving her home because it was dark and rainy and he was kind she imagined he couldnt wait to be rid of her as they bumped up her little road she tried out a dozen different ways to smooth over the embarrassment and every one sounded stilted or silly still she had to say something it would be cowardly and rude not to so she took a deep breath then let it out in a rush do you see her who in the window jude reached out gripping his arm as she stared at the figure in the window of her cottage he looked up smiled a little aye shes waiting i wonder if time stretches out for her or if a year is only a day he switched off the engine so they sat with the rain drumming until the figure faded away you did see her youre not just saying that of course i saw her as i have before and will again he turned his head studied judes profile youre not uneasy are you staying out here with her no because the answer came so easily she laughed not at all i should be i suppose but im not the least bit uneasy here or with her sometimes sometimes what she hesitated again telling herself she shouldnt keep him but it was so cozy there in the warmth of the car with the rain pattering and the mists swirling well sometimes i feel her something in the air some i dont know how to explain some ripple in the air and it makes me sad because shes sad ive seen him too him the faerie prince ive met him twice now when ive gone to put flowers on maudes grave i know it sounds crazy i know i should probably see a doctor for some tests but did i say it sounded crazy no she released another pentup breath i guess thats why i told you because you wouldnt say it you wouldnt think it and neither did she not any longer i met him aidan she shifted on her seat her eyes bright with excitement as she faced him i talked to him the first time i thought he was someone who just lived around here but the second it was almost like a dream or a trance or i have something she said following impulse id like to show you i know you probably want to get back but if you have just a minute are you asking me in yes id then ive time enough they got out of the car and walked through the rain a little nervous she pushed at her damp hair as they stepped inside the cottage its upstairs ill bring it down do you want some tea no im fine just well wait she said and hurried upstairs to her bedroom where shed buried the stone among her socks when she came down holding it behind her back aidan was already lighting the fire the glow of it shimmered over him as he crouched by the hearth and judes heart gave a pleasantly painful little lurch he was as handsome as the faerie prince she thought see the way the fire brings out the deep red tones in his hair and shifts and plays over the angles of his face shoots gold into those wonderful blue eyes of his was it any wonder she was in love with him oh god she was in love with him the force of it struck like a blow in the belly nearly made her groan how many more idiotic mistakes could she make in one single day she couldnt afford to fall in love with some gorgeous irishman to break her heart over him to make a fool of herself he was looking for something entirely different and had made no pretenses about it he wanted sex and pleasure fun and excitement companionship too she imagined but he didnt want some moonyeyed woman in love with him particularly one whod already failed at the only serious relationship shed allowed herself he wanted a love affair which was a world away from love and if she wanted to succeed here with him to give herself the pleasure of a relationship with him she would have to learn to separate the two she would not complicate this she would not overanalyze this she would not ruin this so when he rose and turned she smiled at him its lovely having a fire on a rainy night thanks then come closer to it he held out a hand she was walking into the fire all right she thought and she wouldnt give a damn if she got burned she crossed to him kept her eyes on his slowly she brought her hand from behind her back spread her fingers the diamond nestled in the center of her palm shooting light and glory sacred heart of jesus aiden stared at it blinked is that what i think it is he poured them like candy out of his bag jewels so bright they hurt my eyes and i watched as they bloomed into flowers over maudes grave except for this one that stayed as it was i shouldnt believe it she murmured thinking as much of love as of the stone in her hand but here it is he took it from her hand to hold it in the light of the fire it seemed to pulse then lay quiet it holds every color of the rainbow theres magic here jude frances he lifted his gaze to hers what will you do with it i dont know i was going to take it to a jeweler have it analyzed the same way i was going to have myself analyzed but ive changed my mind i dont want it tested and studied and documented and appraised its enough just to have it dont you think just to know it is i havent taken enough on faith in my life i want to change that thats wise and brave and perhaps the very reason it was given into your keeping he took her hand turned the palm up after laying the stone on her palm he curled her fingers around it its for you and whatever magic it holds im glad you showed it to me i needed to share it she held the stone firmly and though she knew it was foolish thought she gathered courage from it youve been so understanding and very patient with me my outrageous behavior then the way i dumped all my neuroses on you i dont know how to repay you im not keeping a balance sheet i know you wouldnt youre the kindest man i know he managed not to wince kind is it yes very and understanding and patient as well her lips curved yes like a brother might be she managed to keep the smile in place well i hmmm and are you in the habit of throwing yourself into the arms of men you think of like a brother i have to apologize for that for embarrassing you havent i told you that you apologize too often just answer the question urn well actually ive never thrown myself into anyones arms but yours is that the truth then well its flattered i am though you were in some distress at the time yes yes i was the stone felt like a lead weight in her hand now she turned grateful to have her back to him for a moment and laid it on the mantel are you in distress at the moment no no thank you im fine then lets try it again he spun her around and as her lips parted in surprise captured them her body jerked that instant of shock he always found so arousing are you thinking im kind and patient now he muttered and bit lightly at the curve of her neck i cant think at all good if there was anything more potent than a woman stumbling over her own passion hed yet to come across it i like you better that way i thought youd be angry or youre thinking again he nibbled his way up to her temple ill have to ask you to stop that all right okay her breathy agreement made him yearn mavourneen dheelish let me have you tonight his mouth came back to hers and sent her already scattered thoughts spinning let it be tonight i cant go on just dreaming of you you still want me the stunned pleasure in her voice nearly dropped him to his knees it humbled him her complete lack of vanity i want all there is of you dont ask me to go tonight shed followed her heart to this place and had found him now she would follow her heart again no she tangled her fingers in his hair met his mouth with all the newly discovered love and passion in her no dont go he could have lowered her to the floor taken her there and delighted them both in front of the fire neither of them was a child and both were eager but he remembered a promise made and scooped her up in his arms when he saw the dazed surprise on her face he knew it was right i told you that the first time it would be slow and sweet im a man of my word no one had ever carried her before the romance of it was stunning an erotic fantasy with gilt edges her heartbeat drummed in her ears like thunder as he carried her up the steps down the little hall into the bedroom she was grateful for the dark it would be easier not to be shy in the dark when he sat her on the edge of the bed she closed her eyes then they sprang open again when he turned on the bedside light pretty jude he murmured and smiled down at her just sit a moment and ill light the fire a fire she thought of course a fire would be good she linked her hands together and tried to settle the nerves smooth out the needs it would add atmosphere as well as warmth hed want atmosphere oh god why couldnt she think of something to say why didnt she have some wonderful negligee or lingerie to change into and dazzle him speechless she watched him straighten from the fire once it began to flame then begin to light the candles scattered around the room i was going to call you tonight and ask you to dinner the idea was such a surprise such an intriguing one she stared you were thatll have to wait for another time now he kept his eyes on her seeing her nerves enjoying them a bit as he switched off the lamp again and the room was washed in shadows and shifting light im not very hungry he laughed im after changing that right quickly then to her complete shock he crouched down and began to untie her shoes ive had an appetite for you since you first walked into the pub she swallowed hard it was the best she could do then he ran a finger lightly over the arch of her bare foot and the breath strangled in her throat youve pretty feet he said it casually with a laugh in his eyes as he lifted her foot and nibbled on her toes the breath that had caught exploded out again and her fingers dug like spikes into the mattress but i have to admit after seeing them this morning all damp and rosy i have a preference for your shoulders my oh he gave his attention to her other foot and wiped her brain clean what your shoulders i fancy them because it was true enough he rose and lifted jude to her now tingling feet theyre graceful but theyre strong as he spoke he unbuttoned the shirt shed borrowed to torment them both a little longer he didnt remove it but only nudged it off her shoulders so he could do as hed imagined and trail his tongue along the curve oh god the sensation drizzled into her system like gold dust until everything inside her sparkled when she gripped his hips for balance he worked his way up the side of her neck to her jaw like a man slowly sampling his way through a variety of dishes at a banquet his mouth brushed over hers a teasing taste that stirred the juices of her own hunger he heard it in her quiet moan and came back for a second longer taste her hands slid up his back and she moved her body against his in a dreamy rhythm as her head fell back in surrender slow he said and sweet it was exactly right with the candlelight dancing and the rain softly pattering and her own sighs filling her head soft kisses grew longer and deeper it seemed her body was alive with the taste of him now rich and male and perfect when he tugged his shirt off she gave a low sound of pleasure and let her hands roam over his back knead into the muscles his heart leaped against hers those slow hesitant strokes of her hands were maddening wonderful her mouth was so soft so giving and the way she shivered nerves and anticipation when he unhooked her slacks and let them slide to the floor flashed fresh heat into his blood gaelic endearments burned in his brain tumbled off his tongue as he took his mouth over her face down her throat once again over those glorious shoulders until her shivers became shudders and her sighs gasps slow down slow down he ordered himself but how could he have known that the need for her would rear up and snap into his soul with jagged teeth afraid he would frighten her he pressed his lips to the curve of her throat and just held her until the rage of it settled again she was floating too tangled in sensations to note the changes of rhythm dreamily she turned her head found his mouth with hers and slid them both into the kiss it seemed her bones were dissolving and the pressure in her belly was glorious everywhere he touched a part of her lit up this was making love was all she could think at last this how could she have mistaken anything else for this he had to have more he slipped the shirt aside and found himself charmed by the simple white bra to please himself he trailed a fingertip along the top edge circled the tiny mole her legs buckled aidan when i saw this little dot this morning he murmured watching her face i wanted to bite you when she only blinked at him he grinned and flicked open the hook of her bra it made me wonder what other sexy little secrets you hide under those tidy clothes of yours i dont have any sexy secrets the bra fell to the floor aidan lowered his gaze watched the faint flush work over her skin and found it sinfully erotic youre wrong about that he said quietly then cupped her breasts in his hands there that quick jerk of shock and the glimmer of surprise in her eyes experimentally he rubbed his thumbs over her nipples and watched those seagreen eyes blur no dont close them he said as he lowered her to the bed not yet i want to see what my touching you does to you so he watched her face as he enjoyed her as he learned the secrets shed claimed not to have silky skin and tumbled hair all smelling of rain soft curves subtle dips when his workingmans hands skimmed over her she would quiver and each secret he discovered was a pleasure to them both when he tasted her the world slipped away until there was nothing but the rage of her own pulse and the hot glory of his mouth on her skin ripe for release she arched against his hand when he covered her moved against him as the ache sweetened and the sweetness became unbearable his mouth came down on hers catching her cry of pleasure he gave her more more until her breath was sobs and her body molten the eyes that so fascinated him were blind now and her skin glowing and damp it wasnt only her world that had slipped away but his as well she was all that was left in it he said her name once then slid into her heat into heat need into need strong and deep holding there holding until she wrapped herself around him joined now they moved together long slow strokes that fed the soul dazzled she smiled light shimmered like the brilliance of the diamond as his lips curved in response and met hers this she thought was the real magic the most powerful and clinging to it she leaped off the edge of the world with him candlelight fluttered the fire hissed and rain pinged on the windows there was a gorgeous exciting fascinating and wonderfully naked man in her bed jude felt like a cat whod just been given the keys to the milking parlor im so glad williams having a baby aidan turned his head found his face buried in her hair and angled it away again what the devil does william have to do with it oh i didnt realize id said that out loud its no worse than thinking about another man when ive yet to get my breath back after loving you i wasnt thinking of him like that appalled she sat up too mortified to remember she was naked i was just thinking that if he wasnt having a baby my mother wouldnt have told me and i wouldnt have gotten upset and come down to the pub and it all led to here to this she finished weakly he still had the energy for arrogance lifting a brow he said id have gotten you here eventually im glad it was tonight now because it was so perfect im sorry it was a stupid thing to say youre going to have to stop assuming every stray thought that comes out of your mouth is stupid and since theres a logic to the pattern you just mentioned i say we drink a toast to the timing of williams virility relieved she beamed at him i suppose we could though hes not half as good in bed as you are instantly her cheery grin became a look of horror oh what a thing to say if you think im insulted by that youre mistaken chuckling aidan sat up as well and kissed her soundly id say its worth another toast to williams stupidity in not recognizing the jewel he had so she could fall into my hands jude threw her arms around him hugged hard no ones ever touched me the way you did i didnt think anyone would ever want to im already wanting to again he nuzzled into the curve of her neck why dont we go down and have that wine and a bit of soup or whatever then well come back and start all over again i think thats a wonderful idea she ordered herself not to feel awkward as she climbed out of bed to dress hed already seen all of her there was to see so it was foolish to be shy now still she was relieved when she was covered in the borrowed shirt and her slacks but when she reached for a band for her hair aidan laid a hand on her shoulder and made her jump why are you tying it back because its awful i like it wild he played his fingers through it sort of rioting around in this lovely dense color its brown and shed always considered it as original as tree bark sos mink darling he kissed the tip of her nose whatll we do with you jude frances if you ever take the blinders off and really look at yourself i think youll be a terror come on now and leave it be he added and began to tug her toward the door im the one whos looking at it after all she was too pleased to argue but took a stand once they were in the kitchen you cooked breakfast so ill fix dinner she said and got out the wine im not much of a cook so youll have to make do with my fallback meal and what might that be soup from a can and grilled cheese sandwiches sounds like just the trick on a rainy night he took the wine and settled at a chair at the kitchen table plus i get the pleasure of watching you make it when i first saw this kitchen i thought it was charming she moved to the hearth and lit the fire with an ease that surprised aidan a little then i realized there wasnt a dishwasher or a microwave or so much as an electric can opener or coffee machine laughing she got a can of soup out of the pantry and set to opening it with her little manual opener i was a bit appalled let me tell you and ive done more in this kitchen and enjoyed what ive cooked here more than anything i ever put together in my condo and that kitchens state of the art jennair range subzero refrigerator as she spoke she started the soup ducked into the refrigerator for cheese and butter of course i havent tackled anything complicated im gathering the courage to try to make soda bread it seems fairly basic and if i dont mess it up too badly i could work up to actually baking a cake have you a yen to bake then i think i do she smiled over her shoulder as she spread butter on bread but its rather daunting when youve never done it before you wont know if you like it unless you try i know i hate failing at things she shook her head as she heated the skillet i know its a problem its the reason i havent tried a lot of the things i think about trying i always convince myself ill muck it up anyway so i dont try it comes from being an awkward child of graceful parents she laid the sandwiches in the skillet pleased when they sizzled cheerfully but i make pretty good cheese sandwiches so you wont starve she turned and bumped solidly into his chest his mouth was on hers again hot a little rough and very exciting when he let her breathe again he nodded nothing awkward about that or the rest of you as far as ive seen satisfied he went back to the table and his wine jude recovered in time to keep the soup from boiling over he stayed through the night so that she could curl warm against him at sunrise when the light glided through the window to shimmer on the air he reached for her again making lazy love to her that left her steeped in dreams when next she woke he was sitting on the bed beside her holding a cup of coffee and stroking her hair oh what time is it past ten and ive ruined your reputation ten she sat up quickly surprised and grateful when he handed her the coffee my reputation beyond redemption now i meant to leave at dawn so my car wouldnt be in your street but i was distracted she sighed deeply i remember therell be talk now about that gallagher lad cozying up to the yank her eyes glittered will there really how wonderful he laughed tugged on her hair i thought somehow you might enjoy that id like it better if i ruined your reputation ive never ruined anyones reputation before she touched his face delighted that she could and trailed her finger down over the narrow cleft in his chin i could be that loose american woman whos stolen the owner of gallaghers from under the noses of all the local ladies well now if youve decided to be a loose woman ill be back tonight after closing and you can take unfair advantage of me id be glad to keep a light burning for me darling he leaned forward to kiss her then lingered over it long enough to make himself uncomfortable bloody paperwork he muttered i have to go deal with it miss me will you jude all right she settled back against the pillows when he left listened to the sound of the door closing behind him then of his car starting for an hour she did nothing but sit in bed and hum chapter thirteen contents prev next im having a love affair jude frances murray is having a passionate affair with a gorgeous charming sexy irishman i just love writing that i can barely resist behaving like a schoolgirl and writing his name over and over again in a notebook aidan gallagher what a marvelous name hes so handsome i know its completely shallow to dwell on someones physical appearance but well if i cant be shallow in the pages of my own journal where can i be his hair is a deep rich chestnut and the sunlight teases out the red in it he has wonderful eyes a dark and brilliant blue and when he turns them on me just looks at me as he often does everything inside me goes hot and soft his is a strong face good bones as granny would say his mouth smiles slow and easy and theres just the slightest of clefts in his chin his body i can hardly believe ive had it over mine under mine its so hard and firm with muscles like iron powerful i suppose is the word my lover has a very powerful build i suppose thats enough wallowing in the superficial all right done his other qualities are just as impressive hes very kind and has a lively sense of humor he listens thats a skill in danger of being lost and aidans is well honed his family ties are deep and strong his work ethic admirable i find his mind fascinating and his skill in storytelling entertaining the truth is i could listen to him for hours hes traveled extensively seen places ive only dreamed of seeing now that his parents have settled in boston hes taken over the family business and slipped into the role of head of the family with a calm and rather casual authority i know i shouldnt be in love what aidan and i have is a satisfying physical relationship and a lovely and affectionate friendship both are precious and should be more than enough for anyone but i cant help being in love with him ive come to realize that everything ever written about falling in love is absolutely true the airs sweeter the sun brighter i dont think my feet have touched the ground in days its terrifying and its wonderful nothing ive ever experienced is like this i had no idea i had such feelings inside me passionate and giddy and absolutely foolish feelings i know im the same person i can look in the mirror and its still me looking back yet somehow there seems to be more of me its as if pieces that were hidden or unacknowledged have suddenly tumbled into place i realize the physical and emotional stimuli the charge of endorphins and oh the hell with that this doesnt need to be analyzed and slotted it just has to be its so outrageously romantic the way he walks to my cottage at night coming through the gloom or the moonlight to knock at my door he brings me wildflowers or seashells or pretty stones he does things to my body ive only read about oh god reading has definitely taken second place i feel wanton i have to laugh at myself jude frances murray has a sex drive and it shows no signs of abating ive never had so much fun in my entire life i had no idea romance could be fun why didnt someone tell me when i look in the mirror i feel beautiful imagine that i feel beautiful today im picking darcy up and were going to dublin to shop im going to buy extravagant things for no reason at all the gallagher house was old and lovely and sat on the edge of the village up a steep little hill and facing the sea if jude had asked she would have been told that shamuss son another aidan had built the house there the same year he married the gallaghers didnt make their living on the sea but they enjoyed the look of it other generations had added bits and pieces to the house over the years as money and time had allowed and now that there were many rooms most of them had a view to the sea the house itself was dark wood and sandcolored stone that seemed to be cobbled together in no particular style jude found it intriguing and unique it was two stories with a wide front porch that needed a coat of paint and a narrow stone walk worn by traffic its windows were in diamondshaped panes she imagined were the devil to keep clean she thought it was caught somewhere between grand and quaint with just enough of both and with the light morning fog just burning off around it it held a bit of mystery as well she wondered what it had been like for aidan to grow up there in the big rambling house a stones throw from the beach and cozy enough to the village to have swarms of friends the gardens needed work to judes newly experienced eye but they had a nice wild way about them a lean black cat stretched out on the walkway gave jude a steely stare out of golden eyes as she approached hoping he wouldnt take a swipe at her she crouched down tentatively to scratch between his ears he rewarded the attention by narrowing those eyes and letting out a purr that rumbled like a freight train thats bub shawn stood in the front doorway and shot jude a grin short for beelzebub as hes a devil of a cat by nature come in and have some tea jude for if youre expecting darcy to be ready on time you dont know her theres no hurry thats a good thing as shell primp an hour just to run out for a quart of milk god knows how long shell be admiring herself for a trip to dublin he stepped back to let jude in then tossed a shout over his shoulder toward the stairs judes here darcy and she says to get your vain ass moving if you expect a ride to dublin city oh but i didnt jude burst out flustered and had shawn laughing as he drew her firmly inside she wont pay any mind can i get you some tea then im fine really she glanced around noting that the living room spilling off the little foyer was cluttered and comfortable home she thought again it said home and family and welcome aidans down the pub seeing to deliveries shawn took her hand in a friendly manner and tugged her into the living room hed been wanting to have some time with her to take stock of the woman who had his brother so enchanted so youll have to make do with me oh well that doesnt sound like a hardship when he laughed again she realized shed never have flirted so easily so harmlessly with a man a few months before certainly not one with a face like a wicked angel my brother hasnt given me opportunity to have more than a word with you up to now shawns eyes twinkled keeping you to himself as he is youre always in the kitchen when i come into the pub where they keep me chained but we can make up for it now he was flirting right back with her she realized just as harmlessly it didnt make her nervous it didnt give her those odd and lovely liquid pulls that flirting with aidan did it just made her comfortable then ill start by saying you have a lovely house were happy with it he led her to a chair and when she sat made himself comfortable on the arm of it darcy and i rattle about well enough its made for more people a big family lots of children its held that more often than it hasnt our father was one of ten ten good god weve uncles and aunts and cousins scattered all over and back again gallaghers and fitzgeralds you being one of them he added with a grin i remember as a boy having packs of them coming in and out of the house from time to time so i was always sharing me bed with some lad who was my cousin from wicklow or boston or devonshire do they still come back now and then you did cousin jude he liked the way she smiled at that sweet and a little shy but its darcy and me in the house most times now and will be until the first of the three of us decides to marry and start a family the housell go to the one who does wont the other two mind no thats the gallagher way and youll know youll always be welcome here that itll still be home thats right he said it quietly because he read tones and nuances well and could see she was yearning for a home of her own do you have a house in chicago no its a condo like a glorified flat she added then suddenly restless rose flat she thought again was precisely how it seemed to her now this is a wonderful spot you can watch the sea she started to walk to a window then stopped by a battered old piano the keys were yellowed and several of them chipped and over the scarred wood sheet music was scattered who plays all of us shawn came up beside her put his long fingers over the keys and played a quick series of chords battered the instrument might have been but its notes rang sweet and true do you play as well a little not very well she blew out a breath reminding herself not to be such a moron yes which is it yes i play well then lets hear it he gave her a nudge hip against hip that surprised her into sitting down on the bench i havent played in months she began but he was already riffling through the sheet music setting a piece in front of her before joining her on the bench try this one because she only intended to play a few chords she didnt bother digging her reading glasses out of her purse without them she had to lean closer and squint a little she felt the skitter of nerves wiped damp palms on her thighs and told herself it wasnt one of the childhood recitals that had scared her into desperate nausea still she had to take two deep breaths which made shawns lips twitch before she began to play oh she flowed from the first bar into the second oh this is lovely she forgot her nerves in sheer pleasure as the notes drifted out dreamily as her throat began to ache from it its heartbreaking its meant to be he cocked his head listening to the music as he studied her he could see easily why shed caught his brothers eye the pretty face the quiet manner and those surprising expressive and misty eyes yes shawn mused the combination would draw aidans interest then wind around his heart as for her heart it was a yearning one that he understood well you play very well indeed jude frances why did you say you didnt im used to saying i dont do things well because i usually dont she answered absently losing herself in the music anyone could play this well its wonderful whats it called i havent named it yet you wrote it she stopped playing to stare at him artists of all kinds any kind left her awestruck really shawn its gorgeous oh dont start flattering the man hes irritating enough brenna strode into the room and stuffed her hands into the pockets of her baggy jeans the otoole here has no appreciation for music unless its a rebel song and shes drinking a pint when you write one ill lift a glass to you as well they sneered companionably at each other what are you doing here theres nothing broken that i know of do you see my toolbox in my hand would he never just look at her she wondered the bloody batblind moron im going to dublin with jude and darcy brenna lifted a shoulder i got weary of darcy badgering me about it so ive surrendered she turned and shouted up the stairs darcy for sweet jesus sake whats taking you so bloody long ive been waiting an hour now youll have to confess that lie to father clooney shawn told her as you just walked in the house its only venial and it may get her down here before next week she dropped into a chair why arent you down to the pub helping aidan its delivery day because mother he asked me to stay and see to jude until darcy made her entrance but since youre here ill be off youll come back and play again jude frances he smiled as he rose its a pleasure to hear my tunes played by someone who appreciates music he started out pausing by brennas chair long enough to tug the bill of her cap over her eyes she yanked it back up as the front door slammed behind him he acts as if i were still ten and kicking his ass at football then she gave a twinkling grin its a fine ass too isnt it jude laughed and rose to straighten the sheet music the rest of him isnt bad either and he writes wonderful music aye hes a rare talent in him jude turned lifted her eyebrows you didnt seem to think so a minute ago well if i told him hed just get all puffed up about it and be more unbearable than usual i suppose youve known him forever forever and a day it seems brenna agreed theres four years between us and he came along first and youve been in this house too many times to count you can walk into it as though its your own because thats the kind of house it is jude rose to wander to look at family photographs scattered here and there in frames that didnt match an old pitcher with a chipped lip that held a brilliant array of spring flowers the wallpaper was faded the rug worn i suppose ive run as tame here as darcy and her brothers have in my own house brenna told her sure mrs gallaghers laid the flat of her hand across my bottom with as much enthusiasm as she did her own children jude marveled a little at that no one had ever laid the flat of their hand across her bottom reason was always employed in discipline and passiveaggressive guilt laid it would have been wonderful dont you think to grow up here surrounded by music she circled the room noting the comfortably faded cushions and old wood the clutter and the patterns of light through the windows it could use some sprucing without a doubt she mused but it was all here home family continuity yes this was the place for family for children the way her cottage was the place for solitude and contemplation she imagined the walls in this house held the echoes of too many voices raised in temper in joy to ever be truly quiet the clatter on the stairs had her turning to see darcy race down them her hair billowing out are you just going to laze around all day darcy demanded or are we off to dublin it was a much different trip to dublin than it had been from the car was full of chatter leaving jude barely any room for nerves darcy was full of village gossip it seemed young douglas obrian had gotten maggie brennan in trouble and there was to be a wedding the minute the banns were called and james brennan had been so outraged by the idea of his daughter sneaking out to wrestle with douglas hed gotten drunk as three princes and spent the night sleeping in the dooryard as his wife locked him out of the house i heard that mr brennan went hunting for young douglas and the lad hid out in his fathers hayloft where the smart wagers are the deed was first done until the crisis passed brenna stretched out like a lazy cat in the backseat with the bill of her cap over her eyes maggies going to have second thoughts soon enough when she finds her belly swelled and that feckless douglas with his boots under the bed the pair of them not yet twenty darcy added with a shake of her head its a sorry way to start a life why do they have to get married jude wanted to know theyre too young darcy just stared at her well theyre having a baby so what else is to be done jude opened her mouth shut it before she could logically point out the variety of alternatives this she reminded herself was ireland instead she tried another route is that what youd do she asked darcy if you found yourself pregnant first id be careful not to have sex with someone i wasnt prepared to live with should the need arise and second she said after some thought im twentyfour and employed and not afraid of village gossip so much that i wouldnt raise the child on my own if id made a blunder she turned her head then lifted a brow at jude youre not pregnant are you no jude nearly swerved off the road before she recovered no of course not why of course not when youve been sleeping with aidan every night for the past week protections all well and good but its not infallible is it no but ah stop scaring her darcy you know youre just jealous because shes having regular sex and youre not darcy tossed a sneering look toward the backseat and neither are you my girl and mores the pity brenna shifted came forward to prop her arms on the back of the front seats so tell us poor deprived women about sex with aidan theres a pal jude no she said it with a laugh oh dont be a prude brenna poked her shoulder tell me does he take his sweet time about it or is he a member of the irish foreplay club the irish foreplay club ah youve not heard of it brenna said soberly as darcy snickered their battle cry is brace yourself bridget then theyre in and out before their lagers gone warm surprising herself jude all but screamed with laughter he doesnt call me bridget unless i call him shamus shes made a joke darcy wiped an imaginary tear from her eye our jude what a proud moment this is and a fine one brenna agreed but tell us jude does he take his time with it sort of sliding around and nibbling in the right places or is it all hot and fast and over with before you can call out youve seen god i cant talk about sex with aidan with his sister in the car well then lets dump her out so you can tell me why cant you talk of it darcy demanded with barely a pause for a glare at brenna i know he has sex the bastard but if it troubles you dont think of me as his sister for the moment but as your friend exasperated jude blew out a breath all right ill just say its the best ive ever had although with william it was like a precise military march she decided shocking herself again and before him there was only charles charles was it brenna our jude has a past and who was charles brenna prompted he was in finance so he was rich darcy pounced eagerly on the magic word his family was we met during my last year of college i suppose the physical relationship with him was well lets say that when it was done all the figures added up but it was a rather tedious process aidans romantic her companions made oohing noises that had her giggling helplessly oh stop im not saying another word about it what a bitch to tease us that way brenna tugged on judes hair sure you can give us just one little example of his romantic side as relates to good sex one just one and well be satisfied wont we darcy why of course we wouldnt pry into her personal life would we all right the first time he picked me up right off the floor at the cottage and carried me upstairs all the way upstairs to the bedroom like rhett carried scarlett darcy asked or over the shoulder like you were a sack of potatoes like rhett and scarlett thats a good one brenna pillowed her cheek on her arms he gets high marks for that he treats me like im special why shouldnt he darcy demanded no one ever has and well since were on the subject and its not exactly a secret whats going on i dont have anything well pretty sexy lingerie and that kind of thing i thought maybe you could help me pick some out i know just the place for it darcy all but rubbed her hands together i spent two thousand pounds on underwear dazed jude walked down bustling grafton street there were people everywhere swarming shoppers tourists packs of teenagers and every few feet it seemed musicians playing for coins it was dazzling the noise and colors and shapes but nothing was more dazzling than what shed just done two thousand on underwear and worth every penny darcy said briskly hell be a slave to you they were loaded with shopping bags and though jude had gone into the foray determined to buy recklessly her idea of reckless was darcys notion of conservative somehow within two hours she accumulated what seemed like an entire wardrobe with accessories all at darcys ruthless instigation i cant carry anything else here stopping darcy snatched some of the bags from jude and shoved them at brenna i didnt buy anything so you have free hands then dont you oh look at those shoes darcy barreled through the crowd gathered around a trio of fiddlers homing in on target theyre darling i want my tea brenna muttered then scowled at the strappy black shoes with fourinch heels that darcy was drooling over youd have blisters and calf cramps before youd walked a kilometer in those things theyre not for walking you idiot im having them darcy breezed through the door of the shop ill never get my tea brenna complained ill die of starvation and dehydration and the pair of you wont even notice as ill be buried under a mountain of shopping sacks in which ill add is not a single thing of my own well have tea as soon as i try on the shoes here jude these are for you i dont need any more shoes but she was weak and collapsed in a chair and found herself studying the pretty bronzetoned pumps theyre lovely but then id need a bag to go with them a bag jesus brenna rolled her eyes back in her head and slid out of the chair in a heap she bought the shoes and a bag then a wonderful jacket from the shop just down the street then there was a silly straw hat that she simply had to have for gardening because they were so overloaded they took a vote and with brenna the only nay hauled their purchases back to the car to lock them in the trunk before hunting up a place for a meal thank mary and all the saints brenna sprawled in a booth in a tiny italian restaurant that smelled gloriously of garlic im faint with hunger ill have a pint of harp she ordered the second the waiter shuffled over and a pizza with everything on it but your kitchen sink no you wont darcy flipped out her napkin and shot the waiter a smile that had him tumbling directly into love well get a pizza and we each pick two of the toppings ill have a harps as well but just a glass well then i want mushrooms and sausage for my picks fine darcy nodded across the booth at brenna and ill have black olives and green peppers jude ah mineral water and she caught brennas eye kept her face sober as her friend desperately mouthed pepperoni and capers pepperoni and capers she ordered dutifully she sighed sat back and took inventory her feet hurt miserably she couldnt remember half of what shed just bought she had a vague headache from lack of food and presence of constant conversation and she was joyously happy about all of it its the first day ive spent in dublin jude began i havent been to one museum or gallery or taken a single picture i didnt walk st stephens green or go to trinity college to see the library or the book of kells its shameful why dublins not going anywhere darcy pulled herself away from her flirtation with the waiter you can come back and do all that whenever you like i suppose i can its just that normally thats what i would have done and id have planned it all out pored over the guidebooks and made up an itinerary and a schedule and while i would have figured in some shopping time for mementoes that would have been at the bottom of the list so you just turned the list around didnt you darcy offered the waiter another beaming smile when he served their drinks everythings turned around wait she gripped brennas wrist before she could lift her pint jude my throats dry as an eightyyearold virgin have pity i just want to say that ive never had friends like you sure and there arent any the likes of us brenna winked then rolled her eyes as jude held her wrist down no i mean ive never had any really close women friends that i could have ridiculous conversations about sex with or share pizza with or who help me pick out black lace underwear oh god dont go misty now theres a good girl jude a little desperate brenna turned her hand over to pat judes i have sympathetic tear ducts and no control over them sorry but it was too late her eyes were already filled and shimmering im just so happy there now sniffling herself darcy passed out paper napkins were happy too to friendship then yes to friendship jude let out an unsteady sigh as glasses clinked slainte she saw some of dublin after all as they walked off the pizza jude finally dug out her camera and delighted herself with shots of the graceful arch of bridges over the grand river liffey and the charm of the shady greens the lush baskets of flowers decking the pubs she watched a street artist paint a sunrise over the sea then on impulse bought it for aidan she had brenna and darcy pose a dozen times and bribed them with éclairs from a sweet shop to explore just a bit longer even when they trudged back to the car park her energy level was high she thought she could go on endlessly when they drove away from dublin the western sky was splashed with the colors of sunset that seemed to last forever in the long spring evening and the moon rose as they approached ardmore to sprinkle the fields with light and to spread white swords over the sea even after shed dropped her friends at home and helped darcy cart in her packages she wasnt tired she almost danced into her cottage and hauling her own bags upstairs called out cheerfully im back and i had a wonderful time she wasnt planning on having it end her toughest decision she thought would be to choose just what to wear under her new silk blouse she was going to extend the evening with a visit to gallaghers before closing to flirt openly and outrageously with aidan chapter fourteen contents prev next he was swamped thered been a stepdance exhibition at the school that evening and it seemed half the village had decided to drop into gallaghers afterward to hoist a pint several of the young girls had changed back into their dancing shoes to reprise the show for his customers it made for a happy sound and a full pub he was pulling pints with both hands holding three conversations at once and manning the till he wanted to shoot himself for giving darcy the day off shawn slipped in and out of the kitchen as time allowed and lent a hand at the bar and with the serving but hed get caught up in the dancing and forget to come back as often as not its not a bleeding party aidan reminded him again when shawn strolled back behind the bar sure it sounds like one to me everyones happy enough shawn nodded to the crowd that circled three dancers the duffy girls the best of the lot to my thinking shes got a way with her leave off watching them would you and get down to the other end of the bar the abrupt tone only made shawn smile missing your lady are you cant blame you for it shes a sweetheart aidan sighed and passed brimming glasses into eager hands i havent time to miss anything when im up to my ass in beer well then thats a pity as she just walked in and looking fresh and pretty as a dewdrop despite the hour shawn added when aidans head whipped around hed tried not to think of her in fact hed made a concerted effort on it mostly to see if he could manage it hed done fairly well only finding himself distracted by thoughts of her a couple dozen times that day now here she was with her hair bound back and her smile all for him by the time shed squeezed her way to the bar her smile was a laugh and hed forgotten about the guinness he was building whats going on she had to lift her voice to a near shout and lean in close so close that he caught her scent the mystery of it that lingered on her skin a bit of a party it seems ill get you some wine when ive got a free hand hed rather have used that free hand both hands to snatch her up haul her over the bar and gather her in youre well and truly hooked gallagher he thought and decided he rather enjoyed the sensation did you have a fine time in dublin then yes a wonderful time i bought everything that wasnt nailed down and if i started to resist darcy talked me into it shes good at spending money aidan began then caught himself darcy shes back oh thank the lord another pair of hands might get us through the rest of the night without a riot you can have mine hmm i can take orders the idea took root in her head and bloomed and serve darling i cant ask you to do that he shifted as someone elbowed to the bar to order pints and glasses and fizzy water youre not asking and id like it if i bungle it everyone will just think the yanks a bit slow then you can call darcy have you ever waitressed before he gave her an indulgent smile that instantly put her back up how hard can it be she snapped back and to prove her point turned and muscled her way toward one of the little tables to get started didnt take a pad or a tray aidan looked at his customer for sympathy as he filled the order and if i was to call darcy now that one would have my head for breakfast women he was told are dangerous creatures at the best of times true enough true enough but that one is normally of a calm nature thats five pounds eight and he continued as he took the money and made change its the ones with the calm natures who can cut your throat the quickest when riled youre a wise man aidan aye aidan took a breath in a moments lull wise enough not to call darcy and have two females bashing at me still he figured it wouldnt take jude more than a quarter hour to realize she was over her head she was a practical woman after all and later he could smooth her feathers by saying it was a rare night in the pub in any case and how thoughtful it had been of her to offer to help and so on and so forth until he got her naked and in bed pleased with the image aidan served the next cheerfully and he had a smile waiting for jude as she wove her way back to the bar ill get you that wine now he began i dont drink on the job she said smartly i need two pints of harp and a glass of smithwicks two whiskeys um paddys two cokes and a baileys she offered a smug smile and i could use one of those little aprons if you have one handy he started the order cleared his throat ah you dont know the prices you have a list of them dont you put them in the apron i can add and quite well too if you have a tray while youre filling that order i can clear off some of the empties before they end up broken on the floor a quarter hour he thought again and dug out a menu an apron laid them both on a tray and passed it over its kind it is of you to pitch in jude frances she lifted her brows you dont think i can do it with this she flounced away does it hurt shawn asked from behind him what shoehorning your foot in your mouth that way i bet it cracks the jaw something fierce he only snickered when aidan jabbed him sharply elbow into ribs she has a way with her too he added watching as jude cleared off one of the low tables and chatted with the family who sat there id be happy to take her off your hands if he trailed off a little daunted by the vicious look aidan shot at him just joking he muttered and slipped back to the other end of the bar jude came back began unloading the empties loading the first order a pint and a glass of guinness two orangeens and a cup of tea with whiskey before aidan could speak shed hefted the tray just unsteadily enough to make him hold his breath and moved off to serve she was having the time of her life she was in the middle of it all part of it all music and movement and shouted conversation and laughter people called her by name and asked how it was all going no one seemed the least surprised that she was taking orders and emptying ashtrays she knew she didnt have darcys graceful efficiency and style but she was handling it and if shed almost poured a pint of beer on mr duffy the operative word was almost hed caught it himself with a wink and grin and said hed sooner have it in him than on him she managed the money too and didnt think she made any important mistakes in fact one of her apron pockets was bulging with tips that had her glowing with pride when shawn breezed by and swung her into a quick dance she was too surprised to be embarrassed i dont know how sure you do will you come by and play my music again jude frances id like that but you have to let go im running out of breath and stepping all over your feet if you were to give me a kiss youd have aidan boiling with jealousy i would not really his grin was irresistible ill just kiss you because youre so pretty when he gaped in shock at that she kissed his cheek now im supposed to be working the boss will dock my pay if i keep dancing with you those gallagher lads are shameless kathy duffy told her as jude cleared more glasses bless them for it a pair of good women would settle them down but not so much they wouldnt be interesting aidans married to the pub kevin duffy said as he lit a cigarette and shawn to his music itll be years yet before either of thems taking on a wife nothing to stop a clever lass from trying is there and kathy winked at jude jude managed a smile as she moved to another table she managed to keep it in place as she took the orders but her mind was whirling is that what people thought she wondered that she was trying to wrangle aidan into marriage why it had never crossed her mind not seriously hardly at all did he think that was what she was aiming for she stole a glance at him watched him nimbly pulling pints as he talked to two of the riley sisters no of course he didnt they were both just enjoying themselves enjoying each other if the thought of marriage had crossed her mind it was natural enough but she hadnt dwelled on it the fact was she didnt want to shed been down that road and had been smeared on the pavement fun was better the lack of commitment and expectations was liberating they had mutual affection and respect and if she was in love with him well that just made it all the more romantic she wasnt going to do anything to spoil it in fact she was going to do everything she could to enhance it to squeeze every drop of pleasure out of the time she had when you come back from your trip there jude ill have another pint before closing hmm distracted she looked down at the wide patient face of jack brennan oh sorry she picked up his empty then frowned at him im not pissed he promised my hearts all mended fact is i dont know why i got in such a state over a woman but if youre worried you can ask aidan if i can stand another pint he was so sweet she thought and holding back on an urge to pat his head as she might that of a big shaggy dog no urge to break his nose well now ill admit ive always half wanted to just because its never been managed and he broke mine some time back aidan broke your nose it was appalling it was fascinating not on actual purpose jack qualified we were fifteen and playing football and one thing led to another aidans never been much of a one for bloodying his mates unless one thing leads to another aye jack beamed at her and i dont think hes had himself a good mixup in months due for one most like but hes too busy courting you to find time for a scuffle he isnt courting me jack pursed his lips on an expression caught between concern and puzzlement arent you sweet on him then i how did she answer that i like him very much id better get you that pint its nearly closing time youve been run off your feet aidan said when he closed the door behind the last straggler sit down now jude and ill get you a glass of wine i wouldnt mind it she had to admit it had been work delightful but exhausting her arms ached from carting heavy trays it was no wonder she decided that darcys arms were so beautifully toned and her feet it didnt bear thinking about how much her feet were throbbing she sank onto a stool rolled her shoulders in the kitchen shawn was cleaning up and singing about a wild colonial boy the air was blue with smoke and ripe still with the smells of beer and whiskey she found it all very homey if you decide to give up psychology aidan said as he set a glass in front of her im hiring nothing he said could have pleased her more i did all right didnt i you did brilliantly he took her hand kissed it thanks i liked it i havent given that many parties they make me so nervous the planning keeps me in a constant state of anxiety then the hostessing making sure everythings running smoothly this was like giving a party without all the nerves and she jingled the coins in her apron pocket i got paid now you can sit and tell me about your day in dublin while i clean up here ill tell you about it while i help you clean up he decided not to risk her good mood by arguing again but intended to have her do nothing more complex than clearing empties and setting them on the bar but she was quicker than hed thought and had her sleeves rolled up while he was still dealing with behindthebar work and the till with a pail and a rag shed gotten from shawn she began to mop down the tables he listened to her the way her voice flowed up and down as she described what shed seen and what shed done that day the words werent so important aidan thought it was just so soothing to listen to her she seemed to bring such blessed quiet with her wherever she went he started on the floors working around and with her it was amazing he mused how smoothly she slid into his rhythm or was he sliding into hers he couldnt tell but it seemed so natural the way she clicked into his place his world his life for that matter hed never pictured her carting trays or making change of course it wasnt what she was meant for but shed done it well a lark for her he supposed she certainly wasnt fashioned to be wiping up spilled beer every night but she did so with such practical ease he had an urge to cuddle her when he followed it wrapping his arms around her waist and drawing her back against him she settled right in this is nice she murmured it is yes though im keeping you up late doing dirty work i like it now that everythings quiet and everyones gone home to bed i can think about what kathy duffy said to me or the joke douglas obrian told and listen to shawn singing in the kitchen in chicago id be sleeping by now after finishing papers and reading a chapter of a good book that received bright literary reviews she closed her hands over his relaxed this is much better and when you go back he laid his cheek on the top of her head will you find a neighborhood pub and spend an evening or two there instead the thought of it brought a dark thick wall shuttering down on her future i have lots of time before thats an issue im enjoying learning to go day by day and night by night he turned her glided her into a waltz that followed the tune shawn was singing night by night im a terrible dancer but youre not hesitant was what she was and not yet sure of herself i watched you dance with shawn then kiss him in front of god and country he said it would make you boil with jealousy so it might have if i didnt know i could beat him senseless if need be she laughed loving the way the room revolved as he circled her i kissed him because hes pretty and he asked me youre pretty too i might kiss you if you asked me since youre so free with your kisses let me have one to tease and wasnt it wonderful shed discovered she could tease a man she placed a chaste kiss on his cheek then placed another just as soft on his other cheek when he smiled when he circled her she slid her hand from his shoulder into his hair and keeping her eyes on his rose to her toes to press her lips warmly to his this time it was his body that jerked she ruled the kiss taking him unawares moving it from warm to hot from soft to deep sighing so that his mouth his blood his brain were filled with the taste of her staggered he fisted his hand at the back of her blouse and let her strip his mind clean looks as if its past time for me to leave aidan lifted his head lock up as you go shawn he said without taking his eyes off judes face i will good night to you jude good night shawn whistling now he clicked locks and discreetly closed the door behind him while aidan and jude stood in the middle of the freshly mopped floor i have a terrible need for you he drew the hand he still held to his mouth kissed it im so glad it makes it hard now and again to be gentle then dont be excitement spurted through her in one hot gush thrilled with her own boldness she stepped back and began unbuttoning her blouse you can be whatever you want have whatever you want shed never undressed in front of a man not in a way designed to arouse but the nerves that jumped in her belly were tangled with excitement then swallowed by pure female delight as she saw his eyes go dark the black lace bra was cut low an erotic contrast against the milky skin it was designed to showcase jesus he let out an unsteady breath youre trying to kill me just seduce you she toed off her shoes its a first for me more from inexperience than design she slowly unhooked her trousers so i hope youll excuse any missteps his mouth went dry with anticipation of what was next i see nothing missing at all seems to me youre a natural at it her fingers were a little stiff but she pried them away and let the trousers fall more black lace an excuse for a triangle that veed down over the belly and rose high on the hips she hadnt had the nerve to try the matching garter and sheer black hose darcy had talked her into but seeing the expression on aidans face she thought she would next time i did a lot of shopping today he wasnt sure he could speak she stood in the pub lights her hair tidied back her sea goddess eyes dreamy wearing nothing but black lace that screamed sex which part of her was a man supposed to listen to im afraid to touch you jude braced herself then stepped out of the trousers and toward him then ill touch you heart hammering she slid her arms around his neck and lifted her mouth to his it was so arousing to press up against him when she was all but naked and he still fully dressed it was so powerful to feel his body quiver against hers as if he were fighting some fierce and violent urge it was so freeing to realize she wanted him to set that fierceness that violence loose take me aidan she nipped his bottom lip and all but slithered against him take whatever you want he heard his own control snap like a cannon boom inside his head he knew he was rough and could do nothing about it as his hands bruised and his mouth feasted her gasp of shock was only more fuel as he dragged her to the floor he rolled with her wild to have his hands on her everywhere mad for more he closed lips and teeth over the lace at her breast she arched up bowed with pleasure tingling from the nip of pain it was power that flooded into her the punch of the knowledge that she had pushed him beyond the civilized just by being just by offering as crazed as he to touch she tugged and tore at his shirt until she had her hands on flesh then her lips then her teeth hot and frantic with greedy hands they drove each other pleased and pleasured this wasnt the patient man and the shy woman but two who had stripped down to the primitive she gloried in it absorbing each sharp sensation and fighting to give it back the first orgasm burst through her like a sun more was all he could think more and still more he wanted to eat her alive to devour so that the suddenly wild taste of her would always be inside him each time her body shuddered each time she cried out he thought again and again and again the need to mate was a fever in his blood he plunged into her his pace all the more frenzied when she came and called out his name then she was rising and falling with him driving even as she was driven his vision hazed so that her face her eyes her tumbled hair were behind a soft mist then even that vanished as the animal inside him leaped out and swallowed them both she lay sprawled over him exhausted aching smiling he lay beneath stunned and speechless their opposing reactions had the same root hed taken her on the pub floor he hadnt been able to help himself hed had no control whatsoever no finesse no patience it hadnt been making love but mating just as recklessly primitive as that his own behavior shocked him judes thoughts ran along the same lines but his behavior and her own thrilled her when he heard her long windy sigh he winced and decided he had to do whatever he could to make her comfortable ill take you upstairs mmmm she certainly hoped so so they could do it all over again maybe youd like a hot bath and a cup before i see you home hmmm she sighed again then pursed her lips you want to take a bath the idea was intriguing i thought it might make you feel a bit better i dont think its possible to feel any better not on this plane of existence he shifted and since she was limp as a noodle found it fairly easy to turn her around so she was cradled in his arms when she only smiled and dropped her head on his shoulder he shook his head whats come over you jude frances murray wearing underwear designed to drive me crazy then letting me have my way with you on the floor i have more more what more underwear she replied i bought bags of it it was his turn to drop his head weakly on her shoulder sweet jesus ill be waked in a week i started with the black because darcy said it was foolproof he only choked at that pleased with his reaction she snuggled closer you were putty in my hands i liked it shes gone shameless on me i have so ill tell you i want you to carry me upstairs i love when you do that because it makes me feel all female and fluttery then take me to your bed if i must i must he glanced around noting the scatter of clothes he would come back for them he told himself later and when he did quite some time later he fingered the bits of lace as he carried them back upstairs she was full of surprises was jude frances he thought just as much surprising to herself if he was any judge the shy rose was blooming now she was sleeping cozy as you please in his bed she looked right there he decided as he sat down on the edge to watch her sleep just as shed looked right serving drinks in his pub or working in her garden or walking the hills with the otooles dog beside her she had indeed clicked neatly into his life and why he wondered shouldnt she stay a part of it why should she go back to chicago when she was happy here and he was happy with her it was time he had a wife wasnt it and started a family hed found no one who made the prospect of that a sunny one until jude hed been waiting for something hadnt he and here she had walked right into his pub one rainy night destiny took no more than that she might think otherwise but hed talk her around it it didnt mean she had to give up her work though hed have to puzzle on exactly how she could do what most satisfied her she was a practical woman after all and would want her options spelled out she had strong feelings for him he thought as he toyed with her hair as he had for her she had roots here as did he and anyone with eyes could see that now shed found those roots she was blooming there was a logic to it all that he was sure would appeal to her maybe it made him a little jumpy in the gut but that was natural enough when a man contemplated such a big change in his life along with the responsibility the permanence of a wife and children so if his palms were a bit sweaty it was nothing to be concerned about hed work it out in his head for her then theyd move on from there satisfied he slipped into bed beside her drew her against his side where he liked her best and let his mind drift into sleep while he slept jude dreamed of carrick astride a white winged horse skimming over sky and land and water and as he flew he was gathering jewels from the sun tears from the moon and the heart of the sea chapter fifteen contents prev next it was a bold step but shed taken a lot of them lately there wasnt anything wrong with it maybe it was foolish and impractical but it wasnt illegal still jude glanced around guiltily as she carried a table out to the front garden shed already chosen the spot right there at the curve of the path where the verbena and cranesbill nudged against the stones the table wobbled a little on the uneven ground but she could compensate for it a little wobbling was nothing compared to the view and the air and the scents she went back for the chair shed selected arranged it precisely in back of the table when no one came along to demand what the devil she thought she was doing she dashed back for her laptop she was going to work outside and the prospect had her giddy with delight shed angled her work area so that she could see the hills as well as the hedgerows and the hedgerows were blooming wildly with fuchsia the sun gleamed softly through the cloud layers so that the light was a delicate tangle of silver and gold there was the most fragile of breezes to stir her flowers and bring their fragrance to her she made a little pot of tea using one of maudes prettiest pots a complete indulgence with the little chocolate biscuits shed arranged on a plate it was so perfect it was almost like cheating jude vowed to work twice as hard but she sat for just a moment sipping her tea and dreaming out over the hills her little slice of heaven she thought birds were singing and she caught the bright flash of a duet of magpie at least she thought they were magpies one for sorrow she mused two for joy and if she saw a third it was three for she could never remember so shed just have to stick with joy she laughed at herself yes shed stick with joy it would be hard to be any happier than she was at that moment and what was better to prolong happiness but a fairy tale inspired she got down to work the music of birds trilled around her butterflies flitted their fairy wings over the flowers bees hummed sleepily while she drifted into a world of witches and warriors of elves and fair maidens it surprised her to realize how much she had accumulated already more than two dozen tales and fables and stories it had been so gradual and so little like work her analysis of each was far from complete and she would have to buckle down there the trouble was her words seemed so dry and plain next to the music and magic of the tales maybe she should try to incorporate some of that lilt she supposed into her work why did the analysis have to be so stilted so scientific it wouldnt hurt to jazz it up a little to put in some of her own thoughts and feelings and even a few of her experiences and impressions to describe the people whod told her the story how theyd told it and where the dim pub with music playing the otooles busy kitchen the hills where shed walked with aidan it would make it more personal more real it would be writing she clasped her hands together palm pressed hard to palm she could let herself write the way shed always wanted to as she thought of it let herself touch the shining idea of it she could almost feel that lock inside her slide open if she failed what did it matter she had been at best an average teacher if she turned out to be no more than an average writer at least she would be average at something she desperately wanted to do excitement whipping through her she placed her hands on the keys then quickly jerked them back selfdoubt her oldest companion pulled up a chair beside her come now jude you dont have any talent for selfexpression she told herself just stick with what you know no ones going to publish your paper anyway youre already indulging yourself outrageously at least stick with the original plan and be done with it of course no one was going to publish it she admitted on a long breath it was already much too long for a paper or an article or a treatise two dozen stories was too many the logical thing to do was pick out the best six analyze them as planned then hope some publication on the fringes of academia would be interested that was sensible a butterfly landed on the corner of the table fanned wings blue as cobalt for a moment it seemed to study her as curiously as she studied it and she heard the drift of music pipes and flutes and the weeping rush of harp strings it seemed to flood down the hills toward her making her lift her gaze to all that shimmering green why in such a place did she have to be sensible jude magic had already touched her here she had only to be willing to open herself to more she didnt want to write a damn paper she wanted oh god she wanted to write a book she didnt want to stick with what she knew or what everyone expected of her she wanted finally to reach for what she wanted to know for what shed never dared expect from herself fail or succeed to have the freedom of the experience when selfdoubt muttered beside her she rudely elbowed it aside the rain fell and mists swirled outside the windows a fire glowed in the little hearth in my cottage kitchen on the counter were flowers drenched from the rain cups of tea steamed on the table between us as aidan told me this tale he has a voice like his country full of music and poetry he runs the pub in the village of ardmore that his family has owned for generations and runs it well so that its a warm and friendly place ive often seen him behind the bar listening to stories or telling them while music plays and customers drink their pints he has charm in abundance and a face that draws a womans eye and that men trust his smile is quick his temper slow but both are potent when he sat in the quiet of my kitchen on that rainy afternoon this is what he told me jude lifted her hands pressed them to her lips over them her eyes were bright and shining with discovery there she thought shed begun shed begun and it was exhilarating it was hers god she felt almost drunk on it drawing another steadying breath she tapped keys until shed moved aidans tale of lady gwen and prince carrick under her introduction she reread the story this time inserting how hed spoken what shed thought the way the fire had wanned the kitchen the beam of sunlight that had come and gone in a slant over the table when she was done she went back to the beginning and added more changed some of her phrasing driven now she opened a new document she needed a prologue didnt she it was already rushing through her head without pausing to think she wrote what pushed from her mind to her fingers inside her head there was a kind of singing and the lyrics were simple and wondrous im writing a book aidan stopped at the garden gate and just looked at her what a picture she made he thought sitting there surrounded by all her flowers banging away on the keys of that clever little machine as if her life depended on it she had a silly straw hat perched on her head to shade her eyes glasses with black wire rims were perched on her nose a brilliant blue butterfly danced over her left shoulder as if reading the words that popped up on the screen her foot was tapping making him think there was music in her head he wondered if she was aware of it or if it played there as background to her thoughts her lips were curved so her thoughts must be pleasing her he hoped shed let him read them was it the influence of love he wondered or did she really look stunningly beautiful somehow glowing with power he had no intention of disturbing her until she was done so he simply leaned against the gate with what hed brought her tucked in the curve of his arm but she stopped abruptly snatching her hands from the keys and pressing one to her heart as her head whipped around her eyes met his and even with the distance he could see the variety of sensations play in them surprise at seeing him and the pleasure then the faint embarrassment that seemed to cloud them all too often good day to you jude frances im sorry to interrupt your work oh well shed felt him there felt something she thought however ridiculous that sounded a change in the air now she was caught its all right she fumbled with the keys to save and close then took off her glasses to lay them on the table its nothing important its everything she wanted to shout its the world my own world i know its odd to be set up out here she began as she rose why its a lovely day for being outside yes yes it is she turned off the machine to save the battery i lost track of time because she said it as if confessing a sin to a priest aidan laughed as he unlatched the gate with his free hand you seemed to be enjoying yourself and getting things done why worry about the time then ill just say its the perfect time for a break i imagine the teas cold now but she trailed off as she noted what he carried her eyes lit with delight and she hurried toward him oh you have a puppy isnt it sweet it had been lulled to sleep during aidans walk from the village but stirred now as the voices woke it the fierce yawn came first then dark brown eyes blinked open he was a ball of black and white fur all floppy ears and big feet with a thin whip of a tail curled between his legs he let out an excited yip and immediately began to wriggle oh arent you adorable arent you pretty and so soft she murmured when aidan passed the puppy into her hands when she nuzzled his fur he immediately covered her face with adoring licks well now theres no need to ask if the two of you like each other its the love at first sight that our jude claims not to believe in who could resist him she lifted the pup into the air where he wiggled in ecstasy the clooneys bitch had a litter a few weeks back and i thought this one had the most character hes just weaned and ready for his new home jude crouched setting the puppy down so he could climb up and over her legs and tumble onto his back for a belly rub he looks ready for anything what will you name him thatll be up to you to me she glanced up then laughed as the pup nipped at her fingers for more attention greedy arent you you want me to name him for you for yourself i brought him to you if youre wanting him i thought he could keep you company on your faerie hill her hands stilled you brought him to me youre fond of the otooles yellow hound so i thought you might like having a dog of your own from the ground up so to speak since she only stared aidan backtracked if youre not inclined to dealing with one ill take him myself you brought me a puppy aidan shifted his feet i suppose i should have asked you first if you were interested in one my thought was to surprise you and he broke off when she sat abruptly on the ground gathered the puppy into her arms and burst into tears he didnt mind tears as a rule but these had come without warning and he hadnt a clue of their direction the more the puppy squirmed in her embrace and licked at her face the tighter she held him and the harder she wept oh now darling dont take on so there now a ghra theres no need for all this he squatted down digging out his handkerchief and patting at her hush now its all my fault entirely you brought me a puppy she all but wailed it and sent the pup into sympathetic howls i know i know im sorry i should have thought it through first hell be happy at the pub its not a problem at all hes mine she curled herself around the pup when aidan reached down you gave him to me so hes mine aye he said it cautiously god above a woman was a puzzle youre wanting him then i always wanted a puppy she sobbed it out rocking back and forth aidan dragged a hand through his hair and gave up he sat down with her have you now well then why didnt you have one finally she lifted her teardrenched face her eyes continued to brim and spill over with tears my mother has cats she managed and hiccoughed i see as much he supposed as he could see through a fog of pea soup well a cats a nice thing weve one of our own no no no these are like royalty theyre gorgeous and aloof and prissy and sleek theyre purebred siamese and really beautiful but they never liked me i just wanted a silly dog that would get on the furniture and chew up my shoes and and like me i think you can depend on this one for all of that relieved aidan stroked her cheek wet with tears and puppy kisses so you wont curse me when he leaves a puddle on your floor or gnaws one of the nice italian shoes darcys always admiring no its the most wonderful present ive ever had she reached out for aidan sandwiching the delighted puppy between them youre the most wonderful man in the world much as the dog had done to her she covered aidans face with adoring kisses perhaps hed brought the dog to charm her but there was no point in feeling guilty about it because it had worked was there how could he have known he would be filling a deep childhood longing with a flopeared mongrel pup he tucked the uneasy sensation away and managed to cover her enthusiastic mouth with his he wanted her happy he reminded himself that was the important thing i need a book she murmured a book i dont know how to train a puppy i need a book because it was such a typical reaction he grinned and drew back first off id recommend a lot of newspapers to cut down on those puddles and a stout hunk of rope to save your shoes rope so hell chew on that instead thats clever she beamed now oh and hell need food and a collar and toys and shots and she lifted the pup into the air again me hell need me nothing ever has before do the words were in his mind struggling their way to his tongue but she leaped up to whirl herself and the pup in a circle i have to put my things back inside and run down to the village and get him everything he needs can you wait and drive down with me i can yes ill put the things inside you stay out and acquaint yourself with your new friend there as aidan walked to her table he let out an unsteady breath it was best he hadnt said it he told himself it was too soon for both of them to change the level of things there was plenty of time to bring up marriage plenty of time to figure how it would best be done she bought him a red collar and leash and dishes of bright blue aidan found her some rope and tied it into a sturdy hank still she filled a sack with other things she deemed essential to her puppys happiness and wellbeing she took him for a walk around the village or tried to he spent most of the time trying to shake off the leash or tangling himself in it or chewing on it she resolved to get her hands on a training manual as soon as possible she met brenna as her friend was loading a toolbox into the back of her lorry outside the village bedandbreakfast good day jude and what have you there isnt that one of the clooney pups yes isnt he wonderful im calling him finn after the great warrior great warrior is it brenna crouched down to give finn a friendly scratch aye youre a fierce one ill wager mighty finn she laughed as he leaped up to lap at her face hes a lively one isnt he you made a nice choice id say hell be nice company for you jude thats what aidan thought he gave him to me lips pursed brenna glanced over did he now yes he brought him to the cottage this afternoon it was so sweet of him to think of me do you think betty will like him sure and betty loves company too after a last pat for finn brenna straightened shell be pleased to have the pup to play with i was just about to stop in the pub for a pint do you want to join me im buying thanks but no i should get finn home he must be hungry by now the minute they parted brenna made a beeline for the pub she caught darcys eye gave a quick jerk of her head then moved off to a corner table where she could have some privacy darcy brought along a glass of harp what are you bursting with sit down a minute she kept her voice low and her eye on aidan over darcys shoulder when darcy sat i just saw jude walking her new puppy down the street shes got a puppy does she shh keep your voice down or hell hear were talking of it wholl hear were talking of what darcy asked in a hissing whisper aidanll hear were talking of how he picked out one of the clooney bitchs litter handsome one too and took it up to jude at her cottage for a present he darcy caught herself as brenna shushed her again then leaned forward conspiratorially aidan gave her a puppy he didnt say a word to me about it or anyone else as far as i know since it was news both fresh and surprising darcy pondered over it hes been known to give a lass a trinket from time to time but thats usually for an occasion thats what im thinking as well and flowers darcy continued hes always been one for taking flowers to a woman whos caught his eye but this is different altogether exactly different brenna slapped the table lightly for emphasis this is a live and permanent thing a sweetheart sort of thing it is not just the imenjoyingmyselfinyourbed sort of thing to punctuate the opinion she lifted her glass and drank well she gave him that painting she bought in dublin and hes taken with it out of all proportion if you ask me maybe he was after giving her something back and just happened on the pup if it was to give her something back in kind for the painting and i thought it a lovely painting hed have given her a trinket or a bauble or something of the sort a token for a token brenna said firmly a puppy is several steps up from a token youre right about that darcy drummed her fingers narrowing her eyes at her brother as he worked the bar you think hes in love with her id risk a wager on it that hes heading in that direction brenna shifted we ought to be able to find out and if not us shawn could and we can wheedle it out of him easy enough for he never thinks twice about whats coming out of his mouth no but hes fierce loyal to aidan id like her for a sister darcy considered and seems to me she suits aidan down to the ground ive never seen him look at a woman as he does our jude still gallagher men are notorious slow to move to marriage once the hearts engaged my mother said she had to all but pound my father over the head with orange blossoms before he came to ask her shes planning to be here more than three months more well need to move him along faster than that theyre both the marrying kind so it shouldnt be that hard well give this some thought aidan was right finn was good company he walked the hills with jude entertaining himself when she stopped to admire wildflowers or pluck the buttercups and cowslips that flourished as may coasted to june summer came to ireland on a lovely stream of warmth and to jude the air was like poetry when the weather was soft with the rain falling like silk she kept her wandering short so she could tuck herself cozy in the cottage and when days were dry she indulged herself and finn with those long walks in the morning so he could run wild circles around an indulgent betty whenever she did rain or shine she thought of the man shed seen on the road from dublin walking with his dog and how she had dreamed of doing the same whenever and wherever she wanted like the dog shed imagined finn slept by the hearth when she made her first attempt at soda bread and he whimpered when he woke lonely at three in the morning when he dug at her flowers they had to have a serious talk but he made it through two full weeks without chewing on her shoes except that one time theyd agreed to forget she let him walk and race until he was tuckered out then when weather allowed she set out her table and worked outdoors in the afternoons while he napped under her chair her book it was so secret shed yet to fully acknowledge to herself just how much she wanted to sell it to see it with a beautiful cover one with her name on it on the shelf of a bookstore she kept that almost painful hope buried and threw herself into the work shed discovered she loved to add to it she often took an hour or two in the evening to sketch out illustrations to go with the stories her sketches were primitive at best in her opinion and awkward at worst shed never considered the art lessons her parents had insisted on to be particularly fruitful but the drawing entertained her she made certain they were all tucked away whenever anyone came by to visit now and then it took some scrambling she was in the kitchen going over the latest sketch of the cottage the one she considered the best of a mediocre lot when she heard the quick knock on her door then the sound of it slamming she jumped up sending finn into a fit of barking and hastily shoved the sketches into the folder she used to file them she barely got it closed and stuffed into a drawer before darcy and brenna strolled in theres the fierce warrior dog brenna dropped down on the floor to engage in her usual wrestling match with finn do you have something cold for a weary friend jude darcy slid into a chair at the table i have some soft drinks were you working darcy asked as jude opened the refrigerator no not really ive finished most of what id planned to do this morning good for brenna and i have plans for you do you amused jude set out the drinks you cant possibly want another shopping spree so soon im always wanting another shopping spree but no thats not it youve been with us for three months now more or less jude agreed and tried not to think that her time was half over and brenna and ive decided its time for a ceili interested jude sat as well shed always enjoyed hearing her grandmother talk of the ceilis shed been to as a girl food and music and dancing all spilling out of the house people crowded into the kitchen flooding out into the dooryard youre going to have a ceili no darcy grinned youre having it me with something akin to terror jude gaped i couldnt i dont know how theres nothing to it brenna assured her old maude used to have one every year at this time before she took poorly the gallaghers will give you the music and there are plenty more wholl be more than happy to play everyone brings food and drink all you have to do is open the door and enjoy darcy assured her well all help you put things together and make sure the word gets out we thought a week from saturday as thats the solstice midsummers eves a fine night for a ceili a week jude croaked it out but thats not enough time it cant be enough time more than enough darcy winked at her well help you with everything so dont worry a bit do you think i can borrow that blue dress of yours the one with the little straps and the jacket yes of course but i really cant youre not to fret brenna climbed into a chair my mothers all set to lend a hand as well shes been looking for distractions since maureens making her crazy about the wedding now my advice would be to have the music in the parlor the main of it anyway and the kegs and that outside the back door that gives you a nice flow from one to the other well need to move some of the furniture for dancing darcy put in and if its a fine night we could set some chairs outside as well the moon will just be coming full my mother had the thought of setting candles about outdoors to make it festive and to keep people from tripping over things but i can you get shawn to make colcannon darcy brenna interrupted before jude could get the protest out sure hell make plenty and the pub will donate a keg and some bottles maybe your mother would make some of her stew pies no one has a finer hand at it itll please her to do it really jude felt as if she were going under for the third time and her friends were smiling indulgently after tossing her an anchor instead of a rope i couldnt ask aidanll close the pub for the night so ill be able to come along early and help with anything that needs it darcy let out a satisfied breath there were all but done with it all jude could do was lay her head on the table i think that went well darcy said as she and brenna climbed back in the lorry i feel a bit guilty running over her that way its for jude herself were doing it weve left her stuttering and pale but it went well enough with a laugh brenna started the engine im glad i recalled how my father proposed to my mother at a ceili right here in this cottage its a fine omen friends look out for friends some might have called her flighty but there was no firmer friend once made than darcy gallagher shes mad in love with him and too shy to push him where she wants him well see they have the night and the music and ill come around early enough to hold her down and work on her until shes so lovely aidans eyes will fall out on his boots if that doesnt do the trick well then hes hopeless as far as ive been able to judge gallagher men are as hopeless as they come chapter sixteen contents prev next and how jude asked am i supposed to give a party when i dont know how many people are coming when i have no menu no time schedule no plan since finn was the only one within earshot and he didnt appear to have the answer jude dropped into a chair in her now spotless living room and shut her eyes shed been cleaning for days aidan had laughed at her and told her not to take on so no one was going to hunt up dust in the corners and have her deported for the shame of it he didnt understand he was after all only a man how the cottage looked was the only aspect of the entire business she could control its my house she muttered and a womans house reflects the woman i dont care what millennium were in it just does shed entertained before and shed managed to hold reasonably satisfactory parties but theyd been weeks if not months in the planning shed had lists and themes and caterers and carefully selected hors doeuvres and music and gallons of antacids now she was expected to simply throw open her doors to friend and stranger alike at least a half a dozen people shed never laid eyes on had stopped her in the village to mention the ceili she hoped shed looked pleased and said the appropriate thing but shed all but felt her eyes wheeling in her head this was her first ceili it was the first real party shed given in her cottage the first time shed entertained in ireland she was on a different continent for gods sake how was she supposed to know what she was doing she needed an aspirin the size of ardmore bay trying to calm herself again to put things into perspective she laid her head back and closed her eyes it was supposed to be informal people were bringing buckets and platters and mountains of food she was only responsible for the setting and the cottage was lovely and who was she trying to fool the entire thing was headed straight for disaster the cottage was too small for a party if it rained she could hardly expect people to stand outside under umbrellas while she passed them plates of food out the window there simply wasnt room to stuff everyone inside if even half the people whod spoken to her showed up there wasnt enough floor space or seating space there wasnt enough air in the house to provide everyone with oxygen and there certainly wasnt enough of jude f murray to go around as hostess worse shed gotten lost in the writing of her book several times over the last few days and had neglected to keep the party preparation list shed made up on schedule shed meant really she had to stop writing at one oclock shed even set a timer after the first time she ran over then she turned it off intending only to finish that one paragraph and the next time she surfaced it was after three and neither of her bathrooms had been scrubbed as planned despite all that in a matter of hours people she didnt know would be swarming into her house expecting to be entertained and fed she wasnt to worry about a thing shed been told that over and over again but of course she had to worry about everything it was her job she had to think about the food didnt she it was her house and damn it she was neurotic so what did people expect shed attempted tarts that had come out hard as rock even finn wouldnt touch them the second effort was an improvement at least the dog had nibbled on them before spitting them out but she was forced to admit that she would never win gold stars for her pastry baking she had managed to put together a couple of simple casseroles following a recipe in one of old maudes cookbooks they looked and smelled good enough now she could only hope no one came down with food poisoning she had a ham in the oven shed already called her grandmother three times to check and recheck the process of baking it it was so big how could she possibly be sure it was done it would probably be raw in the center and shed end up giving her guests food poisoning but at least shed serve it in a clean house thank god it didnt take any talent to scrub a floor or wash windows that at least she knew was well done it had rained during the night and fog had slithered in from the sea but the air had cleared that morning to bright sun and summer warmth that lured out the birds and the blossoms all she could do now was hope the weather held she had those sparkling windows open wide to keep the house airy and welcome the scents of old maudes roses and sweet peas tangled together and slipped through the screens the fragrance smoothed out judes stretched nerves flowers she bolted out of the chair she hadnt cut any flowers to arrange in the house she raced into the kitchen for the shears and finn raced after her he lost purchase on the newly waxed floor skidded and ran headfirst into the cabinets of course then he needed to be cuddled and comforted murmuring reassurances jude carried him outside now therell be no digging in the flower beds will there he gave her an adoring look as if the thought never crossed his mind and no chasing butterflies through the cornflowers she added and set him down with a little pat on the butt she picked up a basket and began to select the best flowers for cutting it was a task that relaxed her always the shapes the scents the colors finding the most interesting mix wandering through the banks and flows on the narrow rock path with the hills stretched to forever and the country quiet sweet as the air if she were to make her home here permanently she thought she would extend the gardens in the back shed have a little rock wall built on the east side and cover it with rambling roses or maybe a hedge of lavender and in front of that shed plant a whole river of dahlias and maybe shed put an arbor on the west side and let some sweetsmelling vine climb and climb until it arched like a tunnel shed have a path through it so that she could walk there with chamomile and thyme and nodding columbine scattered nearby she would wind her way through flowers under them around them whenever she set out to walk the hills and fields thered be a stone bench for sitting and in the evenings when work was done shed relax there and just listen to the world shed made shed be the expatriate american writer living in the little cottage on the faerie hill with her flowers and her faithful dog and her lover of course that was fantasy she reminded herself her time was already half gone in the fall shed go back to chicago even if she had the courage to pursue the idea of actually submitting the book to a publisher she would have to get a job she could hardly live off her savings forever it was wrong wasnt it it would have to be teaching she supposed the idea of private practice was too daunting so teaching was the only option even as depression threatened at the thought she shook it off maybe she could look for a position in a small private school someplace where she could feel some connection with her students it would give her time to continue writing she simply couldnt give that up now that shed found it she could move to the suburbs buy a small house there was nothing forcing her to stay in the condo in chicago shed have a studio there a little space just for her writing and she would have the courage to submit the book she wouldnt allow herself to be a coward about something that important not ever again and she could come back to ireland a couple of weeks every summer she could come back visit her friends rejuvenate her spirit see aidan no it was best not to think about that she warned herself to think of next summer or the summer after and aidan this time this window shed opened was magic and it needed to be cherished for what it was all the more precious she told herself because it was temporary they would both move on it was inevitable or he would move on and she would go back but she had the pleasure of knowing shed never go back to just how things had been she wasnt the same person anymore she knew she could build a life now even if it wasnt one of her fantasies it could be satisfying and productive she could be happy she thought she could be fulfilled the last three months had shown her she had potential she could would finish what shed started she was mentally patting herself on the back when finn barked joyfully and dashed to the garden gate right through her pansies good day to you jude mollie otoole let herself in and finn out so that he could leap on betty the two dogs dashed happily toward the hills i thought id stop by and see if i could do anything for you since i dont know what im doing your guess is as good as mine she glanced down at her basket and sighed ive already cut too many flowers you can never have too many mollie jude thought with gratitude and admiration always said just the right thing im so glad youre here mollie waved that off even as her cheek pinkened with pleasure well isnt that nice of you to say i mean it i always feel calmer around you like nothing can go too terribly wrong when youre nearby well im flattered is there something youre afraids gone terribly wrong only everything but jude smiled as she said it would you like to come inside while i put them in water then you can point out the six dozen things ive forgotten to do im sure youve forgotten nothing at all but id love to come in and help you with the flowers i thought id scatter them through the house in different bottles and bowls maude didnt have a proper vase she liked to do the same put little bits of them everywhere youre more like her than you realize i am odd jude thought how the idea of being like a woman shed never met pleased her indeed you pamper your flowers and take long walks nest down in your little house here and keep the door open for company youve her hands she added as i told you before and something of her heart as well she lived alone jude glanced around the tidy little house always it was what suited her but alone she wasnt lonely there was no man she loved after her johnny or as maude used to say there was no man she loved in this life once he was gone ah mollie took a sniff of the air as they went inside youve a ham in the oven it smells lovely does it jude sniffed experimentally as they started toward the kitchen i guess it does would you take a look at it mollie ive never made one and im nervous sure ill take a peek she opened the oven did her inspection while jude set down her basket and stood gnawing her lip its fine nearly done too she pronounced after a quick check to see how easily the skin tugged free from the smell of it you wont have a scrap left for your lunch tomorrow my micks fond of baked ham and will likely make more of a pig of himself than where this one came from really with a shake of her head molly closed the oven jude never have i known a woman whos always so surprised at a compliment im neurotic but she said it with a smile rather than an apology well youd know i suppose youve shined this cottage up like a penny too havent you now and left not a thing for a neighbor to do but give you a bit of advice ill take it when you finish with your flowers and take your ham out to cool put it up high enough that your pup cant climb up and sample it ive had that experience and its not a pretty one good point after that go on up and give yourself the pleasure of a long hot bath put bubbles in it the solstice is a fine time for a ceili and its a finer time for romance in a maternal gesture molly patted judes cheek put a pretty dress on for tonight and dance with aidan in the moonlight the rest i promise you will take care of itself i dont even know how many people are coming what difference does it make ten or a hundred and ten a hundred and ten jude choked out and went pale every one of them is coming to enjoy themselves mollie got down a bottle and thats what theyll do a ceilis just hospitality after all the irish know how to give it and how to take it what if there isnt enough food oh thats the least of your worries what if what if a frog jumps over the moon and lands on your shoulder with amused exasperation mollie lifted her hands youve made your home pretty and welcoming do the same with yourself and the rest as i told you will take care of itself it was good advice jude decided even if she didnt believe a word of it since a bubble bath was a failsafe method of relaxation she took one in her beloved clawfoot tub indulging herself until her skin was pink and glowing her eyes drooping and the water going cold then she opened the cream shed bought in dublin and slathered herself in it it never failed to make her feel female totally relaxed she toyed with the idea of a short preparty nap then walked into the bedroom and shrieked finn oh god he was in the middle of her bed waging a fierce and violent war with her pillows feathers flew everywhere he turned to her tail thumping triumphantly as he held the vanquished pillow in his teeth thats bad bad dog she waved feathers away and rushed to the bed sensing fun he leaped down tearing off with the pillow feathers leaked out and left a downy trail in his wake no no no stop wait finn you come back here this minute she rushed after him robe flapping as she tried to scoop up feathers he made it all the way downstairs before she caught up then she made the mistake of grabbing the pillow instead of the pup his eyes went bright with the notion of tugofwar snarling playfully teeth dug in he shook his head and sent more feathers billowing let go damn it look what youre doing she made a grab and between the wax and the feathers on the floor went skidding she managed one short scream as she sailed bellyfirst across the living room she heard the door open behind her glanced over her shoulder and thought perfect absolutely perfect what are you up to there jude frances aidan leaned on the jamb while shawn peeked in over his shoulder oh nothing she blew hair and feathers out of her eyes nothing at all here i thought youd be slaving away polishing the polish and scrubbing the scrubbing as youve been every day for a week and i find youre lazing about playing with the dog ha ha she untangled herself into a sitting position rubbing the elbow that had banged against the floor finn bounced over and generously spit the pillow at aidans feet oh thats right give it to him well youve killed it havent you boyo deader than moses after giving finn a congratulatory pat aidan crossed the room to offer jude a hand have you hurt yourself darling no she sent him a sulky look its not a laughing matter she slapped his hand aside spreading the glare out to shawn as he began to chuckle there are feathers everywhere itll take me days to find them all you could start with your hair aidan reached down gripped her by the waist and hauled her up its covered with them fine thanks for the help now i have work to do weve brought some kegs from the pub well set them around back for you he blew a feather off her cheek then leaned in to sniff her neck you smell perfect he murmured as she shoved at him go away shawn no dont you dare i dont have time for this and close the door behind you aidan finished and pulled jude closer ill just take the dog too since hes finished here come on you terrible beast shawn clucked to the dog and dutifully shut the door behind them i have to clean up this mess jude began theres time for that slowly aidan walked her backward im not dressed thats something i noticed when he had her back to the wall he ran his hands down her body and up again give us a kiss jude frances one that will hold me through the longest day it seemed a perfectly reasonable request at least when his eyes were holding hers so intimately and his body was so hard and warm and close to answer it she lifted her arms to wrap them around his neck then on impulse she moved quickly yanking him around until it was his back to the wall and her body pressed firm to his her mouth crushed hard and hot to his the sound he made was like a man drowning and drowning willingly his hands gripped her hips fingers digging in to remind her of the night hed lost all patience and control the thrill of it whipped through her potent and strong with a snap of the possessive he was hers as long as it lasted to touch to take to taste it was her he wanted her he reached for she was the one who made his heart thunder it was she realized the truest power in the world the door opened slammed jude kept her mouth fused to his she didnt care if every man woman and child in the village trooped in jesus mary and holy joseph brenna complained cant the pair of you think of something else to do every time a body turns around you two are locked at the lip shes just jealous jude said nuzzling at aidans neck ive better things to be jealous of than some softheaded woman kissing a gallagher she must be mad at shawn again aidan buried his face in judes hair he wasnt sure he was breathing he knew he didnt want to move for another ten years or so men are all boneheads and your worthless brothers bonier than most oh leave off complaining about shawn darcy ordered as she breezed in what happened in here the place is full of feathers jude let go of that man you have to get dressed dont you and so do i aidan get out there and help shawn with the kegs you cant be expecting him to deal with all that himself aidan merely turned his head to lay his cheek on judes hair the look on his face gave his sister such a jolt she stared a full ten seconds then began to shove brenna toward the kitchen well just put these dishes in the kitchen and fetch a broom stop pushing bloody hell ive had it to the ears with gallaghers for the day quiet quiet i have to think flustered darcy dropped the dishes she carried onto the counter and paced hes in love with her who aidan with jude well for pity sake darcy so you already thought isnt that why were fussing here for a ceili but hes really in love with her didnt you see his face i think i should sit down she did so abruptly then blew out a breath i didnt realize not really it was all more of a kind of game but just now when he was holding her i never thought to see him look like that brenna a man looks like that over a woman she could hurt him slice right into the heart jude wouldnt hurt a fly she wouldnt mean to darcys stomach was fluttering with worry aidan was her rock and shed never thought to see him defenseless im sure she cares for him too and shes all caught up in the romance of it then what would the problem be its just as we said no its nothing of what we said hadnt she avoided the desperation of love long enough to recognize it when it bashed her own brother on top of the head brenna shes got that fancy education with initials after her name and a life in chicago her family is there and her work and her fine home aidans life is here genuine distress poured out of her heart and into her eyes dont you see how can he go and why would she stay what was i thinking putting them together like this you didnt put them together they were together because what darcy was saying was beginning to trouble her as well brenna got out the broom she thought better when her hands were busy whatever happens happens weve done nothing more than push her into giving a party on the solstice darcy reminded her midsummers eve were tempting the fates and if it blows wrong were to blame if weve tempted the fates then its up to the fates theres nothing else to be done brenna announced and began to sweep jude decided on the blue dress another dublin acquisition shed never have bought if darcy hadnt badgered her the minute she slipped it on she blessed darcy and her own lack of will it was a long sweep of a dress very simple without a frill or a flounce as it dropped square at the bodice from thin straps and fell with just the most subtle of flares to the ankles the color a silvery blue echoed the hue of midsummer moonlight she wore small pearl drops at her ears more moon symbols she thought she very much wanted to take the rest of mollies advice and dance with aidan under the glow of the full moon but on this the longest day of the year just as evening drifted in the sky remained light and lovely color shimmered outside the cottage window blues and greens achingly vivid the air seemed painted with fragrance nature had decided midsummers eve would be one of her triumphs all jude could think as she watched and listened and absorbed was that there was music playing in her living room bouncing in it soaring through it there were people crowded together in her house dancing and laughing natures triumph she thought was nothing against her own already more than half of her ham had been devoured no one seemed to show any ill effects because of it shed managed a bite or two herself but for the most part was too excited to do more than nibble or sip now and then from her glass of wine couples were dancing in her hallway in the kitchen or out in the yard others juggled babies or just cozied in for a gossip shed tried to play hostess for the first hour moving from group to group to make certain everyone had a glass or a plate but no one seemed to need her to do anything in particular they all helped themselves to the banquet of dishes jammed into the kitchen or set out on the board stretched across sawhorses that some clever soul had set up in the side yard there were children racing around or tucked onto laps a baby might fuss for some milk or attention and both were cheerfully provided more than half the faces that passed through were strange to her she finally did what she realized shed never tried at one of her own parties she sat down and enjoyed it she was jammed up between mollie and kathy duffy half listening to the conversation and forgetting the slice of cake on a plate in her lap shawn was playing a fiddle bright hot licks that made her wish desperately she knew how to dance darcy radiant in the borrowed red dress teased out notes on a flute while aidan pumped music from a small accordion every now and again they switched instruments or brought out another pennywhistles a bodham drum a knee harp slipping from hand to hand without a break in rhythm she liked it best when they added their voices producing such intricate intimate harmony it made her heart ache when aidan sang of young willie macbride being forever nineteen jude thought of maudes lost johnnie and didnt care that she shed tears in public they moved from the heartbreaking to the footstomping never letting the pace flag each time aidan would catch her eye or send her that slow smile she was as starstruck as a teenager when brenna settled down at judes feet and rested her head against her mothers leg jude passed her down the plate of cake hes a way with him when hes into his music brenna murmured makes you forget nearly hes a bonehead theyre wonderful they should record they should be doing this onstage not in a living room shawn plays for his own pleasure if ambition came up and knocked him on the head with a hammer it wouldnt make a dent not everyone wants to do everything at one time mollie said mildly but she stroked brennas hair like you and your father the more you do the more gets done ah youre mick through and through why arent you dancing like your sisters instead of brooding lord girl youre otoole to the bone oh ive some logan in me brightening brenna leaped up and grabbed her mothers hand come on then ma unless youre feeling too old and feeble i can dance you breathless a cheer went up as mollie began a quick complicated series of steps other dancers gave way with claps and whistles mollie was a champion step dancer in her day kathy told jude and she passed it along to her daughters theyre a pretty lot arent they yes oh just look at them one by one mollies girls joined in until they were three by three facing each other they were six small women a mix of the fairhaired and the bright with hands sassily on hips and legs flying the faster the music the faster their feet until jude was out of breath just from watching it wasnt just the skill and the dazzle jude thought that caught at her throat with both envy and admiration it was the connection female to female sister to sister mother to daughter the music was just one more bond it wasnt only legends and myths that made up the traditions of a culture aidan had been right she realized she couldnt forget the music when she wrote of ireland war drums and pub songs ballads and great whirling reels she would have to research them as well their sources their irony their humor and despair she hugged the new inspiration to her and let the music sweep her away by the time they were done the room was crammed with those whod wandered in from other areas of the house or outside and the last note the last sharp stomp of feet were greeted by wild applause brenna staggered over and dropped at judes feet again mas right i cant keep up with her the womans a wonder swiping an arm over her brow she sighed someone have mercy and get me a beer ill get it you earned it jude got to her feet and tried to squeeze her way through to the kitchen she received several requests for a dance that she laughingly declined compliments on her ham that gave her a dazzled glow and on her looks that made her think several of her guests had been enjoying the kegs quite a bit when she finally reached the kitchen she was surprised that aidan was behind her and already had her hand caught in his come outside for a breath of air oh but i told brenna id get her a beer jack take our brenna a pint will you he called it out as he pulled jude through the back door i love listening to you play but you must be tired of it by now i never mind making a few hours of music its the gallagher way he continued to pull her along past the pack of men huddled near the back door toward the curving path of candles nestled in the grass and garden but it hasnt given me time to be with you or to tell you how lovely youre looking tonight you left your hair down he said tangling his fingers in the tips of it it seemed to go better with the dress she shook it back and lifted her face to the sky it was a deep deep blue now the color of a night that would never fully become night because of the white ball of moon a magic night of shadows and light when the faeries came out to dance i cant believe what a state i got myself into over this everyone was right they said it would just happen and it did i guess the best things do she turned when they reached the spot where shed imagined putting an arbor behind them the house her house she thought with warm pride was lit up bright as christmas the music continued to pour out tangled with voices and laughter this is how it should be she murmured a house should have music ill give you music in it whenever you like when she smiled and slipped into his arms he guided her into a dance just as shed dreamed he would it was perfect she thought magic and music and moonlight one long night where the darkness was only a brief flicker if you came to america and played one song youd have a recording contract before youd finished it thats not for me im for here yes you are she leaned back to smile at him indeed she couldnt imagine him anywhere else youre for here and it was the magic and the music and the moonlight that pushed him before he had the words ready and so are you theres no reason for you to go back he eased her away youre happy here ive been very happy here but thats enough right there to keep you whats wrong with just being happy his abrupt tone had her smile turning puzzled nothing of course but i need to work i have to support myself you can find work to content you here she had she thought shed found her lifes work in writing but old habits die hard there doesnt seem to be much call for psychology professors in ardmore at the moment you didnt like doing that he was starting to make her nervous a chill slid up her arms and made her wish for a jacket its what i do what i know how to do so youll figure out how to do something else i want you here with me jude even as her heart gave one wild leap at the words he continued on i need a wife she wasnt sure if the thud was her heart dropping again or just simple shock excuse me i need a wife he repeated i think you should marry me then well figure out the rest of the business later chapter seventeen contents prev next you need a wife she repeated keeping her voice calm spacing the words evenly i do yes it wasnt precisely how hed meant to put it but it was too late now we need each other we mesh well jude theres no point in you going back to a life that didnt satisfy you when you can have one here that does i see no she didnt see she thought it was like trying to look through dark murky water but she was trying to see so you think i should stay here and marry you because you need a wife and i need a life yes no there was something wrong with how shed phrased that something not quite right about the tone of it but he was too flustered to figure it out im saying i could support you well enough until you find the kind of work you enjoy doing or if youd just rather work at making a home instead thats fine as well the pub does well enough im not a pauper and though it may not be the style of living youre accustomed to wed manage it all right wed manage it while you support me in the style im not quite accustomed to support me until i bumble around and find what i might be good at doing look why couldnt he get the words to line up the right way you have a life here is what im saying you have one with me do i she turned away as she struggled to hold back something dark and bubbling that wanted to spew out of her she didnt recognize it wasnt sure she wanted to but she sensed it was dangerous the irish she mused were supposed to be poets to have the most charming of words flow right off the tongue and here for the second time in her life she was being told she should marry a man because it would be good for her william had needed a wife too she remembered to help cement his position to entertain to look presentable and of course shed needed a man to tell her what to do and when and how to do it a wife for one a life for the other what could be more logical the first time shed been told that shed obeyed quietly almost meekly it infuriated and it shamed to remember that it infuriated and it shamed to realize how much a part of her wanted to do the same with aidan but there was more to her now more than shed realized she was making something of herself and by god she intended to finish without being guided gently along because she was so inept at finding her own way ive had time here aidan face composed voice level she turned back to study his face in the silvered light of the swimming moon ive had time with you these months dont make a life and its my life im trying to figure out so i can build on it make something of it and of myself make it with me the quick jolt of desperation stunned him left him floundering you care for me jude of course i do somehow she managed to keep her voice pleasant when she said it though that dark and bubbling brew was still churning inside her marriage is a serious business aidan ive been there and you havent it isnt a commitment i intend to make again thats ridiculous i havent finished her voice was chilly now ice over steel it isnt a commitment i intend to make again she repeated until i trust myself and the man and the circumstances enough to believe its forever i wont be cast aside again do you think i would do such a thing as that angry now he gripped her arms held tight youd stand here and compare me to that bastard who broke his vows to you i have nothing else to compare you to or this to im sorry that annoys you but the fact is marriage isnt in my plans at this time i thank you for the thought now i really should go back inside im neglecting my guests the hell with them well settle this we have settled it keeping that same rigid smile on her face she shoved his hands away if i didnt make myself clear ill try again no i wont marry you aidan but thank you for asking as she said it thunder boomed over the hills and a lance of lightning exploded shooting a flash of thin white cracks across the bowl of the sky she turned to walk into the house while the wind reared up to slap the air and send her chimes into a wild and bitter song odd she thought that her heart felt just the same wild and bitter aidan only stared after her shed said no he simply hadnt prepared himself for the possibility she would say no hed made up his mind that they would marry she was the one for him there would only ever be one the sudden fury of the wind streamed through his hair and the air stung with ozone from the next hurled spear of lightning he stood in the midst of the oncoming storm struggling to clear his head she just needed a bit more time and persuading that was it had to be it he thought as he rubbed the heel of his hand over his heart the ache in it was a new and panicky feeling he didnt care for shed come around of course she would any fool could see they needed to be together he just had to make her see shed be happy here that he would take good care of her that he wouldnt let her down as shed been let down before she was just being cautious that was all hed taken her by surprise but now that she knew his intentions shed grow used to them hed see to it a gallagher didnt retire the field at the first volley he reminded himself they stuck and jude frances murray was about to find out just how hard and how long a gallagher could stick face set he strode back to the house if hed glanced up he might have seen the figure in the window above the woman stood her pale hair around her shoulders and a single tear bright as a diamond sliding down her cheek jude managed to get through the rest of the party she laughed and she danced and she chatted it took no effort to keep herself surrounded by people and avoid another confrontation with aidan it took more to nudge him out the door when people began to leave to make smiling excuses to him about being exhausted she needed to sleep she told him of course she didnt the minute her house was empty she rolled up her sleeves she didnt want to think not yet and the best way to avoid it was good solid work she gathered up plates and glasses from all over the house then washed and dried and put away every one of them it took hours and her body was as exhausted as shed claimed but her mind refused to rest so she continued to push herself wiping scrubbing tidying once she thought she heard the sound of a womans weeping drift down the stairs but she ignored it the despair in it made her own eyes sting and that wouldnt do her own tears wouldnt help lady gwen they wouldnt help anyone she dragged furniture back into place then hauled out the sweeper and vacuumed the floors her face was pale with fatigue her eyes dark with it by the time she climbed the stairs to her bedroom but she hadnt wept and the sheer manual labor had burned off everything but a reeling physical exhaustion still fully dressed she lay down on the bed turned her face into the pillow and willed herself to sleep dreaming of dancing with aidan under the silver light of a magic moon with flowers sweeping out colorful and gay as faeries and the air charmed by their scents riding with him on the broad back of a white winged horse over glistening green fields stormy seas and placid lakes of impossible blue this is what he offered her she heard him tell her this a country that fascinates and calms a home waiting to be built a family waiting to be made take them and me but the answer was no had to be no it was not her country not her home not her family couldnt be until there was strength in her trust in them love from him then she was alone in the dream standing at the window while the rain washed the glass because in all the promises hed made there had not been a single word of love when she awoke the sun was streaming bright and the sound of the womans weeping was her own her mind was fuzzy from lack of sleep and her body felt frail as if shed awakened old and ill selfpity jude thought recognizing the symptoms all too well encroaching depression after her marriage had been yanked out from under her feet shed fallen into that pattern for weeks restless nights endless unhappy days clouds of misery and embarrassment not this time she promised herself she was in control now making her own decisions and the first was not to wallow not even for an hour she gathered up flowers tied a pretty ribbon around their stems and with finn and betty for company set out on the walk to maudes grave the storm that had threatened the night before had never struck though there were still some clouds brooding in the southwest the air was beautifully warm the sea sang out its song and on the hills the buttercups sunned their faces she spotted a whitetailed rabbit seconds before the yellow hound scented it betty took off a sleek bullet after the bounding white blur only to romp back moments later her tongue lolled in a sheepish expression as if she was embarrassed to have once again been lured into the chase five minutes of watching the puppy race around betty tumble and yip put jude in a better mood by the time she reached the grave site she was soothed and sat down as was now her habit to tell maude the latest news we had a wonderful ceili last night everyone said it was good to have music in the cottage again and people two of brenna otooles sisters came with their young men they look so happy all four of them and mollie just beams when she looks at them oh and i danced with mr riley he seems so old and frail i was afraid id just shatter him but i could barely keep up laughing she shook her hair back then settled down on her heels for the visit then he asked me to marry him so i know im accepted here i baked a ham it was the very first time i ever did and it worked i didnt even have scraps left for the dogs late in the evening shawn gallagher sang four green fields there wasnt a dry eye ive never given a party where people laughed and cried and sang and danced now i dont know why anyone gives any other kind why dont you tell her about aidan jude looked up slowly it didnt surprise her to see carrick standing on the other side of maudes grave another wonder she supposed that such a thing didnt seem the least odd to her now but she raised her brows because there was temper glittering in his eyes and a snarl on his mouth aidan was there she said calmly he played and sang beautifully and brought enough beer from the pub to float a battleship and the man took you out in the moonlight and asked you to be his wife well more or less he took me out in the moonlight and said he needed a wife and i would fill the bill jude glanced down as her puppy sniffed around carricks soft brown boots and what was your answer jude folded her hands on her knee if you know that much you know the rest no the word exploded out of him and the grass shivered and lay flat you tell him no because you havent the sense of a carrot he jabbed a finger at her and though they were feet apart she still felt the impatient stab of it against her shoulder i took you for a bright woman one with a fine mind and manner with a good strong heart as well now i see youre fickle and fainthearted and mulish since you think so little of me i wont subject you to my company she got to her feet jerked up her chin then gasped when she turned and rapped straight into him youll stay where you are madam until youre given leave otherwise for the first time she heard royalty in his tone the threat and power of it because she wanted to tremble she stood her ground leave im free to come and go as i please this is my world as his eyes flashed with fury the skies shuddered and went stormdark its been mine since your kind still huddled in caves it will be mine long after youre dust have a care and remember that why am i arguing with you youre an illusion a myth and as real as you he gripped her hand and his flesh was firm and warm ive waited for you a hundred years times three if im wrong and must wait for another to begin it ill know why youll tell me now why you said no when the man asked you to wife because that was my choice choice he let out a half laugh and turned away from her oh you mortals and your blessed choices theyre always such a matter to you fate will have you in the end anyway maybe but well choose our own direction in the meantime even if its the wrong direction she smiled a little as he turned back to her his handsome face was such a study in honest puzzlement yes even if its wrong its our nature carrick we cant change our nature do you love him when she hesitated it was his turn to smile would you bother to lie colleen to an illusion and a myth no i wont lie i love him he threw up his hands and groaned but you wont belong to him i wont be anyones convenience ever again her voice rose snapped with a different kind of power the belonging if it ever happens will be on both sides and be complete i gave myself once to a man who didnt love me because it seemed the sensible thing to do and because she closed her eyes a moment realizing shed never admitted it never once even to herself because i was afraid no one ever would i was afraid id always be alone nothing seemed more frightening to me than being alone thats just not true anymore im learning how to be alone and to like myself to respect who i am so the fact that you can be alone means you must be no she threw up her hands this time whirled around to pace men she muttered why does everything have to be explained step by step to men i dont have to be married to be happy and im certainly not going to change the life ive just started risk marriage again and throw myself into someone elses vision unless i damn well want to until i know i come first for a change me jude frances murray her voice rose as she jabbed a hand at her own heart and carricks eyes went narrow and thoughtful im not settling for one inch less than all just because im in love with aidan just because were lovers doesnt mean im going to swoon from the thrill of being told hes decided he needs a goddamn wife and im the one hes picked out ill do the picking out this time thank you very much flushed and out of breath she glared at carrick and there she realized was everything she hadnt put into words before hadnt understood was inside her to be put into words she would never never again settle for less than everything i thought it was mortals i didnt understand carrick said after a moment but im thinking now its just female mortals i dont understand so explain this to me would you jude frances why isnt love enough she let out a quiet sigh it is when it is why are you speaking in riddles because until you solve it yourself it doesnt do any good to be told and when you do solve it you dont need to be told he muttered something in gaelic shook his head heed this a single choice can build destinies or destroy them choose well then flicking his wrists he vanished in a ripple on the air aidan was no less frustrated with women than carrick at that moment if someone had told him his ego was badly bruised he would have laughed at them if someone had told him that was panic that kept sneaking up to tickle the back of his throat he would have cursed them as a lying fool if theyd mentioned that the clutching around his heart was hurt hed have snarled them out of the pub but it was all those things he felt and confusion along with them hed been so certain that he understood jude her mind and heart as well as her body it was lowering to realize hed missed a step somewhere it was true enough hed jumped his fences so to speak but he hadnt expected her to be so cool and casual in her response to his proposal for christs sake hed proposed marriage to a woman to the woman and shed smiled and said no thank you as pretty as you please then gone back to the ceili his sweet and shy jude frances hadnt stammered and blushed but had eyed him with cool consideration then had turned him down flat it didnt make a bit of sense when any fool could see they belonged together like two links in a long and complicated chain it was a chain he could envision perfectly one of sturdy continuity and tradition man to woman generation to generation she was the one he was meant to be with so that together they could forge the next links on that long chain a different approach altogether was needed he told himself as he paced his rooms instead of finishing up the days paperwork he knew how to woo and win a woman didnt he hed wooed and hed won plenty before of course that had been for entirely different purposes he thought and began to worry again but not so much he admitted to himself not yet that he was a babe in the woods in the matter of wooing a woman into a wife he heard footsteps on the stairs minutes before darcy as was her habit breezed in without knocking shawns down the kitchen and considering me his errand girl sent me up to see if youve ordered potatoes and carrots and if weve any more whitefish coming in from patty ryan by weeks end as hes plans for it patty promised us fresh fish tomorrow and the rest will be coming by middle week he hasnt starting cooking tonights menu already has he its barely half one no but hes fussing about studying some recipe one of the ladies gave him last night at the ceili and leaving the bulk of the serving to me are you coming down to man the bar or are you just going to sit around up here and stare at the walls i was working he said more than a little put out for hed been spending considerable time staring at the walls anytime you want to take over the paperwork here sweetheart you just say the word the tone of his voice had her wondering knowing she was leaving shawn and their afternoon help in the lurch she flopped down in a chair and tossed her legs over the arm i leave the figuring to you since youre so wise and clever then leave me to it and go down and do your part ive a tenminute break coming and since i find myself here here im taking it she smiled at him much too sweetly to be trusted what are you brooding about then im not brooding she only lifted a hand and casually examined her nails he paced to the window back to the desk and to the window again when the silence did the job youve gotten close to jude the past couple of months i have yes her smile sharpened not as close as you in a manner of speaking did you have a spat is that whats got you pacing about up here and scowling no we didnt have a spat exactly he jammed his hands in his pockets oh it was humiliating but what choice did he have what does she say about me darcy didnt snicker out loud but her head filled with laughter as she batted her eyelashes at her brother that would be telling im no blabbermouth an extra hour off saturday next instantly darcy sat up and her eyes were crafty well why didnt you say so what do you want to know what does she think of me oh she thinks youre handsome and charming and nothing i can say will turn her mind to the truth of it youve swept her off her feet with the romance of it that carrying her up the stairs was a fine move she did laugh when she saw his pained expression dont ask what women talk of together if you dont want to know he managed one careful breath she didnt go on about the after of it oh every sigh and murmur unable to stop herself she jumped up grabbed his face and kissed him of course not you peabrain shes too discreet for that though brenna and i did pump her a bit whats worrying you as far as i can tell jude thinks youre the greatest lover since solomon took sheba is that all it is then sex and romance and being swept along for a few months nothing but that the amusement faded from her eyes as she looked into his im sorry darling youre truly upset what happened i asked her to marry me last night you did instantly she leaped on him wrapping her legs around his waist her arms around his neck squeezing like a delighted boa constrictor oh but this is wonderful i couldnt be happier for you laughing she gave him smacking kisses on both cheeks lets go down to the kitchen and tell shawn and call ma and dad she said no theyll want to come back and meet her before the wedding and then well all what his heart sank deeper in his chest as darcy gaped at him she said no guilt all but swallowed her she couldnt have she didnt mean it she said it clear enough and was polite and added a thank you oh and that thank you was a bitter pill well what the devils wrong with her abruptly furious darcy wiggled down and planted fists on her hips rage as she knew well was always a more comfortable fit than guilt of course she wants to marry you she said she didnt she said she didnt want marriage at all its the fault of that bloody bastard who left her compared me to him and when i called her there she said how she had nothing else to compare to well compare me to no one by christ im who i am of course you are and ten times the man that william is her fault she thought again shed seen the fun of it but hadnt counted on the pain it wasnt it wasnt just that she didnt want to leave her life in america then we never got that far and why wouldnt she when shes happy here as she never was there well darcy huffed out her breath and tried to think it through it hadnt occurred to me that she wouldnt want marriage shes just not thinking beyond what happened before i know it hurt her and id like to wring the mans neck for it emotions swirled into his eyes but i wont hurt her no he would treasure and tend as he did all the things he loved darcy thought aching for him maybe it is in part a wound that isnt quite healed but the fact is not all women want a ring and a baby under the apron she wanted to get up and stroke and hug him into some comfort but could see there was too much temper in his eyes yet for him to accept petting i understand her feelings on that aidan on the borders of it the finality its not an end but a beginning for you it would be but it isnt for everyone darcy sat back drummed her fingers well im a good judge and im saying our judes the marrying kind whether she believes it or not at the moment a nester she is whos never had a chance to make that nest if youre asking me before she came here on her own maybe we moved a bit faster than we should we you i mean darcy corrected as she thought of the plotting shed done with brenna no need to mention that she decided since it seemed the mess made wasnt her fault entirely but its too late to change that so youll just have to move forward persuade her she smiled again take some time on it but let her see what shed be giving up if she didnt grab what youre offering youre a gallagher aidan gallaghers get what they want sooner or later youre right pieces of his shattered ego began to slide back into place theres no moving back now ill just have to help her get used to the idea relieved to see the gleam back in his eyes darcy patted his cheek my wagers on you chapter eighteen contents prev next she wouldnt be expecting him not so early in any case but since darcy was being so cooperative aidan had taken off a couple of hours before closing to walk the road to judes cottage the night was balmy with the breeze from the sea clouds sailed briskly over the sky so that patches of stars winked out glimmered then vanished the moon was round and fat its light gentle a fine night aidan thought for romancing the woman you intended to marry hed brought her a clutch of fairy roses in delicate pink that hed stolen from kathy duffys garden he didnt think the woman would mind the loss when it was going to such a good cause there were lights glowing in her windows a warm and welcome sight to him he imagined that in years to come when they were married and settled it would be the same hed walk home after work and shed be waiting with the lights burning to guide his step it no longer surprised him how much he wanted that or how clearly he could see it all night following night year following year toward a lifetime he didnt knock such formalities had already slipped away between them he noted that shed already tidied from the party it was so like her he thought with affection everything was neat and orderly and just as it should be he heard music drifting down the stairs and walked up toward it she was in her little office with the radio playing soft and the pup snoring at her feet under the table her hair was bound back her fingers moving briskly over computer keys he had an urge to scoop her into his arms and gobble her whole but he didnt think that was the right move under the circumstances persuasion he reminded himself didnt come from the fast and the hot but the slow and the warm he crossed to her moving quietly then bent down to brush a soft kiss on the nape of her neck she jolted but hed anticipated that and chuckling wrapped his arms around her so the flowers were under her chin and his mouth was at her ear you look so pretty sitting here a ghra working away into the night what tale are you spinning out oh i her heart was in her throat he was right that she hadnt expected him not just so early but at all she knew shed been abrupt and rude and even cold and had convinced herself that what had been between them was done shed even begun to mourn for it yet here he was bringing her flowers and speaking softly in her ear its ah the story of the pooka and paddy mcnee that mr riley told me these are lovely aidan since she was far from ready for anyone to see her work she tipped the top of the computer down then sniffed the roses im glad you like them as theyre stolen goods and the garda may come by at any moment to arrest me ill pay your bail she turned in the chair to look at him he wasnt angry she noted with puzzled relief a man couldnt smile like that if he was angry ill go put them in water and make you some tea when she rose the pup turned over with a grumble and a groan and recurled himself as a guard dog hes a pure failure aidan commented hes just a baby she took the flowers as they walked downstairs and ive nothing to guard anyway it was such a pleasure to slide back into routine the friendliness and flirtation part of her wanted to bring up what happened the night before but she tucked it away why mention something that put them at odds he was probably regretting that hed asked her and relieved that shed said no for some reason that line of thinking had that dark nasty brew bubbling inside her again she ordered herself to settle down and tucked the pink roses into a pale blue bottle as she did she noticed the time and frowned its barely ten oclock did you close the pub no i took a couple hours im entitled now and then and i missed you he added laying his hands on her waist for you didnt come see me i was working didnt think youd want to see me werent we angry with each other she wondered even as he bent down to brush his lips over hers and ive interrupted but since that deed is done he drew back come walking with me wont you jude frances walking now aye he was already circling her toward the back door a lovely night it is for walking its dark she said but she was out the door theres light moon and stars the best kind of light ill tell you a story of the faerie queen who only came out from her palace at night when there was a moon to guide her steps for even faeries can have spells cast on them and hers was that she was cursed to take the form of a white bird during the day as they walked her hand linked with his he spun it out for her painting the picture of the lonely queen wandering by night and the black wolf she found wounded at the base of the cliffs he had eyes of emerald green that watched her warily but her heart couldnt resist and overcame any fear she tended to him using her art and her skill to heal his hurts from that night he became her companion walking the hills and the rock with her night after night until as dawn shimmered over the sea she left him with a flutter of white wings and a sorrowful call that came from her broken heart was there no way to break the spell oh theres always a way isnt there he lifted their joined hands to his lips kissed her knuckles then drew her along toward the cliff path where the sea began to roar and the wind fly moonlight splattered on the high wild grass and the path cut between it turned pebbles into silver coins and weathered stone into hunched elves she let aidan guide her up while she waited for him to start the story again one morning a young man was hunting in the fields for he was hungry and had no more than his quiver of arrows and his bow to feed him game had been scarce for many days and that day as others the rabbits and deer eluded him until it came to afternoon and his hunger was great it was then he saw the white bird soaring and thinking only of his belly he notched his arrow in his bow loosed the arrow and brought her down mind your step here darling thats the way but he cant have killed her ive not finished yet have i he turned to pull her up then he held her there a moment just held her as she fit so well against him she let out a cry filled with pain and despair that ripped at his heart even as his head reeled from lack of food he raced to her and found her watching him with eyes blue as a lake his hands trembled as they were eyes he knew and he began to understand turning jude tucking her under his arm he began to walk again under the splattering light of star and moon though he was half starved he did what he could to heal the wound hed made and took the bird to the shelter of these cliffs and building a fire to warm her he sat guarding her and waited for sunset when they reached the top aidan slipped an arm around her so they could look out at the dark sea together water rolled in then back then in again a rhythm constant primitive sexual and understanding that aidans stories had their rhythm too jude lifted a hand to cover his what happened next what happened was this as the sun dipped and night reached out for day she began to change as did he so woman became bird and man wolf and for one instant they reached for each other but hand passed through hand and the change was complete so it went through the night with her too feverish and weak to heal herself and the wolf never left her side but stayed to warm her with his body and guard her with his life if need be are you cold he asked as she shivered no she whispered touched theres more yet night passed into day again and again day into night and each time they had only that instant to reach for each other and be denied he never left her side to eat as man or as wolf and so was near to dying himself sensing it she used what power she had left to strengthen him to save him rather than herself for the love she felt for him meant more than her life once again dawn shimmered in the sky and the change began once again they reached for each other knowing it was hopeless and her knowing she would never see another sunrise but this time the sacrifice theyd both made was rewarded hands met fingers clasped and they looked on each other finally man to woman woman to man and the first words they spoke were of love happyeverafter better he who had been a king in his own right of a faroff land took his faerie queen to wife never did they spend a single sunset or a single sunrise apart for the rest of their days that was lovely she laid her head on his shoulder and so is this its my place or so i thought of it when i was a boy and would come clambering up here to look out at the world and dream of where id go in it where did you want to go everywhere he turned his face into her hair and thought that now here was everywhere enough for him but for her it was different where do you want to go jude i dont know ive never really thought about it think now then he shifted her then settled down with her on a rock of all the places there are what do you want to see venice she didnt know where that had come from and laughed at herself to realize it had been in her mind ready to pop out i think id like to see venice with its wonderful buildings and grand cathedrals and mysterious canals and the wine country in france all those acres of vineyards with grapes ripening the old farmhouses and gardens and england london of course for the museums the history but the countryside more cornwall the hills and the cliffs to breathe the air where arthur was born no tropical islands and baking beaches or exotic ports of call for his jude frances now aidan noted it was romance and again tradition with the hint of legend that she wanted none of those places is so very far from where were sitting now why dont you come away with me jude and well see them oh sure well just fly off to venice tonight and wend our way back through france and england well now tonight might be a bit of a problem but the rest is what i had in mind would you mind waiting till september what are you talking about a honeymoon was what he nearly said but he thought it best to be cautious for the time being about you coming away with me he had her hand again nibbling along her fingers as he smiled at her over them about you flying off with me to places of romance and mystery and legend ill show you tintagal where arthur was conceived the night merlin worked his magic on uther so ygraine thought she was greeting her own husband and well stay in one of those farmhouses in france and drink their wine and make love in a big feather bed then well stroll along the canal in venice and wonder at the grand cathedrals wouldnt you like that sweetheart yes of course it sounded glorious magical like another of his stories its just impossible why would that be because i have work and so do you he chuckled then switched his attentions from her fingers to the side of her jaw and do you think my pub would crumble or your work vanish whats two weeks or so in the grand scheme of things after all yes thats true but ive seen those places you spoke of he moved to her mouth to quietly seduce now i want to see them with you his hands skimmed over her face and he began to lose himself in her the tastes and textures of her come away with me a ghra he murmured it drawing her closer when she shivered i im supposed to go back to chicago dont his mouth grew hotter more possessive be with me well her thoughts wouldnt line up every time she tried to align one it tumbled down scattering others yes i suppose what was a couple of weeks after all in september if youre sure im sure he got to his feet then plucked her off the rock grinning when she gave a gasp and locked her arms around his neck are you thinking id be dropping you now that ive got you i take better care of whats mine than that of what was his the phrase worried her a bit but before she could think of how to respond she saw the figure behind them aidan her voice was barely more than a breath he tensed tucked her under his arm to defend then turning relaxed again the lady barely made a ripple on the air as she walked but her pale hair gleamed in the moonlight as did the tears lady gwen out looking for the love she lost pity stirred in his heart when he saw the tears glittering on her cheeks as he does i saw him again today i spoke with him youre becoming right chummy with faeries jude frances she felt the wind on her face could smell the sea aidans arm was strong and warm around her yet it seemed like an illusion that would vanish the moment she blinked i keep thinking ill wake up in my own bed in chicago and this all of this would have been some long complex dream i think it would break my heart then your hearts safe he bent his head to kiss her this is no dream and youve my word on it it must hurt her to see lovers here she looked back the ladys gilded hair was flying and her cheeks were wet they dont have even that instant at dawn or sunset to reach out a single choice can build destinies or destroy them when she looked up at him startled to hear him echo carricks words to her he stroked her hair come lets go back she makes you sad yes she does jude clung to aidans hand now for going down was trickier than going up i wish i could talk to her and i cant believe im casually saying i wish i could talk to a ghost but i do id like to ask her what she feels and thinks and wishes and what she would change her tears tell me she would change everything no women cry for all manner of reasons to change everything shed have to give up the children shed carried inside her raised and loved i dont think she could do that would do that carrick asked too much of her and he doesnt understand that maybe one day he will then theyll find each other he only asked what he needed and would have given all he had youre thinking like a man well its a man i am so how else would think it made her laugh that hint of irritated pride in his voice exactly as you do and because a woman thinks like a woman it explains why the two species are as often at odds as they are in sync i dont mind being at odds off and on as it keeps things more interesting and since im thinking like a man right now he swept her up into his arms and muffled her surprised gasp with his mouth how could a kiss be gentle and searing at the same time she wondered so gentle it had tears swimming to her eyes so hot it liquefied the bones she let herself slide into it a warm pool with flames licking at the edges do you want me jude tell me you want me yes i want you i always want you she was already neckdeep in that pool and slipping under make love with me here he chewed restlessly on her bottom lip here in the moonlight mmmm she started to consent then surfaced with a shot an incautious diver clawing into the air here outside he would have been amused by her reaction but the seduction hed begun had circled around to claim him here on the grass with the night breathing around us still holding her he knelt and with his mouth roaming her face murmured to her give yourself to me but what if someone comes by theres no one but us in the whole world no one else his hands moved over her and his mouth even as she opened her own to protest he spoke again ive such a need for you let me show you let me have you the grass was so soft and he was so warm to be needed was such a miracle so much more important than sense and modesty there was a tenderness in his hands as he stroked her slowly slowly heating her blood his mouth brushed over hers whispering of promises and suddenly there was no one else in the world and no need for there to be lazily she lifted her arms as he drew off her sweater when he trailed his fingertips down her body her eyes grew heavy her body slumberous he slipped off her shoes her slacks undressing her without hurry and letting his hands touch and linger where they liked until it seemed her skin hummed she lay naked in the grass moonlight sprinkling over her when she reached for him he drew her up i want to unbind your hair to watch it tumble down he kept his eyes on hers as he freed it do you remember the first time yes i remember now i know what pleases you he pressed his lips to her shoulder then let her hair riot down to curtain his face and smother him with silk and scent lie back on the grass and let me pleasure you his teeth scraped lightly down the side of her neck as he lowered her again ill give you all i have he could have feasted but instead he only sipped long luxurious kisses that shuddered into the soul and drew soft moans from it and at each moan he went deeper he could have ravished but instead he seduced slow tender caresses that slid over the skin and sent it quivering and at each quiver he lingered she lost herself in him in the delightfully dizzy mix of senses and sensations cool grass and warm flesh fragrant breezes and husky whispers strong hands and patient lips she watched the moon soar overhead a gleaming white ball against a deep blue sky chased by tattered wisps of clouds she heard the call of an owl a deep demanding cry and felt the echo of it leap into her blood as he urged her up and up to that first rippling crest she sang out his name floating as the high warm wave cascaded through her go higher he was desperate to watch her fly to know that he could send her up until her eyes were wild and blind and her body quaking go higher he demanded again and drove her there more ruthlessly than hed intended heat flashed into her a star exploding the shock of pleasure was so intense so unexpected after the tenderness her body reared up half in protest half in delight this time it wasnt a moan that escaped her but a scream aidan she gripped him for balance as her world went mad and they rolled over i cant again he dragged her head back by the hair and savaged her mouth again until were both empty the hands that had been so gentle dug into her hips lifted her tell me you want me inside you me and no one else yes she was frantic all but weeping as her body bowed back you and no one else then take me he drew her down until she was filled with him until the glory of it burst through her her breath tore from his throat as she arched back her body silvered by the moon light her hair rained back in a dark tangle she lifted her arms a gesture of abandon tangling her own fingers in those tumbling curls then her body began to rock to move to seek the power was hers now the control of each whip of pleasure as his body rose and fell to her pace she let herself take his muscles trembled as she stroked her hands over him his eyes seemed dark as the night as she leaned close to torment his mouth as he had hers the low groan she ripped from him had her laughing in triumph higher she braced herself over him this time ill take you higher boldly she took his hands closed them over her breasts touch me touch me everywhere while i take you she guided his hands where she wanted them reveling in the feel of them over her slickened skin as she rode him closer and closer to the edge she felt his body plunge helplessly under her heard his breath strangle in a gasp and thrilled with what shed done to him let herself leap after it was he who shuddered he whose hands slid limply away when she lowered to nuzzle her mouth to his when she pressed her lips to his throat she felt the wild beat of his pulse then with a sound of triumph she drew back and threw her arms high oh god i feel wonderful people should always make love outside its so liberating you look like a faerie queen yourself i feel like one she shook her hair back then looked down to smile at him full of magic and marvelous secrets im so glad youre not angry with me i was sure you would be angry how could i be he gathered enough energy to sit up so he could hold her torso to torso everything about you delights me she snuggled closer still flying on the pleasure of the moment you werent delighted with me last night no i cant say i was but since weve straightened it all out its nothing to worry us straightened it out aye here lets get you back into your jumper before you get cold what do you mean she broke off as he dragged her sweater over her head there thats all youll need as im going to get it off you again as soon as we get inside he began to gather clothes and bundle them into her arms aidan what do you mean weve straightened it all out just that we have smiling easily he picked her up and carried her toward the cottage well be married in september what wait i am till september he nudged open her garden gate were not getting married in september oh we are yes then well go off to the places you want to see aidan thats not what i meant it was what i meant he smiled at her again pleased hed found just the way to handle the situation i dont mind if you need to wiggle around it for a while darling not when we both know its whats meant put me down no not quite yet he carried her inside and started up the stairs im not marrying you in september well its only a few months away so we wont have long to see whos right in the matter its insulting and its infuriating that you simply assume ill fall in line with your plans and that im too stupid to know what i want for myself i dont think youre stupid at all he walked down to the bathroom fact is darling i believe youre one of the smartest people i know a bit stubborn is all but i dont mind that he hitched her up a bit so he could reach out and turn on the shower you dont mind that she repeated not at all just as i dont mind having your eyes shoot darts at me as they are at the moment i find it stimulating put me down aidan all right he obliged by setting her in the tub right under the stream from the shower damn it dont worry about the jumper ill take care of it and laughing while she shoved and wiggled he stripped it off and tossed it with a wet plop onto the floor keep your hands off me i want to settle this youve settled it in your mind just as i have in mine i say i want my way more than you want what youre thinking is yours but he brushed the wet hair out of her face if youre so sure of yourself youve nothing to worry about and we can just enjoy the time we spend together that isnt the point are you saying you dont enjoy being with me yes of course i do but or that you dont know your own mind i certainly know my own mind he pressed still curved lips to her brow her temples well then whats wrong with giving me at least the chance to change it i dont know but there had to be something wrong with it didnt there reason she decided cool reason even if she was standing naked in the shower were not talking about a whim here aidan i take all of this very seriously and i dont intend to change my mind all right then in the fine irish tradition well wager on it a hundred pounds says you will im not betting on such a thing he lifted a shoulder carelessly then picked up the soap if youre afraid to risk your money im not she hissed out at him trying to see exactly where hed turned things around and trapped her make it two hundred pounds done he kissed the tip of her nose to seal it chapter nineteen contents prev next it was ridiculous she had actually bet money on whether or not she would marry aidan it was laughable and annoying and not a little embarrassing temper had pushed her into it which was odd in itself she usually had such a mild and easily controllable temper she would forget the bet entirely of course when the time came what point would there be in making herself or aidan feel foolish by bringing it up for now she had chores and work to concentrate on she needed to take finn for a walk and return the dishes that mollie otoole had brought to her party it was time to call home and check in with her family then if the weather held shed set up her outside work area she wanted to write down the story aidan had told her the night before already she had the rhythm of it in her head and the images of the white bird and the black wolf she doubted she would do them justice but she needed to try she gathered the dishes along with a container of sugar cookies shed baked ready to set out she glanced around for the dog just in time to see him squat under the kitchen table and pee naturally hed missed the paper by two feet couldnt have waited one more minute could you she only chuckled when he cheerfully thumped his tail then she set the dishes down again to deal with the puddle he had to leap and lick at her face and make growling sounds while she scrubbed it up which made her forget to scold him since cuddling him made her as happy as it made him she spent ten minutes nuzzling wrestling and scratching his belly shed spoil him of course jude admitted but who could have known she had all this love inside her she needed to give im nearly thirty she murmured as she stroked finns long silky ears i want a home i want a family i want them with a man who loves me outrageously she cuddled as finn wiggled around to lick her hand i cant settle again i cant take a life in pieces just because it looks like the best i can get so she picked finn up to rub her nose against his for right now its just you and me pal the minute she opened the back door he was off like a spotted arrow it delighted her to see him race even if his first sprint was directly toward her flowers he stopped skidding and tumbling when she called his name sharply she considered it progress that he flattened only one row of ageratum finn darted ahead of her darted back raced in circles around her feet then zigged and zagged off to sniff at everything of interest she imagined how hed look when he grew into his feet a big handsome dog with a whipcord tail who loved to run the hills what in gods name was she going to do with him in chicago shaking her head she pushed that worry aside there was no point in thinking of something that would spoil the pleasure of her walk the air was crystal with the sun sliding and streaming through clouds on their way to england she caught glimpses of ardmore bay rolling dark green toward shore if she stopped concentrated she could almost hear its music in the shimmering silence tourists would flock to the beaches today and some of the locals as well if they had an hour or two to spare young mothers she thought letting their toddlers dip their toes in the surf or fill their red plastic buckets with sand castles would be built today then washed away by the sea the hedgerows that lined the road were ripe with summer blossoms and the grass beneath her feet was springy and sparkled with morning dew to the north the mountains hulked under the clouds that covered their peaks and between them and jude it seemed the green glorious hills rolled forever she loved the look of them the simple and sheer beauty of land the tumble of old castles that had been swamped not by sea but by time and enemy they made her think of knights and maidens of kings both petty and grand of merry servants and clever spies and of course of magic and witchcraft and the songs of faeries more tales to be told she mused of sacrifices for love and glory of the triumph of the heart and of honor of spells cast and broken in a place like this a storyteller could spend years collecting them creating them and passing them on she could spend silvery mornings like this one roaming and imagining rainy afternoons writing and compiling evenings would be for curling up after a satisfying day and finding pictures in the turf fire or wandering into the pub for noise and company and music it would be such a lovely life full of interest and beauty and dreams she stopped short startled by the thought more startled yet that the thought had been in her head at all she could stay not just for three more months but forever she could write stories the ones that were told to her and the ones that seemed always forming in her head no of course she couldnt what was she thinking of she let out a laugh but it was edgy and weak she had to go back to chicago as planned to find work in some area of the field she knew to support her sensibly while she pursued the dream to consider anything else was completely irresponsible why shed only taken two more steps when that question struck out why she said it out loud flustered of course theres a reason why a dozen reasons why i live in chicago ive always lived in chicago there was no law that said she had to live in chicago she wouldnt be chained in a dungeon for relocating of course not but i have to work and what have you been doing these past three months thats not work not really her stomach began to jitter her heart to flutter toward her throat its more of an indulgence why she closed her eyes because i love it i love everything about it so that must make it an indulgence and that is incredibly stupid it might have been an odd place for an epiphany on a shaggy hill in the middle of the morning but she decided it was the perfect place for hers why cant i do something i love without putting restrictions on it why cant i live somewhere thats so much more home than anywhere else whos in charge of my life she said on a baffled laugh if im not with her knees a little shaky she began to walk again she could do it if she could dig down and find the courage she could sell her condo she could do what shed been avoiding out of fear of failure and send a sample of her work to an agent she could finally stick win or lose with something she wanted for herself she would think about it seriously carefully walking faster she ignored the voice in her head that urged her to act now right away before she could find excuses it would be a big move she reasoned an enormous step a sensible person thought through big moves and enormous steps jude was grateful when she saw the otoole cottage over the hill she needed the distraction something to take her mind off herself for a while clothes were already drying on the line making her wonder if mollie did laundry twentyfour hours a day the gardens were in glorious bloom and the little shed as stuffed and jumbled as ever betty rose from her morning nap in the yard and gave a welcoming woof that sent finn into devoted yips as he streaked down the hill toward her jude started after and had just reached the edge of the yard when the kitchen door opened well good morning to you jude mollie sent her a wave youre up and about early today not as early as you from the looks of things you have yourself a houseful of chattering girls and a man who likes his tea before his eyes are open you dont have much chance to stay in bed come in have some tea and visit with me while i make my bread i brought your dishes back and some of the sugar cookies i made yesterday i think theyre better than the last batch well sample them with the tea and see she held the door open wide and jude walked into the warmth and the scents and the clatter of brenna wielding tools under the kitchen sink ive about got it now ma so youd better mollie moved to the stove i tell you jude im the shoemakers wife in this house off himself goes as does this girl here fixing and fiddling with everyone elses matter while i live with drips and rattles day and night well you dont pay a body a living wage now do you brenna said and earned a light kick from her mother a living wage is it and who ate a mountain of eggs and a tower of toast and jam just this morning i only did so id have my mouth full and not tell maureen to stop her harping on the wedding plans the girls driving us all batty jude fussing and whining and bursting into tears for no reason at all getting marrieds plenty of reason for all of the above mollie set out the tea and cookies nodded for jude to sit then plunged her hands back into the ball of dough she was kneading and when your time comes youll be worse yet ha if i was thinking of marriage id haul the man before the priest say the words and be done with it brenna declared all this fancy work dresses and flowers and just which song needs to be played just when months in the making for one single day for a dress that will never be worn again flowers that will fade and wither and songs you could sing any damn time she scooted out from under the sink and gestured with her wrench and the cost of it all is sinful ah brenna you romantic fool mollie sprinkled more flour onto her dough and turned it that one single day is the start of a life and worth every minute of time and every penny that goes into it but she sighed a little still it does get wearying dealing with her nerves exactly brenna put the wrench in her dented toolbox and rose to snatch one of the cookies look at our jude here calm as you please you dont hear her blathering on about whether shell have white roses or pink in her bouquet brenna bit into the cookie and dropped into a chair youre a sensible woman thank you i try but what are you talking about the difference between you and my flighty sister the both of you have weddings coming up but are you pacing around the room wringing your hands and changing your mind about the flavor of the cake every two minutes of course not no jude said slowly im not because i dont have a wedding coming up even if you and aidan have a small ceremony though how youd pull that off when he knows every second soul for a hundred kilometers its still a wedding jude had to take a breath then another where did you get the idea that im marrying aidan from darcy brenna leaned forward for another cookie she had it straight from the horses mouth the horses ass is more apt at the snap of her tone brenna blinked and mollie paused in her kneading before brenna could speak mollie shot out a warning look fill your mouth with that biscuit lass before you put the rest of your foot in it but darcy said perhaps darcy misunderstood no i dont imagine she did temper leaped into judes throat when she couldnt choke it down again she shoved away from the table and got to her feet where does a man get that kind of nerve that much arrogance most are born with it brenna said then ducked her head and winced at her mothers hiss i have to say jude that i myself thought thats where the two of you were heading seeing the way you are with each other mollie kept her voice soothing and her eyes keen on judes face when brenna told us at dinner last night not one of us was surprised but we were pleased told you at dinner jude stopped at the table braced her palms on it and leaned into brennas face you told your whole family well i didnt see how who else how many people have you told this ridiculous story to i brenna cleared her throat having a rare temper herself she recognized the danger signs when they were stuck in her face i cant recall precisely not many a few hardly anyone at all we were so pleased you see darcy and myself as were so fond of you and aidan and knowing how aidan can plod about before he gets to the center of things hoped that the ceili might give him a bit of a boost the ceili aye midsummers eve and the moon and such you remember ma she turned to mollie with a desperate look in her eye remember how you told us the way dad proposed to you when you were dancing in the moonlight at a ceili and at old maudes cottage too i do yes and she began to see with a quiet smile she patted her daughters shoulder you meant well didnt you yes we ow wincing brenna grabbed the nose her mother had just twisted thats to remind you to keep that nose of yours out of other peoples business however well meant its not her fault jude lifted her hands to her hair and barely resisted pulling it out its aidans fault what is he thinking of telling his sister were getting married i said no didnt i very plainly and several times you said no brenna and mollie said together with mirror looks of shock i see what hes doing i see what hes up to she whirled away to stalk around the room again he needs a wife and im available so thats it im just to fall in line because after all i obviously have no backbone well hes wrong about that ive got one maybe i havent used it much but its there im not marrying him or anyone im never going to be told what to do again or where to live or how to live or what to be not ever ever again mollie studied the flushed face the fisted hands and nodded slowly well now good for you why dont you take a bit of a breath now darling and sit down here drink your tea and tell us as were all friends exactly what happened ill tell you what happened then you she added jabbing a finger at brenna you can go down to the village and tell everyone just what a brainless fool aidan gallagher is and that jude murray wouldnt have him on a platter i can do that brenna agreed with a cautious smile fine jude took that breath then sat down to tell the tale it helped a great deal to vent to friends it took the sharpest edge off her temper strengthened her resolve and gave her the satisfaction of having two other women outraged at aidans behavior by the time she left shed been given pats and hugs and congratulations on her stand against a bully of course she had no way of knowing that the minute she left mother and daughter dug out twenty pounds each to lay on aidan it wasnt that they didnt sympathize with jude or believe she had sense enough to know what she wanted it was simply that they believed in destiny and a good wager with the stake in her pocket brenna drove into town to tell darcy what a great boob her brother was and to start the pool fortunately ignorant of this jude walked back to her house feeling lighter of heart and stronger in the spine she wasnt going to bother confronting aidan she told herself it wasnt worth the time or effort she would be calm she would remain firm and this time he would be the one humiliated pleased with herself she went directly to the phone in her kitchen and took the next step without a moments hesitation thirty minutes later she sat at the table and laid her head on her arms shed done it shed actually done it her condo was going on the market as the couple jude had rented to had already made inquiries about the possibility of buying it the realtor was optimistic that it would sell quickly and with a minimum of fuss shed booked a flight for the end of the month so that she could go through her possessions ship or store what she wanted to keep and sell or give away the rest so much she thought for a life shed built on other peoples expectations she stayed as she was holding her breath to see what reaction would set in panic regret depression but it was none of those it was done so easily too and there was a huge weight off her shoulders at the idea of it relief was what she felt relief anticipation and a wicked little thrill of accomplishment she no longer lived in chicago she lived in faerie hill cottage county waterford ireland her parents were going to faint at the thought of that she sat up pressed both hands to her mouth to hold back the wild laughter theyd think shed lost her mind and would never ever understand that what shed done was found it shed found her mind and her heart and her home and she thought a little dizzy herself her purpose gran i found me i found jude f murray in six months or less how about that the call to new york was harder because it was more important jude realized beyond the symbolism of the sale of the condo that only meant money the call to new york equaled her future the future she was giving herself she wasnt certain whether her acquaintance from college had remembered her or had simply pretended to out of politeness but shed taken the call and shed listened jude couldnt quite remember what shed said or what holly had said back except that holly carter fry literary agent told jude f murray she very much liked the sound of her book and instructed jude to send a sample of her work in progress because the thought of doing so made her stomach pitch crazily jude made herself get up walk up the stairs her fingers might have trembled as she sat down to type the cover letter but she clicked her mind over to logical and wrote what she thought was both polite and professional she only had to stop to put her head between her knees once she gathered the first three stories and the prologue words shed labored over poured her heart into she could feel herself getting weepy as she slid the drawings into a folder packaged everything in a padded envelope she was sending her heart across the ocean risking having it shattered easier not to she thought stepping away to rub her chilled arms and stare out the window easier to just go on pretending she meant to one day easier still to go back to convincing herself it was just an indulgence an experiment she had no real stake in because once she mailed that envelope there was no going back no more pretending no more safety net that was it had been it all along she realized it was easier to tell herself she wasnt very good at something safer to believe she wasnt clever or quick because if you had confidence enough to try something you had to have courage enough to fail shed failed with her marriage and ultimately with her teaching two things shed been certain she was suited for but there were so many other things shed wanted dreamed of that shed locked away always telling herself to be sensible because people expected her to be but more deep down more the knowing if she failed shed have to live with it and she hadnt had the courage for it she glanced back at the envelope squared her shoulders she had it now this time with this dream if she didnt try she couldnt live with it wish me luck she murmured to whatever drifted through her house and grabbed the envelope she didnt let herself think on the drive to town she was going to mail it then forget it she told herself she would not spend every day agonizing fretting projecting she would know when she knew and if it wasnt good enough somehow shed make it better while she was waiting she would finish the book she would polish it until it gleamed like a diamond then well shed start another stories that came out of her head this time mermaids and shapechangers and magic bottles she had a feeling that now that shed popped the cork on her imagination things would spurt out so quickly she wouldnt be able to keep up there was a roaring in her ears as she parked in front of the post office her heart was beating so fast and so thick her chest hurt her knees wanted to buckle but she made herself cross the sidewalk and open the door the postmistress had snowy white hair and skin as dewy as a girls she sent jude a cheery smile hello there miss murray hows it all going then very well thank you liar liar liar chanted in her head any second she would lose the battle with nausea and humiliate herself to be sure its a lovely day the finest summer weve had in many a year maybe youve brought us luck i like to think so with a smile that felt like a death grimace on her face jude set the envelope on the counter are you sending something to a friend in america then yes jude kept the smile in place while the woman read the address an old college friend of mine she lives in new york now my grandson dennis and his wife and family live in new york city dennis he works in a fancy hotel and makes a good wage hauling peoples luggage up and down the elevator he says some of the rooms are like palaces jude was afraid her face might crack but she continued to smile shed learned enough in three months to know one didnt just scoot in and out of the post office or anywhere else in ardmore without a bit of conversation does he enjoy his work aye that he does and his pretty wife worked doing hair and such until the second baby came along thats nice id like this to get to new york as soon as possible if youre wanting to send it special that way itll be a bit dear thats all right she felt as if she were moving through clear syrup as she reached into her bag for her wallet in a daze she watched the weight and cost calculated passed over the pounds and took the coins in change thank you its not a problem no problem at all will your friend from new york be coming in for the wedding what no doubt your family will but its nice to have old friends as well isnt it the roaring in her head became a harsh buzzing nerves were so quickly smothered by blank fury she could only stare my john and ive been married near fifty years now and still i remember so clear the day we wed it rained a torrent but it didnt matter in the least to me all my family was there and johns as well packed into the little church so the smell of wet wool fought with the scent of the flowers and me da rest him he wept like a baby when he walked me down the aisle for i was his only daughter thats lovely jude managed when she had her breath back but im not getting married oh now did you and aidan have a lovers spat already the postmistress tuttutted kindly dont take on about that darling its natural as the rain we didnt have a spat but she had a feeling they were going to have the worlds champion of spats very soon im just not getting married you make him work for it she said with a wink doesnt hurt them a bit and makes for a better husband in the end oh and you should talk to kathy duffy about the wedding cake she makes a fine one pretty as a picture i dont need a cake jude said between her teeth now then just because its your second time doesnt mean you dont deserve a cake every bride does and for the dress you should talk to mollie otoole as she found a lovely shop in waterford city for her daughters i dont need a cake or a dress jude said waging a vicious war for patience because im not getting married thank you she turned on her heel and marched to the door when she stepped out on the sidewalk sucked in air she glared at the sign for gallaghers she couldnt go in now couldnt possibly shed kill him if she did and why the hell shouldnt she he deserved to die long purposeful strides ate up the ground until she reached the pub and flung the door open aidan gallagher the room filled to bursting with locals and the tourists whod stopped in for a bite to eat or a drink went dead quiet at her outburst at the bar aidan paused in the draft he was drawing when she stalked to the bar the gleam in her eye laserbright he set the pint aside she didnt look a thing like the soft sleepy woman hed left shortly after dawn that woman had looked silky and satisfied and this one looked murderous i want a word with you she told him he didnt think it was going to be a good word all right then give me a minute here and well go upstairs where we can be private oh now he wants privacy well forget it she turned to the room the stares and interested faces didnt embarrass her this time didnt give her that hollow feeling in the belly this time they fueled an already black temper youre all welcome to listen to what i have to say since every one of you who lives in the village is already discussing my business by now let me make it very clear i am not marrying this baboon disguised as a man there were a few snickers and when she saw the kitchen door slit open she spun back again dont stand behind the door shawn come right on out its not you im after and thank god for it he muttered but being a loyal brother he came out to stand beside aidan pretty as a picture the pair of you and you too she said pointing at darcy i hope you both have more brains than your brother who seems to think because hes got a handsome face women are going to swoon at his feet at the first sign of attention now jude darling dont you darling me she reared up over the bar to rap a fist on his chest and dont call me jude in that patient infuriatingly placating tone you bloody moron his own eyes flashed and temper threatened he jerked his thumb at shawn to take over the taps and nodded to jude well go upstairs and finish this im going nowhere with you she rapped her fist on his chest again enjoying the violence of it i will not be bullied bullied whos bullying you id like to know when youre the one pounding on me i can do worse she was suddenly thrillingly sure of it if you think that by telling everyone wholl listen im going to marry you youll pressure me into it or embarrass me into it or just wear me down youre in for a surprise i have no intention of being told what to do with my life not by you not by anyone she spun around again and everyone here better understand that just because im sleeping with him doesnt mean im shopping for a wedding cake when he snaps his fingers ill sleep with whomever i please im available someone called out and brought on hoots of laughter thats enough aidan slammed a hand on the bar and the glasses jumped this is private business he shoved past shawn to flip up the passthrough upstairs jude frances no she kept her chin up and since that appears to be a word you have trouble with ill ask which part of no you dont understand upstairs he said again and took a firm grip on her arm this isnt the place its your place she reminded him and its your doing take your hand off me well discuss this in private im done discussing it when she tried to yank her arm free he simply started hauling her toward the back the fact that he could that people parted way for them that he was strong enough to drag her wherever he chose snapped something inside her and the last lock of that dark bubbling brew broke clean i said take your hand off me you son of a bitch she couldnt quite remember doing it not with the red haze coating her vision but she felt the impact sing up her free arm as her fist connected with his face holy christ stars exploded in his head and the pain was as awesome as the sheer shock of what shed done instinctively he pressed a hand under his nose as blood began to pour and keep them off she said with great dignity as the pub once again fell silent she turned and walked out seconds before the applause erupted here try this shawn passed him over a rag thats a hell of a right jab our jude has aye he had to sit down and did so as darcy pulled him toward a vacated stool what hell got into her he ignored the new bets being laid in the marriage pool and took with gratitude the ice shawn brought him he stared at the bloody rag with both amazement and disgust the womans managed what hasnt been done in thirtyone years shes broke my goddamn nose chapter twenty contents prev im not going after her chasing her like a puppy shawn continued to fry up fish and chips while aidan iced down his abused nose in the kitchen so youve said ten or twelve times in the last twenty minutes well im not fine be a bloody brickheaded idiot dont you start on me aidan lowered the ice pack i can hit you back and so you have more times than i care to count doesnt make you less of an idiot why am i an idiot shes the one who comes swaggering in here peak hour too looking for trouble badgering me poking at me and breaking me fucking nose thats got you doesnt it shawn slid the golden hunks of fish and servings of chips onto plates added a scoop of slaw and garnished them with a bit of parsley that after all these years and all the fine battles its a woman half your size who did the deed twas a lucky punch aidan muttered as his pride throbbed in time with his nose sucker punch more like shawn corrected and youre the sucker he added as he swung out the door with the orders so much for family loyalty disgusted aidan got up to root through cupboards for some aspirin his face ached like a bitch in heat under other circumstances he supposed hed have admired jude for her fine show of temper and her aim but he couldnt find it in him at the moment shed hurt him face pride and heart hed never had a woman break his heart before and didnt know what the devil to do about it hed understood at least in part that hed bungled things the night of the ceili but hed been so sure so confident that he had fixed all that the night before romance and teasing perseverance and persuasion what else did the damn woman want damn it to the devil and back again they fit together anyone could see that everyone it seemed but jude frances murray herself how could she not want him when he wanted her so much he could barely breathe how could she not see the life theyd make together when he could see it clear as glass it was all to do with that first marriage of hers he thought darkly well hed gotten over it why couldnt she shes just being stubborn he said to shawn when his brother came back in that makes her a perfect match for you then its not being stubborn to go after what you know is right shawn shook his head and began to build the sandwiches needed out in the pub the place was a madhouse he mused with people staying long past their usual time and others coming in as they got word of the situation theyd asked michael otoole and kathy duffy to lend a hand at the bar and brenna was on her way he didnt think aidan would be in the mood for pulling pints and making conversation for a bit longer yet no i suppose its not he said after a moment but there are ways and ways of going about it with a woman a lot you know about women more than you i wager as ive never had one plant her fist in my face neither have i up till now even half frozen from the ice his nose was pounding like a kettledrum its not the reaction a man expects when he asks a woman to marry him it wasnt the asking id say but the way of asking how many ways do you ask aidan demanded and why is this my fault id like to know because its pitiful obvious that she loves you and needs love in return so if you hadnt made a mess of it she wouldnt have said no and broken your nose while aidan gaped at him shawn strode out to deliver the next order he started to leap up and follow then calculated hed spread enough of his personal business out into the pub and village that day so he paced impatiently and waited for shawn to come back in he carried empty plates this time and slid them into the sink make yourself useful and wash up would you ive more fish and chips wanted maybe i made a mess of it the first time aidan began i admit that i even talked it over with darcy darcy all shawn could do was roll his eyes to heaven now i can say without a doubt you are an idiot shes judes friend and a woman without a single romantic bone in her body forget the washing ill tend to it later he continued as he dredged fish in flour sit down and tell me how you went about it he wasnt used to his younger brother issuing directions and he wasnt sure how it sat with him but he was a desperate man ready to take desperate measures which time however many there were starting with the first shawn slid the fish and potatoes into the oil and began to make a fresh batch of slaw he listened without a word while he worked when the order was finished before his brother was he held up a finger surprising aidan into silence and went out again to serve it now then when he came back he sat folded his arms on the table and gave aidan a level look im taking ten minutes here to tell you what i think but first i have a question in all this telling her what you wanted and how it would be and what should be done did you happen to mention that you love her of course i did hadnt he aidan shifted in his chair moved his shoulder she knows i love her a man doesnt ask a woman to be his wife unless he loves her first off aidan you didnt ask her at all but told her and thats a different matter entirely plus it seems to me the one who asked her before didnt love her else he wouldnt have broken his vows to her before a year was up certainly shed have no reason to think he loved her would she no but did you tell her or not maybe i didnt its not so easy just to blurt such a thing out why it just isnt aidan muttered and im not some bloody yank whod leave her that way im an irishman who keeps his word a catholic who thinks of marriage as a sacrament oh well then thatll convince her if she marries you itll be a matter of your honor and your religion that keeps you with her thats not what i meant his head was starting to spin im just saying she should trust me not to hurt her the way shes been hurt better aidan she trusts you to love her as shes never been loved aidan opened his mouth shut it again when did you get so smart nearly thirty years of watching people and avoiding the situation you find yourself in i dont think shes a woman whos been given love and respect in equal measure and she needs them i have both for her i know you do sympathy stirred and shawn gave aidans arm a squeeze but she doesnt its time to humble yourself thats the hardest thing for you i know shell know it too youre saying i have to grovel now shawn flashed a grin your kneesll take it i suppose they will cant be more painful than a broken nose do you want her more than anything if you dont tell her just that if you dont give her your heart aidan if you dont bare it for her and give her the time to trust what she sees there youll never have her she might turn me away again she might shawn rose laid a hand on aidans shoulder its a risk i dont recall you ever being afraid of taking a chance then heres another first for you aidan reached up laid his hand on his brothers im terrified a little shaky in the gut he rose ill take a walk if you can hold things here get my mind clear before i go see her then he touched his fingers gingerly to his nose how bad is it oh shawn said cheerfully its bad and itll get worse her hand hurt like six devils if she hadnt been so busy cursing she would have worried shed broken something in it but as she could still make a fist she assumed it was only jarred from ramming into the concrete block that disguised itself as aidan gallaghers head the first thing she did was grab the phone and change her airline reservations she was leaving the very next day not that aidan was running her off oh no indeed she just wanted to get to chicago handle what needed to be handled quickly efficiently and personally before she came back then she would plant herself in faerie hill cottage and live a long and happy life doing as she chose when she chose and with whom she chose and the single person who was not on that list of choices was aidan gallagher she called mollie and arranged for her to dogsit finn already missing him and riddled with guilt for leaving him behind she picked him up and hugged him youll have a wonderful time at the otooles youll see and ill be back before you know im gone ill bring you a present she kissed his nose since she was in no mood to work she went upstairs to pack she wouldnt need much even if the business of relocating took a week or two she had clothes in chicago shed make do with no more than her carryon and her laptop and feel very cosmopolitan once she was on the plane shed settle back with a glass of celebratory champagne and make a list of all that needed to be done shed persuade her grandmother to come back with her to spend the rest of the summer she would even try to convince her parents that they should come visit so they could see that she was settled and happy everything else was just practical selling her car the furniture shipping the few things she loved it was surprising how little of what shed collected in the past few years she really loved closing bank accounts she mused as she set her carryon beside the closet door finalizing paperwork arranging for a permanent change of address a week she calculated ten days at most and it would be behind her the sale of the condo could be completed by mail and by phone it was all arranged she thought shed take finn and the keys to the cottage to mollie in the morning then drive to dublin then she looked around and wondered what she would do with herself until morning she would work in the garden for now so she could leave it in absolutely perfect shape without a single weed or faded bloom then shed go visit maude one more time just to let her know she was going away for a few days pleased with the idea jude gathered her gardening tools and gloves slapped her hat on her head and went out to work aidan hadnt intended to walk by maudes grave but he usually followed impulse when his feet took him there he loitered hoping he supposed to find inspiration or at least a bit of sympathy for his situation he crouched down to trail his fingers over the flowers jude had left there she comes to see you often she has a warm heart and a generous one i have to hope its warm enough generous enough to spare a bit for me shes your blood he added and though i didnt know you as a young woman ive heard tales that tell me you had a quick temper and a hard head begging your pardon ive come to see she takes after you and i have to admire her for it im going to see her now and ask her again then dont make the same mistakes i did aidan looked up and into sharp green eyes he straightened slowly so youre real as well as real as the day carrick assured him twice shes said no if she says so again youre of no use to me and ive wasted my time im not asking her to be of use to you still and all ive only one chance left so have a care gallagher i cant weave a spell here its forbidden even to me but ive a word of advice ive had plenty of that today thanks take this as well love even when pledged isnt enough annoyed aidan dragged a hand through his hair then what the devil is carrick smiled its a word that still sticks a bit in my throat its called compromise go now while shes being charmed by her own flowers it might give you an edge the smile widened into a grin the way youre looking right now youll need all the help you can come by thanks very much aidan muttered even as his visitor vanished in a silver shimmer of air shoulders hunched he started toward the cottage my own brother calling me a brickhead sneering faeries insulting me women punching me in the face how much more am i to swallow in one bloody day as he spoke the sky darkened and thunder rumbled ominously oh go ahead then aidan glanced up with a scowl shake your fist this is my life im dealing with here he jammed his hands in his pockets and tried to forget that his face ached like one huge bad tooth he came around the back had nearly knocked on the kitchen door when he remembered carrick had said she was with her flowers since she wasnt at the ones there it meant she was in the front breathing slow to steady his nerves he circled the house she was singing in all the time hed known her hed never heard her sing and though shed claimed to do so only when nervous he didnt think that was what brought her voice out she was singing to her flowers and it stirred his heart she had a sweet and a tentative voice that told him she didnt trust it not even when she thought no one could hear it was a pretty sight she made kneeling by her blossoms singing quietly of being alone in a festive hall with her foolish straw hat tipped over her face and the pup curled sleeping on the path behind her she didnt seem to notice the dark clouds brewing overhead the threat of storms grumbling she was a steady and bright spot in a magic little world and if he hadnt already loved her he would have tumbled at that moment but he didnt know how to explain to either of them the why of it his heart was simply hers he knew stepping forward with nothing to guard it was the greatest risk a man could take he stepped forward and said her name her head whipped up her eyes met his he was sorry to see that soft and content expression vanish from her face to be replaced by a cold and steely anger but it wasnt entirely unexpected ive finished talking to you i know it finn woke and with a joyful bark scrambled to greet him thats what hed expected of her he realized that she would always be happy to see him that she would rush forward eager for his attention it was hardly a wonder he thought shed given him the boot when hed treated her a bit like a puppy i have a few things to say to you the first of them being im sorry that threw her off but not enough to soften her it might have taken her years to learn how to use her spine but she knew now fine then ill apologize for hitting you his nose was swollen and bruising was already spreading under his eyes had she actually done that she found the fact horrifying and shamefully thrilling you broke my nose i did shock struck first and she took a step toward him before she snapped herself back well you deserved it i did yes he tried a smile youll be the talk of the village for years because she discovered a dark place inside her that found delight in that she spoke primly im sure everyone will find something more interesting to talk about soon now if thats all youll have to excuse me i need to finish this and see to a number of other things before i leave tomorrow leave he recognized panic now when it grabbed him by the throat where are you going im going back to chicago in the morning jude he started forward stopped short warned back by the flash in her eye he wanted to kneel to beg and plead imagined he would before it was done is your mind set on it yes it is ive made the arrangements he turned away to gather himself he looked out over the hills and toward the village the sea home would you tell me if youre going because of me or because its what you want its what i want im just all right then shawn had said hed be humbled and so he was he turned back walked toward her slowly ive things to say things to tell you im only asking you to listen i am listening im getting to it he muttered you could give a man a moment when hes changing his life right in front of your eyes im asking for another chance even if i dont deserve it im asking you to forget the way i put things twice before and listen to how i put them now youre a strong woman thats something youre just finding out but youre not a hard one so im asking you to put aside your anger for just a moment so you can see when he trailed off looking perplexed and flustered she only shook her head i dont know what youre talking about i accepted your apology you accepted mine jude he grabbed her hand squeezed hard enough to have her eyes widen in surprise i dont know how to do this my stomachs in knots over it it never mattered be fore dont you see ive got words ive barrels of words but i dont know the ones to use with you because my lifes in the balance shed hurt him jude realized not just physically shed slapped his ego humiliated him in front of his friends and family and still he was sorry part of her did soften now youve already said it aidan well put it aside just as you said and forget it happened ive never said it and thats the problem there was temper in his eyes again and the edge of it in his voice overhead thunder crashed like balls of lead words have magic spells and curses some of them the best of them once said change everything so i havent said them hoping in a cowardly way that you would change first and id just tend to you after im sorry for that too i do want to take care of you he lifted a hand to her cheek i cant help it i want to give you things and show you places and to see you happy youre a kind man aidan she began it has nothing to do with kindness i love you jude he saw her eyes change and the fact that it was shock and wariness that came into them only showed him how far hed gone wrong there was nothing left to do but bare his heart im lost in love with you i think i was the moment i saw you maybe somehow before i ever did youre it for me there was never one before therell never be another after she felt a desperate need to sit down but there was only the ground and it seemed much too far away im not sure i dont know oh god i wont rush you the way i did before ill give you all the time you need im only asking you to give me the chance ill settle things here then come to chicago i can open a pub there she had to press a hand to her head to make certain it stayed on her shoulders what if thats where you need to be thats fine chicago it didnt matter about her head now nothing mattered but the man gripping her hand and looking into her eyes as if everything in the world he wanted was centered there youd leave ardmore and come to chicago id go anywhere to be with you i need a minute she tugged her hand free to walk to the garden gate lean on it while she caught her breath he loved her and because of it he would give up his home his legacy his country to follow her not asking her to be what he wanted what he expected because she was enough just as she was and more he was offering to be what she wanted what she expected a miracle no no she wouldnt think of loving and being loved in return just as strongly just as deeply just as desperately as a miracle they deserved each other and the life they would make so she would just consider it right shed found jude murray all right and a great deal more her heart was steady when she turned back steady and quiet and calm he didnt quite know what to make of the little smile on her face you said you needed a wife and i do so long as shes you ill wait as long as you need me to wait a year she lifted her brows five ten the knots in his stomach twisted like snakes well ill hope i can persuade you sooner dreams took risks she thought and courage her deepest dream was standing waiting for her answer tell me again that you love me with all my heart with everything i am or will be i love you jude frances thats very persuasive with her eyes on his she walked back down the garden path when i realized you were attracted to me i thought i would have an affair something hot and reckless and daring id never had one before and here was this big gorgeous irishman more than willing to cooperate isnt that what you wanted too i did thought i did panic snuck back up on him damn it it isnt enough thats convenient because the trouble was is she corrected im just not built for reckless affairs not in the long run so even before that first night when you carried me upstairs i was in love with you a ghra but when he reached for her she shook her head and stepped back no theres more im going back to chicago not to leave but to sell my condo and settle my business so that i can move here permanently it wasnt for you and it still isnt for you that ive chosen to do this its for me i want to write i am writing she corrected a book a book everything in his face went brilliant with a pride she realized that astonished her and sealed everything thats wonderful oh its what youre meant to do how do you know because just saying it makes you happy it shows and youve a lovely way of telling a story i said so before yes she said quietly yes you did you said it before i could im so pleased for you ive always wanted to but i didnt have the courage to do it to even consider it now i do now she understood she had the courage for anything for everything i want to write and im going to be good at it i want to write here this is my place now this is my home you werent leaving not for long but i was determined not to come back to you i found my place here my place aidan it had to be mine first and i found a purpose that had to be mine too i understand that he reached out just touched the ends of her hair i do for i was the same can you accept that i know that and want all of that for you and still want the rest i can accept that i found my place my purpose and now ive found you so its you ill come back to and im going to be good very good at all of it this time she reached out took his hand youve given me the words aidan and the magic of them ill give them back to you because what we start here today we start on even ground she paused waiting for the fears and the doubts but all that came into her was joy there was never one before she said quietly though i wanted there to be tried to make myself into someone so that there would be because i was afraid to be alone now ive learned how to be alone and trust myself to like myself i wont be coming to you weak and malleable and willing to always do what im told so as not to make trouble with his heart humming he touched a finger lightly to his battered nose i think ive got that part darling she laughed and wasnt the least bit sorry once i take you therell never be one after she held out her other hand forever aidan or never forever he took her hands bringing first one then the other to his lips then on a deep breath he knelt at her feet what are you doing doing it proper finally theres no pride here he told her and his heart was in his eyes for her i dont have a bag of jewels taken from the sun to pour at your feet ive only this he reached into his pocket to take out a ring the band was thin and old the little diamond in its center caught a stray beam of light and sparkled between them a promise once kept waiting to be given and kept again it was my mothers mothers and the stone is small the setting simple but its lasted ill ask you to take it and me for my love for you is beyond measure belong to me jude as i belong to you build a life with me on even ground whatever that life is wherever it is is ours she promised herself she wouldnt cry at such a moment she wanted her eyes clear the man she loved was kneeling at her feet and offering her everything she knelt with him ill take it and you and treasure both ill belong to you aidan as you belong to me she held out her hand so he could slip the ring on a circling promise to the heart and the life we build starts now as he slid the ring on her finger the clouds whisked away and the sun poured out light bright as jewels and kneeling there among the flowers they didnt notice the figure watching from the window or the wistful way she watched them they reached for each other lips met and as fresh pain exploded aidan sucked in his breath oh it hurts jude eased back struggling not to laugh as she stroked his cheek come inside well put some ice on it ive a better cure than that he rose and scooped her up into his arms just have a bit of a care and well be fine are you sure its broken he slanted her a look aye since it happens to be attached to my face im sure and theres no need to look so pleased about it he pressed a kiss to her forehead as he paused at the front door and im thinking since you are this might be just the time to remind you jude frances youre owing me two hundred pounds and im thinking youll make it worth my while she lifted her hand watched the way the little diamond sparkled in the sun then reaching out reaching forward she opened the door herself turn the page for a preview of tears of the moon the second book in nora robertss allnew irish trilogy of the gallagher siblings chapter one ireland is a land of poets and legends of dreamers and rebels all of these have music woven through and around them tunes for dancing or for weeping for battle or for love in ancient times the harpists would travel from place to place playing their tunes for a meal and a bed and the loose coins that might come with them the harpists and the seanachais the storytellers were welcome where they wandered be it cottage or inn or campfire their gift was carried inside them and was valued even in the faerie rafts beneath the green hills and it is still once not so long ago a storyteller had come to this quiet village by the sea and had been made welcome there she found her heart and her home a harpist lived among them and had his home where he was content but he had yet to find his heart there was music playing in his head sometimes it came to him soft and dreamy like a lovers whisper other times it was with a shout and a laugh an old friend calling you into the pub to stand you for a pint it could be sweet or fierce or full of desperate tears but it was music that ran through his mind and it was his pleasure to hear it shawn gallagher was a man comfortable with his life now there were some who would say he was comfortable because he rarely came out of his dreaming to see what was happening in the world he didnt mind agreeing with them his world was his music and his family his home and the friends who counted why should he be bothered overmuch beyond that his family had lived in the village of ardmore in the county of waterford in the country of ireland for generations and there the gallaghers had run their pub offering pints and glasses a decent meal and a fine place for conversation as long as most cared to remember since his parents had settled in boston some time before it was up to shawns older brother aidan to head the business that was more than fine with shawn gallagher as he didnt quibble to admit he had no head for business whatsoever or the desire to get one he was happy enough to man the kitchen for cooking relaxed him the music would play for him out in the pub or inside his head as he filled orders or tweaked with the menu of the day of course there were times his sister darcy who had more than her share of the family energy and ambition would come in where he was working up a stew or building some sandwiches and start a row but that only livened things up he had no problem lending a hand with the serving especially if there was a bit of music or dancing going on and he cleaned up without complaint after closing for the gallaghers ran a tidy place life in ardmore suited him the slow pace of it the sweep of sea and cliffs the roll of green hills that went shimmering toward shadowed mountains the wanderlust the gallaghers were famed for had skipped over him and shawn was well rooted in ardmores sandy soil he had no desire to travel as his brother aidan had done or as darcy spoke of doing all that he needed was right at his fingertips he saw no point in changing his view though he supposed he had in a way all of his life hed looked out his bedroom window toward the sea it had been there just there foaming against the sand dotted with boats rough or calm and every mood in between the scent of it was the first thing hed drink as he leaned out his window in the morning but when his brother had married the pretty yank jude frances murray the previous fall it seemed right to make a few adjustments in the gallagher way the first to marry took over the family home and so jude and aidan had moved into the rambling house at the edge of the village when theyd returned from honeymooning in venice given the choice between the rooms above the pub and the little cottage that belonged to the fitzgerald side of judes family darcy had opted for the rooms shed browbeat shawn and whoever else shed twisted around her beautiful finger into painting and hauling until shed turned aidans once sparse rooms into her own little palace that was fine with shawn he preferred the little cottage on the faerie hill with its view of the cliffs and the gardens and its blessed quiet nor did he mind the ghost who walked there hed yet to see her but he knew she was there lady gwen who wept for the faerie lover shed cast away and waited for the spell to run its circle and free them both shawn knew the story of the young maid whod lived three hundred years before in that very same cottage on that very same hill carrick prince of the faeries had fallen in love with her but instead of giving her the words offering his heart he had shown her the grandeur of the life he would give her three times he brought her a silver bag of jewels first diamonds cast from the fire of the sun then pearls formed from tears dripped from the moon and finally sapphires wrung from the heart of the sea but doubting his heart and her own destiny she refused him and the jewels he poured at her feet so legend had it became the very flowers that thrived in the dooryard of the cottage most of the flowers slept now shawn thought bedded down as winter blew over the coast the cliffs where it was said the lady often walked were stark and barren under a brooding sky a storm wanted to happen and was biding its time the morning was a raw one with the wind knocking at the windows and sneaking in to chill the cottage he had a fire going in the kitchen hearth and his tea was hot so he didnt mind the wind he liked the arrogant music it made and sat at the kitchen table nibbling on biscuits and toying with lyrics for a tune hed written he didnt have to be at the pub for an hour yet but to make sure he got there at all hed set the timer on the stove and as a backup the alarm clock in his bedroom with no one there to shake him out of dreams and tell him to get his ass moving he tended to forget the time altogether since it irritated aidan and gave darcy an excuse to hammer at him he did his best to keep on schedule the trouble was there were times he was deep enough in his music that the buzzing and beeping of the timers didnt register and he was late in any case he was swimming in it now in a song of love that was young and sure of itself the sort to shawns thinking that was as fickle as the wind but fun while it lasted a dancing tune he decided that would require fast feet and flirting hed try it out at the pub sometime once it was polished a bit and if he could convince darcy to sing it her voice was just right for the mood of it too comfortable to bother going into the parlor where hed jammed the old piano hed bought when hed moved in he tapped his foot for time and refined lyrics he didnt hear the banging at the front door the clomp of boot steps down the hallway or the muttered and annoyed curse typical brenna thought lost in some dream world again while life went on around him she didnt know why shed bothered to knock in the first place he rarely heard it and theyd been running tame in each others houses since childhood well they werent children anymore and shed as soon knock as walk in on something she shouldnt he could have had a woman in here for all she knew the man attracted them like sugar water attracted bees not that he was sweet necessarily though he could be god he was pretty the errant thought popped into her head and she immediately hated herself for it but it was hard not to notice after all all that fine black hair looking just a bit shabby as he never remembered when it was time for a trim eyes of a quiet and dreamy blue unless he was roused by something and then she recalled they could fire hot and cold with equal measure he had long dark lashes each of her four sisters would have sold souls for and a full firm mouth that was meant she supposed for long kisses and soft words not that she knew of either firsthand but shed heard tell his nose was long and just slightly crooked from a line drive shed hit herself smartly when theyd been playing american baseball over ten years before all in all he had the face of some fairy tale prince come to life some gallant knight on quest or a slightly tattered angel add that to a long lanky body wonderfully widepalmed hands with the fingers of an artist a voice like whiskey warmed by a turf fire and he made quite the package not that she was interested particularly it was just that she appreciated things that were made well and what a liar she was even to herself shed had a yen for him even before shed beaned him with a baseball and shed been fourteen to his nineteen at the time and a yen tended to grow into something hotter something nervier in a woman of twentyfour not that he ever looked at her like she was a woman just as well she assured herself and shifted her stance she didnt have time to stand around mooning over the likes of shawn gallagher some people had work to do fixing a thin sneer on her face she deliberately lowered her toolbox then let it fall with a terrible clatter that he jumped like a rabbit under the gun pleased her christ jesus he scraped his chair around thumped a hand to his heart as if to get it pumping again whats the matter nothing she continued to sneer butterfingers she said sweetly and picked up her dented toolbox again give you a start did i you damn near killed me well i knocked but you didnt bother to come to the door i didnt hear you he blew out a breath scooped his hair back and frowned at her well heres the otoole come to call is something broken then youve a mind like a rusty bucket she shrugged out of her jacket tossed it over the back of a chair your oven there hasnt worked for a week she reminded him with a nod toward the stove the part i ordered for it just came in do you want me to fix it or not he made a sound of assent and waved his hand toward it biscuits she said as she walked by the table what kind of breakfast is that for a man grown they were here he smiled at her in a way that made her want to cuddle him its a bother to cook just for myself most mornings but if youre hungry ill fix something up for the both of us no ive eaten she set her toolbox down opened it started to rummage through you know ma always fixes more than enough shed be happy to have you wander down any morning you like and have a decent meal you could send up a flare when she makes her griddle cakes will you have some tea in any case the pots still warm i wouldnt mind it as she chose her tools got out the new part she watched his feet moving around the kitchen what were you doing writing music fiddling with words for a tune he said absently his eye had caught the flight of a single bird black and glossy against the dull pewter sky looks bitter out today tis and damp with it winters barely started and im wishing it over warm your bones a bit he crouched down with a thick mug of tea fixed as he knew she liked it strong and heavy on sugar thanks the heat from the mug seeped into her hands as she cupped them around it he stayed where he was sipping his own tea their knees bumped companionably so what will you do about this heap what do you care as long as it works again he lifted a brow if i knew what you did i might fix it next time this made her laugh so hard she had to sit her butt down on the floor to keep from tilting over you shawn you cant even fix your own broken fingernail sure i can grinning he mimed just biting one off and made her laugh again dont you concern yourself with what i do with the innards of the thing and i wont concern myself with the next cake you bake in it we each have our strengths after all its not as if ive never used a screwdriver he said and plucked one out of her kit and ive used a stirring spoon but i know which fits my hand better she took the tool from him then shifting stuck her head in the oven to get to work she had little hands shawn thought a man might think of them as delicate if he didnt know what they were capable of doing hed watched her swing a hammer grip a drill haul lumber cinch pipes more often than not those little fairy hands of hers were nicked and scratched or bruised around the knuckles she was such a small woman for the work shed chosen or the work that had chosen her he thought as he straightened he knew how that was brennas father was a man of all work and his eldest daughter took straight after him just as it was said shawn took after his mothers mother who had often forgotten the wash or the dinner while she played her music as he started to step back she shifted her butt wriggling as she loosened a bolt his eyebrows lifted again in what he considered the automatic interest of a male in an attractive portion of the female form she did after all have a trim and tidy little body the sort a man could scoop up onehanded if he had a mind to and if a man tried shawn imagined brenna otoole would lay him out flat the idea made him grin still hed rather look at her face any day it was such a study her eyes were lively and of a sharp glass green under elegant brows just slightly darker than her bright red hair her mouth was mobile and quick to smile or sneer or scowl she rarely painted it or the rest of her face come to that though she was thick as thieves with darcy who wouldnt step a foot from the house until she was polished to a gleam she had a sharp little nose like a pixies that tended to wrinkle in disapproval or disdain most times she bundled her hair under a cap where she pinned the little fairy hed given her years before for some occasion or other but when she took the cap off there seemed miles of hair a rich bright red that sprang out in little curls as it pleased it suited her that way because he wanted to see her face again before he took himself off to the pub shawn leaned back casually on the counter then tucked his tongue in his cheek so youre walking out with jack brennan these days im hearing when her head came up swiftly connected with the top of the oven with a resounding crack shawn winced and wisely swallowed the chuckle im not as hed hoped she popped out of the oven there was a bit of soot on her nose and as she rubbed her sore head she knocked her cap askew who said i am oh innocent as three lambs shawn merely shrugged and finished his tea i thought i heard it somewhere round and about as such things go youve a head full of cider and never hear a bloody thing im not walking out with anyone ive no time for that nonsense annoyed she stuck her head back in the oven well then im mistaken easy enough to be when the village is full of romance these days engagements and weddings and babies on the way thats the proper order anyway he chuckled and came back to crouch beside her again in a friendly way he laid a hand on her bottom and didnt notice when she went very still aidan and jude are already picking out names and shes barely two months along yet theyre lovely together arent they aye her mouth had gone dry with that yen that was perilously close to need i like seeing them happy jude likes to think the cottage is magic she fell in love with aidan here and started her new life wrote her book all the things she says she was afraid even to dream of once happened right here thats lovely too theres something about this place he said half to himself you feel it at odd moments when youre drifting off to sleep or just waking its a a waiting with the new part in place she eased out his hand slid up her back lazily then fell away have you seen her lady gwen no sometimes theres a kind of movement on the air just at the edge of your vision but then nothing he pulled himself back smiled carelessly then got to his feet maybe shes not for me id think you the perfect candidate for a heartbroken ghost brenna said and turned away from his surprised glance she should work fine now she added giving the dial a switch well just see if she heats up youll see to that for me wont you darling the oven timer buzzed startling them both ive got to be going shawn said reaching over to shut it off is that your warning system then one of them he lifted a finger and on cue came the cheerful bell from the clock by his bed thats the second round but itll go off on its own in a minute as its a windup otherwise i found id be having to run in and slap it off every bloody time clever enough when it suits you arent you i have my moments the cats out he continued as he took his own jacket from the hook take no pity on him should he come scratching at the door bub knew what he was after when he insisted on moving out here with me did you remember to feed him im not a complete moron unoffended he wrapped a scarf around his neck hes food enough and if he didnt hed go begging at your kitchen door hed do that anyway just to shame me he found his cap dragged it on see you at the pub then more than likely she didnt sigh until shed heard the front door close behind him yearnings in the direction of shawn gallagher were foolishness she told herself for hed never have the same aimed her way he thought of her as a sister or worse she realized a kind of honorary brother and that was her fault as well she admitted glancing down at her scruffy work pants and scarred boots shawn liked the girlie type and she was anything but she could flounce herself up she supposed between darcy and her own sisters and jude for that matter shed have no limit of consultants on beautifying brenna otoole but beyond the fact that she hated all that fuss and bother what would be the point in it if she polished and painted and cinched and laced to attract a man he wouldnt be attracted to what she was in any case besides if she put on lipstick and baubles and some slinky little dress shawn would likely laugh his lungs out then say something stupid that would leave her no choice but to punch him there was hardly a point in that shed leave the fancy work to darcy who was the champion of being female and to her sisters brenna thought who enjoyed such things shed stick with her tools she went back to the oven running it at different temperatures and checking the broiler for good measure when she was satisfied it was in good working order she turned it off then packed up her tools she meant to go straight out there was no reason to linger after all but the cottage was so cozy shed always felt at home there when old maude fitzgerald had lived for more years than brenna could count in faerie hill cottage brenna had often stopped in for a visit then maude had died and jude had come to stay awhile theyd become friends so it had been easy to fall back into the routine of stopping in now and then on her way home or into the village she ignored the urge to stop in more often than not now that shawn was living there but it was hard to resist she liked the quiet of the place and all the pretty little things maude had collected and left sitting about jude had left them there and shawn seemed content to do the same so the little parlor was cheery with bits of glass and charming statues of faeries and wizards homey with books and an old faded rug of course now that shawn had stuffed the secondhand spinet piano in the doll house space there was barely room to turn around but brenna thought it only added to the charm and old maude had enjoyed music shed be pleased brenna thought as she skimmed her finger over the scarred black wood that someone was making it in her house again idly she scanned the sheet music shawn forever left scattered over the top of the piano he was always writing a new tune or taking out an old one to change something her brows knit as she studied the squiggles and dots she wasnt particularly musical oh she could sing out a rebel song without making the dog howl in response but playing was a different kettle of fish altogether since she was alone she decided to satisfy her curiosity setting her toolbox down again she chose one of the sheets and sitting gnawing her lip found middle c on the keyboard and slowly painstakingly picked out the written notes one finger at a time it was lovely of course everything he wrote was lovely and even her pitiful playing couldnt kill the beauty of it completely hed added words to this one as he often did brenna cleared her throat scowled in concentration and attempted to match her voice to the proper note when im alone in the night and the moon sheds its tears i know my world would come right if only you were here without you my heart is empty of all but the memories it keeps you only you stay inside me in the night while the moon weeps she stopped sighed a little as there was no one to hear it touched her as his songs always did but a little deeper this time a little truer moon tears she thought pearls for lady gwen a love that asked but couldnt be answered its so sad shawn whats inside you that makes such lonely music as well as she knew him she didnt know the answer to that and she wanted to had always wanted to know the key to him but he wasnt a motor or machine she could take apart to find the workings men were more complicated and frustrating puzzles it was his secret and his talent she supposed all so internal and mysterious while her skills were she looked down at her small capable hands hers were as simple as they came at least she put hers to good use and made a proper living from them what did shawn gallagher do with his great gift but sit and dream if he had a lick of ambition or true pride in his work hed sell his tunes instead of just writing them and piling them up in boxes the man needed a good kick in the ass for wasting something god had given him but that she thought was an annoyance for another day she had work of her own to do she started to get up to reach for her toolbox again when a movement caught the corner of her eye she straightened like a spike mortified at the thought of shawn coming back the man was always forgetting something and catching her playing with his music but it wasnt shawn who stood in the doorway the woman had pale gold hair that tumbled around the shoulders of a plain gray dress that swept down to the floor her eyes were a soft green her smile so sad it broke the heart at first glance recognition shock and a giddy excitement showered through brenna all at once she opened her mouth but whatever she intended to say came out in a wheeze as her pulse pounded she tried again faintly embarrassed that her knees were shaking lady gwen she managed she thought it was admirable to be able to get out that much when faced with a threehundredyearold ghost as she watched a single tear shiny as silver trailed down the ladys cheek his hearts in his song her voice was soft as rose petals and still had brenna trembling listen what do you but before brenna could get the question out she was alone with only the faintest scent of wild roses drifting in the air well then well she had to sit there was no help for it and let herself drop back down to the piano bench well she said again and blew out several strong breaths until her heart stopped thundering against her rib cage when she thought her legs would hold her again she decided it was best to tell the tale to someone wise and sensible and understanding she knew no one who fit those requirements so well as her own mother she calmed considerably on the short drive home the otoole house stood back off the road a rambling jigsaw puzzle of a place she herself had helped make so when her father got an idea for a room into his head she was more than pleased to dive into the ripping out and nailing up some of her happiest memories were of working side by side with michael otoole and listening to him whistle the chore away she pulled in behind her mothers ancient car they really did need to paint the old heap brenna thought absently as she always did smoke was pumping from the chimneys inside it was welcome and warmth it smelled of the mornings baking she found her mother in the kitchen where molly was just pulling out fresh loaves of brown bread ma oh sweet mary girl you gave me a start with a laugh molly put the pans on the stovetop and turned with a smile she had a pretty face still young and smooth with the red hair shed passed on to her daughter bundled on top of her head for convenience sorry youve the music up again its company but molly reached over to turn the radio down beneath the table betty their yellow dog rolled over and groaned what are you doing back here so soon i thought you had work i did i do ive got to go into the village yet to help dad but i stopped by faerie hill to fix the oven for shawn mmmhmm molly turned back to pop the loaves from the pan and set them on the rack to cool he left before i was done so i was there by myself for a bit when molly made the same absent sound brenna shifted her feet then ah when i was leaving well there was lady gwen mmmhmm what tuning in molly looked over her shoulder i saw her i was just fiddling for a minute at the piano and i looked up and there she was in the parlor doorway well then that mustve given you a start brennas breath whooshed out sensible that was molly otoole bless her i all but swallowed me tongue then and there shes lovely just as old maude used to say and sad it just breaks your heart how sad i always hoped to see her myself a practical woman molly poured two cups of tea and carried them to the table but i never did i know aidans talked of seeing her for years and then jude when she moved into the cottage relaxed again brenna settled at the table but i was just talking to shawn of her and he says hes not seen her sensed her but never seen and then there she was for me why do you think that is i cant say darling what did you feel other than a hard knock of surprise sympathy i guess then puzzlement because i dont know what she meant by what she said to me she spoke to you mollys eyes widened why ive never heard of her speaking to anyone not even maude shed have told me what did she say to you she said his hearts in his song then she just told me to listen and when i got back my wits enough to ask her what she meant she was gone since its shawn who lives there now and his piano you were playing with id say the message was clear enough but i listen to his music all the time you cant be around him five minutes without it molly started to speak then thought better of it and only covered her daughters hand with hers her darling mary brenna she thought had such a hard time recognizing anything she couldnt pick apart and put together again id say when its time for you to understand you will she makes you want to help her brenna murmured youre a good lass mary brenna perhaps before its done help her is just what youll do
