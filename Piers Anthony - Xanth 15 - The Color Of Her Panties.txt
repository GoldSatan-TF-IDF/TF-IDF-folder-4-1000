of america first edition arela merwoman swam restlessly around her sea cave garden brushing the treelike seaweeds that formed the walls and canopy her hair swirled greenly behind her and her flukes caused little eddies that toyed with whatever strands of hair they could catch she swooped down near the glowing colored stones of her floor so that her breasts almost brushed them then she halted at the central fireplace and stoked up the waterlogs so that her fire blazed more brightly oh brimstone she swore severely out of sorts i need a husband she brought out her mirror and stretched the glass out to full length so she could see all of herself it merely reflected what she already knew she was a splendiferous creature with fuller breasts than any mere mermaid and a flashier tail than any fish could boast about her neck she wore a necklace supporting two precious glowing firewater opals surely sufficient to attract the best quality husband so why wasnt she married it wasnt as if she were choosy all she wanted was the nicest handsomest most manly and intelligent unmarried prince in xanth who would be pleased to let her do anything she wanted such as swimming in the salt sea for hours and eating raw fish and who would love to brush out her hair for her once she had captured prince dolph but he had been a trifle young at the time nine years old she had traded him off for her opals and later he had grown up and married a girl of his own species whose endowments werent nearly as impressive as melas own human men just didnt have much sense the problem was that there werent many males who met her modest standards and most of those were already married she had scoured the seas and found nothing worth her while so what was she to do she sighed and the effort sent ripples down through her fabulous flesh there was no help for it she would have to go ask the good magician that meant doing him a years service which would surely be a colossal bore but if he landed her a suitable husband it just might be worth it no time like the present mela gathered together the few useful spells she had collected during her explorations of the bypaths of the sea and tucked them into her invisible purse then she swam out of her cave and up toward the surface of the sea she didnt worry about the fire spreading during her absence because fire could not burn under water without the magic presence of the merfolk only if another merwoman or merman came would it flare up granted no one would intrude on her private premises melas undersea cave was near the isle of illusion by sheerest coincidence so she came up in sight of the isle which had once appeared to be the most illustrious of regions her hair yellowed as it broke the surface she remembered again how she had captured prince dolph here despite the objection of his skeletal companioris marrow bones and gracel ossein they had in the end turned out to be decent folk despite their gauntness indeed they had helped her get her opals she wondered how they were doing they had made a nice if somewhit emaciated couple the isle of illusion no longer had much illusion because the sorceress of illusion queen emeritus iris had long since departed it but a faint tinge of great fancies still surrounded it suggesting the greatness of past imaginings perhaps some day another great illusionist would inhabit it and once again no one would know its rather pedestrian reality she swam directly to the shore where the gap chasm debouched into the eastern sea she came as close to the small beach as she could without getting out of the water then when the sand threatened to abrade her satiny skin she sat up her tail folded before her she concentrated and her beautiful flukes became misshapen lumps while the main portion of her tail turned a sickly pink a lengthwise crease appeared which deepened until the entire tail split into two ungainly limbs mela bent these limbs at their knobby knees and set the bony feet firmly against the sand then she heaved herself up until she balanced precariously on those awkward legs kneedeep in the surf it had been a long time since she had gone on land and it was hardly her notion of tin but it was the only way the good magician lived on land and would not come to the sea once she was sure of her equilibrium she waded on out to the dry sand her new legs were getting stronger as she got the hang of them and her balance was improving she did know how to do this she was merely out of practice but when she walked away from the water the sand grew hot burning her feet and little sharp stonestried to cut her soles her extremities might be ugly but they were also tender fortunately she knew where there was a ladys slipper patch she had seen it from the water she limped to it and picked two slippers naturally they fit perfectly and they protected her feet so that she could walk in comfort she came to the edge of the gap where the way turned steep now she had to climb but she could do that too and clambered up across the rocks and slopes without much trouble she knew that she had to get out of the chasm immediately for two reasons first the sides became considerably steeper farther ineveryone knew thatand second there was the gap dragon only a few folk knew that because most of those who had encountered the dragon had been eaten there had been a forget spell on the chasm for a long time but now it was gone and so it was possible to know things about the gap that was just as well because she would not have wanted to try to run from the dragon on her wobbly legs she wondered how the land folk ever endured such an ungainly mode of travel she came to the brink and climbed over now the land was reasonably level and she could walk upright she understood that the good magicians castle was slightly south of the gap so she walked generally westward there were supposed to be enchanted paths and once she found one of those she would be able to proceed to the castle without having to worry about stray monsters unfortunately she was still in the wilderness ho someone shouted to the side a nymph hit her mela looked alarmed she was no nymph for they were mostly brainless creatures who kept company with sinlarly brainless fauns for some reason human men seemed to like nymphs while lacking interest in the fauns she saw that the shouter was a man the size of an elf standing hardly taller than her knees his hands were relatively huge she didnt have to worry about him then about six more like him appeared hit her hit her they cried charging toward her in a messy mass now she recognized their nature these were hit men their hands were huge because they used them to make tremendous fists the better to hit innocent folk they were erupting from a blackjack bush which was a plant that liked to be hit it was always exclaiming hit me and hit me again though its leaves were so thin and flat that they could hardly stand up long to such abuse maybe that was why they had all those little red and black marks on them in the shapes of things like spades and hearts and clubs but hitmen were notorious for making hits on anything that came within reach and a luscious bare female like herself was a prime target they certainly wanted to hit on her mela quickly took stock she was too far from the sea to reach it before the obnoxious little men caught up with her maybe in time her clumsy legs would be able to carry her swiftly but she was still concentrating on things like balance and locomotion if she tried to run fast she would fall on her face and they would swarm all over her could her magic stop them she had a spell to splash water into the eyes of a person but that only worked on one person at a time and she doubted it would discourage even a single one of these hit men for long she had a small waterlog but that would burn only in water there was her mirror but that had very limited power not much hope there however she also had a little magic manual that was supposed to list many of the useful things of xanth as well as the things best avoided she snatched it out of her purse and checked quickly through it she saw pictures of various creatures and plants including the hit men and blackjack bush well i already knew about those she snapped how about something that will help me thats close by the manual showed a picture of a mitten bush with neat little white mittens a mitten bush mela rolled her eyes she was no kitten and she needed no mitten then she spied a mitten bush close by well that might not be what she wanted but she would have to make do with it she hurried to it not quite managing to lose her balance in her haste the hit men were now almost upon her their big ugly hands forming into bigger uglier fists she dodged around the bush the hit men piled into itand its mittens expanded to swallow their fists in a moment the hit men were all caught by their hands unable to get them from the tight mittens they cursed swore and obscened turning the air bilious blue which was an unusual effect bilious green or yellow were the normal hues but even with the blue they couldnt get free because the mittens were firmly tied to the bush mela went blithely onward sometimes all it took was a little luck and the common sense to use it plus a little help from a manual this was after all the land of xanth where almost everything was magic and the rest was probably lying about it the land was more dangerous than the sea because she was used to the sea but she could manage in due course she came to a river this was wonderful it gave her a chance to wet her tail she waded inand right out again it was fresh water what a horrible sensation she would have to make do on dry legs until she could return to the sea rather than touch the bad water again she walked upstream it stood to reason that if she went far enough the river would give up and fade out and then she could proceed without touching it soon she encountered an odd little creature it had pinkish hairy skin and a squaredoff snout which it used to nose around in the ground she brought out her manual again and sifted through the pages until she found a picture and managed to recognize the thing it was a pig the description was reassuring they were harmless if not bothered so she ignored it and walked on she came across another pig and a third in fact there was half a slew of pigs along the bank it was a piggy bank she moved away from the bank and found a path this expanded as if glad of her attention to it and became l paved road she knew that some paths were treacherous because they led to dragon lairs or tangle trees but this was not that type it was a straight road that liked to b used and she was happy to oblige it it would enable her to get farther faster with less wear on her tender extremities suddenly there was a huge honking and a tremendous pig came charging down the road mela had to leap into the brush to avoid it she got no thanks outta my way nymph the huge pig grunted as it passed mela did not like being called a nymph when anyone could see she was a merwoman on legs hey do you think you own this road she demanded angrily the pig halted and turned its porcine snout to look at her as a matter of fact i do it said what kind of creature are you im a road hog of course now stay out of my way it resumed motion and in a moment was out of sight a road hog that figured when the piggies of the bank grew large and arrogant naturally they became hogs she should have checked another page in the manual and found it before it found her mela shrugged and tried to get back on the road she discovered that she was stuck in the foliage of the most ugly and useless tree she had encountered its leaves were misshapen its bark was falling off and its fruit was rotten it just seemed to have grown all wrong it was a good thing she wore no clothing because the erratic thorns would have caught in it as it was she was smarting from two mentionable places and one unmentionable place she extricated herself and brought out the manual there it was a lemon tree anyone who got one of these was supposed to get rid of it in a hurry because it was no good she had already caught on to that fact this was wearing did she really need a husband but mela decided that there was almost as little point in turning back now as there was in moving on forward she might as well plow on and see what the good magician had to say the road wound on through the forest passing some nice pie trees mela paused to have some watermelon pie farther along she found water chestnuts and watercress that was the best that offered as the land did not seem to have seaweed soup or sea cucumbers she could tell by the taste that fresh water had been used but that was all right for food it was swimming and bathing that required salt water however time was sneaking by and the shadows were taking advantage of it to grow longer mela was intrigued by this phenomenon because there were not many shadows on the sea floor but she realized that this was a magic signal that night was approaching she did not feel at ease traveling in the dark and anyway her new legs were tired she needed a safe comfortable place to sleep now where would that be she checked the manual it showed a picture of a beerbarrel tree mela wasnt sure about that she didnt like the notion of swimming in beer much better than that of swimming in water then she realized that it was a dead hollow beerbarrel tree it meant so she looked around as she walked and sure enough in due course she found one she went to the tree and examined it she found a creyice that led to a crack that led to a fissure that became the square outline of a door this was the place she felt along the edge until she found a latch she worked it and the door opened there inside was a dark abode girl about by fluffy pillows not as appealing as alt water but ideal in terms of roughing it on the land mela entered and closed the door behind her immediately a soft light glowed from colored fungus it didnt compare to that of deepsea plants and creatures but it did give her a feeling of the depths and that was very nice whatever male she married would have to love the sea because she was a creature of the sea inside as well as outside she lay blissfully on the bed of pillows mmmmph mmmph mph mmmmmmmph mela jumped what was that mmmmmmmmmmph the muffled sound came as she landed from her jump squishing the pillows flat she scrambled to her tired feet what is going on here she demanded of the situation in general the center pillow formed a mouth and opened it a better question is what is coming off here how dare you plop your fishy backside in my eskimo in your what mela asked bemused my inuit aleut finn sami lapp mela inquired whatever cant a creature get a decent nap without getting squished by an ugly sea monster mela began to take umbrage umi am considered by some to be a rather attractive sea monster the mouth grimaced by whom fishhead a hungry kraken weed mela finished her taking umbrage brage she swore you dont exactly have much sex appeal yourself cushionface the pillow exploded the mouth flew up and hovered before melas nose while feathers swirled around it i have all the sex appeal i want seaweedhair it exclaimed mela realized belatedly that magic was operating here you are not what you seem she charged with a certain justice the feathers closed in around the mouth forming the shape of a head i am whatever i choose to be man rear that was a low blow no one had ever before mistaken melas posterior for male and what kind of rear do you have pillowcheeks she demanded the feathers shaped themselves into a human outline and faded into flesh tone now a voluptuous woman stood there this kind of rear gillsforbrains she said turning to show a set of buttocks almost as generous as melas own youre a demoness mela said catching on however the creature moved away so that mela could not keep her catch the demoness metria of course and who in conniption are you i am melantha merwoman what are you doing out of your ingredient my what your component aspect fragment division portion segment oh you mean my element the sea whatever why are you here on land i am in quest of a husband i cant find what i want in the sea metria gazed at her appraisingly considering what men are interested in it seems that you should be able to nab one what kind are you looking for a prince would do if hes handsome and manageable i caught one once but he was too young and i had to throw him back oh which one was that prince dolph of the human folk he was nine years old but would have grown in time prince dolph i know him hes seventeen now and married i know mela said sadly i heard she wasnt even a princess she is now and a mother too the stork brought them twin girls dawn and eve oh those should have been my girls mela cried i should never have let him get away well youre mortal you make mistakes so now i am going to see the good magician to find out how to nab some other prince mela concluded im sorry if i intruded on your domain i thought it was available oh go ahead and use it metria said i took it from esk ogre some years back and the truth is things were more interesting when he was around things always are when a males around how true but now hes gone and married a brassie girl from the gourd named bria and they have a son named brusque everybodys getting married mela said petulantly but the son of an ogre and a brassiedoes he have a talent yes he can make himself or other things hard and heavy or light and soft that should be handy when he is grown mela nodded knowingly surely so but it doesnt solve my problem i need a prince why not a regular man the demoness asked there are more of them well after almost nabbing a prince i fear it would feel like backsliding to settle for an ordinary man i suppose so my friend dana demoness married a king now she wont settle for anything less oh what king king humfrey i didnt know there was a king humfrey is he any relation to the good magician humfrey the same but humfreys no king hes the magician of information hes no king now but he was then she got bored and left him but after a century or so she got bored being single so she returned to him and is married to him today i i but i thought he was married to the gorgon he is it gets complicated to explain it must but mela was too tired at the moment for complexity is it all right if i sleep on the other pillows be my guest metria said grandly fading away in the morning mela left the cozy den and searched out some fruits and nuts she needed to do something else but wasnt sure how to manage it cleanly while wearing the clumsy legs she wished she could return to the sea for a while or even an freshwater pond and not just for that the land was just such an awkward place the demoness metria appeared in her human form standing in the air must you go so soon she inquired i thought you wanted to be rid of me i do i was being facetious thats more like it mela had relatively few illusions about demons having encountered them on occasion you look squirmy i would ask you whether there is water near but you would only misdirect me no i would answer truly because then you wouldnt believe me and would go the wrong way the demoness evidently understood why mela wanted water so was teasing her demon fashion never mind ill do it in the den mela headed for the beerbarrel tree oh no you dont go to that purpose bush over there melas left arm stretched out and her hand assumed the form of an arrow what kind of bush aim design province sphere object what its made for function whatever metria agreed crossly whats a function bush just go there and see its really quite natural mela knew that this was mischief but it was better to humor the demoness whose mischief was surely not as bad as her anger she walked to the bush which had the smell of manure then suddenly she folded over and accomplished her business despite her clumsy form a function bush now she understood its name it had its own way of collecting fertilizer mela straightened up and walked away from it thank you metria she said for the demoness had after all facilitated the necessary chore youre not mad metria inquired disappointed furious there was an art to managing demons youre not going to throw any of it at me that wouldnt be ladylike it would just loop around and splat on you that too youre just trying to be dull so ill lose interest and stop pestering you demons are getting smarter all the time well it wont work ill just tag along and see you mess up some other way suit yourself confound it i cant tell whether you even want to get rid of me maybe you prefer to have my company i would prefer it even more if you were a male prince demon perhaps you can get one to come and pester me in lieu of you males can be such brutes that does it i am going to stay and be perfectly nice to you what do you think of that mela sighed you are very sophisticated in your pestering the truth was that she didnt really care whether the demoness remained or departed she just wanted to keep her on good behavior they walked generally west but the freshwater river threatened to return with its pigs and things so they veered south the land became hilly so they veered some more to move along a contour the demoness was now walking on the ground so that she seemed just like another mortal creature she was even solid now mela could tell because she left footprints then she heard a faint booming sound whats that a pronoun used to indicate a person place thing idea or state of being i keep confusing it with which i dont mean the word i mean that sound what sound mela saw that the demoness was still teasing her she surely heard the booming and know all about it but wouldnt tell so mela shut up and walked on the booms became louder finally she came to a series of small hills shaped like little mountains at the top of each hill was a human baby every so often each baby opened its mouth and let out a surprisingly loud boom why theyre baby boomers mela said surprised there certainly are a lot of them they will be something when they grow up metria remarked theyll be big boombooms but whats the point there is no point theyre just there they strayed from mundania where there are even more of them mela shook her head mundania is a strange place that is true even the mundanes dont understand it that is why they come to xanth whenever they can fortunately most of them dont know the way any more than you know the way to the good magicians castle but if i asked you you would merely direct me wrong or right if i didnt believe you of course isnt it beautiful lovely despite her best effort mela was getting annoyed by the demoness they passed beyond the baby boomers and came to a big lake it looked very pleasant mela stood and gazed at it arent you going for a swim metria inquired innocently no oh you already know its nature this made mela pause suddenly she suspected that the demoness wasnt thinking of fresh water but the demoness wouldnt tell if she asked so she shrugged ill go around it actually its not as if the kissmee lake hurts anyone its not nearly as bad as a love spring so this was the kissmee lake she had heard of it wasnt there some trouble with the associated river i heard that your friends pulled it straight and then it was known as the killmee river yes the hummers got really bad thats when i had to leave and i found the ogres den but i helped him restore the river that was interesting so i will just walk around it to the south mela said by all means i will walk with you that meant that there promised to be something interesting for the demoness to the south which in turn meant that mela wouldnt like it ohthe kissmee river flows from the south shore mela said realizing so i cant go that way unless i want to mess with fresh water anyway i i sure enough mela agreed disappointed so ill have to walk around it to the north instead by all means that did not sound promising either but what other choices were there mela certainly didnt want to swim across it and she couldnt fly across it she opened her invisible purse and took out her manual what she wanted was surely in there but she didnt know what to look for that was why she couldnt use it to locate a husband it showed all the creatures of xanth but couldnt point out individuals or give their marriage status now she needed a way to cross the lake without soiling her body with fresh water and the manual couldnt tell her how the sky darkened dimming the page she looked up there over the water a nasty little cloud was forming so she flipped the pages until she came to clouds and there it was king cumulo fracto nimbus the meanest of clouds but since she had nothing either to gain or fear from a cloud she ignored fracto and he ignored her then she saw something strange it was a little red boat zooming along backwards rowed by a very big man no by a very small giant no something even odder but what fascinating metria said and faded out that surely meant trouble but it just might be a ruse if this was someone who could help her cross the lake the demoness might be trying to scare her away so that she would after all be stranded so she couldnt be sure the best thing to do was chance it if she got into the boat with the man and he tried to get freshhow she hated freshnessshe could always jump into the water loathsome as it was and escape so she waited but she took the precaution of hiding behind some redberry bushes the boat plowed right on toward the shore not far distant the rower didnt seem to realize he banged right into the bank and grunted as the boat suddenly stopped oh everythings wrong he cried in a high voice ill never find the good magician melas ears perked up he was looking for the good magician this could be a wonderful break she stepped forward hello she said brightly the stranger jumped right into the air and screamed bursting into tears startled mela fell back into the bushes scratching her nevermind well i didnt mean any harm she said nettled i just happen to be looking for the good magician myself and i wondered she broke off staring at the huge creature why youre not a man at all youre awell just what are you im an ogre girl the other responded you frightened me but theyre very strong ugly and stupid and justifiably proud of it youre a very poor excuse for an ogress the other said i cant even crunch bones very well mela decided to let that pass do you think you might row me across the lake i think the good magician is somewhere on the other side he is the ogress said brightening sure do you know the way not exactly just in a very general sense but if you want to go there too yes i i then lets introduce ourselves im mela merwoman i m looking for a husband im okra ogress im looking for my fortune i want to be a main character a main character why because nothing really bad ever happens to a main character and a whole lot of bad things are going to happen to me if i dont get away from them now thats interesting do you mean i could get a good husband if i became a main character sure main characters always live happily ever after so if you need a husband to make you happy then youd get one well okra im glad i met you lets get on across lake kissmee and well see if we can find the good magician together lake what kissmee didnt you know but i was rowing on lake ogrechobee you must have rowed right up the river to lake kissmee without knowing it only a very strong and stupid person could have done that but that made sense in this case okay okra hauled the red boat around and plopped it back into the water ill row maybe it will work better if you can tell me where were going it should mela agreed realizing that this was part of the ogresss problem she had not been able to look forward so they got into the boat and okra started to row the boat fairly leaped through the water with each heave mela looked aheadand saw the cloud king fracto changing course to intercept them urn maybe we should turn back and wait for fracto to go away she said but the ogress was working so hard that she didnt hear well maybe they could make it across before the storm hit mela hoped so she did not relish the thought of getting doused with fresh rainwater it was a perfect day for a picnic they would smell flowers and eat red yellow and blueberries and sun in the sun with luck they would encounter a winged dragon or a griffin from the time of her association with che centaur she had had no fear of winged monsters for all of them were his friends gwendolyn goblin could not remember when she had been as happy as during these last two years as the gucst of the winged centaur family she had been well treated at home in goblin mountain but confined to her apartment because well because then little che centaur had come to be her companion and his friend jenny elf who was the same age as gwenny and they had gone to be with ches family for the first time gwenny had experienced the freedom of the great outside and she reveled in it of course there were bad things too ches parents cheiron and chex insisted that every creature in their household be properly educated thus the teenage goblin girl and elf girl shared sevenyearold ches fate and had to spend weary hours learninghow to count and figure and read and write and all about the geography and history of xanth they even had to learn the various types of magic and the rules of human and nonhuman cultures what a bore sometimes gwenny and jenny pretended to lose their spectacles so that they couldnt study but the adults were hideously astute at finding them it was the one awful thing about centaurs they were intellectual they represented the very most extreme case of the dreadful adult conspiracy which dictated that anyone young enough to be a nonconspirator must know and not know a rigorous schedule of things naturally most of the interesting things were in the notknow category but overall the positives outweighed the negatives gwenny was well fed and well cared for and safe and she had close companions who didnt like studying any better than she did the alternative was to be locked in her suite at home with only her mother godiva for companyand the truth was godiva also had distressingly adult notions about education and behavior the rest of goblin mountain was a total loss it was dark and gloomy and full of goblins who wanted to be in a mountain full of goblins they skipped along the path che running beside gwenny so that she would be guided by him and would not misstep a visit to a healing spring had cured her lameness but not her eyesight her eyes werent ill they merely were unable to focus quite right at ordinary distances jenny elf had the same problem healing water restored a persons body to its natural state and their natural state was a different way of seeing than that of most folk they had hardly reached the first field of flowers before there was a figure in the sky gwenny put on her spectacles so she could make out what it was it was chex ches dam flying down to intercept them she landed lightly on her four hooves and folded her wings gwenny i have what may be bad news your mother is here there was a pause then the three young folk burst out laughing they knew chex didnt mean it the way it sounded all of them liked godiva goblin despite her adult tendencies but in a moment they sobered godiva would not have come here without good reason and that was indeed likely to be bad news did she say no but i think you had better talk with her immediately i i ill hurry back to the house i will take you but che and jenny we shall get back on our own che said quickly so gwenny climbed onto chexs back and chex flicked her with her tail making her feather light then chex spread her wings and leaped into the air they were airborne gwenny still thrilled to this experience she hung on to chexs mane and peered down as the centaur circled to gain elevation there were che and jenny waving jenny was holding her little orange cat sammy then chex straightened out and headed across the forest not far above the treetops it seemed almost like walking through waisthigh bushes looking down on them only these were frill trees soon they landed in the yard before the house godiva was there her flowing black hair tonning a cape about her body gwenny jumped offand sailed high into the air because she had forgotten how light she was chex reached up with a hand and caught her ankle bringing her down she set gwenny gently on the ground it took a while for the lightening effect to wear off gwenny walkedcarefullyto her mother and hugged her my dear you have lost weight have you been eating enough godiva exclaimed of course it was humor because she understood the centaur magic and could see that gwenny far from being underfleshed was now a rather pretty figure of a gobliness she was after all fourteen years old which was just about old enough for a goblin girl naturally no adult would tell her what she was old enough for adults could be real pains at times why are you here mother gwenny asked godiva became extremely serious your father is dead you know what that means she did not pretend any gnef gouty goblin had been a typical male which meant that he had few if any endearing traits and had done his best to eradicate those gwenny felt a sudden chill indeed she knew what this meant that her idyllic time with the centaur family was over and perhaps her life itself for she was the next in line to be the chief of the goblins of goblin mountainthe first female ever to aspire to that role mother im not ready she said i know that dear i had hoped that your father would hang on a few years longer to give you time but he was unobliging even in this it is now or never but the spectaclesi cant wear them at home and i cant see well enough without them to do anything that would disqualify me immediately i know that too dear but there are other ways we must find you some magic contact lenses at this point chex cut in we have been searching for a suitable lens bush for two years but there seems to have been a blight on them godiva sighed i was afraid of that then there is only one thing to do we must take her to the good magician to find out how she can nullify this liability wait mother gwenny said you mustnt do this for me but dear time is short there is only one month before the ascension of the new chief only the good magician can possibly know where contact lenses may be obtained immediately i agree mother but i must go to him myself if i am unable to do that much without adult help how can i ever be chief she is correct godiva chex said she must rise to her own challenges now they will not allow you to assist her at goblin mountain and the challenge of reaching the good magician is surely less arduous she must have practice in the intervening time little as it may be the gobliness was silent in an appalled way centaur logic was impossible to refute but i think it would be legitimate for her companion to accompany her chex continued but che is even younger godiva said the danger the winged monsters will protect him as one of their own godiva nodded we have seen the manner of that protection gwenny knew it was all right then recently she had been coming to understand some of the nuances of adult dialogue which were sometimes more subtle than children appreciated the centaur had in effect said that the winged monsters would take care of che and his companion which was gwenny herself chex herself was a winged monster and she had been taking care of both of them all along godiva had acknowledged it she was complimejiting chex on it so ttiey would allow gwenny and che to travel by themselves to see the good magician if anything really bad threatened the winged monsters all of whom had taken an oath to protect che would intervene that intervention could be formidable they had at one time almost destroyed goblin mountain itself when they had thought che was captive there well start tomorrow gwenny said we can use the magic paths and grandam chems map actually that would be a copy for chem centaurs maps manifested in air they were extremely accurate so it was decided godiva goblin agreed to stay the night and in the morning they would go their separate ways for the nonce godiva had to keep an eye on things at goblin mountain until the new chief took office with luck and management that chief would be gwenny che and jenny elf arrived back from the field gwenny explained about her need to go to see the good magician and how it was all right for che to come along but what about jenny he asked gwenny hadnt thought of that of course she didnt want to leave jenny elf behind jenny had been ches friend before he came to goblin mountain and she had been gwennys friend too jenny too if she wants to come she agreed of course i want to come jenny said id like to see the good magicians castle when im not distracted maybe he can tell you how to get back to the world of two moons gwenny said yes maybe he could jenny agreed but she did not seem completely excited by the prospect in the morning they bid farewell to ches sire and dam and to gwennys mother then godiva took one path heading east toward goblin mountain and the three of them took another heading south toward the gap chasm and the good magicians castle the copy of chems map showed that they could use the invisible bridge to cross the gap and then go right on down to the castle then they would have three challenges to surmount before they could get into the castle and after that oops gwenny said i will have to give a years service to the good magician for his answer to my question but i have only a month before i must be chief then i will ask on your behalf che said no i will jenny elf said her cat sammy was riding in her backpack you two must stay together but gwenny started to protest then she realized that this was help she needed and that perhaps jenny had looked ahead and realized that their juvenile friendship could not endure beyond the settlement of the chiefship gwenny would then either be chief with its pressing responsibilities or dead in either case she could not truly be with jenny so their separation was coming regardless it was not as if service to the good magician was onerous the word was that often it was as beneficial for the person as for the magician thank you jenny there was more to be said but she couldnt figure out how to phrase it they walked down the path not hurrying they had a fair way to go and there was no point in wearing themselves out also perhaps they were not eager to separate and that separation could occur at any time after they reached the castle this was the last of their carefree association the abode of the winged centaurs was not far from the gap chasm they reached it in the afternoon the path led right up to it and stopped there was nothing but the great deep awesome expanse of the gap ahead che looked at the map the invisible bridge is supposed to be right here i dont see it jenny said smiling he flicked her hair with the tip of his tail making it float about her head we must verify its location and cross making sure no creature is below it what does it matter whether there is anyone below jenny asked i mean we arent going to drop rocks on him gwenny is wearing a dress jenny laughed gwenny felt her dark face doing its best to blush she was indeed in a dress because she had deemed it to be more ladylike than jeans now she wished she had followed jennys example and settled for the jeans because it would be a horrible disaster if anyone below looked up and saw the color of her panties no one was supposed to know that they were goblin black no male anyway jenny knew but not che she hoped well first we have to find it jenny said im not stepping out there until im sure theres something to step on it seemed that there were not such things as invisible bridges on the world of two moons where jenny came from so she was slow to accept them she found a length of wood that would do for a pole and used it to poke along the edge of the cliff when she passed the section where the path ended without result she extended the pole farther and tried going back but there still seemed to be nothing solid are you sure its here she asked che took another stick and probed for the bridge himself with no better success i must admit that it doesnt seem to be perhaps someone misdirected the path who would do that jenny asked oh anyone with mischief in mind perhaps compewter the evil machine who can change reality hes been in a snit i understand ever since his plot to make grey murphy his slave was foiled but how will we find it if we cant see it and dont know exactly where it is then she turned her head to address her cat no im not setting you loose to find it sammy im afraid youll forget what youre after and bound into the gap sammy pretended he was asleep che shook his head i fear that finding it could take a long time it will probably be better to walk on along the gap until we come to the main bridge which is both substantial and visible i believe it is not unduly far out of our way i can make us all lighter so that we will not get tired from the extra walk and we can perhaps proceed more rapidly they did that they walked along the cleared region near the brinkit seemed that trees did not want to grow too close lest they fall offtoward the west it was fast going because che had flicked them making each girl weigh only a fraction what she usually did this could have been dangerous when the winds were high but this was a quiet day they came to the main bridgeand paused dismayed there was a horrendous demon standing on it blocking their way the thing stood ogre tall had tremendous tusks and a glare so intense that the air in its path flickered and smoked i dont think that creature likes us jenny whispered but how can a bad creature be on a charmed bridge gwenny asked adjusting her spectacles to see it better there arent supposed to be any hostiles along the magic hs p the charm may not work well against demons che said or the magic of the bridge may be weakening we shall have to tell the good magician so he can fix it but first we have to get to his castle jenny said and i dont think were going to do it by crossing this bridge there is a third bridge che said checking the map i suppose the sensible thing to do is go to it gwenny sighed i suppose so but it is getting late they walked on west leaving the glowering demon behind when they slowed che flicked them all including himself and they got lighter and faster they came to the third bridge it was narrow but looked solid jenny stepped toward it wait che said he took a stick and poked it at the planking i was afraid of that afraid of what jenny asked it isnt solid see the stick pokes right through it without resistance but the map shows it gwenny protested upset its not supposed to be illusion it isnt its onewaygoing the other way but we have to go our way i am not certain of the mechanism of it che said i suspect that someone recently used it and that it reverses after use to allow the person to return or just to be fair to the other side we just happened to arrive at the wrong time gwenny stamped her delicate little foot oh this isio frustrating were i not the daughter of a chief i would say something disreputable perhaps jenny could say it instead che suggested shes not royal as far as we know what expression did you have in mind big mice maybe even rats jenny cried the bridge trembled smarting under the disreputable expression gwenny giggled feeling better nevertheless they could not cross what were they to do all three bridges had been denied them and the day was fading perhaps if i made us even lighter we might walk down the face of the cliff che said we could not fall or if we did we would land so lightly we would not be hurt in that case we could just jump jenny pointed out gwenny considered i suppose if its the only way they stood at the brink ready to be lightened then a gust of wind came followed by another i just thought jenny said if we are feather light couldnt that wind blow us away unfortunately it could che agreed i fear that our timing is wrong again but there has to be some way gwenny exclaimed we have to reach the good magicians castle perhaps we can go around the gap chasm che said the map indicates that it ends at the water then how will we cross the water jenny asked we shall have to fashion a raft or similar craft che said we should be able to do that in a day or so if we can find suitable materials oh this is getting so complicated gwenny wailed i could summon a winged monster che offered no i have to get through this myself or it doesnt count i mean with your help and jennys but not with adults or monsters otherwise i wont have what it takes to be chief and might as well give up and i absolutely refuse to do that well get through jenny said reassuringly so they proceeded on west and as the day expired they reached the shore of the sea they scrounged for food and found a pie tree with an overripe cherry pie and a somewhat soggy chocolate pie it would have to do che found a deserted shed and some old pillows the shed seemed to have an old debug spell on it because there were no bugs inside they made themselves as comfortable as they could for the night the two girls lying down on either side of the little centaur i dont mean to complain gwenny said but somehow i never thought about the awkward little details of adventuring its really more comfortable at home its better than being a prisoner of the goblins jenny said i mean when the goblinate i know what you mean gwenny said male goblins are brutes thats why i have to be chief if i can then well try to be civilized i think it is my destiny to help you do that che said am supposed to change the history of xanth and i think that will happen if you become the first female goblin chief dont know about the history of xanth but ill do my best to change the history of the goblins gwenny said the goblins are a significant part of xanth they lapsed into silence and then into sleep but gwenrly was uneasy she had no certainty that she could even manage to become chief at her tender teen age or that she could do the job thereafter in the morning shivering they ate more aging pie and set about making a raft the map indicated a copse of deadwood trees nearby and sure enough there was enough deadwood lying around to make several rafts but how were they to tie it together there seemed to be no suitable vines unless they wanted to try to hack some from a tangle tree they knew better than that but jenny had an answer she addressed her cat sammy we are looking for some nice strong safe vines that are close by do you think you can find sammy bounded away ill follow him jenny said hurrying after there was a swirl of dust before gwenny she retreated not trusting it but it followed her theres something here she said i think its magic immediately che came to join her thats a dust devil he said but theres no dust so its probably a demon a face appeared at head height on the swirl two round eyes made from vortices of dust and a mouth formed from a wriggling dust snake no a demoness what are you tankards up to what cups glasses containers bottles mugs goblets whatever nothing interesting gwenny said hoping the demoness would go away there was no point in correcting her about the distinction between a goblet and a goblette or in reminding her that there was only one goblin in this party they had enough problems without having them complicated by a supernatural creature demonesses were supposed to be less worse than demons being mischievous rather than mean but their mischief could be formidable more of the form appeared smoky hair sprouted and curled downward a larger swirl of dust became a voluminous skirt there was nothing between the skirt and the head but they were evidently connected i dont believe that you seemed most eager to get across the gap gwenny caught on that horrible demon blocking the way that was you of course that path is enchanted a real monster couldnt be on it but since i mean no harm and the menace was illusory no problem i just wanted to see what youd do gee thanks gwenny said sarcastically youre welcome sarcasm was of course wasted on demons jenny returned realizing that something was happening here a demoness she asked the dust coalesced into a rather shapely figure of a woman metria che and jenny exclaimed almost together you know her gwenny asked surprised she pestered us when we were coming to goblin mountain jenny said she pretended to be nada naga and talked to prince dolph well a winged centaur foal traveling with goblins and an outsized elf girl on the back of a sphinx was interesting metria said defensively well were dull now gwenny said doubt it why are three young folk traveling alone when they are under the protection of the winged monsters because were trying to learn to be independent and what would a longhaired goblin woman have to do with any of this shes my mother gwenny said shortly s o your mother left goblin mountain to come to the centaur family and next day you three depart alone going in another direction you say thats not interesting gwenny realized that metria would not be denied if we tell you what were up to will you leave us alone that depends lets make a different deal if what you tell me is interesting ill tell you something interesting gwenny looked at che is that a good deal it probably is the centaur said i understand that metria always honors her deals and always tells the truth but that often the deal doesnt turn out the way the other party thinks it will and often the truth is not what h wants to hear lxletria shot him a glance even little centaurs are entirely too intelligent however che continued it will be necessary to obtain her commitment to privacy because our mission is of a private nature metria grimaced that ruins half the fun of it but secrets are more interesting than what everyone knows ill agree very well gwenny decided ill make that deal for she realized that if their story bored the demoness she would go away and that was what they really wanted my father gouty goblin just died and i have to try to be the first female goblin chief of goblin mountain but i cant see very well without spectacles and ill never get to be chief if the other goblins know that so ive got to get contact lenses instead im going to ask the good magician where i can get them the first female chief metria said does that mean your tribe of goblins will start acting civilized yes i can see that there will be no entertainment there but of course you may not win the chiefship in which case the goblins will continue to be interesting yes that must be what che centaur is fated to accomplish getting you to be chief that certainly would change the history of xanth yes now what do you have interesting to tell the demoness made an expansive gesture her arms seemed to jump from one position to another in a series of placements instead of smoothly the way mortal arms did only that there is another group of three traveling to see the good magician they are mela merwoman okra ogress and ida human only the other two dont know yet that ida is to be part of their party mela merwoman che said thoughtfully isnt she the one who yes the color of whose panties represents the question the good magician couldnt answer it seems the time is coming for her to don them she doesnt know this of course shes entirely innocent which is a paradoxical appellation to apply to such a brute such a what animal beast critter freak monster creature whatever metria agreed crossly how come you didnt stumble over paradoxical appellation i am a centaur such vocabulary is natural to me well i stumbled jenny said what does it mean metria was pleased it means that this is the only way in which mela is innocent when it comes to males sheoops just how old are you fourteen jenny said just as crossly as metria had been before i havent joined the adult conspiracy metria looked her over but youre about to it isnt just a matter of age after all mice grow up and join in a matter of weeks but why should mela merwomans excursion be of interest to us che asked well she isnt of course your kind has no interest in panties and the girls already know about them but okra ogress is of interest to jenny elf jenny was startled she is yes arent you aware of the rationale behind your arrival in xanth it was an accident i was trying to catch sammy and we wound up in xanth it was no accident you were chosen to come here someone had to be jenny in xanth and you were the one jenny was flustered i dont understand there were two finalists a foreign elf and a local ogress the elf was chosen so you were guided through the hole in xanth and the ogre girl was dumped chosen jenny asked bewildered someone wanted a jenny here so she was brought thats why the muses were so interested they hadnt done it but then the ogress had to take whatever name and role were left over so okra ogress is a minor character and not too pleased about it it should be interesting when you two meet when we meet jenny exclaimed appalled maybe it will happen at the good magicians castle ida of course is even more remarkable in a weirder way so the future of that trio is a good deal more intriguing than your future with that interesting news i leave you metria faded out you were right gwenny said we dont like her truth who wants to meet an ogress nevertheless we learned something unexpected che said when i started to ask about mela merwoman i was thinking of the way she kidnapped prince dolph intending to marry him when he came of age but metria told me something of which i had no inkling it must be known only to the demons now at last we know the question the good magician could not answer but thats such a simple question gwenny said any magic mirror could answer it just by looking ahead there must be more to it than we know che said then they both looked at jenny who was oddly silent you dont have to meet any ogress jenny che said reassuringly it isnt that its that i didnt know i was chosen that someone else got excluded i didnt mean to do that i thought it was just an accident my coming here you didnt exclude anyone che said you have no responsibility for that still i feel guilty that poor ogre girl gwenny laughed poor ogress thats impossible all ogres are brutes how do we know jenny asked gwenny exchanged a glance with che it was evident that jenny had not had much experience with ogres che changed the subject we must build our raft thats right jenny agreed i forgot about sammy i hope i can find him she hurried off again in the direction the cat had gone this time the other two followed her the three spread out so as to be able to cover more territory the little orange cat could be anywhere he was able to find anything except his way back from wherever he went that was why jenny was so careful about letting him go in strange territory the demoness had appeared at just the wrong time perhaps by no accident but it was all right sammy was just a short distance away playing in a pile of vines there was a quiescent tangle tree nearby they were able to recreate what had happened an ogre had passed by and the tangle tree had made a grab for it and the ogre had twisted off a number of tentacles and thrown them away such incidents occurred all the time in xanth because neither ogres nor tangle trees were noted for their intelligence or caution they hauled the drying vines to their assembled wood they bound the wood together until they had a ragged but serviceable raft it took only half the day because it was no fancy job they hauled the raft to the water clambered onto it and used deadwood poles to push off when the water became deep they used deadwood paddles to move the raft forward i hope fracto doesnt spy us jenny said there was a rumble of thunder horrified they paddled madly but the raft moved as slowly as it could the inanimate tended to be perverse the thunder turned out to be a false alarm it wasnt fracto but a routine action of offshore clouds that did not come closer they nudged on toward the shore to the south of the gap then the current caught them the raft was carried out to sea and they were unable to stop it they watched helplessly as they moved away from the land but there was an island the current carried them tantalizingly close to it yet they were afraid to try to swim to it because there could be lurking water monsters waiting to gobble them the raft passed the northern tip of the island and started out into the larger part of the sea they watched despairingly as adventures went this was a bleak one there was a breeze here blowing from the sea toward the land but it wasnt enough to reverse the effect of the current it merely slowed their outward travel prolonging the agony then gwenny had an idea che you can make the raft light then we can use the wind to get to the island che did it he flicked every log of the raft with his tail and the raft rose in the water floating very high then they braced themselves and stood with their backs broadside to the wind now the current had less raft to work on and the wind had more to work on the raft slowed jogged a bit twisted around and finally nudged back toward the island it was working finally they reached the beach and jumped back onto firm land they hauled the light raft after them for they would need it to cross from the island to the mainland but meanwhile it was getting dark and they had to make camp for the night find us a good place to sleep sammy jenny said putting her cat down on the sand because this was an island she didnt need to worry as much about his getting lost sammy bounded toward the center of the island they followed and there suddenly they spied a tent that looks familiar che said it certainly does gwenny agreed its almost as if we have been here before playing in the sand jenny agreed then it came to them this is the isle of view gwenny exclaimed where prince dolph married electra and that tent is where they summoned the stork che agreed so well that the stork brought them two babies jenny added dawn and eve che said they looked at each other a naughty thought flitted between them do you think gwenny started that if we spent the night here jenny continued that we might learn the secret of summoning the stork che concluded lets find out gwenny said so it was that they spent the night in comfort using the same pillows that dolph and electra had left they had a fine pillow fight for there was no adult to tell them no but they didnt learn the secret of summoning the stork it seemed that dolph and electra had taken it with them they had joined the dread adult conspiracy what a pity in the morning they lightened the raft again hauled it to the east shore of the island and paddled it across to thmainland a sea monster poked its head out of the water and eyed them but a huge roc bird just happened to fly by and the sea monster ducked out of sight gwenny realized that the winged monsters were indeed keeping an eye on them that left her with mixed feelings she wanted to make it on her own but still it was comforting to know that they would not be gobbled by a monster so maybe this was a reasonable compromise the three of them were being allowed to proceed without interference from either hostile or friendly creatures maybe they would have less need for protection as they gained experience they found a magic path and followed it inland it would lead to castle roogna because all the paths of the region did gwenny had visited the castle once with her companions after dolph and electras wedding it was an impressive edifice much nicer if the truth be confessed than goblin mountain suppose she just came to castle roogna and didnt leave it then she would lose her chance to be lady chief but she would be safe she shoved away the temptation it wasnt that she wanted to be chief it was that she had to be so as to change the course of goblin history and therefore xanth history it was her duty and her destiny she dreaded it but she could not flee from it then she realized something she had been making decisions she had thought of a good idea that got them to shore she was learning how to be a leader she might not be very good at it yet but she was getting better maybe just maybe by the end of this journey she would have learned it well enough so there was a scintilla or perhaps even two iotas of hope for her so resolutely she proceeded on toward castle roogna okras mind tended to keep pace with her body since that was now rowing hard she was thinking hard but since there wasnt much to think about at the moment she thought about her past seeming almost to relive it she had been delivered by the stork fourteen years before to a small community of ogres still living beside lake ogrechobee it seemed that they had gotten turned around during the migration to the ogrefenogre fen and returned here without quite realizing after a few decades they had caught on but by then it was too late to catch up to the main party so they had remained okras ogress mother disappointed by okras pipsqueak size had tried to compensate by giving her a name to grow into okra cordata saxifrage goatsbeard ganas ogress unfortunately she hadnt grown enough and was singularly small and plain for her kind she didnt even have any warts or fangs her stare would never curdle milk she was also embarrassingly weak she had to use both hands to crush juice from a rock but her worst failure was in her mind she was not nearly stupid enough this defect had a minor compensation she was smart enough to hide this fault and to pretend to be only a little less stupid than the other ogre whelps but she could not hide it from herself and it was her constant shame okra tended to stay close to home so as not to be teased by her peers other ogres thought that peers were wooden structures that projected into the water of lake ogrechobee and had no concern about them but okra knew better peers were other ogres her age and they were the very worst company for her she was content to stir the pot and scrape the dirt off the floor and to think her frustratingly smart thoughts if she ever let slip how unstupid she was they would throw her away but some events she had been unable to escape her stylishly brutish parents had taken her to the monster marriage mash of conan the librarian and tasmania devil conan was said to have been able to squeeze a big dictionary into a single word and to be able to use two heavy tomes to pound the civilization right out of any creature in short order tasmania was hailed as the meanest shecanine of an ogress of her generation so it was a perfect match alas the marriage did not work out well conan was too literate for tasmanias taste and she had a restless spirit when the blood was on the moon she would feed him wild poison mushrooms that she ground up and mixed into his sea oat cakes he loved the taste of those cakes but the poison only gave him romantic notions she wished he would lie down and die so that she could marry her first cousin tasmaniac and gain status but instead he was fired up for twice the usual amount of stork summoning and their family grew at an ogreish rate but that was irrelevant it was at this wedding that okras mother fem kudzu had gotten okras horrorscope cast in iron the ogre tribes midwife who helped point out the right families when the stork couldnt tell one from another was also the diviner she announced that the runes ox entrails and stars pointed to good news and bad news the good news was that okra would eventually become a significant figure in xanth the bad news was that she had been cursed by a stray random accidental curse that escaped from a curse fiend without finding its proper object and so had a magic talent kudzu had reacted to this outrage as any ogress would she had smashed the diviner into the lake where she had disappeared without significant trace only a few fragments of bones showed at the waters edge and the chobees soon gulped those down she jammed the iron cast down into the ground so deeply that molten lava filled in the hole it left then she hauled okra back into the midst of the festivitiesthe mashing and bashing the slam dancing and the floor show with the drunken harpies harpingand pretended that the horrorscope had never been cast but okra knew better ashamed she slipped away from the festivities and hid in the cold slimy ratinfested cellar that was a pleasant place but still someone might find her so she went down the winding narrow stone steps down down to the main kitchen where the wedding feast had been prepared pieces of chopped monsters lay seattered around they must have fallen off the platters as okras reddened eyes grew accustomed to the smoky gloom she saw sea oat cakes both plain and poison strewn on the stone floor someone had spilled a keg of wine dregs all over the kitchen table the floor and a drunken rat who lay in a stupor under the table it was a very pleasant retreat and okra was able to hide there until the commotion above ground down into a dull roar that was one of okras early memories and not unpleasant as ogre experiences went but the knowledge that she was cursed with a magic talent haunted her thereafter all ogres had magic of course and plenty of it it was magic that gave them their vaunted strength ugliness and stupidity but a separate talent that was awful no wonder she was small and plain and unstupid her natural magic had been siphoned away to make this other talent but maybe with luck she would never discover what it was her other big memory was when she was thirteen it rained as it did every afternoon in this season thick steamy clouds wet on those below with torrents of sheets of deluge that drenched the hot rocks and cooled the hot pools steam puffed up but the freezing rain sliced on through making a turmoil of vapor that suffused the caves and made it almost impossible to breathe it was wonderful the dining room smelled of spoiling cabbage and stewed carcasses that too was wonderful okra mussed up her unogreishly blond hair so that it would better hide the iq vine circlet she wore as a wreath and went inside iq vines had little effect on most ogres because twice nothing remained nothing but it helped okra be alert enough to conceal her other liabilities one was asthma a siege of it had somehow found her and it refused to depart so she had to pretend to be fashionably hoarse though actually she was having trouble breathing she remained naive enough to fancy that a birthday was important to anyone other than the owner of it this was the day that cured her of that notion it was just a pretext for another bash and a new horror she would later wish she had never had that birthday but at the time she hadnt known how it would turn out she had retained a taller of innocence in an effort to sweeten the air okras grandmother that great burgundy queen opuntia had arranged to intermix heaps of wilted flowers with the rushes strewn about the dining room there was a riotous show of color white magnolias yellow orange and red hibiscus deep purple jacaranda bougainvillea and the famous fragrant lavender blooms from which grandmother ogres medicinal soap was made all of this was quickly trampled under the humongous hairy feet of the ogre clan as they pounded in to eat soon the dining room looked like an elegant woman dressed in soiled and tattered rags feeling somewhat the worse for wear the door from the kitchen opened and the old servant troika troll tromped in bearing the largest soup tureen behind her other servants came each bending under the oppressive weight of the food piled on their serving platters the last person in was magpie okras tutor she was in black leather and black feathers her outfit was dated by a century or two but that was understandable for magpie was a demoness who had served similarly in many places and times she had even been at the fabulous human castle roogna with princess rose serving at her wedding to good magician humfrey later rose had gone to hell in a handbasket but remained a good person hell needed more roses and roses were her talent who knew what else magpie had seen during her immortal existence no wonder she liked being a servant but someone tripped and dropped a platter and its contents spewed across the table and floor incompetent screamed the cook enraged she threw crockery handfuls of ground pepper and finally okras birthday cake across the room that caused the ogres to think that there was a food fight in progress and they gleefully pitched in filling the air with flying food the original purpose of the party was forgotten now the dining room smelled not only of spoiled cabbage and wilted flowers but also of every other type of bad food okra appalled wept that was of course a giant yes yes of a nono and gave her an ogresized headache she fled the hallonly to collide with great auntie fanny why ogrette whatevers the matter fanny inquired a male ogre child was an ogret and a female an ogrette of course not that anyone cared well maybe the goblins cared but only because they had goblets and goblettes they cruined my birthday party okra cried oh is that the occasion i thought it was a routine food fight it is now well then there will surely be other birthdays how old are you thirteen today auntie okra replied beginning to feel less worse great gobs of gook auntie exclaimed politely petard and brimstone you are overdue for marriage youre so small it never occurred to mebut i will speak to my husband bareface von wryneck at once we will check the grapevine to see which first cousin ogres are available but okra tried to protest lets see theres young crawling banks hes so stupid that if he had dynamite for brains he could not clear one hairy nostril hes ideal but i think another ogress has her eye and maybe a ham hand on him already theres the twins slow comb and fast comb but its too hard to choose between them because each ones duller than the other well youll probably have to wed the widower zoltan dread locks that name was unfamiliar who auntie poked her head through the door because it happened to be closed the wood splintered it was the doors own fault for being in the way she pointed a ham finger see that dirty old ogre dressed in animalskin slippers and the mask of the black death thats him yes i think hes the one you know my first second and third husbands were widowers when i wed them so i can recommend the type an ogre doesnt get to be a widower unless he treats his ogress pretty roughly it stands to reason so hell be fine for you okra backed away and stared around her petrified with a little loathing and a lot of fear just before she fainted she had a vision of a great gray city crowded with gargoyles made of stone fortunately auntie fanny thought she must have knocked okra out with an accidental sweep of her ham hand and didnt realize how unogreishly sensitive and weak she really was fanny proceeded forthwith setting up the marriage however none of the top prospects was interested in okra they pointed out with some justice that she was too small and scrawny to stand up to much punishment and her looks were so plain as to be disgusting and there was even an ugly suspicion that she wasnt as stupid as she pretended to be her parents finally gave up and turned her over to her more understanding grandparents and the search began anew so it was another year before a suitable prospect was lined up smithereen an ogre from the far ogrefenogre fen who had never seen okra so didnt know her liabilities he started down to meet her but there were distractions along the way such as trees that had not been twisted into pretzels and small dragons who had not learned fear thus his progress was slow for of course he was doing what it was in an ogres nature to do setting the world along his route into ogreish order when he arrived he would do the same for okra everyone fondly hoped for her need was obviously great when the blood was on the moon shortly after okris fourteenth birthdaythere was no party because she was getting entirely too long in the tooth for marriage as if her faults werent already bad enoughthe third big uply event in okras life occurred her kindly grandparents disappeared leaving her in the charge of her uncle marzipana giganta la cabezudos fen ogre and is toady henchmen numb nuts and big blue nose marcipana was a fine specimen of an ogre he liked to stick pins into living butterflies and wear them on his head every time he suffered a difficult thought his laboring brain heated up his head and the butter melted but that was no problem he seldom bothered with difficult thoughts and it was easy to catch new butterflies okra knew that creatures disappeared on occasion ogres did all manner of stupid things such as barging through dragon conventions or walking off sheer cliffs and were generally then heard from no more no one thought anything of it except okra who discovered yet another peculiarity of her nature grief she missed her grandpirents and was sorry to think that anything bad could have happened to them naturally she kept this sentiment to herself because of her primary flaw her intelligence unable to sleep okra roamed the dank chambers and dusky tunnels of their home caves by night during one of these dismal jaunts she happened to overhear the voices of her uncle marzipana and his henchmen it seemed that the ogrefenogre fen ogre smithereen had been spied bashing small dragons over their heads with fresh pretzel treetrunks and would bash his way on to lake ogrechobee any day now they were afraid he would balk when he actually saw okra so they planned to carve a petrified pumpkin into the shape of an ogre faceany random pounding and slashing would do for thatand jam it on okras head so that she would look uglier than she was at least until after the wedding then it wouldnt matter of course the ogre would pull out her hair and bash her real head into any new ugliness he preferred for some reason okra wanted neither the pumpkin treatment nor the marriage she realized that she just didnt fit in ogre society so with shame she did her final unogreish thing she bugged out she packed her dragonleather knapsack and made her way out to the dark slurpy shore of the lake where her little homemade oxblood boat lurked ogres were no sailors so none of the others had ever recognized the nature of this craft let alone connected it to her she had often rowed around the lake by night finding it blissfully peaceful that of course marked one more flaw in her nature no good ogre desired peace but once she was in her boat and fleeing the ogre caves she realized that she had nowhere to go she was unlikely to get anywhere if she had no destination so she pondered and by and by it came to her she would go to the good magician for an answer since she didnt have a question she would have to come up with one she cogitated and pondered and considered and thought about it until her skull began to overheat and finally decided that she would simply ask for her fortune whatever the good magician had to offer was bound to be less worse than whatever else she faced but she didnt know where the good magician lived so she solved that problem ogre fashion she just rowed and rowed until maybe shed get where she was going while she did she continued to thinkthat was a lifelong fault of hersand realized that she might have a better chance if she did not leave her fortune up to the good magician she should frame her question so that the answer would give her the clue to improving her fortune but how could she do that questions flitted tantalizingly around her ears never quite entering her head she began to get annoyed that gave her a notion maybe she should ask whether she should keep her temper and if so where should she keep it but after a time she realized that the good magician might simply answer no and charge her a years service so she discarded that one and continued to ponder she rowed and rowed because she couldnt see where she was going but obviously wasnt there yet that gave her plenty of time to think finally she came up with what she thought was the perfect question how could she become a main character for it was evident that evry creature was a character in the realm of xanth but some were more important than others all of them suffered sundry travails but the main characters had a much helter record of survival and success than did the throwaway characters most ogres were obviously throwaways which was why their lives were so wretched but if she could somehow manage to become important then her fortune would take care of itself the night had brightened into day and the day had darkened into night several times during the course of these deliberations still she hadnt gotten there and she was beginning to get somewhat tired and hungry but she was afraid that if she stopped rowing she would get distracted and never get there then there was a horrendous bump she had gotten there but when she looked around she discovered that it was only a bare shore there was no magicians castle in sight oh everythings going wrong she exclaimed ill never find the good magician hello startled okra screamed and leaped into the air she came down on her feet outside the boat halfway frazzled she hadnt realized that anyone was close it turned out to be a merwoman in nymph form named mela they talked and decided to cross the lakeit was now the kissmeetogether because okra had the boat and mela knew where to go okra tossed the boat back into the water and they started off okra rowed vigorously having recovered some strength during the brief pause and encouraged because now there was someone to show the way mela was saying something but okra couldnt hear over the sound of her rowing but when her thoughts had run their course catching her up to the vicinity of the present she became aware of something else the sky was darkening was it night already no it was a big thick cloud getting ready to rain on them well a little rain wouldnt hurt unless it filled the boat maybe it would be better to go to land and wait out the storm as they would not make much progress in a storm she paused in her rowing do you think we should she inquired too late mela cried a gust of wind chose that moment to blow her hair halfway across her face fracto has cut off our retreat fracto king cumulo fracto nimbus the worst of clouds he always makes trouble but ogres like trouble can you swim no i i then you wont like fractos kind of trouble she had a point okra tried to turn the boat around and row toward shore but the wind gusted up hugely and blew them the opposite way now she saw that the cloud had formed a big misty mouth and was blowing right at them the wind was whipping up the waves which were becoming mountainous rain started first a few fierce drops then a drenchpour eeeek mela screamed pulling her bare legs up fresh water whats wrong with that im a saltwater creature fresh water foozles my tail but youre wearing legs i dont know how to swim with legs anyway it foozles my skin too indeed her skin was getting all blotchy where the rainwater was striking it okra tried to scoop out the water in the boat with her hands but it was coming in too fast so she grabbed her oars again maybe we can get somewhere she said mela looked doubtful but whatever she was trying to say was lost in the howl of the wind and roar of the waves okra saw a huge wave looming trying to swamp them but she managed to heave the boat forward enough to elude it and ride its swell after it settled a little waves could be handled they were like dragonsnot too bad if closely watched and tackled from behind but it just got worse sheets of water swept across making mela scream piercingly enough to be heard even above the storm and filled the boat rapidly okra couldnt row she had to bail so she shipped the oars and started scooping out water with both hands it flew out in gouts lowering the level and that saved the boat from sinking but that meant that they were entirely at the merciless mercy of the wind and waves in addition okra could feel an asthma attack coming on the exertion wind and soaking were making her breath clog asthma always waited for the worst times then the awfullest wave yet charged them it picked them up and carried them at a horrendous rate into obscurity all they could do was hang on soaked through by the seething foam they were doomed to go wherever the wave took them with no argument the boat crashed onto a sandy hairy crumb of a rock it overturned dumping them out the water receded leaving them sitting high and wet mela was huddled and shivering and even okra was cool that had been a nasty storm but they had after all made it to land the storm moved on leaving only a few satisfied rumbles behind it was through with them oh no mela exclaimed as she straightened up and sat down more or less in one motion okra looked there was a great moving mound of sand coming toward them giggling gotcha in my sand trap it said hee hee hee no she she okra gasped two shes not three hes she hoped her breath would unclog soon its a sandman mela said and hes caught us in his sand trap thats why fracto dumped us here sand trap okra stoodand sat again as the sand went out from under her it catches you so you cant get out of it ive heard about it but never been in it before the sandman will cover us over until we smother and then well dissolve away until only our heads are left and well be beachheads hee hee hee the sandman repeated agreeing okra focused her brain and thought heavily for a moment she knew she couldnt fight the sandman because she could hardly breathe and was getting horribly weak so she had to use her brain such as it was a dim bulb flashed heating her head she had a feeble notion she reached into her soaking wet knapsack and pulled out her lunch a bottle of door jam she hated to waste it but it seemed necessary she twisted the cap making it ajar and dumped the jar of it into the sand around her the sand swarmed over the sticky stuff and got jammed more sand came in and it too got jammed soon there was nothing but jammed sand okra got to her feet and stepped on it the surface was now firm because of the sand the jam nullified the looseness of the sand and the sand nullified the stickiness of the jam she could walk on it but the effect did not reach to mela so okra stood at the edge of the jammed sand and reached out to catch the merwomans hand and draw her in then the two of them stepped out of the sand trap the sandman was so annoyed that he sank back into a blah mound good riddance but this turned out to be an island not the far shore of the lake they would have to stay here overnight for the storm could turn around and get them again if they tried to leave before it did okra dumped the remaining water out of the boat and set it out to dry in the sun they found a pool of firewater mela decided that this was better than fresh water so they had a bath in it using a cake of carved soapstone they found nearby soon the were free of the last of the horrible froth fracto had dumped on them okras asthma gave it up as a bad job and let her breath unclog they rubbed their hair dry with a towel from a cottonwood tree then mela sang a sirerl song as she combed her long tresses making them magically lustrous okra watched intrigued she pulled out a lank strand of her own hair it had never occurred to her that hair could be beautiful and it was not the ogre way tobut still mela smiled would you like me do your hair too okra blushed which was another unogreish thing to do and agreed so mela used her magic brush and song and soon okras hair had changed from dank strands to lustrous tresses she looked at her reflection in the pool and was amazed the light was getting all lavender purple and soft it was time to find something to eat before the light moved on to deep purple and black they gathered beach nuts sand dabs beached banana boats and finally found a coconut tree with several nuts full of fresh cocoa that gavt them plenty to eat and drink despite the loss of okras door jam then they collected driftwood and made a drifters hut to sleep in okras boat turned upside down made the roof they gathered fresh pillows and sheets from pillow bushes forming a comfortable bed they slept in the morning they scrounged for more food finding some crabapples they cooked in the hot spring until they stopped squirming and set out again okra had new confidence because she discovered she liked having a companion instead of being alone mela was not at all like an ogre she was beautiful and nice and fun to be with may i ask you something okra mela asked sure but i may not know the answer ogres arent very smart you seem smart enough to me what i want to know is why is it that you dont talk like an ogre i do talk like an ogre but not as loud no you dont you dont rhyme ogres dont rhyme yes they do they say things like the think you stink crude rhymes you dont talk that way okra considered maybe we just sound that way to others we dont to ourselves or maybe your ogre tribe is different from the other ogres maybe ill try to rhyme if you wish mela laughed musically dont bother i like you as you are okra rowed and they made progress toward the far shore of the lake but okra facing back spied a cloud on the horizon which rapidly grew larger as it approached i think fracto is coming after us again she said mela turned back to look youre right thats the demon cloud can we get to land before he reaches us we can try okra bent to it with new vigor and the light craft leaped ahead still fracto gained and would have caught them except that his leading winds just blew them farther ahead he couldnt suck them back into himself however they didnt have much choice about where they landed and didnt have much chance to check around before the storm hit they snatched burlap from a tree strung it over a branch and weighted down the ends with heavy shells this gave them some shelter from the wind and rain and they huddled inside it while the storm raged outside at least they had made it all the way across the lake it remained day but there was nothing to do except wait out the storm okra was really getting to dislike fracto it rained every day at home too but that wasnt malignant fracto evidently stormed just to make trouble for travelers so they lay down and slept okra was a light sleeper for an ogress anything out of the ordinary made her alert thus she woke when the burlap and shell curtains shook and tinkled as if blown open by a wet breath of wind the thing was there was no wind at this point the storm had wandered elsewhere a billowing dribble touched okras arm and then landei with a soft splat on the floor it was a very faint sound but it was unfamiliar so it brought her fully awake one when she had slept in the garden at home a snake had paused and thought about performing a snakely function and the sound of that thought had awakened okra as it happened she was glad to wake because she had been dreaming of riding a night mare and that was not her favorite occupation she had never ridden anything preferring to use her legs on land or her rowing arms in her boat on the water but she was aware that the dangers of the waking state could be almost as bad as those of dreams she opened her eyes and looked at what had fallen beside her it was a fat lunatick ready to gorge itself on her blood even now it was using its stubby legs to craxvl toward her hoping to bite her in an unseen place and get her blood without waking her it was about the size of her fist and twice as ugly a nest of such ticks could drain a persons whole body during sleep so that the victim never did wake up of course that meant that there was no more for the ticks to eat and most of them died that was one reason they were called lunaticks they were crazy but how had the tick come here her eyes flicked to the sloping side of the impromptu tent but there was no hole there so it hadnt dropped in from outside since lunaticks couldnt fly it must have been thrown there it was not true that ogres always blundered noisily when they moved they could act quickly and silently when they had to they seldom had to as it was normally easiest simply to bash something into oblivion but okra being the least of ogres had learned more of silence than was useful her hand went soundlessly to her knapsack beside her and her fingers closed about the handle of her skinning knife but she didnt stab the tick that was a minor pest she wanted to be ready for the major one she knew had to be near then carefully she turned her head there was an awful figure standing over melas still form there was the smell of fresh blood she had thought it was from the tick but now she knew better okra recognized the figure it was a geek they were lesser humanoid monsters smaller and weaker than ogres or trolls but they made up for it by being nastier in personality no geek was ever up to any good that was in the big book of monster rules okras arm moved she threw the knife at the geek but the geek with the evil cunning of its kind turned to flee the blade he was too slow the steel of it buried itself in his back but of course he didnt die geeks had no hearts so stabbing one in the heart wasnt properly effective but the puncture did cause some discomfort and the creature fell out of the tent okra leaped to her feet to pursue him for if she didnt finish him off he would only return for more mischief she strode out of the tent and paused in dismay there was a slew and a half of geeks climbing all over her oxblood boat and lunaticks were trying to suck the ox blood from it outraged okra advanced on them she had forgotten to recover her knife but her fists would do you ridiculous geeks what are you doing on my boat she demanded they looked at her we want to talk you into coming with us of course one said geeks were not the smartest of creatures in fact some were rumored to be almost as stupid as ogres so it didnt occur to them not to answer a question once we have you we will tie you up and hit you for no reason at all until your willpower is gone and we can start work on your wont power when you finally give us the pleasure of dying we will feed your carcass to our hungriest lunaticks he had an oily stinky voice and the smell of a dung beetle those were his better aspects but you geeks dont know how to row a boat okra protested for the moment being almost as stupid as they it was expected of an ogre after all we will make you row it to our hideout where there are many more of us we will take the merwoman along too she looks luscious enough to give us some pleasure before we take all her blood okra didnt know quite what he meant by that but was sure it wasnt anything nice she had heard enough it was time to act so she waded in forming her best emulation of ham fists and knocking geeks every which way she was the smallest and weakest of ogres but these were only geeks soon she had scattered them to a suitable degree they would not bother her for a while then she picked up her knife and returned to the tent to check on mela the geek had set several ticks on her and they were already gorging there were scarlet ribbons of blood on her face hands and breasts the worst of it was that she remained asleep the bites of the ticks were painless so mela didnt even know how she was being drained mela wake up okra said urgently now the merwoman woke she felt the ticks on her body looked down at them and exclaimed yeeeech okra was startled she had never before heard a fourpoint exclamation but the exclamation points were definitely there just like little clubs then she got into action pulling the ticks off mela and squishing them with blows of her miniham fists then okra donned her knapsack and led mela out the merwoman remained weak and dizzy having expended much of her remaining store of energy in the production of that excellent exclamation she would need further attention but first they had to get to a safer place mela blinked as she stepped out and looked around ek she said managing a quarter point scream that was hardly audible what are those things doing draped across the branches of trees and with their heads rammed through knotholes and with their feet sticking up from the mudbank those are geeks okra explained i asked them to get out of our way oh then melas eyes fastened weakly on the boat eek that scream was a little better formed and more emphatic than the last but still not in the same universe as the first exclamation okra picked up the boat and shook it dumping the lunaticks into the water mela relaxed they left the dangerous bay behind them going out onto deep water there was no sign of fracto fortunately the late afternoon was beautiful okra shipped the oars and dug in her knapsack for her medical kit this was yet another unogreish artifact she had picked up most ogres took no note of pain and less of injury she dabbed at the tick bites with unguent but didnt accomplish much mela had lost too much blood even the twin firewater opals she wore on the chain around her neck looked listless so okra did the best thing she could think of she rowed back to the island there she avoided the sand trap and hauled mela to the hot pool and washed her off then mela began to revive for a hot bath had a magical effect on any woman her listless straw hanks of hair began to turn to golden tresses which turned a pretty green under the water okra found a timely thyme plant and a medicinal mint herb she dipped them in a mug of the hot water concocting first one tea and then two teas she gave these to mela to drink and these teased her into further improvement then okra set her on pillows and sang ogreish songs until mela faded away to sleep unfortunately the only one she could remember was happy birthday a rare blue moon came up okra admired its color this was the first time she had seen this hue on the moon she wished she could get some blue cheese from it but couldnt reach that high then she slept especially lightly ready to wake at any sign of trouble in the morning mela felt better but okra felt worse she was hardly able to get into the boat to resume rowing yet she wasnt wheezing what was the matter with her let me check this mela said take off your kriapsack she helped okra remove it ha i thought so theres a tick on you indeed the tick was on okras back hidden by the knapsack which she had not removed overnight it must have crawled into the knapsack while okra was dealing with the geeks then gotten on her while she slept mela took pleasure in drowning the tick in the hot pool then she took care of okra the way okra had taken care of her and by the end of the day okra was feeling better they had a meal of fresh coconut cocoa breadfruit and a variety of butters from beach buttercups the following morning okra rowed them back across to the western shore mela used her opals as searchlights to find a safe path that would guide them across a mountain of sand dunes and down into a huge cave with magic springs an underground stream and a colony of freshwater merfolk she had a little manual in her invisible purse that described the locations of the various merfolk tribes and there was supposed to be such a colony here for she depended on these cousin creatures to give her directions to reach the castle of the good magician the freshwater folk had little association with the saltwater folk but merfolk were bound to support merfolk however there were details that melas manual didnt mention after topping several sandy dunes they stopped by the pathside in the shade of a mixed forest of beach umbrella trees bagpipe bushes clove trees and ladyinger and palm trees the umbrella provided shade the bagpipes played skitly music and the ladyingers made delicate gestures that caused the palms to sweat okras own palms were sweating for she was carrying her oxblood boat and the higher they climbed the heavier it got that was part of the magic of heights of course they made things heavier they found a health spa spring and drank from it then the path became narrow and they had to leave the boat at the spring and follow the winding rocky magic path as it became a white marble chip path they reached a charming antique garden where they settled down to rest mela could not resist plucking a silvery platina lace shawl from a nearby spanish shawl bush and okra nibbled bits and pieces from the pink peppermint candytuft tree it seemed that they had lost any cares they had ever had and were now carefree mela knew a song which she taught okra the saga of the sleeping dragon the sun seemed to slow its journey overhead listening then they saw thyme plants growing near and realized that the presence of a number of these could slow time here and make the day longer it wasnt just their imagination they could relax here as long as they wanted and only a little time would pass outside the thyme garden but soon they moved on along the path realizing that the slowed time was also a good way to get more rapidly where they were going they walked on through the glorious colors symmetries music tastes smells and feelings of this region it appealed to all their senses ahhh ohhh mela sighed as they came upon a crystal rock garden filled with sweetly scented white rock roses tiny paper narcissi and softly baaaaaaing white phlox even okra untrained as she was in the appreciation of loveliness was rapidly learningit a small crystal spring bubbled and sang from the top of the miniature crystal mountain to tumble down down the little crags into a crystal pool below it was perfect except for one small detail the small frozen figure of a young human woman encased in a large block of crystal that was being used to prop open the door of a garden shed they entered the shed which turned out to be a cave with dusky recesses they gazed at the figure she was a fairly pretty creature wearing pale waterwashed aqua blue chiffon dress and golden filigree sandals i dont like the look of this at all mela whispered grabbing nervously at okras arm and shivering suppose you and i also fall into that crystal and remain here as prisoners of thyme forever we must hurry away from here but what about that poor trapped girl okra asked is it right to leave her here mela frowned you would have to think of that no its not right we shall have to try to help her mela lifted her two firewater opals and approached the crystal watery fire shot out and bathed the block it shimmered and its corners melted but the girl inside remailied frozen the opals were not strong enough for this job maybe i can carve her out okra said she drew her knife and attacked the crystal fragments flaked off tnd fell to the floor but soon the knife dulled and the main bulk of the crystal remained maybe my siren song can do it mela said she opened her mouth and sang her lovely weird melody the crystal shimmered and rainbow glints of light radiated from it but it did not fracture or dissolve mela gave up maybe your voice can do it she said try singing ogre loud okra opened her mouth a strange feeling came over her she sang a note and then a higher note and then more higher notes in a stairstep pattern the notes rose to high c and above until they disappeared through the roof and could be heard no more there was silencebut okra was still singing thats your magic talent mela exclaimed you have an ultrasonic voice the crystal block shivered and cracked suddenly it burst apart and the young woman stood there free shaking her head and blinking her eyes but now the heavy stone door to the garden shed was closing having lost its doorstop get out mela cried alarmed the young woman merely shook her head confused okra acted she charged through picked up the girl and carried her out before the door shut them in mela followed her out the three of them stood breathing hard as the door crunched into place behind them okra set the young woman down whats your name mela asked her the young woman took a breath and at her bosom the material of her dress shimmered into a silvery aegean blue green which exactly matched her pale jade green hair and aqua green eyes i dadont ida mela asked know she finished oh the merwoman considered well lets just call you ida then i am mela merwoman and this is okra ogress we just rescued you from a cruel imprisonment hhello ida said thank you now we must learn all about you mela said so we can help you where are you going ida shook her head going she asked blankly well then where have you been ida spread her hands im not sure mela looked at okra i think we have a problem but okra had an idea maybe she wants to go to see the good magician just as we do to get her life straight is that the case mela inquired yes i think so if i can find the way mela smiled as it happens we are in the process of finding the way so you can come with us and the good magician will know what to do ida nodded yes id like that but the path is closed off now okra pointed out the door closed when we took out the block now we cant reach your merfolk cousins and get directions maybe there is another route mela said we shall just have to go back and see so they started back mela led the way and ida followed and okra was last once again her thoughts started galloping around inside her skull bouncing off the bone and getting all mixed up what a strange thing to meet such an elegantly garbed young woman sealed up in a crystal castle roogna was protected by its great orchard che knew about this of course it was part of the centaur lesson plan we have to make sure that the trees know we are friends he said otherwise they will move their branches to block us oh pooh jenny said trees dont move their branches unless theres a strong wind she marched ahead along the path branches swung down from the left and right barring her way then again maybe they do she said stepping back i forgot that this isnt like the place i came from how do we let them know we are friends gwenny asked we identify ourselves and state our mission he said once they know us they wont bother us again so the goblin girl approached the crossed branches i am gwendolyn goblin heir to the chiefship of goblin mountain on the way to consult the good magician about something i need if i am to succeed in becoming the first female chief among the goblins the leaves of the trees rustled after a moment the txvo big branches lifted up letting her pass but they dropped back into place behind her jenny stepped up again i am jenny from the world of two moons im gwennys friend and i want to help her the leaves rustled again and then the branches lifted letting her pass che stepped up i am che centaur gwennys companion i may be destined to help change the course of the history of xanth the trees let him pass also thank you he said they moved on through the orchard where all manner of trees grew with their fruit there were cherries in varieties ranging from chocolate to bomb and pies ranging from lemon to cow and footwear trees ranging from boot to ladys slipper they looked at these sorely tempted but knew that they had to present themselves at castle roogna before touching anything then the castle itself loomed up forbiddingly surrounded by a deep moat a serpentine moat monster lifted its head to stare at them but it recognized them ajid relaxed they had after all been here before they just hadnt come by foot then there was a scream from inside in a moment a young woman in blue jeans and shirttails dashed out her braids flying che gwenny jenny she cried it was electra the first princess of xanth to wear such informal clothing they had been at her wedding two years before she was actually twenty years old but looked sixteen that was fine because her husband prince dolph was seventeen and women were supposed to be younger than men and if they werent they had to fake it che wasnt sure of the origin of that particular rule but it was in the big book of rules somewhere electra hugged them all and ushered them into the castle she took them to the nursery to show off the twin gis the stork had brought her dawn and eve it was hard to imagine this girlishly freckled person as either princess or mother but she was and evidently quite happy to be so they were given a room to share and che gazed out the window while the girls took baths and changed clothing centaurs did not have the same conventions as the human folk but honored them when in human company so he did not try to sneak a peek at anyones panties tempting as the prospect was then they were escorted to the main dining hall for dinner now they met king dor and queen irene who were gracious prince dolph was also present looking somewhat gangly then electra appeared and for a moment che did not recognize her for she had been transformed she wore a pale green gown speckled with golden motes and a tiara in her hair and her feet were dainty in ladys slippers her face remained freckled but now it was adult and beautiful she looked almost as wonderful as she had on the day she married dolph when the magic wedding dress had changed her from nothing to lovely you seem surprised queen irene remarked che glanced guiltily around and realized that she was speaking to gwenny and jenny whose mouths had sagged open that was a relief ches mouth had almost done the same electras so different jenny said just a moment ago she was in blue jeans we have learned the art of compromise queen irene said by day and in informal situations electra dresses and acts as she pleases in the evening and when formal she dresses for the part she is after all a princess now i wonder if i will ever be like that gwenny murmured awed surely you will dear when you are chief queen irene said your mother is excellent with clothing and manners actually she was not far from it now che reflected gwenny like all goblin females was petite and pretty and in the dress she was wearing at the moment she was winsome but she did not know it which was surely part of her appeal they ate well for all the fruits of the orchard that had tempted them were served there was even a nice plate of cat treats for sammy che realized that queen irene had noticed and made sure to please the guests yet why should the queen have gone to such trouble they were merely three creatures on a private mission hardly worthy of royal treatment no that was not correct they were special people jenny was a representative of a species of elf never before seen in xanth whose story was as yet incomplete she had pointed ears and four fingers and her folk in their own realm had the ability to communicate mind to mind gwenny had the chance to be the first female chief of a goblin tribe and that could transform the relations of goblins to other species as dramatically as the change of clothing had done for electra and che himself was supposed to change the history of xanth though the way of that was not yet clear perhaps he would be instrumental in helping gwenny achieve the chiefship or perhaps it would happen in some other manner so the three of them though young were not ordinary and queen irene was well aware of that possibly his sire and dam had notified the queen that they were coming centaur adults left little to chance still he appreciated the courtesy which was being extended and knew that the girls did too after the meal electra invited them to join her and her daughters in princess ivys old room to see the magic tapestry she carried the twins in a large bassinet they like to watch it electra explained so we watch it before they go to sleep for the night it is always interesting the tapestry turned out to be a big woven picture of castle roogna hung on the wall it had been made back in electras time almost nine hundred years ago by the sorceress tapis the sorceress had given it to the zombie master in the form of a puzzle and he had not appreciated its nature until he had assembled it now the zombie master lived in the present but had elected to leave the tapestry where it was most useful at castle roogna it had helped educate princess ivy and prince dolph and any number of other folk for the picture on the tapestry was not fixed it constantly changed showing facets of the history of xanth or contemporary events it was possible to spy on others using it though of course good folk would never do that still that did make it a most interesting item what would you like to see electra inquired the twins dont mind what is on theyre too young yet to be choosy actually at the moment the twins werent looking at the tapestry at all they were watching sammy cat who had joined them in the bassinet he was playing with a loose thread on their blanket gwenny shrugged but jenny looked concerned do you think it might show okra ogress she asked hesitantly immediately the picture changed it showed a strange crystal rock garden with white rock roses and sheeplike white phlox a crystal spring flowed from a little crystal mountain making miniature waterfalls until it formed a pool below the scene was beautiful but there were no figures in it ogre or otherwise only a block of crystal which propped open a door then a figure appeared a rather large human woman heavy boned and lightly furred her strawlike hair flared outward from her head and down her back in knots and tangles with her was a smaller but more voluptuous woman wearing slippers and nothing else her hair was the same yellow color but the tresses were glossy and silky rather than crude and ropy thats mela merwoman a voice said from the doorway it was prince dolph who had stopped by for a moment thats rightnada said you knew her electra remarked without enthusiasm uh yes he said staring at the image of course i didnt want to marry her because you were nine years old at the time electra retorted but i must admit that she has very nice never mind electra snapped the picture fuzzed in the region of melas torso so that whatever he thought was interesting was no longer so prince dolphs eyes were freed from what had held him like the peephole of a hypnogourd oh to be nine again he murmured as he departed gwenny and jenny exchanged a glance which che intercepted he knew their thought was this what marriage did to a relationship then electra got up do you mind keeping an eye on the twins for a while i have something to do the girls in the manner of their kind were glad to keep an eye on the twins all girls loved all babies in ches observation electra hurried out i wonder what she has to do so urgently jennyaid musingly i suspect she means to apologize to prince dolph che said apologize for what for being jealous gwenny said oh but jenny wasnt quite satisfied couldnt she have just said she was sorry here perhaps she had a gourd realm apology in mind che said smiling jennys brow furrowed thats different this time it was gwenny and che who exchanged the glance you dont know about apologies among the brassies gwenny inquired an apologys an apology isnt it i see we shall have to show you gwenny said with an obscure smile che the naughty girl che approached her he was seven and she was fourteen but he was of a larger species and his human portion was somewhat taller than she who apologizes to whom he inquired ill apologize to you gwenny said the way electra will do with dolph very well proceed i dont understand jenny started gwenny embraced him i apologize che she said winsomely then she drew herself close and kissed him on the mouth what are you doing jenny asked amazed do you accept my apology gwenny asked che grimaced im not sure he said with a smile playing the game actually gwenny was very nice to have so close her body had become rounder and softer in the past two years but that was surely irrelevant oh youre not gwenny breathed then i shall just have to try harder she removed her spectacles and brushed back her hair with her hands then she embraced him again more closely so that there was no space between their bodies she reached up and hauled his head down mussing his hair and plastered him with xanths sloppiest kiss now are you sure her face was serious but he knew she was trying to stifle her laughter it was a favorite game to imitate the foolish things adults did he stifled his own mirth well enough jenny cried giggling the twins seemed to be smiling too watching the apology instead of the tapestry so was sammy you mean thats what electra and dolph are doing now kissing more than that i think gwenny said with mock gravity as she recovered her spectacles so that she could see clearly again but im not partial to the adult conspiracy so i dont know what i suppose they enjoy it though that adult conspiracy is such a bore jenny said what is it they think should be such a big secret im sure i dont know gwenny said but it seems to relate to why men like to look at creatures like mela merwoman they looked at mela again in the tapestry whose body was no longer fuzzy but no matter how hard che stared he couldnt fathom why men would prefer to look at the merwoman rather than at something interesting such as a dragon or pie tree or mathematical equation meanwhile the action proceeded in the picture mela and the other woman were trying to get the block of crystal to break open for it seemed that there was something inside it that they wanted they werent having much success but we were supposed to see okra ogress jenny said plaintively che suffered a realization the room brightened momentarily as an invisible bulb flashed above his head that big womanthats the ogress gwenny and jenny stared but shes not big enough or ugly enough gwenny protested shes mostly like a big human woman but now che was orienting on particular features do believe she is an ogress he said the patterns of her bones her way of movingthese indicate ogre stock but she must be the smallest weakest and least ugly of n all ogresses maybe she had a bad illness gwenny said so she doesnt measure down to ogre standards and got booted maybe she should have gotten the part then jenny said maybe she should have become the major character so and where would you be now if that had happened gwenny inquired sharply back in the world of two moons jenny said she began to cloud up with my family and the ability to send without your spectacles che said quickly or your new friends gwenny added jenny brightened thats true but still it wasnt fair to exclude we dont know why you were chosen to come here or by whom che said but there must have been good reason one day we shall learn it until then we cant judge it i suppose youre right she agreed she looked again at the picture is this what is happening right now there i dont think so che said i understand that the tapestry normally orients on events of the past so this may have happened a few days ago but it is now night it may be that the ogress is sleeping so the tapestry showed her a few hours ago when she was active i wonder whats in that block gwenny remarked if we knew how to manage the tapestry we could change the orientation of the picture che said we are seeing the block from behind but it looks as if there is a person inside it how weird gwenny exclaimed then electra reappeared looking slightly disheveled but happy she was back in blue jeans thank you she said going to the twins did he accept your apology jenny asked what electra asked blankly gwenny stifled a giggle we thought maybebut obviously we were wrong the twins are fine do you know their talents yet as a matter of fact we do the good magician told us dawn will be able to tell anything about any living thing and eve will be able to do the same for any inanimate thing he says those are both magicianclass talents wow gwenny said awed well its not really coincidence every one of grandpa binks descendants has magicianclass talent im not sure why but it has been true so far i was just lucky i married dolph so that my children are blessed thats great jenny said those talents will be very useful when they get old enough to use them electra picked up the bassinet and carried it away sammy jumped down losing interest che went with gwenny and jenny to their room where the girls changed into nighties and he lay down on the floor among cushions sammy joined him then jenny sang a song and soon they were all in the magic dream that formed there was a trick to sharing jennys dreams they had to divert their minds to something else first but they had learned how to do that and so had sammy so they found themselves sharing a dream of friendly dragons unicorns and centaurs in an orchard much like the one around castle roogna with pleasant skies then they lay down on the soft sward and fell asleep somehow it was always more fun to go to sleep in a dream than it was in reality on the morrow they resumed their trek to the good magicians castle there was an enchanted path leading directly there so they knew that that part would be easy but they also knew that getting into the castle would not be easy there were always three challenges and if the querent succeeded in getting by them she still had to perform a years service for the good magician in short frivolous questions were discouraged thus their mood was not light as they set out the air fuzzed before them and the demoness metria formed you must be really excited she said our anticipation knows no bounds che agreed tersely especially considering that the good magician has arranged to hit you with the most intriguing possible challenge the demoness continued i have never seen him use this one before in the century or so i have known him she was of course trying to fluster them che kirey better than to let her succeed no doubt the other challenges are even worse no there is to be only one challenge this time but there are always three and we are three people so we may have more not so the good magician has made a freedom in your case a what privilege manumission deliverance emancipation liberation exception whatever she agreed crossly but why we are just ordinary supplicants not deserving of any special treatment true therefore it is a mystery how i love a mystery why dont you ask a question of the good magician yourself then because it is his business to resolve mysteries not to generate them anyway dana doesnt like me to get too close to him who the good magician who else i mean who is dana his wife i told you about that before oh she hadnt told him but probably had told someone and misremembered whom her memory was like that che had heard about the matter the good magician had had five and a half wives in the course of his life and now they took turns being with him dana must be the one who was a demoness so it seemed that one demoness could be jealous of another that was interesting they did have some human emotions then he thought of a way to get rid of metria for a while why dont you go ahead and wait for us to arrive at the castle instead of watching our boring walk there are you trying to get rid of me of course that means you dont want me there you are trying to fake me out of course good idea ill do it she vanished you faked her out jenny exclaimed how did you manage it i locked her into an eitheror mode che explained pleased she thought she had to be either here or there and chose there as more interesting it didnt occur to her that she could have done both youre smart i am a centaur he said modestly maybe by the time we get there shell have forgotten us gwenny said that is my hope the path enabled them to travel rapidly nevertheless it was more than a days walk maybe we should look for a place to camp for the night jenny said sammy ran ahead of them as always she followed because the cat was almost as good at getting lost as he was at finding things che and gwenny followed her sammy took a side path they wouldnt otherwise have noticed it led to a little park they found a nice umbrella tree conveniently placed for just such travelers as themselves with nearby fruit and nut trees and a big pillow bush so they dined on breadfruit with butternuts and drank vanilla milkweed pods with candy canes for dessert do you think well stop liking such things when we turn adult and join the conspiracy against fun gwenny asked oh i hope not jenny exclaimed yet somehow it seems that everything changes when a person grows up che said sadly look at electrl actually shes not so bad gwenny said she still wears blue jeans by day maybe she didnt really join the conspiracy she summoned the stork che pointed out maybe its possible to learn how to do that without adopting the bad parts like spinach jenny said hopefully lets agree that well subscribe to only the good parts of the conspiracy che suggested well be different when we grow up yes gwenny agreed the three of them clasped hands sharing the oath they settled down for the night moving into a dream and then into sleep as usual che suffered a bellyache during the night he wished he hadnt eaten quite so many candy canes they now had a distressing aftertaste he heard the girls tossing restlessly in their sleep and knew that they had the same problem it was of course impossible that a person could ever get too much candy still there was something maybe there had been a curse on some of them in the morning they marched the rest of the way to the good magicians castle none of them had been here before so it was more daunting than castle roogna had been despite being smaller and without the tree guardians well technically jenny had been here but only briefly she had been allowed to inquire about the way back to the world of two moons but then had changed her mind before getting the answer she had decided that she wasnt ready to leave xanth yet to che and gwennys relief but since the good magicians castle was different each time anyone visited it that hardly counted now it was just a somewhat dilapidated stone edifice surrounded by a small moat it seemed undefended there was no moat monster and the drawbridge was down no person was in sight as they came closer they saw that their first impression had been deceptive this was not an ordinary castle at all it was made of pastry and candy the walls were not stone but fruitcake with large stonelike sections of fruit the roof seemed to be peanut brittle the drawbridge was gingerbread and the moat fizzed like pop from lake tsoda popka they managed to exchange a threeparty glance why dont i trust this gwenny inquired because it is not trustworthy che replied the good magician always knows when a querent is coming and is always prepared querent supplicant petitioner beggar moocher sponge oh stop it gwenny said laughing you mean folk like us who come to ask a question whatever che agreed scowling but he couldnt hold it more than a moment and had to smile at least it broke their tension or dented it somewhat there must be something we dont see jenny said since i will ask the question so that i can do the years service i might as well lead the way she started toward the drawbridge wait gwenny protested there may be danger i should go first even if im not going to actually ask the question no need to quarrel girls che said putting oil a superior smirk first we can be reasonably sure theres no danger because the good magician wouldnt want to hurt us and the winged monsters wouldnt allow it anyway but the winged monsters arent watching at the moment jenny said looking around certainly they are he said maintaining his superior smirk oh where che pointed to a purple dragonfly perched on a nearby bush there she looked but thats only a bug thats a winged monster he will report to the others if anything happens or take care of it himself i dont believe it jenny said ixnay gwenny murmured warningly she was too late the dragonfly had taken umbrage it jetted into the air leaving a trail of sparks and a contrail of vapor it zoomed away in a moment it returned leading a phalanx of dragonflies now the sound of their wings was audible they swung around in formation and oriented on jenny elf duck che cried its a strafing run the three of them threw themselves to the ground little streaks of flame passed over them and burned the nearby foliage the dragonflies flew on out of sight they picked themselves up they werent shooting for effect che said if we hadnt ducked they would have held their fire i think i guess they made their point jenny said im sorry i doubted the purple dragonfly reappeared and perched on her shoulder he accepts your apology che said gwenny laughed but you dont have to kiss him jenny was serious still they cant help us with the good magicians challenge its not allowed maybe sammy can find a safe way in che suggested immediately the little cat bounded across the gingerbread drawbridge jenny ran after him as she always did wait for me sammy she cried gwenny rolled her eyes youre my two best friends but sometimes i do wonder about both of you she said you should know better than to suggest that sammy find something and she should know better than to dash madly into a strange castle we should che agreed apologetically but we dont i just hope theres not a mean witch in there they hurried after jenny who was by this time across the drawbridge and coming to the main entrance gate of the castle the drawbridge surface was slightly spongy but solid the gate was open and the cat was scampering on n they almost banged into jenny who had suddenly stopped just inside the gate she was staring up che looked in that direction there was a giant more correctly a giantess a huge human woman sammy no help in this crisis had curled up for a snooze under the giants chair come in children the woman said her voice boomingly dulcet she doesnt ilook like a witch gwenny said faintly no i am not a witch dear the woman said i am the archetypal adult i am here to initiate you into the adult conspiracy no gwenny cried affrighted were too young che protested in what he hoped was a reasonable tone two of you are on the verge and one of you is of a culture that recognizes another standard the adult said gazing down at che but im with those of human derivation who honor the conspiracy che said so i honor it too i have a question for each of you the adult said each will answer in turn if any of you fail to answer or answer incorrectly none of you will be admitted to the presence of the good magician is that clear che opened his mouth to protest that the rationale wasnt clear but the adults gaze bore down on him with such severity that he was daunted he realized belatedly that it had been a rhetorical question one that allowed only the answer desired by the one who put the question he scuffled his front hooves i guess so he said reluctantly the gaze moved across to the girls then they too fidgeted and mumbled their agreements you the adult said fixing imperiously on gwenny identify yourself lim gwendolyn goblin from goblin mountain im here to that is quite enough gwendolyn what is the adult conspiracy gwenny was taken aback thats my question no dear that is my questio to you che clenched his teeth this adult was so adultish that it was painful they were always so sure of themselves and so obnoxious about it but a child could never tell them that because they always twisted it around to make it seem that the child was the obnoxious one it was impossible to reason with an adult because the mind of any adult was set like old cement well everyone knows that gwenny began no dear i do not want anyones answer i want your answer gwenny began to show a bit of righteous rebellion my answer is that it is a conspiracy by adults to make children miserable she said because no do not tell why just what anything that really interests children the adults deny like all the good words that can make plants wilt and dry grass burst into fire and the ones that curseburrs respect and anything about how to summon the stork and they make children eat awful things like castor oil and broccoli instead of the good things like cake and candy and they wont let any boy child see anyones panties even if theyre really pretty panties or any girl child see what a boys got instead of panties and they make children go to bed early when theyre not sleepy things like that the adult nodded with distant tolerance that reminded che of another adultish annoyance they seldom praised a childs efforts unless it was insincere such as saying very good when the child succeeded in choking down a nauseating brussels sprout she turned to jenny identify yourself i am jennifer elf from the world of two moons jennifer why is the adult conspiracy what jenny asked startled not what dear why the adult was insufferably patronizing but that was normal i dont know why adults want to make children miserable jenny exclaimed angrily maybe theyre jealous of our open minds and sunny dispositions its not that way where i come from the adult frowned you can do better than that dear im sure there it was again che thought the adult was twisting things around not accepting the obvious answer adults always preferred to be devious but jenny tried well i can tell you why it might be if adults really cared about children there might be something dangerous that might hurt children so the adults try to keep children away from it like maybe those words of power if a child said one in a straw house it could set the house on fire and the family would lose its home che and gwenny looked at her astonished she was making sense there might actually be reason for a small part of the conspiracy though of course that did not justify the rest of it and the adult inquired in that uncomfortably rodding way they had and about eating the bad stuffits supposed io be nutritious jenny continued candyit tastes good but after a while it can pall and maybe it is not as good for the body as it seems she was evidently remembering their tummyaches of last night so the adults try to keep children from getting into trouble by eating too much of the wrong things and about going to bed early i did feel better when i got a good nights sleep instead of when i didnt get enough because of staying up late pillowfighting she looked apologetically at the other two and about not knowing how to summon the storki suppose there could be a problem if children started doing it because they wouldnt be ready to take care of babies i mean its fun seeing a baby once in a while but i wouldnt want to have to take care of it all the time and suppose a child got a baby just for fun and then got tired of it that would be pretty bad for the baby che was amazed jennys alien upbringing in the world of two moons must be telling she had actually made it seem as if there were a sensible reason for the conspiracy still and the panties the adult prodded well i really dont know about them but maybe they have something to do with the stork jenny paused trying to work it out it seems that adults maybe really like summoning the stork and they feel more like it if they see panties and maybe children would feel like it too if they saw panties and they might stumble onto the secret so they have to be protected from that too that will do jennifer again that contemptuous dismissal the gaze swung across to pin che again identify yourself i am che centaur of the winged monsters do you agree with the adult conspiracy che knew that the correct answer was yes but he was tired of being browbeaten by adult attitudes it was time to make a stand so he ventured into dangerous territory no elucidate if the adult thought he wouldnt know the word she would be disappointed she wanted his reasons well he might as well get into a lot of trouble as long as he was traveling that route maybe the adults think they have a reason for keeping things from children and making them do things for their own good but i think thats the wrong way to do it children should get good information and good experience so they can giow to be responsible when they finally have to be adults if saying a bad word starts a fire then they should be warned about that so they know not to set the house afire and if too much candy makes a bellyache they should be told and allowed to try it and after they see that its true they wont do it again if not getting enough sleep makes children feel bad the next day they should be allowed to try it until they find out how much sleep is best they dont need to have adults deciding for them all the time he paused afraid the adult was going to lift her monstrous foot and squish him to nothing but she merely sat there listening and she prompted and about summoning the storkwell i think that even a small child wouldnt want to hurt a baby so if children were taught how to summon the stork but also told how important it is to take care of the babies and that they would have to do that instead of going out to play whenever they wanted to i think most of them wouldnt do it the few who did do itwell my sire says that folk do have to take the consequences of their actions and i think thats fair for children too so i think children should be educated completely about both actions and consequences and then allowed to do what they wish i dont think any adult conspiracy is neededif adults take the trouble to teach their children properly he stopped talking waiting for the dread verdict that he had answered incorrectly so that they would not be allowed to see the good magician yet it wasnt in him to falsify it wasnt the centaur way the adults gaze scared across the two girls do you agree gwenny and jenny exchanged yet another glance they fidgeted well the adult demanded in that warning tone well yes i guess gwenny said with understandable reluctance you actually approve of giving such information to children the adult said with that thisisyourlastchance attitude yes jenny agreed i dont care what you think hes making sense and you too gwendolyn it was the verge of doom yes gwenny said recklessly and you are prepared to face the consequences of your attitude the gaze managed to transfix all three of them simultaneously they were in too deep to escape they nodded with foolhardy bravery then you are about to join the adult conspiracy the adult said she reached somewhere far away and brought back two dolls each was the size of one of the girls she set them down on the floor before the three of them show me how these figures would summon the stork but we dont know that gwenny protested dont you of course we dont jenny said are you sure the girls looked wildly at che i think she wants us to figure it out he said its our punishment for agreeing that we dont agree with the adult conspiracy my punishment really only since you support me you must share it they glanced up at the adult but she remained impassive somehow that was more frightening than whatever they had expected from her they glanced at the dolls which were male and female well if i want to be chief id better learn how to figure things out gwenny decided i think i do have half a hint about itmaybe i mean half a brother my little brother gobble goblin iswell my father gouty got together with a woman who wasnt my mother to summon the stork and the stork brought gobble so from that i know that folk dont have to be married to do it they can do it even when theyre not married and when its wrong they dont have to be in love either my father never loved anyone just so long as theres a male and a female it must be a purely physical thing yet there should be love jenny said i dont think the world of two moons is different from xanth in this respect we dont have storks bring the babies but i never was clear on the exact delivery system i just knew that if two people love each other enough a baby could come i think that if they cant love each other at least some they cant get a baby i have of course seen centaurs mate che said our kind does not use storks i think because our foals are too heavy for them to carry yet we have partial human heritage i wonder whether the human mode of summoning the stork could be parallel in any way gwenny picked up the girl doll who didnt have any clothes if these were centaurs what would they do to get a baby che picked up the similarly bare boy doll i think they would get close together like this he put the male doll beside the female doll but we were closer than that when we pretended to apologize the goblin girl pointed out not in one detail he said what detail jenny asked he poked around with the dolls this one i think the two girls stared but gwenny said but jenny echoed maybe it is different with centaurs che said its disgusting gwenny said not to centaurs but he was shaken could it he they stared some more maybe it is possible gwenny said but can that be all che shrugged with centaurs it seems to be enough no wonder they keep it secret jenny said no wonder gwenny echoed giggling then they were all laughing but it was the mirth of embarrassment tinged with shame they had never suspected that the adult conspiracy concealed something ike this i think we had better keep the secret after all he said after they subsided the two girls nodded both were blushing which suggested that they were just as uncomfortable about the as he was the giant adult faded away where she had been was an open hallway leading into the main part of the castle sammy got up and stretched his nap done it seemed that they had surmounted the challenge and could now meet with the good magician but at what a pnce their innocence was gone da was a foundling she appeared as a baby one day near faun mountain and a nymph carried her back to nymph valley the other nymphs made a great fuss over her and brought her milkweed pods to nurse on and set her in a nice bed of leaves and flowers but it was evident that she was not a nymph she was a human baby that the stork must have misdelivered or lost a neighboring otterbee spied her there and swam back to his fellows she otterbe with us for the night he said so she wont forget the way the nymphs do they agreed for otterbees were good creatures who never shirked a task so as dusk closed and the nymphs lost interest they took the baby and swam with her across the marsh to their warm nest and made her comfortable there in this manner they protected her from the night magic of the nymphs and fauns and allowed her to remember her prior days however some damage had already been done and the baby did not remember very much anyway but after several years her memory improved and as she grew thriugh normal child and girl and young woman stages she was able to remember most of her life back to about the age of three or four now she understood that she must not stay the night in nymph valley though she enjoyed spending her days there of course because she was not a nymph she did not indulge in nymphly activities with fauns she was satisfied just to watch them having their fun she did however swim with the otterbees who were creatures of the water and shore who also were happy in their fashion she otterbe educated in the human fashion the otterbees decided so they prevailed on an itinerant centaur named cerebral to give her lessons in the human mode for some reason centaur scholars did not wander they were itinerant but it meant much the same thing in this manner ida learned to speak human speech and to don human apparel and to brush her hair she no longer ran around bare the way the nymphs did she regretted that but the centaur tutor was very inn about the importance of maintaining the conventions of ones kind and he knew more than all of the fauns nymphs and otterbees combined so she had to do it she came to appreciate the liabilities of nymphly status some other creatures preyed on fauns and nymphs sometimes an ogre would stomp by pick up a screaming nymph and bite off her head that stopped her screaming and he would then carry her away for a more leisurely repast chewing as he went nymphs did not like that very well sometimes a dragon would slither through chomp a faun in half and swallow the pieces if it happened to be a firebreathing dragon it would toast the faun first fauns were not too keen on that but the following day it was as if nothing had happened the fauns and nymphs frolicked as before never missing the chomped ones ida tried to tell them about such events but they did not believe her because they could not remember anything beyond the one day after a while ida realized that they were perhaps better off that way what was the point in moping about bad memories still it bothered her there otterbe a better way she muttered there is a better way cerebral informed her the human way fauns and nymphs are chained to the present as are animals creatures of the moment but humans remember and reflect almost in the manner of centaurs and are therefore superior remember that for there will be a pop quiz thus did ida learn what set her kind apart from other creatures she did remember and she passed the quiz and was duly rewarded with some pop from lake tsoda popka cerebral believed in the salutary effect of incentives this meant in normal terms that good things came for learning ida would never admit it of course but she found learningfun for its own sake there was just so much to know and it was fascinating when she came to be twentyone years old according to the judgment of the centaur who had looked at her teeth the otterbees decided that she otterbe on her way to find her destiny we love your company they told her but we are only animals while you are a human being you deserve better things ida wasnt sure about that for the otterbees seemed like very deserving creatures to her so she asked cerebral unfortunately it is true he replied you are no more an otterbee than you are a nymph and you must not allow your horizons to be limited by theirs you must seek your destiny among your own kind but i dont even know where my kind are she protested where is there a man mountain or a woman valley i know of no such artifacts of terrain the centaur admitted perhaps you should seek instead the castle of the good magician who i understand is back in business at this time and inquire about your destiny he was out of business she asked slightly curious for several years but then the castle became active again under new auspices of course there may be a certain difficulty locating and entering it and you may be required to do a years service for the magician in return for an answer to your question however there are those who believe this to be worthwhile despite the difficulty and cost ida had learned that the cerebral was not necessarily expressing the opinions he seemed to be he had the didactic manner she assumed was common to his kind didactics never spoke directly and simply do you believe this to be worthwhile for me he considered for he was never so incautious as to express a thoughtless opinion he had once suffered a bout of hoofinmouth disease and been exiled from centaur association that was why he was available for tutoring her he no longer put his hoof in his mouth but remained excruciatingly careful yes other things being equivalent i suspect it is so ida set out for the good magicians castle she carried with her a small magic purse the otterbees had given her which contained her formal clothing a hairbrush and a change of unmentionables as well as a magic sandwich in case she got hungry she wore a bracelet which protected her from harm by any other creature these were things the fauns and nymphs had found and the otterbees had rescued from being forgotten the otterbees were not covetous they merely saved things until they could be used as they otterbe she bid a sad farewell to the otterbees fearing that she would never be as happy away from these good creatures as with them she knew she would always have a liking for ponds and mudflats and sandy shores then she set foot on the path leading to unknown central xanth at first the way was reasonably familiar because she had poked all through this region during the past two decades or so she knew which side paths to avoid because they led to tangle trees or dragons lairs and which fruits not to eat such as choke cherries but the farther she went the less familiar things became until she was in strange territory she came to a fork in the path which way was best she couldnt decide but she didnt want to dawdle she was no longer in nymph valley where dawdling was a way of life furthermore she needed to pause for an unmentionable function and wasnt sure whether that counted as dawdling one of the odd things about the centaur tutor was that he handled his own functions in a completely open manner yet insisted that she as a human being should pretend that no such functions existed this was the human way he said and she had to emulate human ways so as to be able to associate with her own kind in due course then a goblin came down one of the forks ida had an idea goblins were not the nicest of folk but they could be helpful if approached in just the right manner maybe she could ask him where the best place for the unmentionable was and if he gave a good answer for that she could ask him which fork was best hey burpnose wheres the worst place to do something unmentionable she asked the goblin looked at her then around at the scenery over behind that bush he said pointing so ida went behind the bush then something happened eeeek she screamed in the manner the centaur had prescribed for maidens which was how he classified her she marched angrily back to the path where the goblin stoically waited that bush tickled me she said naturally its a tickleberry bush but i asked you the worst place to go you were supposed to lie she said indignantly i did lie he replied the worst place is that gooseberry bush over there ida thought about that and decided that the goblin had after all been true to his nature then whats the worse path of these two she asked indicating the fork the goblin considered thats hard to answer why all you have to do is lie about the better hath but they are equally bad that meant equally good very well i withdraw the question get lost snothead the goblin evidently charmed by her courtesy resumed his walk down the path so her idea had worked out often they did but probably she owed most of whatever success she achieved to cerebrals apt instruction she had had the idea that he would be the best possible instructor when she first saw him and that had been amply vindicated in ordinary words that meant he had been good she set off down the right path because she didnt want to take the wrong path she had confidence that it would take her where she was going indeed it took her to a quaint little old cottage just as dusk threatened to overtake her maybe there would be a sweet little old housewife inside who had a room to spare for the night and a warm pot of stew on the hearth ida knocked on the door it opened and there was the grandmotherly woman why i was hoping for a nice young traveler to use my spare room tonight the woman said come in dear and have some warm stew ida came in gratefully your house was in just the right place she said i was hoping i wouldnt have to sleep out in the forest are you a quiet sleeper no i toss and turn all night im hyperactive that was the centaurs word for her restlessness wonderful it turned out that the old womans old husband had gone on a trip to the market and would be back with a basket of beans on the morrow meanwhile the house was quiet and the old woman wasnt used to that she wanted to be able to hear that there was someone else in the house with her especially when it was dark after supper they sat by the fire and exchanged news fortunately the old woman never left her house and yard and ida had never been away from her home vicinity before so neither of them had very much news to exchange ida was tired and the old woman never stayed up late so they both went to their rooms to sleep contented but as ida changed into her nightdress and lay down she suffered a qualm qualms were clamlike thoughts that lay at the watery bottom of consciousness and only showed up when the water got very quiet and clear as happened when a person was trying to drift off to sleep suppose the qualm inquired all was not quite as it seemed could the nice little old woman have some unnice secret she wasnt telling that would make mischief for her guest ida didnt like that notion but couldnt quite expunge it expunge in human terms meant to get rid of something sometimes she mopped up spilled milk with an old expunge she was concerned about what the darkness might reveal sure enough the moment she blew out the candle a ghost loomed up hoooo it cried airily flapping its sheet tails ida squirmed down under the covers its only meeee she replied apologetically the ghost seemed embarrassed i beg your pardon i mistook you for the dirty old man dirty he never washes his feet they get the sheets all messed up i cant stand to see sheets abused so i haunt him the ghost reflected for a moment before the mirror how are your feet my feet are clean ida said she poked a foot out from under the sheets maidens are supposed to have dainty feet so i try to conform the ghost examined them youre right those are very clean dainty maidenly feet when will the dirty old man be back tomorrow i think then until tomorrow the ghost faded out relieved ida settled down to sleep she was so glad it had turned out to be a nice ghost in the morning she mentioned the matter to th old woman did you know you have a ghost a ghost i thought it was a hussy hes a dirty old man you know yes his feet get the sheets dirty and the ghost doesnt like that well ill make him wash his feet the old woman said i dont like dirty sheets either after a nice breakfast of beans porridge ida resumed her walk along the path she wondered what she would have encountered along the other path she was almost tempted to go back and take the other one just to find out but restrained herself after all the sooner she found the good magicians castle the sooner she would know her destiny she hoped it was a nice one for she was a nice girl the path did not lead directly to the castle however it led to a dragons lair ida almost stepped into it before she realized she backed away as a general rule dragons lairs were not good places to be for those who were not of the dragon persuasion now she would have to return to take the other path though it was a rather long walk at least she would satisfy her curiosity about it then the shadow of a dragon fell and after it the dragon himself he had coincidentally cut off idas escape well now the dragon said allow me to introduce myself i am dragoman dragon what have we here nothing but a delicate maiden ida replied truthfully and do you know what i do with delicate maidens ida had a notion because of her memories of the dragons who had poached nymphs from nymph valley but she knew that her magic bracelet would protect her from harm i think you shall have to let this one go for you cannot harm me the dragon squinted down at her oh why not because i have a charm that guards me you are surely most charming dragoman agreed but as it happens i collect winsome maidens no i didnt say that i was charming though that nay be true i meant that i wear an amulet hm the dragon considered that does require some interpretation may i see it certainly ida removed the bracelet and handed it to the dragon dragoman inspected it closely you are correct this charm is effective against all corners no creature can harm she who wears this yes so i was informed may i have it back now please the dragon puffed a small puff of smoke there is something i feel constrained to clarify for you you are not wearing the charm now so i may do what i wish with you if i return the charm to you i will not be able to harm you somehow i doubt that my interests would be well served by giving you back your charm ida realized that she had made a mistake but she had an idea how to proceed it is true that i am unprotected now but i was protected when you asked for the charm this means that it was protecting me from you if you now were to harm me that would mean that it failed to protect me that would be what my centaur tutor would call a paradox a paradox is not a good thing dragoman puffed more smoke pondering i enjoy problems in logic he admitted i shall have to think about this certainly may i have my bracelet back while you ponder as you wish the dragon handed it back to her distracted by the intellectual problem thank you ida placed the bracelet firmly back on her wrist after a moment dragoman came to a conclusion i think you are correct you would not have been abte to give me the bracelet had i intended to harm you sirice i have no harmful intent there was no problem and no paradox thats nice ida agreed the dragon reached out and grabbed her however i never did tell you what it is i do with delicate maidens eeeek ida screamed for that seemed appropriate at this stage dragoman picked her up so nice of you to inquire i collect them i take very good care of them in fact i keep them perfectly preserved so you see i intend no harm to you and your bracelet has no need to be concerned he spread his wings and lofted the two of them into the air he took her to a crystalline cave it was beautiful all around it were giant crystals and in each crystal was a lovely young woman frozen still looking exactly like a lifesized doll but i dont want to be preserved in stone ida protested you dont have a choice dragoman said i dont you dont you are destined to be preserved in all your prettiness until someone happens to rescue you with luck it will be a prince but its as likely to be nobody of interest now change into your nicest raiment what raiment is clothing i knew that its the kind of term centaurs use what i meant was an exclamation of indignity why should i cooperate with you because you are less likely to be rescued if you look like halfchewed dragon bait ida considered that and realized he was correct so she changed into her best dress the blue chiffon and donned her display sandals so that her dainty clean feet showed meanwhile the dragon was fretting im going to have to enlarge this chamber he said it is getting too crowded ill just have to stack you in the shed for now until the renovation is complete the shed ida exclaimed dont i deserve better than that of course you do he said consolingly and i promise ill move you to a better place the moment i can she was not as satisfied by this as perhaps she should have been but since she didnt have much choice she did not complain anyway she noticed that the shed wasnt really a shed but a shed door leading out to what looked like a nice garden at least she would have a nice view there she brushed out her hair and was ready ah you look divine the dragon said step right up here on this pedestal please ida stepped resigned to her maidenly fate dragoman breathed a cloud of thick vapor at her it coalesced encasing her and suddenly everything changed dragoman was gone and a voluptuous merwoman wearing legs was yelling at her get out what had happened where was the dragon ida shook her head confused then someone charged in from the side picked her up and carried her out of the shed before its door slvung closed the second person who turned out to be a big young woman set her down whats your name the merwoman demanded name she had never had a name none of the fauns nymphs otterbees or monsters had names only cerebral centaur and dragoman dragon i dont know she said having difficulty speaking well lets just call you ida then the woman said i am mela merwoman and this is okra ogress an ogress ida gazed at her in surprise then she realized that she had never seen a female ogre it was possible that they were much less ugly than the males as was the case with goblins mela continued to question her but ida was at a loss for answers she had sought her destiny and her destiny had turned out to be crystallized apparently that had occurred and these were the folk who had rescued her she had no idea how much time had passed or where the dragon was now but the name they had given her was settling in and now it seemed that she had always been ida and that anyone who might have talked or written about her would have been calling her that the centaur would have alluded to it as retrospective nomenclature but probably it was just backdating the text the folk who had rescued her seemed nice enough possibly they were on a mission of their own it would be really nice if they were going to see the good magician it turned out that the merwoman and the ogress were indeed going there so ida decided to join them it seemed that their path led through the garden shed and was closed off when they removed the crystal block containing ida so they had to find another way she was sorry to have interrupted their journey but had not been aware of what was going on until they freed her from the crystal mela led the way and okra was last with ida safely in the middle they reached a health spa spring and had a drink then okra picked up a red boat she had evidently left there before and carried it over her head with the strength of her kind they finally came to a big lake this was it turned out lake kissmee they got into the little boat and okra rowed them vigorously across to an island it isnt really safe on the shore mela remarked its not safe on the island either but we know what the dangers are so were more comfortable here indeed it was comfortable for there was a wonderful hot pool mela explained that she was not at all partial to fresh water but had learned to appreciate this pool as it was firewater she had a set of firewater opals that seemed to glow more brightly as they neared this pool the three of them soaked in it and compared histories ida told her story up to this point and okra told hers and how she hoped to become a main character and maybe lose her asthma and mela said that her story was too long to cover as she was older than she might appear being one of the longlived sea monsters but that she was now in search of a suitable husband she really was not choosy any handsome thoughtful intelligent gentle and manly prince would do especially one who happened to like well endowed merwomen ida was not conversant with the tastes of princes but she suspected that any who were manly would like melas endowments which were trying their best to float to the surface of the hot water okra had a question how is it that you understood the speech of the dragon she asked ida ida was taken aback wasnt i supposed to but human folk dont understand the languages of other creatures do they i mean they understand creatures of human stock so you can talk to the two of us but dragons are different to us their speech is just roars and growls oh i didnt realize that ida said chagrined i have been talking to animals all along never realizing that i wasnt supposed to the otterbees are friendly furry animals who like to swim and eat fish shouldnt i have talked o them t of course you should have mela said we are just surprised that you have that ability maybe its your talent my talent every human person has a magic talent didnt you know no i didnt the fauns and nymphs didnt they arent quite human enough i think mela said some of us part humans have builtin magic such as being able to breathe water i never thought of it as magic i just spoke to anyone who spoke to me well we can check it the next time we meet a dragon or other monster mela said she went off to find some ripe pies for supper ida hurried to help her for she had always been used to finding her own pies after supper they discussed their plan of travel mela had a map which indicated that the good magicians castle was to the west it had shown a path that went that way but that was the one now blocked off so they had to find another they pored over the map and discovered what mela had not seen before there was an invisible river flowing from iron mountain through poke country to lake kissmee the only way to find the river was to spot the faint reddish flecks of rust in it from the mountain heartened they decided to try that in the morning then they settled down for the night but ida had one question do you happen to know why this is called lake kissmee it was once a very friendly lake mela explained so was the kissmee river which flows from it but then the demon corps of engineers pulled the river straight and it lost all its charm and became the killmee river they finally had to put it back the way it was but neither the river nor the lake has yet fully recovered from the shock that may be just as well because we dont want to be compelled by their magic to be forever kissing them and each other ida had to agree with that she had never kissed anyone herself but had seen the fauns and nymphs doing it all the time they had never stopped at kissing so if kissing was one step in an ongoing process ida was not yet ready for it in the morning okra rowed them back across the lake ida wore her dull ordinary dress for she was no longer on display this time they explored the shore looking for the invisible river it occurred to ida that she might be able to spy it if she squinted because that changed the way things looked sure enough soon she spied a faint wave pattern of air with flecks of reddish brown only if it was what she hoped it was it wasnt air but invisible water the water was invisible but not the sediment it carried along i think i see it she announced pointing okra was facing back so she could row but since ida was in the rear end of the boat the ogress could see her so okra guided the craft in that direction and soon mela also spied the specks of rust it looks just like wind mela said doubtfully but okras oars made splashes as they encountered the invisible water so she rowed right into the river leaving the lake behind the current was slow so there was no trouble going against it still ida was impressed with okras strength and endurance this river flowed not in a regular riverbed but across the varied landscape apparently it did not disturb the land it passed over and kept to itself until it reached the lake it maintained its elevation winding back and forth to avoid hills and holes so they got a fair tour of the surrounding land it was mixed countryside with trees of many kinds and bushes of a few kinds and herbs of one kind a swirl of vapor appeared above the boat curious ida stared at it was it another branch of the invisible river but it didnt seem to be flowing just hovering thin a mouth formed what are you staring it it demanded it talks ida cried affrighted of course it talks the mouth said a pair of eyes formed focusing on her what did you expect a belch but youre a cloud ida protested clouds dont talk do they of course clouds talk just not in a language humans understand oh you mean the way dragons do cardinally what intrinsically inherently fundamentally elementarily primarily essentially whatever the vapor said clouding up thats the demoness metria mela exclaimed looking back however did you know the cloud asked forming into the shape of a woman almost as shapely as mela herself it was a lucky guess theres nothing of interest going on here metria so we shouldnt waste any more of your time but isnt this ida metria asked shes the most interesting person in xanth i am ida asked incredulously ela asked why is that because of her destiny theres never been one quite like it before but my destiny was to be crystallized by the dragon ida said that may have been what the dragon claimed metria said but dragons are notorious liars i didnt know that well you havent had much experience with dragons thats true ida agreed i didnt even know that humans couldnt talk to dragons thats what comes of an isolated upbringing the demoness said unless maybe my magic talent is to talk to monsters metria laughed what an interesting way to put it but your talent is hardly that you know what my talent is of course i know will you tell me ida asked eagerly i might if you asked what is my talent then again i might not the demoness faded out i should have warned you mela said she likes to tease mortals she probably doesnt know your talent anyway i i you mean demons are like goblins ida asked you have to treat them discourteously not exactly but they dont mean to do you any favors metria isnt bad as demons go she merely is bored and likes to entertain herself by watching what mortals do but she has a problem finding the right word sometimes and that gives her away i noticed now okra spoke why does the demoness think ida is the most interesting person in xanth im really not very interesting ida said with maidenly modesty she said it was because of her destiny mela said remembering i must say that though metria can be annaying she does seem to tell the truth there must be something very special about ida maybe well find out when we reach the good magicians castle okra said they continued on up the stream it was definitely slanting uphill now the current was stronger and the flecks of rust were thicker arent you getting tired ida asked the ogress youve been doing all the rowing i suppose i am okra agreed i hadnt noticed until now lets see if we can pull to the side without falling out of the water mela suggested they did so cautiously and were able to come safely to land they got out of the boat and okra lifted it out of the water and sat down to rest mela and ida went looking for food and found some cupcakes for ida and some watermelons for mela but what would okra like they saw some okra plants growing and knew that their fruit would be perfect for the ogress as they ate ida saw a plant growing pretty red caps one of those will be fine to protect my delicate hair from the sun she said she went and picked a cap and put it on and it fit her perfectly mela stretched we should get moving she said who says ida snapped angrily why i just thought so dont think then ida went and kicked the boat startling the ogress she was furious mela stared at her a moment then she sought her purse and brought out a little book she leafed through its pages thats it she cried finding her place thats not it ida snarled what is okra asked its a madcap the merwoman said stop insulting me ida screamed please take off that cap i will not but okra behind her reached out and lifted the cap from her head ida was immediately appalled what was i saying it wasnt you mela explained you happened to pick a madcap see here it is in my manual the moment you put it on it made you mad oh ida felt herself blushing i would never act like that i mean i knew something was wrong and since the cap was the last thing that changed i checked it it wasnt your fault oh throw that awful thing away but okra considered it might be useful sometime she folded it and tucked it into a pocket that startled ida because she hadnt known the ogress had any pockets since she wasnt wearing anything they put the boat back in the invisible river and climbed in okra rested rowed it more swiftly upstream ida could only marvel at the girls strength but of course that was the ogres talent ogres were strong ugly and stupid and it seemed okra had one of those traits they came to another lake this one was smaller than the last with a smooth surface on which little footprints showed id better check this mela said getting out her manual in a moment she had it this must be lake wails we had better portage around it why ida asked then a huge creature appeared running along the surface of the water wailing because we dont want to run afoul of the walls mela said i understand they get very upset if their prints are erased the prints of walls thats right they are unhappy enough as it is ida had to agree so they got out of the boat and walked around the lake at one point they encountered a multiheaded serpent hello serpent ida greeted it but the thing only hissed several times at her simultaneously she realized that mela had been right she couldnt talk to monsters however she doubted that the serpent had anything to say that she really wanted to hear they found the river on the far side of the lake and resumed their travel then the tip of the iron mountain came into sight it was solid metal poking high into the sky the closer they came the larger it loomed until it towered above them the river did flow from it but not gently it issued from a coiled spring in the side and plummeted through a waterfall they parked the boat and started up the mountain the way was steep but there were iron steps and an iton guardrail so it was all right it seemed that they were not the first to come here but when they were halfway up walking along an on ramp with a sheer cliff above and below a dragon appeared in the sky ida looked and her worst fear was realized thats dragoman the dragon who crystallized me well we cant let him take you again mela said but were helpless here he can pick us all off and probably will her fear was growing into a deadly certainty no he wont okra said he wont he wont mela echoed trust me so ida trusted her since she had been asked to her deadly certainty faded back into weakkneed uncertainty there must be something okra could do to dissuade the dragon from its fell purpose otherwise she would not be so confident the dragon gave a harsh cry and swooped down at them its dread talons extended ida did not understand what he was saying but she could guess he was angry that she had gotten away from his showcase okra fished out the madcap and put it on she scowled then as the dragon made a grab for ida okra made a ham fist and swung it furiously it bashed the dragon on one leg and sent it spinning out of control oh lovely mela breathed if theres one thing that can stand off a dragon its a mad ogre so it seemed but the dragon had not yet caught on that one of the three maidens was an ogress he righted himself and came diving in again this time okra didnt bash his foot she made a swipe with her ham hand and caught it in an ogre grip she hauled the dragon in then she bashed him in the snoot with her other ham fist dont fool with us bezoarbreath she roared and hurled him away now at last he caught on he pulled out of his tailspin and circled out of sorts then he reoriented and came in again he might be up against an ogress but after all he was a dragon and she was a rather puny example of her kind he looked as if he had something new in mind he opened his mouth hes going to crystallize us ida screamed dont let that vapor touch us of course it seemed doubtful that they could stop the dragon from breathing on them but okra had said to trust her so ida did the dragon loomed close a jet of vapor came out okra opened her own mouth and breathed back at the dragon there was an awful stink the dragons breath and the ogre breath collided they formed into the ugliest crystalline cloud imaginable then the crystal melted and dropped like the foul stone it was the ogre breath had nullified it the dragon took a look at this shrugged and flew away his worst weapon had been thwarted so he was doing the sensible thing and retreating okra turned toward the two of them her face was swollen and horrible she inhaled take off the cap mela and ida screamed together snarling okra swept off the cap then she looked appalled ida knew exactly how she felt you did wonderfully she said you got rid of the dragon and saved us all from a fate worse thanwell i dont know what its worse than but im glad you saved us i guess i did okra said ive never been ogremad before but it seemed to be a good time for it it certainly was mela agreed warmly then they resumed their trek up the mountain ida thought about what had just happened it seemed to her that okra had a reasonable chance to achieve her dream of becoming a major character she had certainly acted like one enny was still shaken by the revelation of the content of the secret of the adult conspiracy but there was no time to ponder that because the way was open and she had a question to ask the good magician sammy cat was already bounding into the main part of the castle actually she had been here once before but that was almost like a dream and the castle had looked different so it was just as unfamiliar now to her as it was to her friends a young woman appeared she had long fair hair with a tinge of green princess ivy jenny exclaimed she had met ivy at the wedding of prince dolph and electra ivy hugged them all then ushered them into the main chamber where magician grey sat youre just in time for lunch ivy said brightly jenny started to protest but realized that she was hungry and the others surely were too sammy had already found the dish of milk that must have been set out for him so they joined grey at the table he was nondescript and not at all like jennys impression of someone from mundania but of course she had never been to mundania so couldnt judge the dull folk there didnt i see you here before grey asked jenny yes when i came to ask the good magician how to return to the world of two moons jenny laughed it happened to be portrait day and all five and a half of the good magicians wives were here for the occasion they were all beautiful i think each one was prettier than the others but then i changed my mind and decided to stay in xanth for a while longer you have friends here ivy said yes that counted for a great deal a maid brought in a huge shoefly pie and served them each a slice jenny was glad to discover that the shoes were really pastry in the form of footwear and their little wings were leaves of lettuce we expected three challenges gwenny remarked we were surprised one might even say dismayed che added here in xanth so much is made of the adult conspiracy jenny said all three of them waited expectantly we were surprised too ivy said but the good magician humfrey always knows what hes doing he said you had to be inducted into the conspiracy or he wouldnt be able to help you but we have such a simple question jenny protested ill ask it but its for gwenny it has nothing to do with when he answers it you wont be able to benetit unless you belong to the conspiracy grey said i thought it was strange though things are more confused in mundania and im not sure i agree with the conspiracy any more than you do but it seems that gwenny must belong and since you three are working together you all must know humfrey said he wouldnt have done it if the matter werent so important theres no telling what hami this early knowledge may do to you but the alternative is to deny you gwendolyn your chance to be chief of goblin mountain and that was unacceptable i suppose it would be hard to be chief without knowing such things gwenny said distastefully as the maid brought dessert eye scream sandwiches jenny changed the subject which wife does magician humfrey have now ivy laughed shes right here didnt you realize jenny accepted her sandwich from the maid she peered at it and its big green eye peered back at her she wondered whether it would scream as she ate it no i didnt see her sammy was rubbing against the maids leg the maid che exclaimed catching on the features of the maid changed her drab dress became bright and her body turned buxom now jenny recognized her as one of the beautiful portrait brides she could of course assume any likeness so was as lovely as she chose to be jenny realized that this was probably an asset in a marriage dana demoness i didnt know you in costume you didnt recognize me as the adult either the creature murmured ooooo so i didnt gwenny squinted at the demoness how can humfrey trust you if you dont have a soul demons can be trusted to do what suits them my husband knows that when i had a soul i loved him and i made him ludicrously happy and gave him a son when i lost my soul i left him and then i was horribly bored now for a month things are interesting again if i act soullessly i will instantly lose my place to the next wife on the roster so i act just as if i have a soul for the sake of the game you had a son che asked dafrey halfdemon that was back in nine hundred fiftyfour a hundred and thirtyseven years ago he grew up and married in the normal human manner and had a son of his own and bzzzzt he was gone having passed the soul on to his offspring i lost track of him after that nine hundred fiftyfour jenny asked thats a date thats a date che assured her dont you remember our history lessons the year is now one thousand ninetyone dating from the onset of the first wave of human colonists in xanth i guess i wasnt paying attention jenny confessed all those numbersi never did get along well with numbers perhaps you will learn to count the days of your year working for my husband dana said maybe i will for jenny really did not relish that upcoming year she would much prefer to remain with che and gwenny and the centaurs but she would do what she had to do speaking of which ivy said its time for your appointment jenny got up cancan the others come too yes but they cant ask questions they followed ivy up a winding stone staircase to a crowded little chamber there sat the gnomelike good magician before a monstrous tome he looked at least a hundred years old though jenny knew that he had youth elixir to make him as young as he chose to be apparently he liked this age humfrey looked up well he said grumpily ask him ivy whispered whwhere can we find a pair of contact lenses for gwendolyn goblin to wear so she can he probably frowned though his face was so set and lined that it was hard to be sure there is only one pair available and they are problematical weshe has to have them because in three respects first there is danger in their vicinity but there is danger if she doesnt have them second they are in the realm of dreams in the gourd but they are intended for use by visionimpaired night mares herein lies the third problem they will enable the wearer to see dreams as the night mares do but thats not a problem jenny started then she had a second thought bad dreams all dreams including those in violation of the adult conspiracy oh gwenny exclaimed behind her now it made sense gwenny could not use those lenses unless she was in the conspiracy anticipating this the good magician had inducted her into it distressing details and all he had had to finesse it in a couple of ways because he would have been in trouble if he had violated the conspiracy by simply telling her in fact he had told her nothing he had assigned the job to dana demoness whose lack of a soul and conscience had enabled her to force the children to assume part of the dread mantle of adulthood i will give you instructions so that you can enter the realm of the gourd and locate the lenses humfrey said even so you will find it difficult the winged monsters will not be able to protect you there well do what we have to do gwenny said thank you good magician jenny turned to her feeling sad i wish i could go with you but now i have to serve the magician not till you help her get the lenses humfrey said your year commences after the completion of your mission oh thank you good magician jenny exclaimed delighted the route to the lens bush will be marked by mock lenses humfrey continued gruffly see that you do not lose the way because they will fade out after you pass them you must find them within one day because after that we shall have to rouse you rouse us jenny asked we wont go physically into the gourd che explained well look in peepholes when someone outside interferes with our line of sight to the peephole we emerge but why only a day gwenny asked it might take longer because i promised your mother and ches dam who spoke also for jenny elf the three exchanged a look which was a good glanceandahalf long so the parents had known about this but it could not be helped it was the only way i will show you to the gourds ivy said jenny looked again at the good magician but he had already returned to the tome having forgotten them ivy had set up a pile of pillows for them to lie on there were four greenish gourds their peepholes covered over with tape they got comfortable then linked hands jenn held on to sammys paw they had to be touching when they entered or they would find themselves in different settings ivy checked the alignments making sure that each of their heads were braced right before the peepholes are you ready she asked they agreed they were ready jenny tried to conceal her apprehension she had never done this before and dreaded it but she wouldnt leave her friends to face it alone now that the good magician had given her the chance to be with them at the same time she was afraid it wouldnt work what kind of sense did it make to enter into a growing gourd without ones body ivy pulled the tape from gwennys gourd gwenny looked and froze fascinated then ivy did the same for ches gourd and che also froze finally she came to jennys gourd just then jenny had a perilous thought how could dream lenses do the physical gwenny any good surely they would be left in the dream realm when gwenny woke all this might be for nothing she opened her mouth to say something to ivy but as she did so her eye saw the exposed peepholeand she found herself in a chamber with a flat floor and a deep dropoff ahead alarmed she stepped back and banged into che then she saw sammy pop into existence beside her were all here gwenny said sounding relieved i was so nervous when i arrived here alone but then che appeared but then it seemed like forever before you came jenny decided not to voice her doubt what was the point at this stage she would just have to hope that the good magician had taken this into account and that the lenses would work in the real world as well as in the gourd after all the night mares operated outside the gourd that was where they needed to see the dreams they brought to be sure they were working properly all three of us che agreed also sounding relieved jenny remembered that however mature he might seem because he was a centaur he remained only his real age of seven emotionally suddenly there was a crowd of people in the chamber jenny stared they werent just any people they were gwenny and che three of each and two otherswho she realized were elves jenny elves there were three of her too and three cats they exchanged a nineway glance then one of the gwennys blinked im looking twice but i still see another me a new gwenny exclaimed chiming in now there were four gwennys im looking tw jenny started but before she could finish saying twice too one che interrupted her dont say any more he cried this is a multiplication table jenny shut her mouth she had never trusted multiplication tables indeed the whole subject of math was somewhat alien to her but she had not thought that it worked quite this way she could see that the two other jennys and all three sammy cats were just as confused look another che added pointing to the dropoff that is the edge of the table see the corners and the other sides the three jennys looked and sure enough it was one big table of the scale that would have been suitable for the huge adult in the good magicians castle now she saw that there were markings on it numbers along the edges and numbers in the center that much she understood the numbers in the center represented the results of the numbers at the edges she could never remember whether six times seven had a sum or a product or a total or whether that result was supposed to be thirtysix or forty or fortytwo or maybe fortyfive probably none of the above as far as she was concerned the world would be a better place if numbers just went away the very last place she wanted to be was in the middle of a multiplication table and maybe that was the point of it this was her dream this was the place of the night mares after all whenever we speak a number it multiplies us by that number the third che concluded when i saidwhat i first saidit multiplied us by that number when gwenrry said what she said it multiplied her by that number i had said lls so it multiplied us all she sai i so it multiplied only her now we have a problem the four gwennys and three jennys nodded afraid to say anything the problem was that there were too many of them suspect that each of us feels that he or she is the onginal person the first che began carefully and not one of us wishes to give up his individuality the second continued the word one is probably safe to use because the multiplication leaves that person unchanged yet it is surely necessary to revert to our original states before proceeding farther into this region the third concluded the seven girls nodded still afraid to speak because none of them had the centaurs brains perhaps if we perform an act of division the first che started but this is a multiplication table one gwenny said the second che smiled the two functions are related we have merely to multiply by a fraction will it work a jenny asked jenny was no longer sure which one was herself the third che nodded i think our best approach is to reduce the gwennys to the same number as the others then do an overall multiplication on the group all four gwennys looked nervous will it hurt one asked i dont think so the first one said i need merely speak to you the fraction three quarters the second che continued one of the gwenny disappeared now there were three of them all looking alarmed did that hurt jenny asked i dont know a gwenny said i wasnt the one who was disappeared i doubt that it hurts either way the third che remarked i suppose we have to do it one of the jennys said with resignation yes i suppose one of the gwennys agreed unhappily then i hereby multiply us by one third the first che said suddenly there were three of them one che centaur one gwendolyn goblin one jenny elf and one cat they exchanged three thirds of a glance as nearly as jenny could make it she felt the same as she always had silently they walked to the edge of the table and peered over there below were assorted plants one of them leaned toward them showing a deep cuplike center a branch swung toward jenny che pulled her away from it beware he said i think thats a pulpit it will pull you into its pit jenny quickly retreated horrified she went to another side of the table there was a big bee buzzing among flowers but the bee wasnt gathering pollen it was cutting the heads off the flowers now whats the matter with that bee she asked dismayed che looked i believe i recognize that species that is attila the hunny bee oh i wish we could find a safe way away from here gwenny said sammy marched to another side of the table what about that plant jenny asked pointing at one with very large transparent leaves right opposite the cat che brightened i believe those are leaves of absence they will probably conduct us away from here and seethere is a lens for dew was sparkling on one of the leaves in a way that focused the light that was their sign of the way then lets get conducted gwenny said they linked hands and jenny picked sammy up and set him on her shoulder then reached out to touch one of the leaves immediately they found themselves in another place this one did not seem much more promising there were wilting bushes and sadlooking trees with fallen fruit at their bases flies buzzed from bush to fruit and back again the smell was awful ooo ugh gwenny said wrinkling her nose no wonder che said those are putriflies they make things rot faster they walked quickly on and left the wilting things behind but there was more mischief ahead they encountered a figure which looked less and less manlike the closer it got it had two legs and two arms but its body was made of gray metal and its neck was a projecting tube with no head just a hole what is that jenny asked perplexed just then the creature bent forward and its hollow neck came to point directly at her there was an ominous click no che cried catching her arm and yanking her to the side as he did so there was a loud bang and something whistled past the place she had just been smoke poured out of the creatures neck and there was the smell of brimstone or something similar something hit a tree gwenny said looking back jenny looked and saw a hole in the tree just about the size of the creatures hollow neck now i recognize it che said its a gunman i thought they existed only in mundania a gunman jenny asked still confused all i see is a metal thing with no head a gun is one of the bad dreams the mundanes have he explained it exists only to hurt other creatures it shoots out slugs of metal and they lodge in the flesh of others or make holes in them the gunman bent forward again che dived for it grabbing at its body no gwenny screamed nothing happened the gunman staggered back without firing then turned around and ran away what happened jenny asked hurrying forward to help steady che i put on its safety the centaur said it couldnt fire then i wont even ask what a safety is gwenny said the mundanes must be terribly afraid of guns no i understand they like them che said i never want to go to mundania jenny said fervently nobody does che agreed its an awful place so where do we go now gwenny asked jenny looked around and spied another sparkling lens look that way they hurried along a path to the side passing through the mock lens the path wound around and down into a glade where there seemed to be more figures moving around as they got closer they saw that these were fauns and nymphs but not ordinary ones they have wings che exclaimed so they did the creatures were not merely running around they were spreading their wings and flying otherwise they were normal for their kind all of them were naked the fauns were chasing the nymphs and the nymphs were running away and screaming this was their idea of fun i wonder if there are any centaurs among them che murmured musingly jenny realized that he was thinking of the lack of any others of his own kind his parents were the only adult winged centaurs in xanth and he was the only winged centaur foal jenny herself had a notion what it felt like to be unique in xanth it was lonely i never heard of winged fauns in xanth gwenny iemarked so why are they in the curd maybe the regular fauns and nymphs have bad dreams about them jenny suggested but regular fauns and nymphs live only for the day they cant remember prior days che said so shouldnt have bad dreams about them well lets ask jenny said she approached a pair of them who were lying in the flowers at the edge of their glade then she halted oops whats the matter gwenny asked adult conspiracy i recognize it now you mean theyre i think so that is what fauns and nymphs do che said once they catch each other they stood and watched i dont want to interrupt them jenny said do you think theyll be through soon they look as if theyre having fun gwenny said surprised i suppose it should be fun or folk wouldnt do it che agreed dubiously i confess that it seems to me that a pillow fight would be more fun or a tsoda popka fight jenny said gwenny shook her head it must be a terrible thing to become adult and lose interest in the fun things and have to settle for dull things like this the others could only agree then the faun and nymph finished their business they looked up eeeek strangers the nymph shrieked run the faun cried wait jenny exclaimed we only want to ask you a question the two considered then decided to wait a moment but no more than one moment the nymph said firmly we cant spare two moments why are the winged fauns and nymphs here in the gourd jenny asked quickly trying to stay within the moment when there arent any in xanth the fauns eyes went round we dont remember he said then the two were up and away she leaped into the air spread her wings and flew around a tree he pursued her eeeeek she cried as he caught her ask a foolish question get a foolish answer i guess jenny said if they cant remember any prior days they cant remember about why theyre here either they walked on there beyond the tree were the same faun and nymph lying together on the ground but they just did that jenny said surprised they must have forgotten gwenny said laughing with more than a tinge of embarrassment then they saw another mock lens marking another offshoot trail and moved on along it this one led to a blank wall but when they touched the wall they discovered that it was illusion they stepped through it and were in a region as gloomy as the other had been pleasant it was night with a huge gibbous moon hovering suspiciously low ahead were somber gravestones oops now were in one of the scary sections jenny said lets hurry through they broke into a jog to follow the path through the center of the graveyard but the sand crunched under their feet and made a horrible scratching noise then the soil of the graves stirred eeeek gwenny screamed sounding exactly like the nymph they stopped for there before them a bony arm and hand were poking up from the ground it moved as if casting about for something such as maybe an ankle sammy hissed at it and backed away they tried to retreat but two things stopped them first che said the path isnt marked the other way and well lose it second jenny said shivering bones are appearirig behind us too third gwenny said were you cant say that che reminded her there are only two oh she looked around then i have only one thing to say what is that eeeeeeeek she screamed twice as long and loud as before che nodded i believe that covers it they huddled together for support against the fright while all around them things hauled themselves out of the ground soon there were a dozen horrendous figures the walking skeletons che exclaimed like marrow bones and gracel ossein who are they jenny asked they are friendly refugees from the gourd he explained marrow got lost and esk ogre brought him out then gracel got in trouble for ruining a bad dream and was kicked out now theyre a couple they may even have summoned the stork or whatever it is they do maybe they simply assemble a baby skeleton from small bones at any rate such folks do scare people in dreams but thats just their job i understand they are nice when you get to know them personally mmaybe we should make the effort gwenny said then she turned to the nearest skeleton hhello are you ffriendly why i never thought about it the skeleton said i never tried to be friendly with a monster monster gwenny looked fearfully around where he means you che said us because were different me gwenny was amazed jenny understood why though gwenny was not vain she was a very pretty gob lin girl and could hardly be ignorant of that fact maybe its my spectacles no its your grisly flesh the skeleton said i see that you have tried to cover it up but enough shows to make you a truly frightful creature are you from another section of the dream establishment you must be very good at terrifying dreamers no im just visiting im looking for the contact lens bush i dont suppose its near here as a matter of fact it is the skeleton said i understand its the last one growing the night mares come to it when they have trouble seeing well i suppose going out into that horrible other realm is bad for their eyes that must be the case gwenny said evidently gaining confidence just let me go and get a pair and well leave this area so you wont have to be appalled by the sight of us that will be much appreciated the skeleton said and the other skeletons nodded we dont mean to be impolite but it is hard to be close to freaks like you without spooking understand perfectly gwenny said they walked on along the path the skeletons making wary way for them there in the center of the graveyard was a glittering bushand there on the bush glittered a single pair of tiny lenses oh i can hardly believe it gwenny said they stood around the bush but how do i put them on gwenny asked after a moment i think you just look straight ahead and set them on your eyes che said maybe i can help you i think i have to do it myself gwenny said so that they will work for me if you touch them they might decide to work for you instead good point he agreed stepping back gwenny reached out and very gently took a lens it dropped into her hand she removed her spectacles put them in a pocket and brought the lens to her faceand it jumped onto the right eye oh is something wrong jenny asked alarmed no its right i can see clearly with my right eye and fuzzily with the left its as if i have only half my spectacles on then she took the other lens and put it to her left eye she blinked oh its wonderful jenny tried to imagine what it would be like to have such lenses she pictured herself with a pair walking around without her spectacles she would feel naked just as if all her clothes had dissolved because she had used the spectacles ever since coming to xanth gwennys gaze swung around to jenny oh youre naked she exclaimed no she remains clothed che said surprised jenny jumped you saw my daydream she exclaimed oh now youre clothed again gwenny saidiyour dream i was daydreaming jenny saidand you saw it just as the good magician said you would that is an excellent sign che said it means the lenses are working exactly as they are supposed to but actually seeing dreamsis that polite gwenny asked jenny smiled that must depend on the dream ohand some folk will be dreaming adult things gwenny said i wish there had been some other lenses actually these may be worthwhile che said thoughtfully you will face a difficult situation at goblin mountain if the daydreams of people indicate their real feelings you might be able to tell when theyre not telling the truth jenny said but of course folk would tell the truth gwenny said goblin males che asked pointedly oh because male goblins were just naturally the worst of folk being the opposite of goblin females but i wouldnt want to spy on anyone now look gwenny a chief has to know whats going on che said you know that goblin males are always conspiring to do mischief how long do you think you will last if you dont know what theyre thinking hes right jenny said you will be chief over the meanest male folk as well as the nicest female folk maybe if you were an ordinary goblin girl you could just be your nice self but thats not your destiny if you cant be mean youll have to be knowledgeable gwenny still looked doubtful so they worked on her some more you should practice using those lenses now che said so youll be able to know folks dreams and tell whether theyre your friends or your enemies and so you wont blush when you see an adult dream jenny added but what can i practice on gwenny asked without enthusiasm the folk here are dreams then she had a second thought how was i able to see jennys day dream i mean shes right here in dreamland so how could she be dreaming that set them back but then che came up with the answer we arent dreams were just visiting our real bodies are lying in the good magicians castle so we can still have dreams through those bodies that seemed to make sense so jenny tried to make another dream but she couldnt the more she concentrated on it the more she paid attention to their here and now rather than wandering to something else sing che suggested maybe that would do it so jenny sang imagining a pleasant landscape not at all like the graveyard here it worked soon the landscape became real for her then sammy appeared in it preferring it to the reality of this dream realm after a moment che appeared in it too finally gwenny appeared then they walked through the field of flowers toward the brilliant sunset and beside them walked some of the skeletons who seemed surprised but im not seeing your dream gwenny protested im in it and so are the skeletons che said i think jenny actually changed the scene here so it seemed i guess well have to practice outside the gourd jenny said but we might as well wait here where its nice until we are recalled to reality so they settled down for a nap inside jennys dream then che had a notion jenny if you are able to bring us all into your dream here including the skeletonswhat about the good magicians castle his castle but were already there really thats what i mean can you dream us back out of the gourd awake so we dont have to wait here anymore jenny thought about it why i really dont know my dreams always end when some outside disturbance interrupts them just the way the gourd visions do or when i stop singing that brought another realization but im not singing now so why didnt this vision end probably because this is the dream realm che said when we shift from one dream setting to another here we have neither slept nor awakened we have merely moved within the larger dream so your singing just facilitates that movement but what im thinking of now is whether you could make a dream of us back awake in the castle and have that come true because if that worked you would be able not only to change dreams but to get out of the dream realm on your own that would be truly remarkable why i dont know jenny said intrigued i suppose i could try it if it doesnt work well be rescued anyway in a few more hours gwenny said still i dont want to stay here any longer than i have to so jenny sang again this time she imagined the chamher in the good magicians castle with the three of them lying on their cushions and looking into the gourds then she had herself look away from the peepholeand she was there she quickly covered the peephole with her hand then turned the gourd around so that she could not accidentally look at it again but the others remained locked to their gourds she tried to imagine them looking away as she had done but they did not then she put her hand between ches face and his gourd and he snapped out of it it worked he exclaimed but jenny had a nasty thought suppose it didnt work could this just be a dream of us waking and we didnt wake at all but only thought we did he put his hand before gwennys face waking her no i dont think so because i had not yet entered your reality dream i had not yet become distracted so i was still in the flower valley i woke from there to here gwenny sat up are we out she asked blinking behind her spectacles i think so jenny said exceptoh no i forgot to include sammy sammys here che said turning the cats gourd around but when i pictured this chamber i didnt picture him in it so he should be missing why isnt he because this is real che answered what you pictured of the rest of us had no relevance we must enter your dream ourselves you pictured me but i wasnt there in your dream but you had to be because i woke you no you were in itand since your dream was of reality you saw reality you may have forgotten to imagine sammy here and he may not have come in by himself but since this is not a dream but reality he here i suppose youre right jenny said her head spinning because surely if it were just her imagination sammy would not be here that seemed to be the proof of it bul she wasnt quite sure then her uncertainty found another focus but the lenses did they come through gwenny removed her spectacles which were back on her face here in reality she looked around i can see everything better than before only no dreams thats because none of us are daydreaming at the moment che said then gwennys gaze fell on the cat now i see a chocolate mouse she said sammy does like them jenny said so he must be dreaming of one now so the lenses do work here well lets go down and surprise the others gwenny said delighted they think were still locked into the gourd thats right che agreed we may be the first to have found a way to escape the gourd by ourselves actually jennys the only one who can do it but it remains a valuable discovery we can never be trapped in the gourd if shes along then we had better remain friends with her gwenny said laughing jenny picked sammy up and they headed out to surprise the others in the castle elas legs were really getting tired as they neared the top of iron mountain she had never used them this hard before and she wished she could rest them legs were so inefficient compared to a tail but this was the route to the good magicians castle according to the map so she just had to suffer through finally they reached the top it was bare trees just did not seem to grow well on solid iron not even ironwood but the view was terrific they could see xanth spread out all around them but that did not help much because they couldnt actually see the good magicians castle from this vantage one part of xanth looked much like another it did not even seem to be a very good place to camp for the night yet they were too tired to make the arduous trip down the west side on this day what were they to do i wish i had a nice soft moss bed to lie on ida said i wish i had a nice hardwood pallet to lie on okra said i wish i had a seawater pond to float in mela said smoke formed before them it swirled and became a female figure are you travelers in distress she inquired oh hello metria mela said without enthusiasm im not metria the demoness said well whoever you are we arent looking for trouble and we hope you will go away im dana the good magicians wife i have no soul but i try to emulate a souled person by doing a good deed every day if i can find one to do i thought perhaps i could help you in some way mela did not quite trust this but did not want to annoy the demoness because that could lead to worse mischief so she tried to avoid disagreeing directly i had thought the good magician was married to the gorgon mela had recently been told otherwise but she distrusted the source of that information he now has six wives counting mareann we take turns with him while the others remain in hell this is my month of delight the demoness metria did say he had married other wives mela agreed but she also said that he was once a king i find such things difficult to believe oh yes he was the king of xanth when i married him i had a soul then but knew i could get rid of it only by marrying a king now i wish i had a soul again though i blush to confess it she turned an attractive pink but please if there is any good deed i can do for any of you let me do it so that i can pretend to have a soul mela exchanged two glances with okra and ida as a matter of fact we were making some wishes oh i thought i heard something like that what were they i wanted a seawater pond to soak my tail in dana gestured a depression appeared in the iron surface filled with water mela dipped a toe cautiously in it oooo it really is salt she converted her legs to tail and plunged in it was wonderful soon okra had her hard pallet and ida had her soft moss all three made sighs of satisfaction how can we thank you dana mela inquired blissfully oh no the demoness protested you must not thank me this is my good deed for today i feel almost as if my soul is back wouldnt it be nice if souled folk did good deeds too mela said if we cant thank you at least we can hope to see you again soon when we reach the good magicians castle oh you are going there do you know the way we have a map but it hasnt been easy to find the route i will come again tomorrow morning and show you the best route that will be my good deed for that day then the figure turned smoky clouding up oh i forgot this is my last day at midnight i must exchange with my successor the maiden taiwan oops i mean the matron taiwan shes not exactly a maiden anymore or maybe sofia i will not be able to guide you well it was a nice thought mela said the feel of the salt water on her tail was so good that nothing could upset her at the moment i know dana said ill have metria do it but metria is full of mischief mela objected true but she is bored and if i tell her that you will be doing something interesting she will help something interesting such as falling off the moutain a no nothing like that but if you are to appear at my husbands castle you will have to put something on something on all three of you dana said firmly the matron taiwan will insist on it but im a merwoman mela protested i never wear clothing and im an ogress okra said ogres dont wear clothes either except for special occasions fur suffices danas right ida said i understand that all human folk wear clothing so they probably expect it in others the matron is very concerned about protocol dana agreed you are not nymphs you cannot run around bare bottomed so i will have metria guide you to the pantry the pantry mela asked thats where you start well i must be off i have only half a night to make humfrey deliriously happy she disappeared they made a meal of idas magic sandwich which expanded enough to feed all three of them with enough left over for another meal then they slept comfortably on or in their respective gifts from the demoness at the first crack of dawn the demoness metria appeared up you lazy bones we dont have all aurora all what mela asked sleepily sunrise daybreak cockcrow dawn grief grief okra asked morning ida exclaimed whatever the demoness said crossly dana told me to get you to the pantry if i wanted to see something interesting so lets get on with it they got off or out of their assorted sleeping places which promptly disappeared mela flexed her legs which felt marvelously restored after the nights rest in tailform they snatched another bite of magic sandwich then followed metria down the steep iron path to the west in due course they arrived at the pantry this was a huge tree in the shape of a pan metria opened a door in the trunk and they walked into the interior which was one big chamber all around its circular wall were displayed its hidden fruits panties ida exclaimed how marvelous we have to put on panties okra asked not pleased yes this should be most interesting they walked around the circle gazing at the assorted panties mela had been diffident about this matter but found herself getting interested she had never dreamed that there could be such an array to choose from there were panties of every type and description from blah to fantastic and all the shades between but something nagged her she finally put her mental finger on it why should this be so interesting she asked the demoness because of the oh you mean you really dont know i really dont know but im sure that you must have good reason to be interested and that may not be what interests me indubitably in what in doubt suspicion distrust metria paused hey wait i had it right the first time it means not to be doubted for even a tiny instant had mela not been a fairtempered creature she might have thought of being annoyed thank you what is that nottobedoubtedforatinyinstant reason for your interest last year good magician humfrey was dickering for his wife with the demon x tl and to get her back would have to answer a question that couldnt be answered that put him in a picklement as you might imagime but he managed to wangle a compromise so didnt have to answer the question which wife okra asked dana no rose of roogna you dont know her what has any of this to do with me mela demanded mentally dousing her temper in chill seawater to keep it from warping why it has everything to do with you metria said you are the central figure i am or maybe your center is to be figured the greatest mystery of xanth is about to be solved something im doing will solve a mystery yes it will answer the unanswerable question thats why its so interesting what question mela demanded the question the good magician couldnt answer the temper was definitely fraying and what is that the color the what the color of your panties mela digested that the good magician cant tell the color of my panties thats right but i never wore any thats what makes it such a challenge but thats not a fair question yes it is because you are about to don panties and they will surely have a color even if that color is transparent and then there will be an answer but surely he already knows that color since he knows everything ah you see it is more complicated than that the demon x lh did not want to free rose so he planned to change the color you chose to make humfreys answer wrong he has the power to do that sort of thing and humfrey could not oppose it but the cunning mortal managed to get around it with a plea bargain and so the question remained unanswered not that it matters now it is merely a curiosity but i am very curious thats why i brought you here to find out what color my panties will be thats right ive never had the answer to an unanswerable question before then maybe i wont don any panties the demoness shook her head theyll never let you into that castle bare nude you look way too much like a woman you have to choose mela sighed she did want to find a good husband which meant she had to see the good magician and if getting panted was part of the price of that then she had to do it even if it gave the demoness satisfaction besides she was really quite intrigued by the variety of panties offered the right panty might do wonders for her midsection and possibly even enhance her chance of catching a husband so she lifted a panty from its hook and flattened it against her it was plain white i dont think this does much for me she said thats no way to judge metria said you have to put them on take them into the changing chamber she indicated a curtained region in the center of the pantry i dont need a chamber mela protested i can try it on right here no you cant the demoness said thats not the way yes i can mela bent forward and lifted a foot but the moment it approached the panty the material wrinkled and writhed away and got all twisted up she couldnt get her foot in it so with ill grace she stepped into the chamber then the panty behaved and she was able to put first one foot and then the other in the garment fit her perfectly and she realized that this was part of the magic of the pantry all of its wares would fit any woman who came here she stepped outside the other three were now seated on stools in a semicircle thm around metria said why because thats the way its done if youre going to model panties you have to do it properly suppose i dont at that point the panty started twisting up again and uncomfortable wrinkles pressed into her tender flesh so she turned around oh they look much better now ida said your hottorn looks so much more interesting this too did not fully please mela she had been under the impression that her bottom had always been sufficiently interesting but she spied a set of angled mirrors which magically showed her from behind as well as in front and had to admit it was true her midsection was enhanced by the panty there was a certain glossy mystery about it now was this the mystery that was about to be solved she wasnt sure that she liked the notion of the attention of all xanth on her posterior but she also wasnt sure she didnt like the notion it depended on the panty and her mood still plain white was not her favorite color she would try on something else she retreated into the changing chamber and removed the panty it hung limply depressed about being rejected she took it out and hung it back on its hook then she took another panty this one was lustrous black in a moment she was in it and doing her turn before the little audience thats nicer okra said it makes your bottom ripple when you walk mela checked the mirror and saw that it was true her walk was definitely more intriguing than it had been still she hoped to do better she tried a lovely sea green panty that was better yet for the currents of the ocean seemed to flow across it as she walked but it still lacked something enough with the simple stuff metria said impatiently lets see some fancy pants then you pick them out mela said shortly gladly in a moment the demoness brought a shimmering peacock blue silk panty oversewn with a golden net within the net hung glowing fireflies mela was amazed she had not realized that anything this fancy existed she put it on and stepped out the room lit up oooh i like it ida exclaimed mela was tempted but now was getting into the delight of panting there might be even better panties coming she would find the very best panty for her and that was the one she would wear after all if the fate of the good magician humfrey had once depended on what she wore she owed it to xanth to choose carefully the next panty was royal deep purple satin embroidered with woven golden ribbons edged with golden threads hung with little golden bells with each step she made music and when she twirled she tintinnabulated you what metria asked i cant pronounce the word mela said i cant even think it properly when i try to it means the way i made the bells ring tincanambulate okra asked close enough mela decided going for another change the next panty was handknitted pink with matching stockings of pale rose hue as gossamer as a spiders web on a rose bush they made her legs feel impossibly slender and smooth they seemed almost as nice as a tail i always wondered why pink panties are supposed to be so magically wonderful ida said now i kriow those are soso only a man could find the word metria said a man ida asked why because only a man would say that panties are nol the best thing in xanth just next to it i dont understand thats because you are a nice girl i of course understand all too well would this snare me a husband mela asked gazing at her slick bottom in the mirrors ida was right the effect was just so she twitched a muscle and watched the panty surface flex fascinatingly im not sure i dont think any man has seen those no men are allowed in here of course they would totally freak out mela decided to keep looking the next panty was country style with creamy cool white cotton gauze with saucy white linen rosettes and garters garters okra asked what are they for metria looked at the little snakes they are to hold up stockings they bite down onto them and then the stockings cant fall probably the gorgon uses them since she already has snakes on her head but i fear it might be awkward feeding the snakes to keep them healthy mela agreed this was a nice panty but she wanted nothing in it except hersell she went for the next this was another countrystyle effort stonewashed waterwashed bonjour blue cotton denim with an easy comfort button on the back serviceable but mela was becoming jaded so she tried on a jade panty it was a deep bluegreen with glowing waves which rippled when she moved reminding her so strongly of the sea that a drop of seawater leaked from her eye how she missed the deep salt ocean she couldnt wear this wonderful as it was because it would make her forget all else in her longing to go home she couldnt go home until she had found a prince to take home with her this is special metria said as she brought the next panty mela donned it it was made of milk pods interspersed with stripes of mint peach and peppermint it was nice enough but somewhat heavy how is it special she inquired as she stepped out to model it its edible the demoness explained if you get lost in the woods with no pie trees in sight you can eat your panty or if you nab your man and he gets hungry i think ill try another mela decided it was an intriguing notion but she didnt want to risk getting eaten by some ardent fool who didnt know where to stop the next was a colorful contrast it was a rainbow moon panty in several variants with colors of azure beach sand clay heather and other that last color was really special but she feared it would call so much attention to itself that she herself would be neglected that did not seem to be the best strategy a potential husband might decide to marry the panty instead of the merwoman then there was a gossamer silk bluebeards blue mist panty shot through with shimmering silver threads among the gold sporting sparkling green peridots in pairs of dots all over but there was some kind of association with the notion of bluebeard that she didnt quite like and assorted hotpants panties but the day was already warm enough and these were threatening to make her break out in an unladylike sweat indeed steam was rising from them before she managed to get them off there was a feather panty to tickle her fancy unfortunately the feathers tickled more than that she didnt want to go into a giggling fit the moment a man came near there was a queen annes lace panty with exquisite white lace sporting milkweed flower trim with seed pearl centers the center panel shimmered with a faintly greenish glow from green witch stitchery there was a spellbinding black lace panty the lace embroidered with gold thread rack and runes the matching lace net stockings had golden zodiac clocks but who wanted to keep time the next was a timepiece of another kind it was fltshioned from sprigs of thyme part of you will never grow old in this metria said but what about the rest of me for it occurred to mela that a man just might want to look at the rest of her too in fact she rather hoped he would next was a knotsofast panty made of knotted macrame lace designed to tease the life out of any male lucky enough to catch a glimpse and a panty to wear up a gum tree trimmed with a pocketful of gum drops but she worried about the drops she might land too hard and get gummed up in an exceedingly awkward manner there were several scented panties when she modeled them there was the smell of rose lavender heliotrope and jasmine for evening use and a cowgirl panty trimmed with lotsa moolah an an almost transparent panty shot through with radiant metallic copper and platinum threads now this was tempting because in shadow it would be practically invisible she could qualify as wearing it without seeming to still if she was going to wear anything she might as well show it off this then the demoness said handing her something else it is a violet damoreelixir of lovepanty it was black velvet embroidered with silver spiderwebs shimmering with dew tiny diamonds sewn with translucent thread ida ooohd and okra aaahd when they saw that but mela still wasnt quite satisfied none of these seemed to be quite exactly precisely devastatingly her the demoness frowned then brought out some truly fancy stuff there was the gold coast gold lace panty trimmed with long chains of tinkling goldfish when mela walked or swayed there was gentle music and the royal midnight blue panty with a small silver moon complete with tiny moon moths and shining silver stars woven in as she walked the stars progressed across the flexing heaven and the moon waxed and waned mysteriously that almost satisfied her but she was concerned about wearing it in daylight the stars might fall out in the heat of the sun she tried a love lace panty with cotton gauze trimmed with silver filigree fringe studded with heartshaped amethysts and tiny see shells and another hot panty gold lams fire opals on scarlet lace and spectacularly long floating panels of flamecolored chiffon also a metallic mail panty proof against any attack trimmed with horrific golden goblin teeth but she was afraid it would also be proof against the right male there was a panty with plain background embroidered with the words the one i love is untruebeware she who dances with demons but she was afraid it might give the one she loved a bad idea once she found someone to love then there was an ethereal panty blue green silk foaming white lace shimmering with pearls with a faint clinging scent of sea lilies that very nearly satisfied her but again she knew that she could not afford to think of the sea too much lest she lose her stamina and give up on her quest so that too she reluctantly doffed there was a pause she looked up why hadnt metria brought her the next panty you have tried them all the demoness said amazed we have been here all day i hardly noticed tried them all mela had somehow thought the parade of panties would go on forever she too had not been aware of the time passing it had been such a blissfull experience but it was all too true the pantry was darkening but now she had to choose from among the myriad she had modeled which one still she could not make up her mind they were all so pretty yet no single panty had been just purely totally utterly right arent there any more she inquired plaintively ida and okra got up and looked through the hanging panties there must be just one more ida said there must be one thats completely right for you must be okra agreed metria sighed very well i will distill again you will what again mela asked condense digest summarize refine search pattern seek whatever the demoness disappeared crossly among the panties i think i found one ida cried she hurried forward carrying a bit of cloth it had fallen down behind another mela took it it was a dustcovered mass hardly promising but she shook it out and took it into the changing chamber it was comfortable but lacked any spangles or embroidery it was just an ordinary panty she stepped out and did her little walk and turn ooooh ida exclaimed thats perfect yes it is okra agreed this little nothing mela asked she suspected that they just wanted her to take it so that they could get oat of here but she looked in the mirrors the mirrors made their region brighter now mela saw the full color of the panty it was a crossbarred pattern with many hues cunningly interwoven why thats skirl metria exclaimed thats what mela asked peering at her full bottom contained in the panty bagpipe highland blanket scotch tape kill skirt okra asked whatever metria agreed crossly then she uncrossed no wait thats not it cloth material crisscross distinctive scarf tartan plaid ida said urn the demoness agreed recrossing plaid mela hadnt thought of that but she did like it she turned around again watching herself the plaid flexed and shifted aspects most gracefully the more she saw of it the better she liked it it was conservative without being dull and its detail was interesting still she wasnt sure it was perfect for her maybe she would be better off in the one with the moon and stars or maybe there was one with the sun and blue sky that would dazzle anyone who gazed directly at it that would serve the gazer right she started toward the changing chamber what color is plaid okra asked why its ida started that is its not exactly a color its a pattern metria said a design each one is unique to itself with its own history now mela saw that the colors and ratios were indeed shifting with her motions so that the exact display could never be fixed that was intriguing a person could get lost amidst the shifting lines especially when she was walking and never be able to say exactly what he had seen she decided that she liked this panty ill take it she said ida went back to where she had found the panty there must be spares to use when the first gets soiled soiled mela asked sharply dirty defiled polluted foul filthy the demoness said helpfully pooped okra asked whatever metria wasnt cross this time for some reason whatever mela echoed indignantly for some other reason she was now the cross one wait i didnt mean that ida protested just that they can get smudged if you sit on the ground orah there they are she fished out two more plaid panties now mela had not just one panty but three panties she was thrilled she put the two spares in her purse meanwhile okra picked up a pair of furry black panties in the ogre style donning one and saving the other since they matched her fur they didnt show which evidently satisfied the ogress ida took plain white and plain pink and yellow tinged with green panties matching her hair but did not put any on she was already clothed this was merely a reserve in case of soilage or whatever thy were ready to go outside it was dusk they considered then decided to spend the night in the pantry where it was surely safe from monsters they went out just far enough to take care of private business and forage for food and mela was lucky enough to find a pie bush with a plaidcrusted pie on it she stared amazed until okra joined her and found a black furry cherry pie beside it then ida came and found a pink meringue pie the pies matched their panties that was the magic of this place in the morning they set out again metria remained with them which made mela wonder surely the entertainment was over since the great mystery of the color of her panties had been resolved it couldnt be because of the goodness of the demonesss heart because the metria had no goodness and no heart but it wouldnt do to ask her because that could remind her to do some mischief maybe the demoness had simply forgotten that the fun was done the path wended its way westward in the manner of its kind through woods and vale through fields and hills and through some interesting regions and more boring ones they had found an enchanted path so were reasonably safe from molestation at one point they spied a dragon snoozing nearby he was a big lusty masculine reptile the three mortals paused are you sure mela asked cant touch you metria assured her cant even breathe fire on you these paths are absolutely vermin free all he can do is watch and salivate you might as well relax and enjoy teasing him the demoness always told the truth so it should be safe mela forced herself to breathe normally and led the way onward the dragon opened an eye he blinked his pupil expanded awesomely then he rolled over as if dead whats the matter with him ida asked routine freakout metria said hell recover in due subject in due what study orbit flow process mode time route bearing direction trend course the demoness did a double take course i got it in due course it seemed to mela that her suggestion of time would have sufficed but the case was not worth arguing they went on they passed a goblin cave three ugly mean goblin males stood outside it staring malevolently at the approaching party they looked as if they would like nothing better than to swarm over innocent maidens and do unmentionably horrible things to them but reassured by the dragons inability to bother anyone on the enchanted path mela strode onward the goblins eyes fixed on her then in turn they fell forward on their faces and remained that way i never saw a goblin do that before okra remarked another routine freakout metria said think nothing of it later they passed a small human village it contained three and a half houses three bold men and a boy stood watching the path but mela figured that its enchantment should be effective against them too the human males stared then one fell to the left another to the right and the third on his back only the boy remained standing but his face was slack what is it with you mela demanded the boys mouth opened with an effort ppp plaid metria said lets move on finally they came into sight of the good magicians castle it looked perfectly ordinary from a distance and more so as it got closer there was a young man walking on an intersecting riath why thats magician grey murphy metria said this should be really interesting mela still distrusted the demonesss attitude but couldnt fathom it the man saw them and paused why hello metria he said what mischief are you up to at the moment i am bringing three querents to see you or humfrey metria responded queer whats mela demanded suspiciously odd strange peculiarno wait its the right word it means questioners shes right grey said those who come to the good magician are querents let me introduce them metria said briskly ifere is ida human ida turned suddenly shy for she had never before formally met a man of her species hhello she managed he squinted at her have we met before you seem somehow familiar i dont think so ida said i have lived apart from human folk all my life this is okra ogress metria said hi okra said hardly less abashed you dont look like an ogress he remarked i know okra said ashamed and this is mela merwoman hello mela i have heard much about you i almost married prince dolph she said i remember however then his eyes which had been fixed on her upper section happened to drop to her midsection they widened then they narrowed so this is your mischief metria he said severely oh river blockage the demoness exclaimed you mean a dam whatever i thought youd freak out the way the others did you forget my talent begone metria or ill null you he reached toward her the demoness instantly faded away but why would you freak out metria asked she didnt tell you of course its that magic panty on a body like yours it is guaranteed to freak out any male who sees it except that i can nullify magic so can resist it nevertheless you should put on some clothing before you proceed farther but i have some clothing on mela said just as dana said i should this is all i have she meant more than a panty nude you can be mistaken for a wellendowed nymph clothed you would resemble a buxom woman but panties alone are dangerous you are in violation of the adult conspiracy so thats what metria was waiting for ida said to see if the plaid panty freaked out the magician precisely i suppose you should proceed to the challenges now and sofia will see to some clothing for you once you are inside i must go now i wish you well thank you mela said faintly oh that demoness gwendolyn goblin was thrilled with and nervous about her new lenses they worked perfectly but this business of seeing dreams was daunting would the bad dreams of others frighten her she hardly wanted to find out she also felt guilty about letting jenny elf serve for gwennys answer how could she ever repay jenny for this if she managed to become chief she would not be available to return the favor by serving a year for an answer for jenny her responsibility to her tribe would come first she was likely to be stuck with this considerable favor owing dana demoness was surprised to see them but who freed you early from the gourd jenny did che said her talent makes her able to escape the dream realm dana nodded that is more of a talent than it seems i suggest that you keep jenny close by you and that you do not tell others about this soon ivy and grey murphy were there they have the lenses so there wasnt any point in remaining in the gourd longer dana said ivy seemed nonplused of course but let it pass grey told her perhaps he had caught on he had an understanding of how magic could be canceled magically or perhaps he had seen it in the book of answers will you be going directly to goblin mountain now dana inquired yes i think i must gwenny said the longer im away there more mischief there may be she looked at jenny it may be dangerous maybe it would be better if you stayed here to do your years service no i will see the mission through jenny said firmly i want to see you be chief then ill return here but if something happenedyou know how mean goblins can be thats why i have to be there to help you shes right grey said there will be time for her service gwenny remained frustrated she just couldnt seem to do anything good for jenny yet at the same time she was relieved that jenny would remain with her they had been friends for two years the best years of gwennys life and she wished that could continue forever you will need a pass for the gap ivy said ill write one out a pass gwenny asked blankly the shortest route from here to goblin mountain is a straight line you wont want to take the longer route to cross the bridge over the gap chasm that means you have to go down into it the pass is so that my friend stanley steamer the gap dragon will know not to eat you oh gwenny was not thrilled with the notion of going down into the gap but unless she wanted to accept a lift from the winged monsters that was the way she would have to go thank you i did not realize that the dragon could read che remarked he cant ivy said but the paper and ink smell of me he wont chomp anyone with this she handed it to gwenny just dont lose it i wont gwenny tucked the paper into her pocket soon they were on their way following an enchanted path northeast there were several bypaths which surely led to interesting things but they were determined not to be distracted so hurried on along the main path without pausing at any of the diversions just to be sure jenny had sammy cat pick the route at each intersection because sammy knew they were looking for the fastest way to goblin mountain and he could always find the right path nevertheless they noticed some of them one side path was marked stock marketsee the bulls and bears gwenny was extremely curious about those animals for she had never seen either variety in xanth they could hear an occasional noise as if big creatures with hard feet were stampeding alternating with depressing growls whatever could be going on there another side path was marked compewterthe nice machine gwenny didnt quite trust that either a third path was marked the big top they were able to see the upper surface of a mountainous spinning top beyond the trees then they encountered someone going the opposite direction it was a young human man and an odd dog ttie man was perfectly ordinary but the dog was made out of stone the two came to a halt as they saw the three oh hello the man said are you looking for the good magicians castle because if you are youre going the wrong way no we just came from there gwenny said were going to goblin mountain he peered down at her i say youre the prettiest goblin ive seen at that point by sheerest coincidence a shy fly came by and smacked her fight in the face gwenny started blushing too badly to speak che stepped forward perhaps we should exchange in troductions before we part he said i am che centaur and this is gwenny goblin and jenny elf and jennys cat sammy sammy was sniffing noses with the stone dog i am alister he said and this is my dog marbles were going to ask the good magician about finding a magic talent for my father my talent is finding things i can find anything except an answer thats sammys talent jenny exclaimed he can find anything except home alister was surprised i thought no two people ever had the same talent sammys an animal oh then it must be all right i was afraid we were in the wrong time or something stranger things happen che said actually i was amusing myself on the way because i know this path leads to the good magicians castle i was seeing whether i could find special things along the way without deviating from the path this time i had decided on the prettiest girl in the region i can see my talent is in good working order he glanced again at gwenny and she had the tremendous misfortune to get stung by another shy fly just at that moment again her blush drowned out her effort to speak oh how that embarrassed her then they resumed their walk to the northeast and alister and marbles continued southwest gwenny wondered whether they really could be in the wrong time wouldnt that be odd meeting folk who were there some other time actually the soldier crombie finds things too che remarked in an afterthought i understand that he closes his eyes whirls around and points and whatever he is seeking is in that direction but hes pretty old now so maybe he doesnt do it anymore gwenny finally recovered from her shy attack how embarrassing to have it happen just then he had seemed like a nice young man for a human being maybe it isnt finding thats the talent that cant be repeated she said maybe its how a person finds something crombie whirls around and sammy just runs alister must have some other way that is surely it che agreed meanwhile we had better find a place to camp for the night jenny said sammy bounded ahead jenny ran after him as she always did wait for me sammy she cried as she always did but he didnt wait as he always didnt gwenny and che were used to this they ran along after the two soon they came to a pathlet to the side and ran down it it led to a large spreading tree its branches formed a big cuplike center covered by broad mottled leaves sammy jumped right up into this cup and stopped gwenny examined one of the leaves she discovered to her surprise that the mottles were in the form of legible print i am the ministree welcome to my branch a ministrec jenny asked sammy are you sure but the cat was licking his paw ignoring her so they all climbed into the center cup one of the branches extended down to the ground so that che was able to walk up it without much trouble they discovered good fruits on the tree and found that the bark of the branches was spongy and comfortable to settle down on a number of the big leaves hung low gwenny picked another and read it have you considered protecting the trees of xanth she picked another our most precious heritage is our plant life hm were there random messages or was there a pattern she picked another leaf randomly and read it we urge all feeling creatures to conserve the vegetable kingdom i think this tree is trying to tell us something gwenny said showing the leaves she had picked well it seems to be ministering to us che said that is consistent with its identity perhaps it is also ministering to the environment of xanth gwenny thought about that and decided it was all right sammy was right she said this is a good place to stay and we should try to preserve the good plants of xanth she picked another leaf thank you it said please remember not to litter we wont litter gwenny promised che picked a leaf remember what the demons did to the kissmee river it said that was a terrible thing che agreed we hope the demons learned their lesson the trees leaves rustled with appreciation it was satisfied that its ministry was effective in due course they settled down to sleep each nestled comfortably on a broad branch gwenny took one last look around before closing her eyes che the youngest of them was already asleep gwenny saw his dream it tonned in the air around him like a picture prqiected on him so that he was both lying quietly on the branch and being active in the dream in the dream he was spreading his wings and flying up into the sky up up he flew gloriously spiraling in the sunlit air for it was full day in the dream he sailed over the ministree and on over the gap chasm which was close by to the north he feltwonderful there were little lines of joy and excitement around him showing his feelings then he looked down and back and saw the cup of the ministree where his two friends remained i cant desert them he exclaimed he began spiraling down as the dream faded out gwenny was touched the young centaur had personal aspirations but he also had loyalty his dream had shown that more perfectly than words would have she looked at jenny elf who had now drifted to sleep in her dream she was standing on the ground holding her cat i wish i knew the way home she said then sammy jumped from her arms and bounded away wait for me sammy she cried chasing after him youll get lost the cat leaped through a shimmer in the air and landed in a strange scene beyond it jenny followed it remained fairly dark the night had not changed to day they charged through a weird unxanthian landscape where trees were subtly and unsubtly different and bushes were simply not the kind that grew in xanth there were two moons hanging in the dark sky jenny and sammy ran up to a huge tree where several big canine animals lounged the holt the wolffriends jenny cried joyfully she threw herself among them without fear people came down from the tree no they were huge elves with pointed ears and fourfingered hands like jennys they embraced her joyfully jenny we thought you were lost we feared that something terrible had happened to you we feared you were dead or cruelly hurt no im all right im all right she replied ive had the most wonderful adventure but what is that thing on your face one of the adults asked jenny put a hand to her spectacles oh i got these in xanth they help me to see clearly then she stood still ixanth my friends i cant leave them not while they have such important things to do and the good magiciani have to servei promised then her dream faded out she was back in the ministree she too was loyal even in her sleeping fancy she wanted to go home but wouldnt until she had met her commitments gwendolyn goblin closed her eyes but she felt the tears squeezing out anyway next day they thanked the ministree for its hospitality promised to treat plants and trees with respect and set out refreshed by noon they reached the gap chasm it was as awesome as it had been from the other side but how are we going to get down this clifflike slope gwenny asked appalled at the magnitude of the challenge i can make us light enough to handle the climb safely che said all we need to do is find a section where there are sufficient handholds it may be tedious but feasible why not just jump jenny asked it would save us time and scratches gwenny laughed that far were not crazy but if we are light enough we wouldnt land hard enough to hurt would we jenny asked gwennys outgoing glance collided with ches incoming glance the elf might be right perhaps we could verify it che said how gwenny asked not at all easy about such a descent we could make the cat light and inquire the fastest and safest way down if he were to jump jenny looked at sammy you arent fooling him hes been listening in on all our lesson sessions and probably can spell as well as we can but hes an animal che said sammy find che jenny said facing away from the little centaur the cat leaped onto ches back it seemed that the centaur had been stung by a shy fly this time his face neck and shoulders turned red gwenny knew how he felt sammy however looked smug they decided to try it after che cooled off he flicked each of them several times with his tail making them so light that they had to pick up stones for ballast then he flicked sammy similarly sammy find the fastest and safest way down into the gap chasm jenny said to the cat sammy ran along the brink of the chasm they followed he came to a smoothly slanting face of rock where a small river crossed on the way down the river found a rounded channel farther down and happily coursed along it sammy ran away from the river he stopped at a tree with leaves as big as any member of their party they were glossy and looked slippery and tough a toboggan tree che exclaimed we must pick leaves for ourselves and sammy they did so carrying them back to the brink sammy jumped onto his leaf which then overbalanced and slid into the river the cat rode the leaf down across the rock face and into the channel jenny jumped after him riding her leaf gwenny was next and then che they were all in the small river sliding down it was fun in its way but scary for they were moving very fast despite their lightness it was the current of the river that was carrying the leaves along at its own pace not that of their bodies they clung to their leaves the river twisted around seeking what seemed to be the most devious possible route it shot through a narrow channel then paused in a brief pool then set out again across another slanting stone face then it leaped gleefully out into space ooooo gwenny cried with mixed joy and horror but the leaf landed gently on another slope and continued down suddenly the river curved and spread out the world seemed to be set on right angles then gwenny realized that they were at the bottom it was the normal level land that seemed strange after the long slide down the side they got off their floating leaves and waded to the bank of the river they were wet around the edges but were safely and swiftly down sammy had indeed known the way the base of the chasm was almost level here there was green grass and a number of bushes and even small trees there was also a beaten track down the center they knew what used that the gap dragon indeed as they spied the track they felt a shudder in the ground the dragon was coming get out your pass gwenny che reminded her we dont want the dragon to get confused and eat us gwenny reached for her pocketand stood appalled the pass was gone it must have fallen out during their wild ride down the slope oh no jenny said looking at her and understanding her expression then sammy find the pass the cat headed back the way they had come but he stopped at the base of the slope it was too steep for him to climb the pass must be somewhere up the side of the chasmand they could not reach it meanwhile the shuddering was intensifying now they could feel a distinct whomping pattern to it the dragon was definitely bearing down on them oh what are we going to do gwenny cried terrified sammy jenny called find the best place for us to hide from the dragon the cat did something strange he hesitated he took a few steps toward che then away seeming not to know where to go that suggested that there was no good place to hide from the dragon this was the bottom of the gap his hunting ground it was to be expected that he would have everything covered a column of vapor showed above the bushes to the east that was the steam of the steamer in a moment the dragon himself would come into sight and in another moment he would be upon them if there was no place to hide what was their best course was there any way for them to save themselves gwenny cudgeled her mind trying to think of something but her head was too jampacked with fright to let any positive thoughts through she saw jenny and che similarly petrified the dragon appeared he was long low and sinuous with six squat legs vestigial wings big teeth and a lot of puffing steam his front set of legs would lift and jump forward and then the middle set and finally the end set proceeding by rapid whomps so that his motion resembled that of a racing caterpillar more than that of a serpent he was moving far too swiftly for them to outrun however she saw sammy standing there too bad she couldnt ask him what they should do but the cat didnt solve problems he just found things when they werent hopelessly out of reach like their safeconduct pass the dragon turned to whomp straight toward them his scales glistening green jets of steam shot forward from his nostrils singeing the foliage of the bushes on either side the three of them would be steamed and cooked before they ever got chomped then half a thought squeezed through her mind perhaps shoved from behind by the overload of fright thoughts sammy she cried find the best thing for us to do the cat bounded toward che centaur and leaped onto his back digging in his claws che startled out of his stasis jumped forwardright toward the onrushing dragon he passed gwenny and jenny and came to a stop petrified again his little wings fluttered pitifully gweriny remembered his dream of flying in the dream his whigs had fleshed and feathered out but in life they remained inadequate they were simply too small with too few flight feathers he could not fly away even if he made himself light enough to float like a bubble in the air the wings just werent ready could sammy mean for che to flick them all again with his tail making them all air light so that they could jump too high for the dragon to get if so it was already too late for che would be the first one chomped anyway unless there came a good wind they would just drift back down to the ground where they jumped from and the dragon would be waiting to snap them up there werent even any goodsized trees here that they might hide in out of reach of the dragon the chasm was a trap sure enough the dragon whomped up to cheand stopped his horrendously toothed mouth opened his tongue came up he licked the centaur on the face then gwenny caught on hes a winged monster she cried even if he cant fly he still has wings just as you do and no winged monster will hurt me che finished how could i have forgotten the dragon eyed gwenny he oriented his snout toward her tell him im your friend gwenny cried and jenny too and sammy theyre my friends stanley che said quickly we are traveling together we had a safeconduct pass from ivy but we lost it the dragon nodded it was evident that he recognized ivys name now it was all right gwenny felt her knees turning to wet noodles she hoped they didnt look too bad she was glad that sammy cat had known what to do if jenny had not come along then neither would the cat have come and then gwenny herself might have been steamed and eaten before stanley realized she was with che that thought made her noodle knees turn to mush which was even worse steam had that effect not only did the dragon not eat them he turned out to be quite friendly now that he knew they were all right maybe he missed his years of growing up with ivy who by an odd coincidence had once been the same age that gwenny and jenny were now fourteen in fact by an almost unbelievable coincidence she had also once been ches age of seven so the dragon might have a fond memory or two left in his hot skull of young folk in fact gwenny caught glimpses of steamy daydreams he had of cute little ivy playing with him enhancing his scales until they shone like mirrors and kissing him on his ear an offshoot dream memory was of him losing an ear a long time ago to an ogre but he had grown it back when he got rejuvenated dragon ears gwenny knew were very special things with magical properties that was one reason dragons didnt like to lose them stanley guided them to a place where a walkable path climbed up the north slope of the chasm there had been others but the dragon had passed them by perhaps knowing that they led only to caves or just petered out getting tired long before reaching the top the dragon knew exactly which ones offered no hope of escape of course because he caught and steamed and ate any creatures who tried to flee on them thank you stanley gwenny said as they were ready to part then she did something daring and naughty she leaned down and kissed his ear the way his memory daydream had shown ivy doing by yet another unbelievable coincidence a shy fly stung him at that very moment and the dragons scales blushed burning red even his steam turned pinkish but he did not look unhappy they started up sammy led the way because he had been told to find the safest path with jenny following then gwenny and che bringing up the rear again that was because as he explained centaurs had better ears than other folk did also if one of the others slipped and fell he would be better able to catch and hold that one making her light so that they did not both go tumbling down into the chasm che himself retained most of his full weight now because it gave him better traction the path did try to trick them by sending off occasional offshoots that led either to cliff brinks or nowhere one offshoot started out nicer than the true path but they could see how it then turned and tried to go straight up a cliff that was a meanspirited path but sammy didnt even think about being fooled he pattered right on up the correct path every time it was a wearying climb despite the way che lightened them when they came to brief landings where his tail could reach them then a cloud appeared and eyed them oh no gwenny breathed i hope that isnt fracto jenny finished her dread echoing gwennys own it isnt che said thats an ordinary cumulus humilis cloud they dont mean any harm to anyone theyre just curious about landbound activities fun loving jenny asked im not sure wed like a clouds idea of a joke che smiled thats humilis as in humility not humorous no joke gwenny felt her knees softening again with relief hey stiffen up your knees jenny said warningly as she glanced back they look like bread dough noodle dough gwenny said pasta che corrected them past what jenny asked past a bit of dough but not beyond spaghetti he explained gwenny concentrated stiffening them and managed to maintain her pace as they neared the top the day was fading it was still bright above but the depths of the gap were in deepening shadow so that they could no longer see the bottom gwenny was glad they were going out of it instead of into it it was gloomy though she knew that there was no longer much danger down there for them unless they fell she shuddered and kept her eyes on the path ahead at last they emerged they walked a reasonable distance from the awesome brink then dropped to the ground feeling faint with relief im glad im not adult che said because then i would have had to face that without being afraid actually we may be adult gwenny reminded him we were inducted into the adult conspiracy remember jenny laughed thats like the gap chasm deep and dark and wearisome and not a lot down there once you see it they all laughed but there was too much truth in it to sustain the laugh for long then they had sammy find them the best place to camp for the night and they dined on the wonderful assortment of pies that grew in this region they even found an old tent left by tent caterpillars it made a perfect place to sleep because it was silken throughout with a layer on the ground to shield them from bugs and silk hammocks hung from the branches of trees beside the tent so they slept in fairly good comfort and they really needed that after their arduous days trek gwenny didnt see any of the dreams of the others because she fell asleep as fast as they did and sank down almost as deep as the gap chasm in fact she probably dropped below the dream realm because she didnt remember having any dreams in the morning they discovered that their tent was close to a village that would be the gap village che said consulting his memory i believe there is also a goblin village to the east if you wish to no i think not thank you all the same gwenny said quickly it would be run by goblin men and you know how they are unfortunately i do no offense but when gwenny becomes chief all that will change jenny said brightly because they arent so bad when they have proper leadership in fact idiot moron and imbecile are sort of fun remember how they brought us tsoda popka and we had a squirt fight gwenny had to smile that was when joy came into my life in the form of the two of you i must confess i am uneasy about returning to goblin mountain that was the understatement of the year we are here to make you less uneasy che said oh you are doing it gwenny exclaimed let me hug you and she hugged each of them in turn jusi so glad to have them both with her meow sammy said you too gwenny agreed she picked up the cat and hugged him carefully and kissed his whiskers then they wrapped up their business and proceeded to gap village it was a small one and the folk did not seem to be unduly curious about them though it was surely not every day that an elf a goblin and a winged centaur passed through they caught a path in the center of town and took it north toward goblin mountain and the regions between but soon they reconsidered do we really want to pass through dragon country gwenny inquired even if the path is enchanted to be safe im not sure how far it extends in that direction we could cut across to the sane jaunts river che suggested and make another raft and float down toward goblin mountain gwenny grimaced we did not have exactly the best experience the last time we made a raft she said but we cant get blown out to sea on a river jenny said and it would allow us to travel while resting our legs gwenny looked down at her legs they were not turning into pasta at the moment but the prospect of resting them was appealing so it was agreed they took the next side path east and in the afternoon came to the big river it seemed far too wide to have originated north of the gap but che had the answer to that i understand it crosses the gap it flows down the south side and up the north side i suspect it has to use magic to make the climb but rivers always do what they need to to get by every one of them knows where there is the sea or a lake and winds toward it unerringly it is part of their water magic they foraged for suitable wood and for vines to lash the sticks together drawing on their prior experience by nightfall they had a big unruly raft but they were satisfied with it because any water dragons who tried to chomp it would get a mouthful of messy branches and would probably give up the effort before causing any real damage a fire dragon could set the wood on fire of course but it was unlikely that any fire breathers would be on the river they stocked the raft with many pillows and towels so as to have comfortable beds and masks against smoke and steam just in case and of course they stocked a pile of assorted pies together with many milkweed pods they floated down as the night closed che had assured them that his geography showed no waterfalls on this river they might get hung up on overleaning tree branches but that would merely delay them not hurt them progress might be slow because the current was easygoing but they would be able to keep moving day and night which was nice indeed it seemed that the river dragons were not paying attention because they passed the night unmolested in the morning they were well along the river significantly closer to goblin mountain then gwenny glanced up and saw a flying dragon circling overhead oh the winged monsters were still watching and must have let their riverdwelling cousins know that this raft was to be left alone that was the advantage of having che centaur in their party in two days they drifted about as close as the river cared to go toward goblin mountain gwenny could understand why it preferred to stay clear they left their big raft with a certain regret and resumed their foot trek now they walked west toward the mountain which loomed in the distance it was gwennys true home but she had seldom seen it from the outside and it looked awful in the past two years she had developed an appreciation for the open outdoors and for the surface cabin of the centaurs when she had visited home the centaurs had normally carried her there through the air and she hadnt worn her spectacles so that she had not seen it clearly that had been more of an advantage than she had realized at the time but worse was her dread of the even uglier goblin peil itics she knew she would encounter therein she had been protected from that sort of thing by her mother but now she knew that she would face the worst of it and godiva could not shield her from very much but maybe with the help of her friends she could find her way through that morass too she hoped a goblin guard noticed them he had of course been snoozing on the job but now he jumped up and waved his club get out of here you freaks he yelled politely oh dont be silly hawkspittle gwenny retorted go tell the lady godiva her daughters here hawkspittle rubbed his eyes oh its you gwendolyn he said recognizing her he turned about and went into a hole in the mountain in due course gwennys mother came out her voluminous hair swirling with authority she hurried to embrace her daughter oh gwendolyn youre just in time thank goodness youre here something terrible has happened gwennys feeling of dread intensified what mother it involves your half brother over whom my authority has disappeared since the death of your father now he is worse than ever i think that is impossible mother gwenny said seriously what could be worse than his normal brattiness there has been a violation of the adult conspiracy now the dread welled up like a monster from the gourd you mean hehe knows yes and he is threatening to tell it to every child in goblin mountain if he isnt made chief by high noon tomorrow now gwenny understood how this related to her gobble was her only rival for chief because he was the only other child of gouty goblin but he was too young at age twelve except by special dispensation with an awful threat like that he might obtain that dispensation gwenny at age fourteen and now legitimately in the adult conspiracy just barely qualified for the office but she was a girl which was two strikes against her her bad eyesight would have been the third she had fixed that but if gobbles disgusting ploy worked it would make no difference goblin mountain would not only have another bad male chief it would be the worst possible oneand a juvenile too instead of improving the goblins would become much worse than before and it was her job to prevent that she was the only one who could if only she had some idea how okra now felt distinctly awkward in her panty though it hardly showed on her dark body she too had been deceived by the demoness metria it wasnt that metria had lied she had just failed to clarify the truth knowing they would misunderstand okra was of course stupid enough to do that it made her feel slightly less worse to know that mela merwoman had also been deceived thus they had both unwittingly violated the adult conspiracy and given the demoness her demonic laugh for the day well magician grey murphy had said that there would be better clothing for them inside that would be welcome now all they had to do was get inside the good magicians castle stood in the center of a circular plane a breeze waited out from it as they approached the breeze became a wind then a gale and finally a storm too strong to go against their hair streamed out behind them and they leaned way forward but their feet slid against the sand and they could not make further headway a challenge okra said it must be mela agreed but since its only wind maybe we can get around it and get blown into the castle from the other side so they walked around the edge of the plane but the wind kept blowing at them and when they were on the opposite side it was still blowing them away from the castle how can it be a circular wind ida asked i mean where is the wind coming from i think i heard of something like this okra said a story of places called thethe propeller plains i wonder if this could be one of them that maybe the magician borrowed to use as a challen mela nodded maybe my magic manual shows it she dug it out of her purse and turned the pages yes the propeller plains are in western xanth they are big invisible blades that turn over their planes sucking air down from above and blowing it out along the ground you just have to go around them we have been around this one ida said but the castle is in the center there must be a way mela said theres supposci to be all we have to do is find it okra got down flat on the ground to see if she could crawl under the propeller but the wind was just as strong there she scooped some sand out with a hand but the wind immediately filled in the hole with more sand she couldnt dig under it either there must be something we havent seen yet ida said they retreated to ponder the matter beyond the edge of the plane were bushes and trees and a shed the shed was filled with small figures what are these ida asked picking up one of the figures it seems to be a doll mela said with a drum a toy okra asked picking up another it did indeed seem to be a little drummer boy with two sticks to beat his drum in back was a key she turned the key and when she let it go the dolls arms moved making the sticks strike the drum in a faint pitterpatter do you think these dolls have anything to do with the challenge ida asked they must mela said but how can a little doll stop all that fierce wind a doll that drums okra said intrigued i never saw one of these before she wound her doll drum doll drum what did you say ida asked doll drum mela said isnt that maybe it is what is okra asked perplexed when the doll drums maybe come on we must try it they hurried back to the plane with okras doll to her confusion now make it drum mela said okra wound the key a turn and let it go the doll drummed the wind died it works ida exclaimed clapping her hands why did the wind stop okra asked still confused the doll drums make it stop mela explained doldrums those are calm reions thats how we can get through but then the wind resumed no problem mela said we just have to wind the doll more so it will drum longer maybe we should take several dolls ida suggested so that when one stops we have another and dont get blown away excellent notion they gathered two dolls apiece and wound one each well take turns mela said when mine stops let yours drum ida and when that stops you let yours play okra meanwhile well each wind our other doll and hold it ready so that the drumming never stops we should be able to make it all the way to the castle if were careful they did so they found that it didnt matter if two dolls were going at the same time but if there was even a moment when none was going the winds resumed fiercely so they overlapped them and walked steadily toward the castle when they reached the moat the winds stopped they experimented letting their dolls run down the wind resumed but now it was beyond them they were inside it they had passed the first challenge but the second challenge was already hard upon them a horrendous dragon was running just outside the moat charging toward them eeeek ida screamed what kind of dragon is that okra peered at the monster she had seen dragons on occasion when ogre males got into fights with them so she knew the basic types they could be flying ground or water fire smoke or steam in any combination this one wasnt flaming smoking or steaming so it might be a rare breathless dragon still dangerous it was on the ground and lacked wings so was landbound yet there was something odd about it the scales of the back were not lying flat some were sticking up in rows a weird one she said but it does have teeth so we need to get out of its way but we cant go back the way we came mela said the wind would blow us away unless we kept playing the doll drums and then the dragon would probably snap us up and we cant go into the castle because the drawbridge is up okra said then wed better run ida said because that thing is getting awfully close they ran ahead of the dragon around the moat but the monster was gaining do we go into the wind or the water okra asked she was moving along well enough but the other two were puffing that was because they werent ogres the water mela gasped so they swerved inward and plunged into the moat they got enmeshed in moatweed and mela wound up astride a thick tentacle of the stuff oh yech she exclaimed i forgot it was fresh water she slapped the weed tentacle and it sank back into the murky water i cant change to my tail in this stuff ida was no better off her clothing was now festooned with soggy weed and her hair was green with moat slime yech she echoed but okras mind was on business the dragons still coming after us well have to swim across mela said it probably cant swim they tried to swim but there turned out to be a fierce current in the moat that carried them right back to shore worse the dragon was entering the waterand it floated its raised scales formed a barrier against the water so that its body was much like a boat it could handle the water better than they could the dragon floated near them its toothy head loomed close it was about to gobble them up maybe we can talk it out of eating us okra said without any great effusion of hope thats an idea ida agreed maybe it will work mela hauled herself upright thigh deep in the water and faced the monster the creatures gaze bore down on her there was a reflection of plaid in his eye i say dragon lets introduce ourselves who are you and what is your business i am dragon dola he replied i am going to put you in my belly but we arent very good to eat mela said im mela merwoman and i taste rather fishy this is okra and she tastes like an ogress and thats ida and her soggy clothing would snag on your teeth something about the dragon nagged at okra his name and the way he floated reminded her of something his nameit means something something that floats im sure you will all fit nicely in my belly the dragon said cranking his jaws open then ida figured it out youre not a dragonyoure a gondola a type of boat we misheard your name dra gondola at your service the dragon agreed so all we have to do is climb into your belly and youll carry us across the moat exactly so they climbed over the upright scales and into the belly of the boat then dra lifted his head high paddled his feet and moved smoothly across the water the current didnt bother him as he was mainly above it okra was amazed all they had had to do was get the dragons name right and he was part of the solution instead of part of the problem dra gondola reached the inner shore and crawled up onto the land time to disembark he announced to do what kind of barking okra asked to get out before you get barked at he clarified they clambered out thank you dra mela said i might not have helped if i hadnt been dazzli by your panty the dragon confessed oh mela exclaimed blushing in a plaid paittem okra had not known she could do that dra slid back into the water and paddled back across the moat their second challenge had been navigated now all they had to do was pass the third and enter the castle the main gate was closed mela tried the latch and the gate opened they went in could this be all no third challenge okra didnt trust that they walked on through a wide passage the stones of the castle arched up overhead closing it in it was dark but not too dark they could see light at the end they reached that lightand discovered that it was the other side of the castle they had walked right through it without really getting in they walked back through looking for side passages but there were none it was just a tunnel through the center of the castle going nowhere i think were in the third challenge after all ida remarked we must have to find the entrance mela said but i certainly dont see it well just have to look better okra said she put her hands to the wall feeling the stones she pulledand a stone swung out it was a door it seemed to open into some sort of closet the others crowded close but when it was all the way open there was a surprise boo something cried rattling eeeek ida screamed and mela gasped okra slammed the door closed for there in the closet was a skeleton it was a small one but definitely human every bone was bare still they had discovered that the walls of the tunnel were not solid where there was one door there might be another okra felt along more stones soon she found another door stone cautiously she pulled it open boo it was another little skeleton okra shut the door so it went there turned out to be many doors but behind each was a rattling bony figure there was a skeleton in every closet they sat on the stone floor in the center and consulted maybe we could go on through a closet if a skeleton werent there ida suggested how can we get into the castle proper when theres no way past those little horrors mela asked i certainly wouldnt want to touch one but then she reconsidered they arent all horrible i remember now marrow bones was a good creature and so was his friend gracel ossein but they were adult skeletons from the gourd from the gourd ida asked you dont know about the realm of the gourd its where bad dreams are made for the night mares to carry out to deserving sleepers yes i know that my tutor told me but i didnt know that any creatures could come out of it except the night mares well they seldom do but sometimes funny things happen marrow and gracel had quite a story they helped me actually thats how i recovered my firewater opal okra noticed that a closet door was opening a crack by itself could the skeleton be listening maybe talk about big skeletons interested little skeletons could that be a way through if they got all the little skeletons listening so they didnt want to yell boo all the time okra wasnt quite sure how that would help but it seemed better than nothing tell us about marrow and gracei okra suggested yes im curious too ida said well it really isnt mela started to demur but okra nudged her gently with a toe then mela saw the partly open closet doors and realized that something was happening very well it all started as far as i was concerned when marrow brought prince dolph to me in a boat actually the boat was made up of the bones of marrow and gracel it was weird i saw that cute prince and decided that he would do for a husband once he came of age to join the adult conspiracy she paused do you suppose those little skeletons in their closets are youngsters then i mustnt say any more about that how many adult skeletons are out of the gourd ida inquired only those two i believe so they made a couple then melas eyes widened why these little skeletons must be theirs theres no other way because any other little skeletons would still be in the gourd so there cant be very many okra said maybe only one or two and they move around to block off iny doors we open mela nodded then she resumed her history so i took the little prince down to my cozy den under the sea and fed him nutritious food but the little mischief changed into a gourd and i got caught by its peephole then marrow bones came down to take him away but we made a deal in exchange for the prince they would fetch me back my lost firewater opal so gracel remained with me as a hostage and i let the prince go okra saw the doors opening farther as the little skeletons listened there were only two of them it seemed that would be about right for a family of four so then the prince and marrow bones went to beard draco dragon in his den where he hoarded my precious opal together with another he had they fought and the prince changed into all sorts of shapes but it was an even contest then they had to make a truce to attend chex centaurs mating ceremony but while they were gone the goblins raided the dragons nest and only marrow bones was there to defend it i must say he behaved exactly like a hero fighting off all those goblins alone the doors opened all the way and the two little skeletons came out fascinated by the history they werent nearly so frightening now that they were acting like children instead of like spooks he used all sorts of skeleton tricks mela continued he had the bats who helped guard the dragons nest dump the gems into the water and the fish who also helped guard the nest bit at any goblin who tried to get those gems but in the end the goblins pulled his bones apart and put them in bags and got most of the gems he hid the two firewater opals in his skull but the goblins took his skull too the little skeletons crept closer listening they were almost within reach when the prince and dragon returned they discovered the disaster mela continued so they enlisted the help of the naga folk and prince dolph agreed to marry princess nada naga when they both grew old enough later he changed his mind and married electra instead but thats complicated the naga intercepted the goblins and rescued the treasure and draco dragon was so grateful to marrow bones for all he had done that he gave him both firewater opals and he brought them back to me i was so pleased so i wish him all the best and his offspring too then okra caught one little skeleton by an ankle and ida caught the other by a wrist bone they struggled but they were too small to win free and you must be marrow and gracels children mela said how nice you look what are your names im picka bone one said im marrows son im joynt the other said well you seem like two fine boys mela said im not a boy im a girl joynt said im gracels daughter oops i couldnt tell without mela paused evidently concerned about the adult conspiracy i have an extra rib joynt explained she flicked a rib with a bone finger and it chimed and you are serving your service for an answer mela said and you did very well but i think now we shall be able to get through one of those closets without getting spooked we just wanted to hear about daddys great deeds picka said and about mommys trial joynt said well i hadnt gotten to that yet so then mela told them all about gracels trial for messing up a bad dream they had evidently heard all this before but never tired of it in the manner of children and while mela talked she got up and checked the nearest closet sure enough it now had no spook and it led into the castle proper they had found the way past the third challenge inside they foudd humfreys mundane wife sofia she was old but brisk you must clean up immediately she exclaimed you have moat moss all over you and youll have to put on something more than panties i fear that dressing all three of you is more than i can handle socks are more my specialty were sorry mela said sounding as shamefaced as okra felt i will have to exchange with rose sofia decided shes expert with dresses we dont mean to be any trouble ida said we just came for some answers not garbed like thatt sofia said firmly suppose someone saw you now get in the shower and ill see about exchanging eventually they marched into the shower this was a chamber with a dense little raincloud floating above the moment they stepped in it proceeded to rain on them the water was cold but that couldnt be helped they struggled out of their soiled clothing and stood bashfully bare getting cleaned by the water okra shivering had an idea maybe if we make the cloud mad it will heat up oh that does make sense ida exclaimed so who is the best at insulting clouds mela asked bemused let me try it okra said im going to pretend its fracto she took a breath cloud listen to me i think youre the ugliest bit of fog ive seen the cloud twitched it was listening ive seen big clouds and small clouds okra continued but youre the puniest excuse of all the cloud developed a pink fringe it was getting angry ive seen satisfying clouds and maddening clouds but you re far from the maddening cloud little flecks of lightning zapped through the cloud it was really getting furious indeed its water was warming in fact okra began enough mela whispered the waters getting too hot she was using a carved soapstone on her body it cleaned off the grime wherever it rubbed okra had not seen this type of magic before but she liked it in fact i guess youre okay okra said the rage of the little storm subsided the water went from hot to warm as it sank back to cool they got out from under having finished their shower they found cottonwood towels and dried themselves off it was a job to get their hair dry and fluffed out for all three of them had whole hanks of it melas was golden in the air but sea green when wet idas was light brown above turning greenyellow below okras own was of course ogre dark then mela put on one of her spare plaid panties and okra put on her spare black panty and ida dug her spare yellow panty from her purse her remaining clothing was still sodden she rinsed it out under the cloud they stepped back into the larger chamber there was a new woman she was dressed like a former queen or princess with roses on her gown oh you must be rose okra said so i am the woman agreed sofia exchanged with me and you three are surely mela okra and ida lets see about dressing you i have a collection of clothing left behind by various parties and i think some of it should fit you with a few adjustments rose did indeed know her business for okra she produced a pair of ocher dragon leather pants and boots making her an ocher ogre as well as stainless steel gauntlets and an umber vest and jacket lined with a golden fleece i have heard so much about you okra said shyly rose was surprised you have but i have been back in xanth only recently i know magpie the demon maid she said oh magpie shes the only demoness i know with a tender heart she doesnt have a heart of course but she acts as if she does i didnt know she was working among the ogres i think it amuses her the way it amuses metria to trick people only magpie never tricks anyone that is true rose agreed for ida she brought a princessly blue dress and slippers oh i couldnt wear that ida protested its far too fancy oh its all right rose said reassuringly this is one of princess ivys dresses you are just about her size shes visiting castle roogna now a place dear to my heart but im quite sure she will be glad to have you borrow it a princess ida exclaimed dismayed no she wouldnt want a lowly person like me to touch her things trust me rose said with a subtle smile she is a sharing person then she dressed mela sofia was right you cannot go around showing mantraps like those rose said glancing down at the plaid panty any male who saw you would freak out they did ida said giggling soon mela was wearing a nice plaid skirt which completely covered her panty so that if a naughty gust of wind should happen to blow it up no one would realize that the matching panty had been exposed that should save a number of males from risk above she wore a heavyduty halter which must have been left by a sea horse and a blue green shirt with wave patterns on it okra would hardly have recognized her if she hadnt been present for the change mela looked just exactly almost like a full human woman with the accent on the full then rose showed them to a mirror wall and okra almost didnt recognize herself but i too look almost human she said she had never thought that what was possible for a merwoman was feasible for an ogress it was disgruntling and an ogre without grunts would be in a sad state rose considered youre right we must do something about those gauntlets in a moment she brought a pair of elbowlength black gloves put these on instead but i like the gauntlets okra protested they are ogre style then perhaps you can wear them over the gauntlets rose suggested they tried that and it worked the outline of the gauntlets softened and now okras hands and arms looked nearly completely human it was embarrassing now you must be hungry rose said sofia is better at meals than i am so i will switch back with her you can switch back and forth just like that okra asked oh certainly as long as there is only one of us here in xanth at a time but dont you get into any differences about whose turn it is ida asked oh no we have known each other for a long time and we are all friends we have much in common in common mela asked humfrey oh okra realized that it probably would be awkmlard for more than one wife to be here at a time then a strange animal appeared in the dooryay eeeek a monster ida shrieked rose laughed no thats only canis major hes from the dog star hes very sirius he certainly looks serious mela agreed hes a dog of the species transmuto rose explained each day he is a different breed he was invisible when our last visitors were here so they never noticed him today he is nondescript tomorrow who knows let him sniff you so he will know you canis approached he sniffed each of them in turn then he wagged his tail they discovered that it was fun petting him none of them had seen such a creature before now you must be hungry sofia said from the doorway they jumped for a moment it seemed that rose had changed into another species but okra realized that she had merely exchanged again with the other wife this must be a strange household she brought them to the dining room and served them homemade shepherds bread from a large old black iron kettle with a lid on in the big stone oven she sliced up the bread and made toasted cheese openfaced sandwiches served with pumpkinseed sauce fresh razzleberries and cream in glass bowls fresh figs from the figment tree and watermelon shells frill of fresh water okra lifted her sandwich to her mouth and paused its open face was frowning just bite into it sofia said but im afraid it will bite me back no im mundane my food is mostly unmagical my openfaced sandwiches arent really alive okra poked the face with a finger and it didnt react she realized that it was merely a molded face not a real one so she bit into it and it tasted magically good for dessert they had cheesecake scented with key lime juice and topped by crystals of citrus rinds there was also what sofia called chocolate bliss fresh chocolate cake served with a dish of white chocolate and raspberry sauce swirled together the cake was topped with candied violets which whipped the cream finally mela protested you folk are being very nice to us but we came here to ask the good magician our questions we dont deserve all this attention in fact we expect to have to serve our years for our answers thats no reason not to treat you courteously sofia said i spent a good many years with humfrey and we always treated querents well after all if they have the gumption to come through the challenges they deserve some respect that did seem to make sense but we had better go ask the good magician and get it over with ida said im afraid you will have to wait until tomorrow morning sofia said the magician is indisposed today you mean hes grumpy okra asked immediately she regretted it because she could tell by the reactions of the others that she had pulled another ogreish social blunder but sofia only smiled that is his nature she agreed every decade he gets a little worse but of course he has a lot on his mind however im sure he will see you in the morning their room for the night was piled with pillows okra sniffed the air with her sensitive ogre nose someone has been here she said well of course sofia said this is our guest chamher i wasnt here but i understand that the last group of querents visited during danas watch a goblin an odd elf and a winged centaur foal they have been the objects of some interest among those of us who now reside down in hell as have you three us ida asked startled of course all of us were curious about the color of my panties mela said seeming not entirely pleased and about the identity of ida who it seems was lost by the stork near nymph valley and okra who it sems was displaced by jenny elf displaced okra asked as startled as ida had been oh didnt you know there was to be a jenny cliaracter and the choice was between an elf girl and an ogre girl and the elf was chosen so she is jenny elf and you are a minor character i was supposed to be a major character okra asked a strange emotion coursing through her well only if you were chosen but you werent so it doesnt matter well good night sofia departed mela and ida rearranged the pillows doffed their new clothing and soon settled down but okra remained in a morass of emotions she had had a chance to be a major characterand someone else had homed in that elf had gotten it she could smell the traces of jenny elf who had been here she smelled like no ordinary elf because there was no particular elf scent associated with her that was odd but it made her easy to identify okra would not forget that scent slowly a thought percolated through her ogre brain her question for the good magician had already been half answered jenny elf had gotten the status that might have been okras but if something happened to that elf then there would be only one person to have that status okra herself how could she get rid of jenny elf that was now her question in the morning they got up dressed and joined sofia for a breakfast of pease porridge some of the peas were hot and some were cold and some looked as if they had been in the pot for some time this is just right for eating now sofia said confirming okras impression it is exactly nine days old mela picked out some hot peas and ida selected cold ones but okra liked those that were nine days old at last it was time to see the good magician humfrey sofia ushered them into the smallest dingiest most crowded chamber of the castle there almost lost amidst the piled tomes was an old gnarled gnome of a man this was himself he looked up what do you want he demanded grumpily they hesitated then mela spoke wewe have questions sir dont call me sir he snapped no your majesty dont call me that either in fact dont call me anything it only wastes time uh yes mela agreed out of sorts well get on with it he grumped mela took a breath which was impressive even in her clothing how can i find a suitable husband she asked he squinted at her appraisingly by that you mean a nice handsome manly and intelligent prince who is partial to sea creatures of course of course she echoed he looked at ida and you ida was startled by the abruptness of his attention i seek my destiny i yes yes everybody does he said his gaze oriented on okra you ogress how can i get rid of jenny elf okra asked boldly mela and ida were appalled you cant do that mela said shes a major character if theres a way he should know it okra said there is a way humfrey agreed theres always a way there are answers for all three of you but i have decided not to give them on the grounds that it would be counterproductive now go away and let me get my work done but the three said together the good magician has spoken sofia said gently theres no arguing with him when hes like that you will have to go now wait a minute mela said indignantly we had to go through the challenges and we got thoroughly gunked up in your smelly freshwater moat at least tell us a better why the magician ignored her please dont aggravate him sofia urged hes difficult enough already at least a hint ida said im sure he could spare that much yes okra agreed the magician looked up but did not speak yes a hint mela said or else humfrey scowled or else what or else ill show you my panty mela said she turned around and put one hand on her skirt and freak you out oh sofia exclaimed appalled the good magician seemed almost to smile then go see nada naga he returned to his musty tome sofia bustled them out what a disaster she muttered well at least we did get a hint ida said but hell be insufferably grumpy for a week sofia said oh why did this have to happen on my watch im sorry mela said i suppose i shouldnt have threatened him but he wasnt being nice hes never nice and he always has reason there must be some calamity that will happen if you three get your answers whats wrong with my getting a prince to marry mela asked and my finding my destiny ida asked and my getting rid of jenny elf okra asked sofia looked at her that last i can answer i think jenny is a nice girl she doesnt deserve bad treatment i dont want to treat her bad okra said i just want to be rid of her so i can be a major character maybe she could go back to where she came from i dont know sofia said then she bustled them on out of the castle they had definitely overstayed their welcome godiva led the way into goblin mountain che had visited here with gwenny several times in the past two years but this was different because he was aware of a muted hostility in the other goblins which hadnt been there before they knew that he was gwennys companion and that she was first in line to be the new chief and the goblin men feared and loathed that notion the goblin women might feel otherwise but they would not dare evince even half a scintilla of support for fear of retribution if gwenny didnt achieve the office gwenn was essentially alone for now except for her mother and che and jenny elf in godivas pleasant suite they had a proper meal while she acquainted them with the situation it seems that when my husband died in the general confusion gobble was able to sneak into his fathers chambers he went there to steal anything of value he might find of course trusting that no one would notice but he got something far more treacherous than mere objects gouty had a dragons ear a dragons ear che exclaimed she glanced at him i see you understand a dragons ear can be used to hear things magically when properly applied exactly what is heard varies with the species and sometimes with the dragon little is known about this of course because dragons ears are hard to come by but some ears will hear anything spoken about the one who is listening with the ear some will tune in to any spoken dialogue within a certain range some will attune to one particular person and overhear what he says and nothing else others will hear only what is said to him goutys ear was of the limitedsubject type it could overhear whatever was spoken in goblin mountain on a particular subject what subject gwenny asked whatever subject the listener wished i believe gouty used it to tune in on conspiracies against him only now do i comprehend how he had such uncanny ability to discover such plots as he had never seemed unduly intelligent i despised him of course but i always supported him because it was the proper thing to do viously he knew that because of the ear he allowed me more power than is normally given a woman and supported my effort to obtain a companion for my daughter because he knew that i intended him no harm also because it gave him more time to play with other women during my absence she glanced at che but the companion was what was essential whatever the cost you of course know how that particular endeavor worked out i know che agreed godiva paused as if gathering herself for something unpleasant then she continued gobble found that ear he had it for only an hour before he was discovered and relieved of it but in that time the damage was done for he has always had an unerring nose for the worst possible mischief i think you can surmise to what subject he tuned it i i the adult conspiracy jenny exclaimed exactly you might suppose that a single hour would not be enough but it is with a dragons ear gobble evidently did not learn the nuances or the rationale but he did learn the forbidden words she glanced at gwenny i understand that you have now joined the conspiracy the good magician required it gwenny said all three of us learned it actually we didnt learn the forbidden words just thethe essential nature of it you will recognize the words the moment you hear them they are superficial but to those of a certain shall we say mindset they are overwhelmingly important certainly they have power and this power should never be abused naturally our menfolk do frequently abuse it naturally gwenny agreed without irony gobble learned the words and now threatens to shout them at the children of goblin mountain as i mentioned that would of course do them incalculable harm and perhaps destroy the integrity of the adult conspiracy itself this cannot be allowed it cannot gwenny echoed her dark face pale but how can he be stopped jenny asked i have a plan godiva said but i think only you gwenny can put it into action because you are the only one who has any vestige of nominal authority over gobble you are technically his elder sibling he does not see it that way but the men of goblin mountain dare not gainsay it i dread giving you this terrible duty but i see no other way che saw gwenny swallow and knew she dreaded it also i will try mother what is your plan you must take the magic wand that only i and your grandmother goldy know how to use i will show you its secret with it you will be able to hoist any person or thing into the air and move it where you wish that should sufrice to control gobble physically for a while but he will still be able to speak the words gwenny said i wont be able to keep him from the children very long and when it is time for the new chief to be selected all the goblins of the mountain will be present including the children and he will be able to freak out everyone who isnt in the conspiracy i know that dear but that is only the first step you must travel through the deepest caves to where there is an offshoot of the darkest river of all called lethe lethe che exclaimed the river of forgetfulness godiva glanced at him appreciatively i see you are developing centaur knowledge yes it is that river it is dangerous for a person who finds it and drinks can forget his way home in fact he can forget his whole life if he overdoses but properly used this enchanted water can cause selective forgetting and that is what we want in this case to make gobble forget the words he learned gwenny said even so you must take him there sprinkle him with just a few drops of lethe water and say the words you wish him to forget then he will be harmless why not just dunk him in the river so that he forgets everything and cant even be chief jenny asked godiva shook her head that is not allowed gobble is illicit in birth and manner but he is goutys child and must be protected by all goblins of the mountain gwendolyn must not begin her chiefship with a crime against the succession the same law that gives her authority over her half brother requires her to protect him from harm this treatment with lethe water is part of that his mind has been warped and must be restored but how do i find that river gwenny asked evidently daunted by the prospect sammy can find it jenny said only only he cant find home again che finished but i have a good memory once there i will know the way back i i but i wasnt asking the two of you to take this horrible risk gwenny said this is something i must do myself i am your companion che said firmly i shall not desert you in your hour of need and i am ches companion jenny said and sammy is mine we are all with you gwenny until you are chief after that you will be able to dismiss us if you wish to i will be going to the good magicians castle anyway in my place gwenny said i already owe you so much i just cant ask you to risk your life this way and you didnt ask us to che said we decided jenny nodded agreement godiva looked at him you are the truest of companions che because of you my daughter has had two years of life on the surface which has surely been a delight for her and has received an excellent education she glanced at the elf and because of you jenny she now has her magic lenses and a way to find the river lethe i have not yet properly demonstrated my appreciation but i shall do so in due course and so will i somehow gwenny said her eyes gli stening the lenses she wore were invisible her eyes seemed entirely natural and beautiful in fact the whole of her was the same he remembered how nice it had ben to kiss her even in play with his new understanding of the adult conspiracy he realized why that was of course theirs would always be what the elder centaurs called a platonic friendship because they were of different species and crossbreeding was frowned on his granddam chem had scandalized the centaur community when she bred with xap the hippogryph to produce the winged centaur filly chex the goblins had been similarly scandalized when glory goblin had married hardy harpy and the stork had brought them gloha the winged goblin girl but there was more reason than scandal he had a duty to preserve and extend the species that had come into being but where would he ever find a winged centaur filly che hauled himself back from the nebulous clouds of speculation to reality and turned to godiva i assume that gobble will be helpless as long as the wand keeps him floating away from any handholds but i suspect this trip to the river lethe will be arduous what happens when the tunnels become too narrow to keep him away from the walls what happens when we have to sleep how do we feed him without having him grab on to us i do not know the full route but i know how it begins godiva replied there is a great vent in the stone a veritable nether chasm only with the help of the wand will you be able to cross that once you are across gobble will not be able to return alone and he will know it then you will be able to give him some freedom because he will depend on you he will of course try to steal the wand when you sleep but he will not be able to use it so that aspect should be satisfactory no what concerns me more is the danger of the lethe itself and of those dread deep caverns you will have to start by traversing callicantzari caves the callicantzari gwenny cried horrified che knew why those creatures were like huge stretchedout goblins with their muscles tied on backwards and they cooked and ate any creature they caught they were so bad that even the goblins loathed and feared them and perhaps worse beyond godiva said i shall not minimize the risk my daughter because you must understand it before you undertake it i fear you may never return but if you do you will be fit to lead this tribe of that no one but gobble will doubt you must consider whether you would prefer to give up this ambition and go into exile allowing gobble to become chief i am sure the centaur family will accept you it will che said he could not say more this was gwennys decision oh i wish my father had waited a few more years to die gwenny cried with no pretense of affection for the departed i am not ready for this then her pretty jaw firmed but i will do it i must save our tribes children from violation of the adult conspiracy and i must save goblin mountain from the horror of gobbles chiefship but most of all i must fulfill the destiny for which i came to be to lead the goblins into decency if i possibly can i had almost hoped you would choose otherwise godiva said come then i will take you aside and attune the wand to you she glanced at che and jenny no offense if gwendolyn then chooses to inform you of its secret that will be her privilege but i must keep the covenant i made with my own mother naturally che said the only way to keep a secret was to keep it and much of the wands power lay in the fact that no illicit party could use it smash ogre had discovered the key to the wand and given it to goldy goblin long ago and it had served her and her daughter well ever since there was food and beverage on the table while gwenny and her mother were away che and jenny sampled them heythis is tsoda popka jenny exclaimed tasting from a bottle do you think we should were not children anymore technically he re minded her regretfully we have to set a good example no more food fights too bad she agreed gwenny returned holding the wand now i must test this she said wickedly she pointed the wand at jenny and jenny rose into the air then jenny descended and the wand pointed at che he rose up made a little circle anel dropped back to his hooves the wand evidently worked now to use it on gobble gwenny said this is going to be unpleasant but i have to do it now before he realizes mother will see to it that the children are confined so he cant corrupt them we shall have to depart immediately mother is fixing us packs with food and tools grab a bite to eat che recommended it may b long before you have another chance gwenny smiled and did so then she led the way through the labyrinth of the mountain toward gobbles chamber he is gorging himself on cookies while waiting for everyone to agree that he must be chief tomorrow she said i dont think he even realizes that im back and if he does he doesnt care he thinks he has the ultimate weapon he did che said until you decided to nullify it jenny picked up sammy and carried him on her shoulder che trotted along behind he knew this was not going to be pleasant business they came to a tunnel where goblins were carrying haskets of cookies there was no need to ask for whom those were they followed a cookie toter into a chamber there was the twelveyearold goblin boy sitting in the middle of a pile of cookies tossing them into the air and watching them crumble as they struck the floor he must have eaten all he could hold but couldnt give up the notion so was wasting the rest only a real brat would do such a thing but he was of course the realest brat available gwenny went to stand before him gobble i have come to put a stop to this she said oh hi sis he said wanna know what i think of you no come with me please i think youre a crummy there was a horrified intake of breath from a gobliness who happened to be passing by several cookies spoiled around the edges the jaw of a male goblin dropped jenny elf who derived from a foreign culture looked sickened it was to gwennys credit that she managed not to blush che realized that she was probably so concerned about the threat to the children of the mountain that she wasnt really absorbing the disgusting nature of the word he had never heard it before but its degrading essence struck right through to his mind and lodged there forever only his recent entry into the adult conspiracy enabled him to hear it without freaking out and he knew that the tender minds of young children would be hideously warped and that they would grow up to be the worst goblins yet if such an utterance came their way there was no doubt about it gobble had learned the forbidden words i ask you again gwenny said evenly come with me and do not utter any more such filth yeah make me gobble took a breath then he yelled now the cookies around him sent up wisps of filthy smoke the gobliness who had just been recovering from the last word reeled anew the male goblin began to smile he of course lacked the gumption to perform such a violation himself but he was typical of his ilk in his vicarious appreciation of it che felt sick and jenny was turning a faint mottled green that does it gwenny said che saw that her jaw was clenching involuntarily only raw nerve kept her stable she brought the wand around and pointed it at the brat he rose into the air spilling crumbs hey he yelled startled whered you get that from my mother not yours gwenny said she moved the wand carefully and gobble moved along just above the floor you cant do this the boy screamed im going to be chief youre just a dumb girl im the daughter of chief gouty and his wife gidiva gwenny replied as such i am the leading candidate to be the next chief and i rank you by half your parentage no one else can stop you and no one at all cin stop me now you are coming with me regardless no im not no im not he screamed guards arrest this impostor lock her in a cell but the goblins in the vicinity did not move they knew that gwenny was goutys legitimate child and that they could not interfere with her not openly they liked the words but at the same time knew that no child should be uttering them so they didnt know quite what to do gobble yelled but though those nearby blanched they were all adults so couldnt be freaked out quite the remaining cookies turned into steamy sludge but the brat remained captive to the wand so he took a breath and spewed oijt his ultimate ches young mind reeled with the onslaught of those abominable words he felt nauseated but managed to keep his stomach down and his face straight he saw jenny doing likewise though she was turning a deeper green around the gills that was a good trick for someone who had no gills gwenny concentrated on her wand causing the brat to float through the chamber door he quivered a little because her control was not yet quite assured but got through help me somebody gobble shouted shes kidnapping me im your future chief stop her stand clear gwenny said and the goblins reluctantly did so she lofted gobble on down the tunnel che and jenny followed as they passed the nursery where the children were normally kept gobble managed to rip out one more word he bawled but there were no screams of freakedout children it seemed that godiva had had them removed from the vicinity of the exit route gobbles awful ploy had failed godiva met them farther along here are your packs they have food and water for a twoday trip i hope you can complete it within that time if not i hope you can forage she gave them each one and tossed one to gobble where he hung in the air i dont want this junk the brat complained go hungry then godiva said it isnt as if anyone would miss you if you starved gobble reconsidered and put on the pack gwenny and her party moved on out of goblin mountain and around to the side where there was a crevice between it and the next mountain at the end of the crevice was a boulder wedged in a hole now you will have to hold gobble for a moment gwenny said she lofted the brat over to che che grabbed one arm and jenny grabbed the other neither of them was a goblin so gobble had no authority overthem gobble cried struggling but the word had less force because he had used it before it seemed that he had learned only six of the seven forbidden words certainly they would not tell him the seventh gwenny oriented her wand on the boulder it looked as if it had been in place about four hundred years but now it floated out and came to rest a short distance away behind it was revealed a dark and dreadful cave hey thats where the callicantzari hang out gobble cried fear ringing his voice you cant dump me in there we are all going in there gwenny said help kidnapping he screamed in desperation were all going to die in that hole but the goblins on the mountain just stood there helplessly gwenny goblin was the only one they could not interfere with even if she had a suicidal nature gwenny aimed the wand at gobble again and he floated up his arms and legs waving wildly he tried to hold on to che and jenny but they stepped out of the way the moment they released him aaaargh he wailed as he was lofted into the cave just as if the others werent going in with him we need a torch che said yes it is very dark and dank in here jenny agreed shuddering that and the fact that the callicantzari are afraid of fire though i understand they use it to cook their meat thats part of their fouledupness no gwenny said a torch would advertise our presence we must try to get through without alerting them mother said there is supposed to be fungus light when it gets deep enough hal gobble said hey callicantzari come and get them you will be the first one they eat gwenny told him that set him back then he tried to bluff it out how come everybody knows that girls taste better than boys theyll eat you first and ill escape no they will do something else to us first gwenny said evenly che was impressed by the way she was able to speak of that adult conspiracy secret without blanching and they dont like horsemeat as well as goblin meat so theyll leave che too but you will be just right for them to start with because youre small and loud and dusted with cookie crumbs also you smell bad and they have terrible taste they prefer tainted meat she was showing qualities of leadership goblin style gobble decided to shut up he evidently realized that she was probably right even if he didnt know exactly what the monsters would do to the girls first it would hardly make a difference to him if he got eaten first they moved on down below the mountain gobble not evincing so much as a peep after a while the fading light from the cave mouth was replaced by yellow green and blue glows the fungus light was showing in many colors the farther they went the more colors showed until there was a full rainbow spectrum it was eerily pretty it showed the outline of the tunnel because the fungus lined every surface it wasnt very bright but would do they came to a larger cavern and then to branching passages now it was time for the cat sammy find the river lethe jenny said setting him on the floor but dont run naturally the cat bounded off at full velocity that was because he was an animal who didnt truly understand human or centaur imperatives jenny started to run after him but che held her back youll crash into a stalagmite he warned but ill lose sammy no you wont see there are dark spots where his paws crushed the fungus we can follow his trail he was right of course centaurs always were the cats trail was reasonably clear they could follow it at leisure they did so leaving their own trail behind but che knew better than to trust to that for their return the fungus might regrow and reglow before they came back erasing their trail or other creatures might pass this way obscuring it so he made sure to fix the exact route in his memory so that he could find their way without reference to the fungus then they heard something a sort of ugly shuffling and scuffling as if something awful was doing something worse that must be one of the callicantzari can we hurry jenny whispered they hurried but when they did they made more noiseand so did the unseen thing now there was more than one ugly noise as if several things each more grotesque than the others were closing clumsily in on them then one of them showed up ahead it was even worse than che had feared it seemed to have started on the frame of a man but gone astray it had a grotesque furry face with a bulbous nose and two dirty eye slits and a mouth obscured by twisted fangs the body seemed to have bones in the wrong places and the muscles attached backwards exactly as represented in the centaur classes it it tried to jump forward it might lurch backward though probably it had learned to try to jump backward when it wanted to go forward but that was not the worst of it its breath was such a foul stench that the fungus around it was turning bilious green che knew that they would all choke if they got too close to the monster we had better run he suggested but its right where we have to go gwenny said and we dont dare leave the trail we might not find it again she had a point or two but jenny came to the rescue use the wand on it but then gobble will run away gwenny said i dont think so because theres another monster bthind us gobbles safer with us gwenny set gobble down and sure enough the brat did not run she aimed the wand at the monster and the callicantzari made a noisome moan or maybe a moaning noise and sailed away backwards then the four of them charged forward down the tunnel the monster behind pursued but it was so disjointed that it couldnt keep the pace the one ahead kept floating backward because of the magic of the wand the tunnel widened into a passage and the passage into a hall and the hall into a gallery they had to dodge around the many supporting columns fortunately the glow fungus made each one stand out so they could see it coming suddenly they came to a great dark cleft in the floor there at the brink of it was a small furry shape while the monster was suspended over the chasm che realized that this could be an extension of the great gap chasm gone underground if so there was no hope of getting around it they had to go over it sammy jenny cried swooping down on the small shape che realized that the cat had been stopped by the chasm so had simply waited for them to catch up that was just as well because if sammy had tried to hurdle the cleft and missedbut obviously he had more sense than that gwenny dumped the callicantzari on the other side then aimed the wand at che if the monster tries to get you i think theres a knife in the pack she said ill just make him light and throw him away che said more confidently than he felt then he floated across the gulf and landed on the other side the callicantzari did come at him he spun aside and flicked it with his tail the monster abruptly lightened leaped into the airand plunged into the chasm che was chagrined he hadnt intended that he watched the thing float slowly down at least it wouldnt land hard meanwhile gwenny was lofting gobble across then she started on jenny but waithow will you get across jenny asked oopsi hadnt thought of that the goblin girl said chagrined there should be a rope che called rummaging desperately in his pack in a moment he felt it godiva had indeed had the foresight to provide them with this most useful tool for cave delving catch this and i will haul you across he knotted the end and hurled it across the chasm but gwenny was now facing the other way one of the callicantzari was lumbering at her she lofted it up and back so that it tumbled into the one behind and they both became a writhing mass of limbs and torsos each part worse than the rest jenny caught the rope and tied it to a column but then the monsters may use it too che said and we wont be able to get it back yes we will jenny said you dont want to try to hold her full weight she might drag you both down so tie your end to a column too che obeyed anchoring his end firmly but jenny turned to gwenny now you climb across old that rope quickly but i havent lofted you across yet gwenny protested right ill go last move gwenny put away her wand and took hold of the rope she had strong goblin hands and was able to hand herself across in short order as soon as gwenny completed her crossing jenny untied the rope at her end it slid into the chasm but che hauled it up on his side but another monster was coming at her look out che cried as the monster reached a twistfingered hand for her jenny scooted away but the clumsy arm came down brushing her head a backward finger caught the bow of her spectacles and they were ripped off her face oh jenny cried suddenly blinded she staggerect forward trying to see where she was going the callicantzari clung to the spectacles it brought them to its face it was trying to eat them che and gwenny watched in horror as it crunched them between its tusks jenny staggered toward the chasm no che and gwenny cried together then jenny stepped over the brink she screamed as she fell into the awful depth but in a moment her descent stopped jenny rose back to the top and came toward them che let out his breath gwenny had used her wand to catch jenny that had been jennys intent when she decided to be the last to cross but che had mislaid that notion when he saw the monster almost grab her jenny landed safely before them che embraced her she wasnt as pretty as gwenny but she was his best friend and he was greatly relieved to have her safe haha foureyes gobble said they gotcha spectacles now youre bat blind che suffered a surge of fury he released jenny and took a step toward the goblin brat but gobble was already rising into the air and floating over the chasm gwenny was just as angry dont drop me dont drop me he screamed i didnt mean nothing now jenny realized what was happening dont hurt him she said hes just acting the way he is thats what brats do gwenny hesitated gobble shook over the chasm because her hand was shaking on the wand che put his hand on hers and guided it so that the brat floated back to the regular cave floor and landed he knew jenny was right a brat couldnt be blamed for being brattish also gwenny was supposed to protect her little brother even if he was a disgrace to goblin mountain but how was jenny to fare now without her spectacles the light was dim enough already and this would probably indeed make her effectively blind gwenny put her hands to her face che thought she was crying but then she poked her own eye and something came away from it it was one of her magic contact lenses jenny take this gwenny said pressing the tiny lens into jennys hand put it in your eye and you will be able to see with that eye jenny realized what it was but thats yours you need it i have the other we can share one eye is good enough down here when we get back to the surface you can get another pair of spectacles and it will be all right but down here we need you to see so you dont step off any more ledges jenny had to acknowledge the truth of that she rubbed the lens on her shirt then brought it to her right eye it went into place and she blinked oh i can see again better than before but whats that gobble has che looked the brat was just standing there gwenny looked her left eye had her lens oh thats his daydream the biggest fattest bottle of tsoda popka eer filled he lives forjunk food there was a trace of sadness in her voice which che understood now that the three of them had joined the adult conspiracy they were no longer supposed to be interested in junk food it would take time to adjust to that privation gobble looked at them hey are you s talking about me oh it disappeared jenny said because you jogged him out of his daydream che said though he had never seen the dream gobble if you keep using that word i just may change my mind about dropping you in the gulf gwenny said che could see why that particular term was the most derogatory reference to the female persuasion that existed which was why it was forbidden by the conspiracy they returned to business i dont trust letting samnly go ahead loose jenny said he could have plunged into that chasm himself maybe we could tie a tope to him gwenny suggested no he wouldnt like that besides it might snag and choke him but we do need to find the she hesitated not wanting the cat to take off whatever maybe you could hold him and see which way he wants to go che said yes lets try that jenny agreed relieved she held the cat in her arms now sammy i want you to stay with me because its dangerous here but i also want to find the river lethe and by a safe route so you just look the way you want to go and well go there okay the cat seemed satisfied to be carried he looked down the tunnel aheadand both girls jumped look at that gwenny cried delighted oh wonderful jenny agreed what do you see che asked mystified sammy is dreaming the route to the river gwenny answered its like a map with the path highlighted now we know exactly where to go but doesnt your mentioning it make him stop no its still there jenny said maybe because hes an animal and he has a very fixed attention span when he sets out to find something he doesnt stop until he has either found it or been stopped from finding it i never knew exactly how that worked before hey gobble said you mean those lenses make you see things like dreams oops gwenny said we shouldnt have let him know that hell blab it all over the mountain no he wont che replied were taking him to the lethe right that will be just one more thing for him to forget hey im not forgetting anything gobble cried im going to remember all the great words and how my stupid of a sister has to use a lens to see which means shes blind too so cant be chief and how shes snooping on dreams you may forget more than those things if you dont shut your fowl mouth gwenny warned him tightly the brat shut up for a while realizing that she was serious he knew that a fowl mouth was the very foulest mouth because it referred to the way a harpy talked they went on more rapidly now because the girls had the cats mental map to follow they wound down through what would have been truly awesome caverns if they had been in less of a serious hurry but they couldnt complete the journey in one trek so they made camp in a deadend offshoot chamber and had a meal they took turns visiting another region for private business and gobble had the wit not to call it out loud then they settled down to sleep i appoint you the watch gwenny told gobble im sure youll let us know if any monsters approach hey he protested why me i didnt ask to come here because youre the cause of his trip because of the way you corrupted yourself with part of the adult conspiracy well how do you know i wont tie you all up and steal that wand so i can get out of here gwenny handed him the wand try it she said he waved the wand nothing happened heyits broke no its just not attuned to you you cant use it and if you were to tie us up you would have to make your way back alone if you manage to get across the chasin im sure the callicantzari will welcome you with open maws gobble shut up che knew he wouldnt keep very good watch but it didnt matter because they had assigned him the place at the chamber mouth any monster who came would eat him first his screams would alert the rest of them then gwenny would use the wand to float the monster elsewhere it worked perfectly no monster came after a reasonable sleep they ate again and resumed their journey sammys mental map remained clear to the girls who seemed to do about as well with one seeing eye apiece as with two he suspected that was because two eyes were necessary for the magic of depth perception but dreams lacked depth and the caves had nothing but depth which a single eye already knew finally they reached the river lethe it was just a ribbon of dark water evidently no more than a lost tributary coming from some forgotten source and going to a forgotten end but it was one of the most treacherous rivers of xanth water from this river had caused the good magician humfrey to forget his wife rose for eighty years that had complicated his life somewhat when he rememhered gwenny got out a small cup and dipped out a tiny driblet she faced gobble who tried to cringe away but there was nowhere he could go forget these words she said and sprinkled him with six drops then she gritted her teeth and uttered the awful crudities she said and then fell back looking as if she wanted to wash her mouth out che knew how she felt he wanted to wash his ears out it didnt work gobble cried i still know them i can say see then he reconsidered aarrgh its gone he looked chagrined gwenny dipped out another driblet now you will forget that i have any problem with my vision or that anyone uses contact lenses or that anyone can see any dreams with them she sprinkled him with three more drops ha the brat said when i get home ill tell all xanth about he paused aboutoh mice i know theres something gwenny nodded mission accomplished i think i wish i could make him forget to be a brat but without his brattiness he would disappear because thats his essence now all we have to do is get safely back to the surface che said somehow he knew it wouldnt be easy yu really shouldnt have threatened him ida said mela nodded shamefaced i know i was desperate and it was all i could think of under pressure its funny okra said musingly he did not seem frightened or angry just amused i wonder why oh i know ida said realizing because that was the big question he couldnt answer so of course he would have made sure to learn it the moment the color was fixed probably sofia told him he must have been prepared and wouldnt have freaked out at all if he had seen them oh i forgot mela said chagrined anew but at least we got a hint ida said we have to go see nada naga i wonder what she has to do with us i never heard of her before you told the story about marrow bones prince dolph and how he agreed to marry her okra said is she acquainted with jenny elf i believe she is mela said but i dont think she would help you get rid of jenny would she know anything about my destiny ida asked getting interested i dont see why but if our only hint for our answers is to talk to her then well talk to her i understand shes a nice person and when in her human form one of xanths most beautiful women ida looked at mela surprised you mean youre not mela seemed taken aback why i never thought about it these legs arent my usual state im just a merwoman in drag as it were in what in a wrong body inverted reversed seeming other than i am stranded out of my element footsore whatever mela agreed smiling ida looked around where do we find nada naga mela pondered i suppose well have to go to castle roogna and inquire i understand she lived there while she was betrothed to prince dolph they should know where she is now so they followed the enchanted path toward castle roogna it was easy going being fairly level with regular camping places along the way ida was rather intrigued by the prospect of meeting royalty there was a swirl of leaves before them the swirl asslimed the shape of a voluptuous nymph did i overhear talk about beautiful women it inquired you dont count metria ida replied you can assume any shape you want and you dont tell the truth mela said angrily i always tell the truth the demoness said indignantly except about my age which is none of your business not the whole truth you didnt tell me to put on more than a panty the demoness shrugged that off as she stepped out from the settling leaves well you didnt ask me whats this about nada serpent ida played the game nada who snake reptile python half human crossbreed whatever ida suggested naga metria agreed crossly then she did a double take hey do you know where she is ida asked of course i know where she is the demoness said shes with my kind all three of them were astonished shes among the demons mela asked correct theres some very important project in the making and shes part of it but shes not a demon mela said shes a naga princess what would she want with your kind nothing metria said but she doesnt have a choice she tasted some red whine in the realm of the gourd a person cant leave the dream realm if she eats of its substance she didnt eat she drank and she didnt really drink she only tasted but it compromised her so she has a debt to work off before she can be free shes serving her time ida found this confusing but i thought the demon realm was different fromthe dream realm it is but a beautiful creature like her is no good for bad dreams so shes rdy to the demons shes what ida asked ha the demoness said caught you thats the term i meant to use but i still dont understand it it stands for temporary duty teedeewhy the dream realm is lending her to the demons but whats she doing there that the demons couldnt do for themselves ida asked thats what id like to know metria said crossly but they wont tell me its some fat juicy secret and theyre afraid ill blab it across xanth if i knew it wouldnt you mela asked of course i would thats my privilege im a gossipy demoness it really gripes me that they are preventing me from doing my thing ida however could see the point of the other demons they could not very well keep a secret if one of them blabbed it everywhere but mela had an idea we have to go talk to nada but we dont know how to get to the demon realm you on the other fluke want to the other what sorry im from the sea i meant to say hand you want to know whats happening there maybe we can make a deal metria considered i get you there you tell me whats going on thats it but if they know youll tell me they wont tell you and if i get you there theyll know you can assume any form ida said why dont you assume human form and join our party then you can learn it yourself the demoness wasnt sure demons are pretty good at recognizing other demons because we all change form constantly suppose they never thought to check you mela asked if you were beneath suspicion some harmless innocent waif maybe that should work ida said they could recognize you but maybe wont because it never occurs to them metria began to be convinced but i dont know any harmless innocent waifs well invent one ida said cerebral my centaur tutor told a story of a little human match girl she was so poor she wore rags she sold matches they are magic splinters of wood that make fires when rubbed against things but no one wanted them so she froze to death why didnt she use her magic sticks to make a fire to keep warm okra asked ida shrugged i dont know maybe she didnt thllnk of it i think she wasnt a very smart little girl then thats perfect for metria mela said no one will suspect her because shes really smart y the demoness seemed tempted but what would she be called smart aleck okra suggested perfect metria said then she reconsidered now just a minute that wont do because im not a boy you need a name that is pitifully plain mela said because woe betide us all if you get caught thats it ida exclaimed what the other three asked in an imperfect but serviceable chorus the name woe betide the demoness fogged then reformed as the smallest cutest most innocent ragged little girl imaginable she carried a box of tiny wooden splinters with red tips please buy my matches she begged in the most waifish of voices oops mela said this is xanth we dont have money so how can she be selling anything no problem the waif said demons do anything they want to since we can make coins from air we use them to trade for things she lifted one hand and a bright golden disk appeared in it but wont the coins turn back to air again soon mela asked of course as soon as we forget to concentrate so what but then the sale isnt real neither are the matches the waif held up one and it puffed into smoke and drifted away but that will give you away ida pointed out a real waif would have real matches metria sighed the entire box of matches vanished well have to make real ones they found a handy firewood tree and peeled off a number of splinters these worked when vigorously rubbed against a stone they burst into fire then the demoness made a new box and put the real matches in it that should surfeit them should what them ida asked induce inveigle assuage complete qualify satisfy whatever the waif said crossly mela pursed her lips i dont think that will do we shall have to keep the dialogue simple youre supposed to be unsmart anyway maybe jus match match okra suggested thats fine mela agreed waif just say that so you cant mix up the word the waif turned wonderful big brown eyes on her match she begged pitifully thats it ida said that would melt a heart of stone oh lets see the waif said she approached a stone that was roughly heart shaped match she begged so soulfully that it seemed impossible that she should be a soulless creature the stone began to melt around the edges it i think were ready mela said how do we get there i can carry you there in a basket the demoness sail a huge basket appeared ida didnt like the look of that she remembered how it had been told that princess rose had been taken to hl i in a hand basket so she fashioned an objection if we enter the demon realm magically they will know theres demon magic involved so wed better sneak in the way real folk would that makes sense mela said there must be some secret access there are several the waif agreed but were not supposed to tell mortals of them and other demons arent supposed to tell you whats going on there ida reminded her if we follow those rules theres one in the gap chasm the demoness said quickly i can take you there no we had better walk there mela decided so we do it nonmagically all the way and on the way we can get used to calling you woe betide and you can get used to playing the part that way well be less likely to make a stupid mistake to that the demoness agreed they started walking north along the first divergent enchanted path they came to by the time they reached the gap little woe betide seemed quite real to them all she had trouble keeping the pace and seemed to shiver in her rags though the day was warm and she answered every question with the plea matches ida hardly cared to admit it but she was developing considerable sympathy for the waif despite knowing she wasnt what she seemed ida was awed by the gap chasm the centaur tutor had told her of it but she had discounted it somewhat in her mind now she saw the vast expanse and depth of it and knew that it had already been discounted by the centaur whose memory of it might have fogged just a trifle there were even small clouds hovering below her eye level as if the atmosphere of the gap were a world apart there was a bit of a rocky path down the sloping side of the chasm ida was nervous about falling off it and plunging down to the distant bottom but she reminded herself that this couldnt happen if they were careful the path led to a shallow hollow that didnt show from above which fed into a cave which debouched into a crevice which finally gave up and let them into a tunnel down into the ground there was a faint greenish glow which helped them see the walls it was from mold coating them this is an old vole hole woe murmured demons dont need tunnels of course so they ignored this but i found it one day while teasing a vole oh mela said i thought the voles left xanth a thousand years ago oh was it that long i must have been thinking of something else ida wondered could the demoness be a thousand years old it seemed possible how far is it to where nada is mela asked oh several days walk through the labyrinth no problem ida exchanged a glance of dismay with mela it might be no problem for a demoness who could jump there instantly but it would not be any fun for them for one thing what would they eat on the way she wasnt sure how much longer her magic sandwich would last she also dreaded the notion of sleeping on cold stone in a perpetually dark tunnel who knew what monsters might lurk in this region are there rivers down here okra asked a river that notion was far less unappealing than dry tunnels they might make a boat and float saving their feet oh yes there are fivers galore throughout the canems the seeming match girl said why ida and mela explained why metria told them where some pieces of driftwood and flotsam were and they made their way to these and dragged them to the water the water had a faint blue glow of its own contrasting with the green of the walls it was rather pretty in its sinister way okra used her ogre strength to bend the wood into new shapes and weave it together forming the raft she turned out to be good at it and in due course they had not merely a raft but a crude houseboat with a woven shelter abov now if only we had some food ida said oh thats right mortals like to eat and match girls like to eat too mela reminded her firmly well there are blind fish in the river and water chestnuts and water biscuits and water taffy the waif said oh goody mela said she lay down on the raft and put her face over the edge into the water in a moment her hand swept down and came up with a fish it didnt see me she said ill ignite my waterlog and cook it ida and okra managed to pick some of the chestnuts biscuits and taffy from the shallow edge of the river in due course they had enough to fill out the meal it turned out to be nice enough in the shelter the burning waterlog warmed it as it baked the fish and toasted the chestnuts and biscuits there was a roar the three travelers sat up alarmed whats thata waterfall mela asked no only a water dragon the demoness replied is it dangerous only to mortals were mortals oh thats right i forgot in that case youre in trouble they peered out the door of the shelter there was the glowing outline of the toothy head of a dragon it was about to chomp the raft okra grabbed the burning waterlog by its unbuming end and hurled it into the dragons maw the dragon swallowed the log it looked faintly surprised it burped it was not a fire breather of course few of that kind liked the water it gulped water from the river steam began to hiss from its ears then it submerged doesnt it know you cant put out a waterlog with water mela asked water is its fuel i dont think it does know ida said not feeling unduly sorry for the dragon that one wont be back the waif said it will take it days to digest that fire and then it wont feel excruciatingly excellent feel what okra asked never mind mela said just so long as its gone im sorry i used up your waterlog okra said contritely under the circumstances ill forgive you mela aid with two thirds of a smile i do have another at home are there any more water dragons ida asked not on this river the waif said im afraid this will be a dull float how unfortunate mela said dryly which was a rare mode for her so for the next day or soit was hard to be sure since the light never changedthey ate and talked and slept floating down the dark river the word must have spread among the local water dragons because there were no other attacks finally they came to the appropriate region they drew the house raft onto a dark beachlet and walked toward the increasing light of the demons mysterious project remember the waif whispered the demons will try to fool you without actually lying every time they do i will try to sell a match then you will know soon they encountered an office cave with a demon it a desk who in heaven are you the demon swore mela took the initiative we are merely three women and a waif come to see nada naga who says the good magician humfrey says he told us to talk with nada the demon looked at a book which appeared in his hand there is no demoness by that name here match the waif begged proffering her box the demon scowled across the desk at her who the delight are you i am just poor sweet little woe betide eking out her paltry living selling accords oops metria had tried to say too much and had miscued a word selling what the demon demanded a wisp of smoke curling up from one tusk a cord of matches mela said quickly or only on whatever you care to buy to help the poor innocent detenseless bigeyed cute little waif the demon frowned the wisp of smoke formed a floating question mark possibly he was suspicious a golden coin appeared in his hand i will buy a match he said o thank you ever so much sir demon woe cried ecstatically she gave him a match he took the match and flipped it into the air it did not puff into smoke and dissipate he caught it and scratched it briskly across the suddenly marbled surface of the desk it burst into flame it really was a match meanwhile woe had given them the hint the demon was trying to temporize what ida asked herself deceive cheat dupe mislead delude she answered herself fool whatever so they had to find out what he was hiding he had said that there was no demoness by the name of nada naga here mela seemed to have pursued a similar chain of thought we did not say that nada was a demoness she is a mortal of the naga persuasion oh that nada she is too busy for visitors at the moment match woe inquired i already bought one the demon snapped no one can be too busy for the good magicians business mela said we must talk with her the demon sighed the wind of his sigh was tinged with frustratedlooking smoke very well i will have a demon take you to her match if you bug me again ms betide i will turn you into a silly piece of putty the demon snapped woe puffed up id like to see you try basiliskbreath all three others closed in on her oh were you frightened by a basilisk ida asked solicitously poor little thing mela said i will go stomp on it okra said mela turned to the demon the poor waif isnt quite right in her mind i think a basilisk thought about brthing on her mother i think a regular demon would frighten her could you have a demoness show us the way instead the demon blew a double smoke ring tinged with fire anything to get rid of you which one do you want magpie okra said suddenly the demons suspicion doubled how do you know of the one nice demoness im an ogre girl okra said magpie came to help at our banquets she told me how she helped similarly when rose of roogna married the good magician the demon turned pages in his ledger i see that magpie did serve at the good magicians wedding to rose of roogna that was a demon extravaganza a what woe asked a bash event shindig fancy occasion celebration blowout woe offered whatever he said crossly then he stared at her silspiciously theres only one creature i know who please summon magpie to guide us mela said urgently im sure shell be just fine anything to get rid of you he snapped his fingers making sparks fly out and a grandmotherly figure lppeared magpie okra exclaimed hugging her my dear how youve changed the demoness exclaimed you look almost human its this clothing i have to wear among the human folk okra said embarrassed but you look almost nice i know okra agreed more embarrassed and who are these folk with you i see that ones human ones from the sea and ones a poor innocent match girl waif mela cried magpie gazed at woe evidently not for an instant le ceived yes of course she said well where is it you need to go to see nada naga mela said the good magician sent us very well right this way magpie walked briskly down a new tunnel that appeared in the rock they followed first mela then okra then ida then woe woe moved up to pace ida she knows but shes despicably nice she murmured she wouldnt hurt anyone for anything even another demon so shes letting me pass maybe you can follow her example ida murmured back why ida realized that it was useless to suggest ethics or niceness to a demon demons had no souls they merely did what pleased them in their various ways it pleased magpie to be a nice emulation of a human being it pleased metria to be mischievous and curious they could be trusted to be those things and no more since there were times when it was necessary to work with demonssuch as right nowit was best to have a realistic understanding of their natures so she revised her answer it might be entertaining i doubt it so much for that notion they came to a cavernous chamber or perhaps a chamberous cavern a lot seemed to be going on at once demons were everywhere doing mysterious things there was a flying dragon in one corner using a dummy model of a human being for target practice the curious thing was that the dragon kept missing ida realized that it was trying to come as close as it could without actually scoring demons were measuring paths apparently making them as narrow as possible without preventing human passage others were digging holes in the ground and fashioning cunning covers for them to make them look like safe paths that would actually give way under the weight of unwary travelers and dump them down this looks like a bad dream factory woe murmured i wonder whether theyre setting up in competition to the gourd realm why ida asked the demoness seemed taken aback it might be entertaining she said after a pause i doubt it ida said so much for that notion woe said ida had a feeling of ddjivu but couldnt think of the term and wouldnt have known its meaning anyway so had to let it go magpie led them to a lovely young woman wearing a serpentine gown she was standing before a demon in mundane costume reading a script no i will not do that she said facing a blue line which was painted on the ground before her but how else will we get across the river the demon asked reading from his own script he sounded unconvincing we shall have to find some other way a princess deies not disrobe before a stranger no no an imposing figure of a demon objected he had gnarled horns and swishing tail and fangs that shaped his mouth into a set snarl do not volunteer the information make him ask for it but it says here the woman protested not anymore nada the old demon said nada glanced at her script it seemed that it had changed they tried it again we shall have to find some other way nada said but why the mundane demon asked managing to be just as unconvincing as before because a princess does not disrobe before a stranger nada read but im not a stranger the mundane demon read weve been together for hours now oh well in that case cut roared the fanged old demon never adlib is your brain full of mush follow the script but professor the script doesnt cover everything suppose he tries to kiss me the mundane demon stepped forward and put his arms around her happy to play the scene then you change into a serpent and slither away the professor responded the mundane demon tried to kiss her she became a serpent and started to slither no you dont he said grabbing her by the neck she opened her jaws about to bite him cut the professor cried you must not bite the mundane you are not allowed to hurt him you are supposed to be helping him the serpent became the woman again but mundanes are unpredictable nada pointed out how can i predict what he might do if i dont teach him some manners thats what were doing now working out all the variations so that there can be no surprises now take it from the top you come around the bend and spy the river which bars the way to your destination oh this is all so complicated nada exclaimed throwing up her hands the mundane demon reached out and started pulling up her dress eeeeek she shrieked well he might try that the mundane demon said then lets add a motion to the script she said furiously a punch in the snoot a snake cant punch the mundane demon pointed out smugly she has no fists then suppose i bite his face off she demanded forming the head of a snake with a huge mouth take a break the professor snapped evidently fed up relieved nada walked away from the river magpie chose this moment to approach her nada you have visitors just so long as theyre not from mundania nada said wearily oh no were from xanth mela said the good magician humfrey sent us to talk with you why would he do that i dont know you we dont know we came to ask our questions and he wouldnt answer instead he told us to the professor interceded get organized he said severely cowing them all first establish identities i am professor grossclout inducted into the direction of this ludicrous charade this is princess nada naga one of the leading players in the game and ordinarily a nice person you four are his terrible gaze turned to each of them in turn mela merwoman okra ogress ida human woe betide metria what are you doing here grossclout demanded werent you banned from the premises the waif turned the biggest hugest meltingest most tearful dollbrown eyes on him please professor i want so much to know whats going on very well he said grimly you will not only learn you will participate as part of that participation you will be unable to tell any outside party anything about this project im not sure i want to participate metria demurred i dont recall inquiring as to your wants the professor gestured the waif was engulfed in a puff of smoke when it cleared metria was herself again you are enrolled he said you will be one of the list of authorized companions lets hope no one chooses you im getting out of here metria said alarmed you are reporting to your station for rehearsal he said magpie take her there the grandmotherly demoness approached the beautiful young one who seemed unable to flee come dear it is really an interesting project the two vanished but metria may not like the role nada said to be sure the professor agreed then he fashioned his set grimace into something very like a smile ida suspected that the demoness metria was receiving her just desserts unfortunately such desserts seldom tasted very good the professor returned his attention to the three of them now i happen to know humfrey he said he is a good man for a mortal and he nominally has sufficient reason for what he does what were your questions how can i get a good husband mela asked how can i get rid of jenny elf okra asked what is my destiny ida asked well no wonder the professor exclaimed his answers would be counterproductive thats what he said mela confessed but i threatened to show him my panty and then he told us to talk with nada naga so we made a deal with metria to get here now it all comes clear he acted appropriately nada take five the beautiful princess looked around take five what professor grossclouts eyes rolled up until the smoldering pupils disappeared then on around inside his head until they returned to the front five moments talk to these querents but i dont understand nada said bewildered exactly the professor stalked away nada looked at them baffled we dont understand any better than you do mela said apologetically we thought you would know what it was all about i hardly know what this is all about nada said gesturing in a full circle ida seeing mela and nada standing together found it hard to judge which one was more beautiful melas body was fuller but nadas face was prettier then again could it be related to our questions okra asked nada frowned a husband jenny elfs riddance destiny i somehow dont think so i really dont want much mela said just the most handsome virile thoughtful intelligent prince available nada stared at her a moment then she shook herself as if not quite believing her own conclusion and turned to the next woman okra why do you want to be rid of jenny elf shes a nice girl and surely never did any harm to anyone especially you she was chosen to be a main character instead of me okra explained if she goes then i can be it and then nothing bad will happen to me and maybe ill live happity ever after how long have you been traveling with mela and ida oh days we helped get mela panted even panted you mean the good magicians question has been answered yes her panty is dont tell me such things are not good to bruit about but i think im getting an inkling of the good magicians reasoning then she turned to ida and stared again oh my i think i do know your destiny you do ida said delighted what is it but i dont know exactly why the good magician didnt tell you so i think i must not say what i think the good magician always has reasons and i am afraid to interfere but surely it cant hurt to nada shook her head i dont mean to tease you ida but im afraid i must to this extent but i believe that my brother naldo may be able to help all three of you and that the reason humfrey sent you to talk to me was so that i would refer you to him indeed you would have more trouble finding him than you did me here let me see if i can arrange it she walked to rejoin professor grossclout who was just standing up aware of the end of her dialogue by some inherent professorish mechanism evidently the five moments were up yes i will arrange it the professor said promise them to secrecy then tell them what you wish he vanished secrecy mela asked about this project surely you are curious oh yes mela agreed echoed by the other two this is the strangest business then the three of you must agree not to tell any other person about what you have seen here if you do that the professor will not use magic to bind you to secrecy as he has metria the three exchanged a generous four glances we agree mela said we are preparing for a marvelous game nada said it will be open to mundanes who will get to tour xanth through it each player will be helped by one of us so that he doesnt get into trouble such as being eaten by a dragon if he plays well enough he can win a magic talent if he doesnt hell be out but what was all that business about swimming or kissing ida asked if i work with a male mundane he might get notions about seeing me in panties nada explained of course we cant have that so if we have to cross a river i wont swim it unless i change to serpent form were practicing how i can dissuade him if he gets insistent everything has to be prepared for so we dont mess up in the game itself thats why the dragons are working on their accuracy they arent supposed to fry any players just warn them but of course the mundanes wont know that i dont envy you this duty mela said all because you tasted a bit of red whine actually it is interesting nada said i wasnt doing anything much after i stopped being betrothed to prince dolph and once its done ill be free im learninga lot and professor grossclout isnt bad once you get to know him what nada jumped there was the professor i was only saying how terrible you are she said quickly a real brute of a monster with no consideration for personal frailty thats better arrangements have been made he faced the three visitors group yourselves together it has been nice meeting you nada said remember tell my brother what you have told me but say nothing about what we are doing here we will mela agreed mela okra and ida drew together the professor gestured abruptly the scene changed jenny hoped that the worst was over gobble was still a brat and she still had to use mainly one eye and they were deep under the callicantzari mountain but they had cured gobble of his adult vocabulary and che knew the way back gwenny dipped some more lethe water and screwed the cap on the cup that elixir could be useful later then just to make sure gobble didnt steal it and use it on them she sprinkled one more drop on him forget about the lethe water we have with us she said they moved on up the winding tunnels and caves and galleries until they reached the place they had nighted before they ate the last of their food because they knew that the following day would see them either out of the nether region or in the fouledup stomachs of the callicantzari they let gobble keep the watch again because it still would be no particular loss if he got eaten by a monster he was less obnoxious now that he had lost his bad words but they had to be careful not to say anything about the way the lenses let them see dreams jenny was tired and so fell immediately to sleep not watching anyone elses dream she woke refreshed and trusted that the others were too except for gobble who didnt matter they trekked on until they reached the chasm there unfortunately was a phalanx of callicantzari each one looking worse than all the others as was their nature what were they going to do now gwennys wand could move only one monster out of the way at a time they had hoped that these denizens would have forgotten about the travelers in the course of the last two days forgotten obviously these creatures had better memories than bodies or natures but that gave jenny an idea she drew gwenny aside we can use some of the water to make them forget us she whispered then theyll go away and well have no trouble i knew i saved it for something gwenny said brightening but how could they do this without alerting gobble of course they could sprinkle him with another drop and make him forget again but they werent sure the lethe water would be effective against the same memory twice it would be better to divert or deceive him in some way so that he just didnt learn about the lethe again why dont i take gobble and look for another way around the monsters jenny said meanwhile you two can check in the other direction then we can meet back here and see who has the best route thats a wonderful idea jenny gwenny agreed so i cotta be with the foureyed freak elf gobble grumbled then he did a double take or at least a one andahalf take say pointears how come you can see without your specs i remember you lost em and youre batblind without em but now youre seeing okay the brat was entirely too cunning jenny thought faintly maybe im not as blind as you think i am bratwurst he shut up which was his usual reaction when bested they walked down the tunnel away from the chasm then turned right at the first intersection jenny made careful note because she knew how important it was not to get lost they proceeded through assorted chambers but none seemed to lead near the chasm let alone across it there doesnt seem to be much here jenny remarked of course she wasnt looking for much the point was to give che and gwenny time to cross and sprinkle the callicantzari with lethe water why dont you have your dumb cat look gobble asked sammy isnt dumb he can speak if he wants to because dumbness had nothing to do with intelligence and everything to do with silence yeah then lets hear him say something sammy growled at him thats not talking the brat said thats cattalk but i wont repeat what he called you junkbrain still it was a notion sammy find the safest way out she held on to the cat just in case the cat map appeared as it had before it led straight back the way they had come that meant that the others had cleared the way see he doesnt know anything gobble said hes looking back jenny said that means were going the wrong way maybe the others have found something yeah sure he said derisively theyre probably just smooching that was all he knew about what adults did the conspiracy was holding they made their way back sure enough che was across the chasm and gwenny was waiting for them the monsters went away she called they must have forgotten about us just so how nice jenny said i never heard of the callicantzari forgetting about their prey gobble said suspiciously why my dear little brother gwenny said sweetly could it possibly be that there is something about yucky monsters that you dont know he shut up twice as solidly as before they tossed the rope and gwenny used it to cross this time che had flicked her with his tail before he was lofted to the other side so that she was light and it was easy for her to hand herself along the rope then from the other side she lofted gobble and jenny across they hurried on because there could be other callicantzari who hadnt been sprinkled with lethe water or some who had but might hear them and come in again but they got through without event to jennys relief it was wonderful to see the faint splotch of light at the end of the tunnel do you know jordan the barbarian explored this very passage centuries ago che remarked but he managed to find another way out yes he was the one who left the boulder blocking the entrance gwenny said i mean they rolled it to shut him in but he did get out but he wasnt looking forstie stopped just in time remembering not to speak of it they walked on out of the deep cave and into the afternoon sunlight it was a glorious feeling the goblin men came out to see them very well gobble gwenny said you may go now thank you for a wonderful time gobble opened his mouth he yelled frustrated they returned to godivas suite and made a full report while eating a full meal then they retired to gwennys suite for a full nights rest this too was wonderful there was much to be said for fullness but there was no spare pair of spectacles in goblin mountain jenny had had a pair in reserve but probably gobble had sought them out and destroyed them out of sheer brattishness so gwenny insisted that she keep the one lens until she could get regular spectacles but she would have to act as if she couldnt see as well as she could so that the goblins did not catch on that there was other magic in operation that could make mischief for gwenny next day they walked around the passages of goblin mountain talking with goblins that was interesting and disquieting how do you feel about my becoming chief gwenny asked one you can be chief if you want to the man replied but he seemed evasive and jenny saw a daydream of gobble wearing the mantle of the chief this goblin actually supported gobble but didnt dare say so in case gobble didnt make it how do you feel about me gwenny asked another male youre okay i guess he responded but his mental picture showed her in a big pot of boiling water jenny realized that not only were the goblins against gwenny they were lying to her about it or trying to the night mare lenses were acting like lie detectors because the spot daydreams showed the truth that made them very useful indeed perhaps it had actually been a good break having to fetch these special lenses instead of regular ones they talked to some goblin women too some said they liked gwenny and hoped she would be chiefand their dreams showed they were telling the truth others said they thought a male should be chiefbut their daydreams showed that it was gwenny they really wanted the men were pretty solidly against her and the women similarly solidly for her whatever either said openly then they passed a chamber where goblins normally caroused they had never been there before because gwenny had normally remained confined in her chambers so that no one would realize that she couldnt see well she never wore her spectacles here of course only jenny did that che had helped greatly with that so that she had been able to go out when shed needed to but they had never pushed their luck how well jenny under stood with the way gobble had always tormented her about her spectacles and supposed blindness but a chief would have to go about so now gwenny was doing it demonstrating her ability but this chamber was a terror they didnt even try to enter it because they could see the daydreams floating out from it they were of nymphlike goblin girls running around without clothing and flinging themselves on the men to perform conspiracy acts galore both they and the men seemed tireless it just went on and on the variations parading through but the underlying nature unchanging it was really true all those crude men wanted was one thing and that thing was dreadfully dull what was the matter with them jenny exchanged a glance with gwenny and because their lensed eyes were doing it they saw each others fancies too both their spot daydreams were of a monstrous pot of boiling water cooking all those dreaming males into mush then they laughed though somewhat hollowly poor che was perplexed because he couldnt see the daydreams the following day it was time for the challenge this was to determine a candidates fitness to be chief iwo challenging tasks were written out on paper and sealed into capsules they would each draw one and have to perform the task written if one succeeded within the time limit and the other did not then the failure would be disqualified if both succeeded they would in due course move on to the next challenge gobble marched up to draw first without asking jeliny knew that gwenny would have protested but did not want to be impolite gobble felt around for what seemed like a long time trying to pick between the two finally he pulled one out opened it and exclaimed with satisfaction i have to get an old wives tail in two days he said i can do it in one he ran off come on he called to two adult goblins we gotta head for the harpy forest he was allowed to have two helpers because gwenny had two one capsule remained gwenny took it and opened it she stood there appalled jenny came and took it from her hand she read it fetch what is between the roc and the hard place what is that jenny asked the most terrible challenge of all gwenny said i dont think i can do it at all let alone within two days che took the paper we must consult he said grimly they went to gwennys suite and consulted che explained the meaning of the paper to jenny in the nameless castle there is a great stone nest and on that nest sits a roc bird between the two is the rocs egg that is what we must fetch but the egg must be huge jenny said it is but gwennys wand will lift it that is not the problem the rocit wont give up its egg without protest jenny said true that is a problem but not the problem where is this nameless castle anyway that is the problem che said soberly no one knows where it is in fact the only reference to it we know of is in the good magicians notes it seems the demons spoke of it humfrey searched for it and ascertained that it was nowhere on the peninsula of xanth so he went on to other things then how do you know about the roc and the hard place the good magician had a footnote about that perhaps the great demon professor grossclout mentioned it but that is all we know how could gobble get such a simple task while gwenny gets an impossible one jenny asked i suspect that gobble cheated che said soberly he must have switched the real capsule with this one unfortunately we cannot prove that i am afraid that we are stuck with this task but we should go to the authorities and complain jenny said the authorities are male goblins jenny sighed she had learned enough of goblin ways to know that protest was useless so what do we do che made half a smile unfortunately it wasnt the nice half we find the nameless castle when even the good magician couldnt find it he didnt find it that is not to say he couldnt he probably had other things to do so how do we find it then we ask sammy jenny smiled maybe that will work so they replenished their packs and went out of the mountain when they were in an open region jenny addressed the cat sammy find the first short stretch olthe way to the nameless castle for she had no notion how far the cat might run if not limited and she was learning how to use his ability more effectively sammy bounded to the east that was all right since there was a path in that direction leading to the river they had used it not long ago but they had not seen any castle on or near the riverand anyway the castle was supposed to be not on peninsular xanth that probably meant the sea which was less all right they followed after a bit sammy stopped and waited when they caught up jenny had him find the next segment of the route this was certainly a good way to use his talent but what would they do when they came to the sea to the east and had to go beyond build another raft that had worked for the river but she wasnt eager to risk it on the sea if fracto spied them they came to the river sammys mental map proceeded straight across so they pulled out their raft and found poles and shoved across but this was the haunting ground of dragons in a moment one or more of them would sniff them so jenny started singing making a dream and any local dragons who werent already paying attention joined the dream in stead che who was doing the poling paid close attention so that he did not get caught in the dream when they were safely across and had trees to conceal them gwenny touched jennys hand do you know i could see the dream without being in it that was fun beyond the river the route continued but it was too good there was an old wide path that curved along the contour fairly level sammy bounded along it so swiftly that they were soon worn out trying to keep up but that wasnt all nice paths too often lead to tangle trees or ogres dens che said now i know hes supposed to be following a safe route but he might not realize who made the path maybe it is safe only so far then it becomes unsafe and whoever is on it is trapped or maybe it is safe only by day but it will take more than a day to traverse and we wont like the night gwenny said or maybe it just goes so far that well be hopelessly footsore by the time we get to wherever it goes jenny said it was evident that none of them were eager to spend much time on this particular path i really dont think sammy would lead us down an unsafe route but we only have two days so we need to go fast che studied the path i think this is a serpentine track he said see its surface is oily green and very hard probably a giant serpent slithered along here years ago and is long gone leaving only its imprint in the land gwenny peered at the green i would hate to meet a serpent that big but if it makes its own trail as it goes and doesnt return to it jenny said then its free for anyone to use still if the nameless castle is far awayand it may be if gobble wants to be sure we wont be back in timewe still need something more than just to walk along it maybe we should try a diversionary ploy che suggested a what jenny asked ask the feline to find us something that will in an indirect manner facilitate our journey with respect to both velocity and safety you werent any clearer the second time gwenny complained youre getting to be too much like a centaur che was taken aback i didnt realize all i meant was that maybe sammy can find us something to help oh good idea jenny addressed the cat sammy sammy took off into the underbrush wait for me jenny cried running after him here we go again gwenny said following they trailed after the cat who bounded through thicket and field and finally came to a peasant hut there was a boy of about eight playing among a collection of toys blocks and things he had black hair blue eyes and looked smart for his size sammy came up to him and stopped hey a friendly wild creature the boy said delighted he reached out to pet sammy and sammy did not avoid his hand jenny saw that as she ran up that meant that not only was this boy what the cat was looking for he was an okay person those were good signs the boy looked up as jenny arrived look what i found he said indicating sammy ah the naivete of youth now that jenny was in the adult conspiracy she felt nostalgia for the innocence of the childish state yes that is sammy my cat you didnt find him he found you i think you have something we want do you can have all these things i just made them for fun jenny looked at the objects in the yard as che and gwenny caught up they were of every type but she didnt see how any of them would help them travel you made these yes thats my talent i make ininane inanimate che said whateverthings into other things the boy finished now that has possibilities che said lets introduce ourselves i am che centaur and i am seven years old these are jenny elf and gwenny goblin they are older but they have a right to betheyre girls yeah the boy said seeing the logic of it im darren im eight im older than you che so you are but i have wings gee i wish i had wings but i cant change myself just bits of wood and stone and stuff jenny and gwenny stayed back and let che interview the boy he was good at it we are traveling but we are in a hurry che said we saw a path that goes where we want to go but we need to go along it very quickly can you make anything that would help us do that sure darren said a land sailer you can go very fast in that a sailor on land che asked perplexed no a sailer like this the boy went to a big block of wood and touched it immediately the block started changing its outline until it became a wooden boat with a thin wooden sail at its base were several wooden wheels see when you get in it it attracts the wind which blows it along but mom wont let me go very far she says that there are dragons out there your mom is smart there are dragons i think we can use this sailer what can we trade for it darren looked around how about this cat jenny jumped but che took it in stride no we need sammy with us but maybe he could find something for you something you want oh i guess all i want is to forget how dull it is being a child che glanced at gwenny i believe we can arrange that gwenny brought out her bottle of lethe water she sprinkled one drop on the boy forget how dull childhood is she said darren looked up hey its fun being a child i like it i dont ever want to get into any of the adult conspiracy stuff jenny turned away how little he knewyet how familiar was the sentiment che made the sailer light and hauled it away leaving the happy boy in his yard they brought it to the path then they all got on it immediately a stiff wind came up to address the sail the sailer began to move soon it was moving so rapidly they had to hang on but it was taking them where they wanted to go much faster than they ever could have done it on foot and this was more restful too the scenery whizzed by so swiftly it became a blur but how were they going to stop jenny wished they had thought of that before they boarded this craft the blurred scenery turned dark they were passing through a mountain cleft or perhaps even a tunnel bored by the serpent or maybe it had gotten bored after the serpent left it since nothing interesting was happening then there were more trees and glades finally it opened out and they could see far to either side across a level plain or marsh where are we gwenny cried in the wind the east shoreline i fear che cried back but then we must be sailing into the jenny started splash the sailer threw up a great cloud of beach sand and plowed into the water it bounced and flipped as its wheels touched the liquid and the three of them landed in waistdeep brine the sea jenny finished belatedly now she had her answer about how they were going to stop at least they werent hurt they plowed back to the beach dragging the sailer they were soaking but there wasnt time to worry about that the day was latening and they didnt know how far they still had to go however the beach itself glowed brightly so that it seemed that the day would never end here i wonder where this is gwenny said then che spied a sign that explains it he said pointing the sign said day tona beach though whoever p ainted this sign was sloppy i think it should be day on a beach literacy isnt what it used to be gwenny agreed but jenny remembered their mission sammy she began fearing where he might go next the cat walked a few paces south and stopped they came and stood by him but there is nothing here gwenny said indeed the sand was bright and bare there was nothing even close yet sammy sat licking a paw unconcerned maybe it is below gwenny offered but the sane was undisturbed and the cat wasnt digging sammy think of the route jenny said the cats mental map appeared the line went straight up they looked up there was nothing there but a white cloud floating serenely by itself yet that was where the route line went the nameless castle is nowhere on peninsular xanth che said we assumed that meant it was off to the side such as in the sea but it just might be above xanth instead we have to reach that cloud gwenny said but how can we do that che asked im not sure its within range of your wand and we have no way to fly i i jenny had a bright notion maybe che could fly she began if he just forgot that he could not gwenny finished she brought out her bottle the logic is fallacious che said i am simply not grown enough to gwenny sprinkled a drop of lethe water on him you cant fly she said identifying what he was to forget this is ridiculous the little centaur protested i simply cannot yetbecause my wings have not yet he hesitated surprised what can i not do im sure we dont know jenny said but we are in a hurry so please make us very light and then you can carry us up as you fly to that cloud overhead of course he flicked the two of them and the cat and then himself each of them took one of his hands with jenny holding sammy then he spread his wings which had grown and feathered out nicely in the past two years more than had been apparent before so had his chest muscles which helped anchor the wing muscles he pumped them and the flight feathers caught hold of the air they lifted from the sand at first things were unsteady because this was his first flight and he was supporting the others but in a moment he got the hang of it and was able to make a controlled spiral ascending toward the cloud jenny looked down already the ground was distressingly far down she felt alarmingly insecure but she kept a stiff upper lip and a stiff lower one too after all this had been her idea so she looked up and saw the base of the cloud lppreaching it was quite ordinary but how could there be a castle up here castles didnt float in air but clouds did and a castle might rest on a cloud if the right magic were in operation che achieved the edge of the cloud breathing hard my wings are getting tired he gasped then his wing beat faltered they began to sink down jenny reached out and grabbed the edge of the cloud it felt like cotton stuffing she hooked her three fingers and thumb into it and pulled the three of them and sammy in she knew that she wouldnt have been able to do it if there had been one more of them or one less finger then gwenny caught hold also they were all still very light so they were able to haul themselves and che in without falling they climbed onto the cloud and set the little centaur on his feet there thank you che said my wings got so tired youd think i had never flown before he cocked his head actually theyll recover jenny said quickly it was a difficult climb holding the two of us but now were here and we can look for the she broke off amazed all three of them stood gaping for there before them was the nameless castle it was cloudcolored and seemed to be made of cloud stones but overall was solid and tall with turrets and buttresses and embrasures and pennants and all there was even a moat one thing a cloud could provide was water jags of lightning jumped from its highest pinnacles that was another thing a cloud could provide sammy jumped down and walked toward the drawbridge they followed still awed this would be a perfectly ordinary castle if it werent up here on the cloud as it was it was extraordinary the drawbridge was down and the porcullis up it was almost as if the castle expected them yet they were here only because of gobbles attempt to cheat jenny was amazed that they had managed to get this far could they actually fetch back the rocs egg they set foot on the drawbridge it was made of the same tough cloud stuff as the rest and readily supported their weight of course they didnt weigh much at the moment but if they had it still would have been strong enough jenny bent to tap its substance with her fingers and it was like spongy tree bark soft on the surface but with very little give beneath they walked on into the main doorway it was huge as was the castle a giant could have used this the great hall led to a mighty central chamber but it was empty so they tried a side hall but that led endlessly away with many blank doors at its sides where was the roc sammy find the roc jenny said the cat bounded off she had forgotten to hold on to him all she saw was his mental map which disappeared as he followed the highlighted route so she just had to run after him as usual trying to keep his tail in sight it turned out to be no easy route they wound through halls chambers and galleries as devious as those of the caves they had left wending their way gradually upward it seemed there was no grand central staircase but rather many little hidden stairs scattered around the castle rihe only thing that enabled jenny to keep up with the cat was the number of closed doors that balked him he had to wait for her to come open them this castle was a veritable puzzle box this portion is made for folk our size che remarked in contrast to the main gate and hall which is made for a giant i wonder why maybe this is the servants quarters gwenny said yet there are no occupants of this castle large or small he pointed out except maybe the roc jenny said then she had a nasty notion just what do rocs eat any creature they can catch che said then he realized the significance of that the roc could have eaten everyone in the castle but the roc would be too big to get in here gweriny said and theres no damage to show that it ripped any of this open to get at anyone so there must be some other explanation jenny said relieved they must have gone elsewhere we dont know how old this castle is after all they could have left centuries ago it could have gotten boring on this cloud finally they came to the top floor here there was a lone passage leading to the center of the castle it opened onto a balcony overlooking another awesome sight for there below them in a vast central chamber sat the huge roc bird it was of course roc colored with a metallic sheen to its feathers it was sitting on a monstrous nest fashioned of marbled granite in the nest just barely visible was the rounded curve of the phenomenal rocs egg it sparkled like a gem iridescently if just that one little sliver of it is that lovely gwenny breathed what must the whole thing look like mindbendingly spectacular che said they stared down for a while but the big bird did not move is it asleep jenny asked do you know i think it is a statue che replied see it is not breathing this is a statue an exhibit bird nest and egg so we should be able to borrow the egg without any trouble after all that was a great relief they all found a ramp leading down to the base of the exhibit just fight for them they trekked down it jenny watched the roc somewhat nervously but it was true it neither breathed nor moved an eyelid it was indeed a statue so realistic that it would have fooled anyone who did not watch it closely for a time they came to the base of the nest they walked around it one of the rocs enormous tail feathers projected out and down jenny reached up and touched it it was longer than she was and as hard as stone isnt that egg too big to fit through the doors gwenny asked it certainly is jenny agreed che looked around from here i can see that there is an opening to the sky that must be where the roc flew in before it was petrified or where it could have flown in to provide the statue verisimilitude youre getting centaurish again gwenny informed him i cant even imagine that word you just used che looked abashed i only meant that if they wanted to make the exhibit seem realistic they had to have a way for the bird to reach the nest just as if it really could fly why didnt you say that then she said severely but she couldnt maintain her frown and the smile started leaking through so maybe we can use the wand to float the egg out the top jenny said and down to the ground below and you can fly after it it does seem feasible he agreed provided i have some rest stops along the way so how do we get the egg out from under the roc gwenny asked you can use the wand to loft the roc out of the way then i can flick the egg and make it light enough to lift when jenny and i have it clear you can lower the roc onto the empty nest and then use the wand to loft the egg gwenny brought out the wand and faced the bird she pointed the wand moved itand the roc rose smoothly up the complete egg was revealed and its luster magnified it was indeed the most beautiful object jenny had seen she had not realized that a mere egg could be so magnificent but of course this was not a true egg but a giant gem part of the exhibit our turn che said he stood beside the egg and flicked his tail touching it lightly making it light the egg flashed light radiated out from its crystalline center bathing them all it did not blind them but it added an iridescent cast to their hair skins and clothing they were abruptly marked folk uhoh gwenny said the roc squawked it spread its wings and extended its legs it stood on the nest glaring down at them huge panels slid across the skylight seating it closed there was the sound of doors slamming throughout the castle there was also the crash of the portcullis slamming down across the front entrance and the squeak of the hinges of the lifting drawbridge they had just been locked into the nameless castle with an angry monster predator bird suddenly jenny knew what had happened to all the other folk of this castle they had come from their safe chambers into the rocs domain and tried to steal the egg touching the egg was what made the roc come to angry life that was the terrible trap of the nameless castle no wonder little news of it got out bratty gobble goblin must have known or suspected that it would be this way so that gwenny would not only be unable to fetch the egg she would be dead and they had fallen for the dastardly plot they were in a dusky cave okra and ida stood on rock but mela stood at the brink of water before she could catch her balance she fell in with an ungailily splash oh she spluttered her hair turning sickly gren fresh water ugh okra immediately reached in and hauled her out by an arm naturally mela had not changed to her tail because of the awful water now she was soaked through this is a weird place ida said whats that mela merwoman looked around they were standing beside a collection of bones and skulls meanlooking little bats hovered near watching them suspiciously above on a broad ledge was what appeared to be a huge dragons nest filled with gemsand the dragon was there it rose up jaws gaping peering down at them then its eyes fixed on melas soaking bosom it froe mela glanced down it surely wasnt her sex appeal that mesmerized the monster there on her bosom were ithe two firewater opals gleaming brilliantly so that was it naturally the dragon wanted those precious gems for its collection hold friend a voice said i recognize one of those damsels shes my sisters friend mela looked and saw that beyond the dragon was a large serpent with the head of a man one of the naga folk you must be naldo naga nadas brother she said relieved he looked at her that i am but who are you and what are you doing here in dracos lair draco mela said appalled draco dragon to be sure naldo said you expected some other dragon he killed my husband mela cried and stole our firewater opal the dragon looked abashed naldo looked at him evidently understanding him then spoke again but he returned it and its mate so that you now have a matchless set it was his way of apologizing for the incident he recognized the set instantly but has not before met you melas feelings were mixed it is true that draco returned double but i would never have been in difficulty if that same dragon hadnt rudely toasted my husband i would not at this moment be in search of a new husband having to go on land and wear these tiresome legs she lifted her plastered skirt to show her legs being careful not to raise it quite far enough to show her wet panty there was no need to be an even worse sight than she already was you came to a dragons lair looking for a husband naldo inquired with a droll lift of a brow no not exactly the three of us had questions for the good magician and he wouldnt answer and he sent us to see your sister nada instead and she sent us to you a demon conjured us here i assure you draco dragon was the last creature i ever wanted to see and being dunked in his foul freshwater puddle was the last thing i wanted to do my sister sent you to me then i must try to be a better host naldos head turned to the dragon draco do you have any humanstyle clothing in your collection maybe left over from a meal in her size the dragon squinted studying melas soaked torso he disappeared then reappeared with several items dangling from his toothy mouth naldo took them yes here is some underclothing not ideal but it will do until your regular clothing can be cleaned and dried here i will toss it down and you can retreat to a private crevice to change then we can talk for it may be that we do have a dialogue coming okra extended a hand and caught the items as he dropped them she brought them to mela they were a furry green brassiere a silky white slip and a pair of light slippers mela took them to a private spot got out of her clothing dried delved in her purse for a spare plaid panty and donned the new clothing the bra was odd but sufficient even for her structure the slip was so slick it seemed to want to slide right off her body but it stayed once she was all the way in it the slippers were similarly slippery just what kind of articles are these she called naldo consulted with the dragon an algae bra freudian slip and freudian slippers draco says they came from an unusual but sexy woman with erotic taste mela had never heard of such clothing but it was the best that offered at the moment so she didnt complain it would do for the nonce certainly it was better than having the dragon discover what her taste was then the dragon let down his tail and one by one they got on it and were hauled up to the nest it was beautiful it scintillated with all manner of known and unknown gemstones mela had to admit that the dragon had taste i see that you like dracos display naldo said its the loveliest thing ive seen in my life next to th deep sea itself she breathed the dragon snorted draco says that you are the loveliest thing he has seen next to the boiling lava of a fresil volcano oh really mela said flattered oh he means as a morsel for eating that too the naga agreed he looped his serpentine body into a pyramidal coil with his head at the apex as i explained it was a misunderstanding that caused draco to toast your husband and he much prefers not to quarrel with you we were playing dominoes and discussing our mutual problem with goblin encroachment of our demesnes never expecting company draco has had interesting news from other winged monsters and suddenly i think i see a larger purpose in this encounter a larger purpose mela echoed because the good magician never does anything purposelessly he surely had good reason to send you to my sister and she had similar reason to forward you to me lets have formal introductions and then perhaps i can clarify things somewhat i am naldo naga and this is draco dragon i am mela merwoman and this is okra ogress and this is ida human okra wishes to become a major character so needs to get rid of jenny elf ida needs to achieve her destiny the various named parties nodded at each other but when mela turned in the course of introducing the others idas eyes looked troubled naldos staring at your backside ida whispered to mela mela put a hand back and discovered that her slip had somehow slipped aside and was revealing some of the color of her panty naldo had seen she felt herself turning a rosychecked apple red crosslined with other colors as she hastily pulled the slip back across her bottom this could never have happened if she had been in her normal tail but the slip started to slip aside again so she sat down on the raised edge of the nest unfortunately the slip rode up across her knees and the slippers managed to make her feet slip apart giving naldo too much of a glimpse up her legs what perverse items of clothing these were she had to concentrate on keeping them from embarrassing her further leaving the dialogue to the others there had been a time when she had not been concerned with appearance but that had been before she learned that males were not supposed to see panties she was now doing her best to abide by the customs of landbound folk so she firmly crossed her legs and hoped for the best what is this interesting news draco dragon has okra asked and why do you think nada sent us on to you ida added i will answer you both naldo said removing his eyes from what mela hoped he hadnt quite seen but first let me learn just a little more about you okra why should getting rid of a harmless elf facilitate your situation because there was an opening for one major character and the choice was between an ogress and an elf and the elf got it since jenny was the elf if i can get rid of her then there will be only one candidate me you dont actually wish her any harm no i just want her out of xanth one way or another so if there were some other way for you to gain the status you desire you would be content to let jenny elf be well i suppose but since there was only one character to be chosen i think it has to be her or me naldo nodded and ida how do you propose to achieve your destiny well i was going to ask the good magician but lie didnt answer so i thought id ask nada naga but she sent us on to you so maybe you know how im sure i dont you are sure you dont but that i do well yes really ida said because we have been sent to you so you must know the answer or know how to get it professor grossclout seemed to know the an swers but hes just like the good magician humfrey neitheir one will secondguess the other they say our answers would be counterproductive whatever that means so youre our last hope you must be able to help us naldos human head nodded on his serpent neck i believe you are correct very well now i will answer the news is this che centaur is in trouble the winged monsters have been keeping an eye on him but arent supposed to interfere but they fear that if something is not done soon che will not survive his difficulty neither will his companions gwendolyn goblin and jenny elf jenny elf okra exclaimed i dont want her to survive and why should we care about che or the goblin girl ida asked naldo smiled a trifle grimly his face was rather handsome and so were his coils in a different way mela thought i asked myself a similar question when i learned that a goblin was a member of the party to be saved the naga folk do not get along well with the goblin folk but this particular goblin has a chance to become the first female chief of goblins and that would transform their nature and make them halfway decent neighbors and because che centaur us very important to the simurgh and she will be most annoyed if he is harmed we dont want to experience her annoyance she might let the universe expire so that another can start instantly in its place one without the annoyance mela thought about that and realized that they did have a certain peripheral interest in the matter since they were part of the universe but we have concerns of our own she said why would nada send us here when we cant do anything about your other concern ah but perhaps you can he said but rather than attempt to persuade you by logic which is an imperfect mechanism let me be more direct i believe i can solve all your problems or at least arrange for the satisfaction of all three of your quests if you will do something to help me handle my concern you can satisfy our quests ida asked excitedly yes but i shall not do so unless you do something for me i want you to help save che centaur i suspect that this is what the good magician had in mind when he sent you to me via nada but why not send us directly to you ida asked perhaps because mela would not have come had she known i was with draco he glanced at okra and you would not have come had you realized that i would require you to help save jenny elf save her okra exclaimed i dont want to do that but you do want to be a major character he reminded her just as ida wants to achieve her destiny and mela wants a husband i do happen to be in a position to enable the three of you to fulfill these quests but i do also have my price which i think is not as great as the one the good magician exacts the three of you must do what you can to save the three others from their predicament regardless of your personal wishes only if you do that will i oblige your own wishes mela exchanged a good three and a half glances with okra and ida she did not like this but if he really could deliver it might be worth it she saw that the other two felt much the same then well do it she said though we consider this to be unfair naldo shrugged which was impressive with his serpent body the price does not seem excessive considering that you are in no position to bargain they could not argue with that so what is it we have to do mela asked you have to go to the simurgh and tell her that roxanne is about to eat che the simurgh mela exclaimed horrified no one dares go there correction no flying monster dares fly there naldo said and other creatures had best practice extreme caution because of the maenads and python but i think three damsels in evident distress might manage to get through so that is your task to go to mount pamassus and tell the simurgh then return here and i will make good on my promise mela knew that the naga folk always kept their promises but she had another objection we are north of the gap chasm and mount pamassus is south of it it will take us a long time to get there and if the problem is urgent we may be too late naldo glanced at draco who slithered out of the nest spread his wings and flew down to the water he dived in l will show you out of this den naldo said by the time we emerge draco will have some winged monsters ready to transport you just so long as we dont have to go through that awful fresh water mela said unfortunately you do but i trust all three of you can swim mela exchanged a few more glances with her companions yes but we dont want to get our clothing wet then take it off by all means i certainly dont object but if we do you will see ourour unmentionables mela said not wanting to say the p word to a male i will transform to my complete serpent form he said the proscription does not apply to animals of course as they have no appreciation of the significance of such apparel mela wasnt quite certain of the logic but couldnt refute it so naldo assumed his fully serpent form and the three of them removed their clothing and then their panties and stood in their altogether like three nymphs they sealed their things in their purses then looked at the snake the snake slithered to one side of the nest and nudged something with his snout it was a rope ladder mela went and tossed it over the side and saw that it reached to the floor of the cave and was firmly anchored above that must have been how other visitors came up when the dragon had company she had never thought of dragons as sociable creatures but it seemed that it was possible after all draco had been playing a game of fire water sand with merwin merman when they had the altercation that led to the loss of the firewater opal it seemed that though every mercreature knew that water doused fire sand displaced water and fire melted sand the dragon had somehow thought that it was backwards with fire evaporating water water covering sand and sand smothering fire so each thought he had won and that the other was cheating and they had fought what mischief had come of the confusions and aggressions of males still males did make life more interesting perhaps not as interesting as females made life for males but then the realms of life and love never had been quite fair they used the ladder in turn and stood by the dark water the bats hovered again watching they were evidently guardians of the den the snake slithered down the ladder and into the water so they followi distressing as it was for mela once she landed her husband and returned to the sea she would never touch fresh water again they swam in single file the snake took a breath and dived under the surface and mela followed she saw vicious little piranha tish and was suddenly nervous because without her tail which she would not trust to this water she could not swim fast enough to avoid them but they did not attack they merely watched draco must have given them the word the dragon had guardians in both the air and the water making his precious nest secure yet obviously the demons could reach it since they had c njured the three damsels there and the goblins had raided it so nothing was perfect there was an underwater passage leading out they used it and soon came to an end of the water in a dry cave someone going the other way would never know that the dark pool led to a dragons lair mela had been surprised to see the dragon swim away but she really had never known a lot about dragons it was evident that some flying dragons could indeed swim and that some firedrakes could handle water just as some merfolk could handle land when they had to they saw daylight beyond so paused to put their clothing back on since melas original clothing remained wet she had to use the freudian slip and slippers again and her algae bra the bra was all right in fact she hoped to continue using it after this was over because it derived from the sea and was comfortable but the slip was treacherous and she didnt trust it at all it seemed to be out to embarrass her by accidentally showing things she very much did not want to show the slippers were almost as bad they tended to slip on the ground when someone was watching they caused her legs to slip out of their covering at odd moments so that more of them showed than intended this could have been very embarrassing if she hadnt taken the trouble to form good legs they came to the cave opening it turned out to be in the slope of a mountain with a sheer drop to the level ground what now a fourlegged griffin approached its fierce eagles head orienting on them as the paws of its lions body reached for them it hovered as close as it could to the cave but it was shaped the wrong way to land there naldo resumed his naga form one of you catch onto the griffins legs he said the downdraft from the wings was blowing his hair straight back but mela said with a qualm that was more than mere doubt draco has enlisted them to carry you to mount parnassus naldo explained but one griffin can carry only one person gregor griffin will set you on his back once you catch on trust him he is sworn to protect che centaur melas faith was distinctly weak griffins had been known to slaughter and eat luscious merwomen such as herself but she realized that she had to set an appropriate example besides her slip was trying to slip to the side again and her slippers were trying to make her feet slip out from under her so that she would sit down suddenly with her slip flying over her head she had to get into a better situation so she stomped on the nearest qualm shored up her faint faith and reached out to take hold of the monsters front legs the griffin flew up and mela was dragged off the mountain she dangled in the air under the griffin feeling like the clapper of a bell she tried to scream but before she got enough breath for a respectable effort the griffin hoisted his front legs and sent her looping up over his head she did an appalled flip in the air and landedplopon his back right between his beating wings she finally got her breath in order and made ready to scream but by then she realized that she no longer had cause she was riding the griffin and no one could see her panty even if the slip tried to show it because she was too far from the ground she hung on to the griffins feathery mane and glanced back there was another griffin behind with okra on it farther back was a third with ida they were all safely riding what a relief now the three griffins winged swiftly south surprisingly soon they were crossing the gap chasm mela peered down trying to see whether the cave they had taken to the demons realm was there but they were flying so high that the details were only a blur it was amazing the way professor grossclout had conjured them so far to the dragons cave just like that she would never want to run afoul of the professor for sure the griffins accelerated now the scenery fairly whizzed by xanth was like a huge carpet with forests rivers lakes and fields painted on most lakes were small like puddles but there was one larger one which looked like pursed lips lake kissmee she exclaimed thrilled by the identification she had been there not all that long ago a line extended south of it which had to be the kissmee river up which okra had paddled they followed that line down until it touched a much larger lake that would be ogrechobee where the curse fiends resided plus a few stray ogres as okra had shown then they angled southwest crossing dense jungle finally the very tip of a mountain showed aheadand the griffins swooped down to the land that would be because they were not allowed to fly too close to mount pamassus but it would still be a long walk for mela and her companions but the griffins did not stop they touched land folded their wings and ran on four feet on toward the mountain so that was why draco had enlisted the fourlegged variety they could take the travelers a good deal closer to the mountain without getting into trouble in due course the griffins halted they were now quite near the base of mount parnassus but not touching it the winged monsters had gone as far as they dared go mela dismounted thank you gregor she said with genuine gratitude you have saved me a long hard trek then she kissed the griffin on the beak gregors face feathers changed from golden to beet mela was sympathetic having experienced something similar when the freudian slip misbehaved probably the creature was frustrated at not being able to consume her tender flesh soon the griffins were running away all the three of them had to do now was find a way to the top of the mountain without getting eaten by the wild maenads or the monstrous python mela hoped they were up to it mela verified her memory of the hazards in her manual then explained the problem we cant just climb up the maenads are wild women who chase down and eat any intruders and those they dont catch the terrible python does there are muses on the mountain but they dont interfere and anyway its the simurgh at the top who we have to see maybe i could bash a maenad okra said but they travel in wild screaming packs mela said while you were bashing one the others would get us no we want to avoid them entirely if we can maybe theres a path they arent on okra said yes maybe there is ida agreed we have only to find it and then we can go straight up and not have any trouble no maenads no python mela started to object but realized that it was pointless they had to go up the mountain and hope that they did not encounter its menaces why make the others afraid even if they were doomed to be caught and eaten there was no point in proceeding with fear okra believed that major characters never had anything really bad happen to them that would be nice if mela cold be sure that she herself was a major character considering the death of her husband merwin way back when she doubted that she could be major so she had no security and nither did ida the only way to avoid the dangers was not to go up the mountain and then they wouldnt complete their quests but she did think it was cruel of naldo naga to send them on this dangerous mission he should have gone himself but instead was saving his hide by making them do it maybe he really had no solutions for them but figured he would not have to provide any because they would not survive this mission no that was unfair the naga folk were honorable and he was a prince therefore responsible so he would honor the deal but he had certainly driven a cruelly hard bargain okra and ida were searching for a good path mela joined them with less enthusiasm she was older than they were and versed in the horrors life could bring such as the death of ones spouse but it was better to leave them their relative innocence as long as possible i found it okra cried its an invisible path wonderful ida exclaimed then how did you find it mela asked more critically i sniffed it out see here it is okra gestured to an impenetrable thicket of brambles mela was trying not to be unduly negative but was having a problem that doesnt look like a very good path thats because you cant see it watch me okra stepped forward and disappeared in the brambles wait youll get all scratched mela protested no i wont the ogress replied the brambles are illusion the real brambles dont grow here because they think this space is already filled thats what makes this such a good path no one uses it because no one can see it the maenads probably dont want to get scratched either it probably goes right to the top of the mountain mela poked a cautious finger at the mass of brambles it encountered nothing she put a foot in nothing it really was illusionwhich meant it was also a serviceable path if it continued far enough meanwhile okra was forging ahead ogre fashion so mela nerved herself and followed ida came last smiling she had been so sure there would be a path and lo there was mela feared that idas optimism would inevitably be disabused but she didnt want to be the one to do it folk tended not to be as nice after disabusement okra followed her nose and found the curves and twists of the path anyone without such a keen sense of smell would surely quickly go astray and wind up amidst real brambles but the invisible path was kempt not unkempt with no blockages or gaps who had made it and who used it when they were perhaps a third of the way up the mountain they heard a scream there was one of the fierce wild women the maenad stood on an intersecting path and had spied them she was as naked as a nymph and proportioned like a nymph but her pretty face was distorted into a grimace of hate her hair extended in a stormy cloud around her head her scream was not because of any horror but was to alert her companions in a moment the whole motley crew would be in pursuit run mela cried she hoped the maenads would not discover the invisible path okra ran and the other two followed as closely as they could the maenads charged for them but did not take the invisible path instead they cut straight across through the brambles in a moment they were howling with pain as well as rage for they were getting sorely scratched it seemed that much as they delighted in scratching others they did not like being on the recelying end mela realized that if she thought about it she might remember others with similar attitudes so she didnt think about it it was working the wild women did not know of the path and it seemed that their sense of smell was not as acute as that of the ogress so they couldnt sniff it out so they thought that brambles were the only way they were fighting through them but losing ground soon the maenads were out of sight behind but the three moved on quickly despite panting with the effort to be sure that they were truly clear of the threat mela seemed to remember that snakes had acute senses of smell if the python happened by but their luck held and no monster snake appeared they slowed to a walk and continued up the slope of the mountain they seemed to have had a bit of the luck normally reserved for major characters as if the script had s ipped finally they came to what seemed to be the end of the path it ended in a blank stone cliff the cliff seemed to extend indefinitely to either side probably it circled the mountain so that they could not go around it they had to find a way up it maybe okra could bash some steps out of the stone ida suggested mela started to protest that that was impossible but remembered that male ogres could bash stone okra was a far cry from a male ogre but she had been able to nullify the dragons breath on the iron mountain so maybe it was possible maybe she can she agreed okra made a fist and pounded the stone tentatively a chip of stone flaked out she hit the stone again harder and a larger flake was loosened i can do it she said surprised maybe you just never tried it before ida said maybe i thought stone would hurt my hands im really not much as ogres go youre enough for us ida said warmly maybe you just never knew your own strength maybe thats right okra agreed staring at the damage she had done to the face of the cliff then she got serious she used both fists and bashed them alternately at the rock and fragments fairly flew out she was doing it in due course okra had made a crude stone stairway set in the rock like a relief carving she even made stone handholds so they could climb the stairs without the danger of falling off mela had never really appreciated ogres before but she was acquiring a taste for this one they wended their way up the stairs and reached the upper level of the mountain this was a slope leading directly to the gigantic tree at the top they were in sight of the tree of seeds they approached it cautiously they saw the tremendous bird sitting on a branch the rays of the late afternoon sun refracted from her feathers iridescently then the bird turned spying them mela was suddenly in a state midway between overwhelming nervousness and moderate terror and who are you who climb my moijntain uninvited the simurghs powerful thought came wewe are three maidens in distress mela said the great head turned and a piercing eye fixed on them you are no maiden mela merwoman you have been married and widowed h meant two maidens and a woman mela said falteringly we have come to tell you something important i have seen the universe die and be reborn three times the simurgh thought what do you think could be important enough to warrant my attention maybe nothing mela confessed but naldo naga sent us to you to tell you she hesitated fearing another overwhelming thought but the simurgh waited to tell you that roxanne is about toto eat che centaur there she had gotten it out somehow what the thought was so strong it almost blew the three of them off the mountain but mela tried again roxanne is i heard you brave creature i must certainly set this right but first let me learn more about you how came you to bring this message to me the three of us went to the good magician humfrey with our questions but instead of giving us answers he sent us to nada naga who sent us to her brother neildo naga who told us he would grant us our desires if we took this message to you so how did naldo naga know about roxanne his friend draco dragon had it from the winged monsters but they arent allowed to fly here or to interfere with your designs so just so what was your question for the good magician how can i get a good husband all i want is the handsomest nicest smartest prince to be sure the one you marry will also have a certain sense of humor mela frowned i suppose i can live with that if he has the other qualifications mela was developing a slow thrill realizing that there really was a husband for her she had begun to doubt he does now let me acquaint myself with your companions who are new to me the huge bird aimed her eye at ida mela saw the simurgh blink almost as if startled what could account for that ida was a nice but ordinary young woman pleasant company but without any evident magic what could there possibly be about her to surprise the wisest creature of xanth who do you think you are and what do you think your quest is ida made the effort to speak ih think i am ida i was raised among the otterbees i came to seek my destiny i dont know what that is but i hope its nice it is as nice as any destiny possible in xanth but it must wait its turn for you have things to accomplish first i do what are they it would be counterproductive to tell you at this point innocent damsel thats what the good magician said ida said sounding frustrated and grossclout demon naldo naga claims to know something but wouldnt tell us right away isnt this sexist or something or something the simurgh agreed with a wry curve of her beak but necessary her eye moved to fix on the ogress and you okra looked up at the bird i am okra ogress my quest is to get rid of jenny elf so i can become a main character and instead you must save her that may seem like irony that seems like nonsense okra said mela was alarmed fearing that the ogre girl would bring destruction on her head but the simurgh seemed not to take offense nevertheless this is your course unless you default now i shall seed you step close okra the ogress stepped closer to the simurgh i dont understand naturally not much of what i do i do through seeds first i seed you the simurgh turned to pull a scintillating feather from her wing she held this in her beak and brought it down to tap okras head mela could not see anything happen and could not fathom the significance of this action now i give you two seeds one is to give to roxanne hold out your hand the bird jumped slightly causing the tree to shake and a single round seed fell down to land in the ogresss outstretched hand this is a seed of thyme roxanne will understand its use now hold out your other hand okra obediently held out her other hand the simurgh shook the tree again and a cylindrical seed fell into it this is a rocket seed which will enable you to travel there with your friends step into it and go there now but okra started confused then mela saw that the second seed was growing it expanded until it was too large for the ogresss hand she had to set its flattened end on the ground but its pointed end kept growing it was assuming the form of a cylinder with a sturdy central section it was translucent so that they could see that it was hollow a cylindrical champer soon it was large enough to hold all three of them and it had a paneldoor in the side so the three of them slid open the panel and got into the seed it was crowded but they did fit the panel slid closed behind them the seed had become a prison but before mela could work up a decent fright the thing exploded gwendolyn goblin stared up at the giant bird they had walked right into a trap and were locked into the nameless castle with a righteously angry roc hat ever were they to do now scatter che cried it cant catch us all good strategy gwenny ran in one direction and jnny elf in another che himself leaped straight up fliked himself with his tail and flew farther up but gwenny saw that all three of them still sparkled slightly with the radiance of the egg they could not hide from the roc because that sparkle called attention to them even if they had been able to flee into a crowd the bird would have been able to pick them out the roc oriented on che first gwenny stood by the ramp and watched helpless and horrified and the terrible bird stalked him the roc was so big that it did not lieed to fly indeed there was little room here in the cistle chamber for that it merely walked stalking the tiny figure it this was surely a female bird because she was ggsitting they had thought her to be a statue now they knew that she had merely seemed that way and that heir touch of the egg had instantly awakened her this was an enraged mother bird che couldnt fly out of the castle because it was now sealed he couldnt hide in the small halls and chambers because these were now shut off all he could do was try to dodge and elude the huge awful beak of the roc but youre a winged monster jenny cried from the other side of the chamber all the winged monsters are sworn to protect che from harm she was right but gwenny saw with dismay that the roc was taking no notice evidently she had not gotten the word maybe that made sense she could have been sitting here for years out of touch with recent events so simply didnt know about the simurghs requirement and if she did not understand human speech they would be unable to make her realize that she wasnt supposed to eat the winged centaur maybe some other year she would learn but that would be way too late then gwenny had a desperate notion maybe she could distract the roc she walked back toward the center of the chamber she aimed her wand and concentrated on the lovely crystal egg it rose and hovered above the stone nest look roc she cried im taking your egg the birds head snapped around the huge eye fixed on the floating egg squawk so the monster did understand human speech well enough dont move or ill drop it gwenny said the roc took a step toward her gwenny shook the wand and the egg bobbled dangerously it will shatter on that stone gwenny warned if you take another step ill do it after all its my friends life im fighting for i i the bird considered rocs were not known for their imagination as they were bigger than anyones imagination but now gwenny saw a mental picture forming it seemed that the bird was trying to get the picture straight so that she would know how to act and at the moment the picture was somewhat tilted in the center of that picture was the shining egg precariously balanced above the nest to the side was gwenny with her wand in the picture the roc launched at gwenny snapping her up and swallowing her in a trice but the egg dropped on the hard place in another trice and shattered into one thousand and one glittering fragments the picture tilted worse and dissolved that was definitely no good the picture formed again of floating egg and standing goblin girl this time the roc launched at the egg trying to catch it before it fell that seemed more promising oh no you dont rocky gwenny cried moving the wand so that the egg sailed away from the bird the rocs picture tilted and dissolved it was replaced by one of herself somewhat fuzzy as if something was interfering with her thought her names probably not rocky jenny called she was able to see the mental pictures too because she had the other lens rockhead gwenny asked the picture fuzzed worse rockbound rockabyebaby rockfall rocking chair rocknroll the picture blurred into obscurity try female names jenny suggested rochelle the picture brightened roxanne suddenly the focus was perfect that was the name you are able to communicate che inquired he had landed at a safe distance then get her to talk about herself then maybe shell forget about chasing us good idea well roxanne gwenny said we didnt know you were alive we thought you were part of an exhibit we have to get the egg if i am to become chief of my tribe its nothing personal it doesnt look like a real egg are you sure you couldnt let us have it for a day or two then we could bring it back roxannes mental picture exploded into smithereens one smither zoomed so close that gwenny had to duck it seemed that the egg was not available for a loan but the egg wont be much good to anyone if it shatters gwenny said and ill drop it or loft it against a wall if i have to the roc moved sideways not approaching the egg but also not retreating from it gwenny didnt drop it because once it shattered she would have no hostage against the rage of the bird so they were at an impasse how did you come by this egg since i dont think you laid it gwenny inquired conversationally that set off a new picture roxanne was flying across xanth covering an ordinary landbound creatures hours travel with every wing beat she was young and her feathers were bright she saw a high mountain and flew to investigate it having the curiosity of youth what are you seeing che called a big tall twopeaked mountain gwenny called back with a temple at the base and a giant tree growing on the summit but thats mount pamassus che protested no ones allowed to fly there and on the tree sits a bird the size of a roc gwenny continued with iridescent feathers roxanne is flying right toward that bird thinking maybe its another roc thats the simurgh che cried the oldest creature in xanth she has seen the world end and be recreated three times she doesnt allow anything to fly in that vicinity roxanne heard him speaking her head cocked toward him then she leaped che tried to take off but couldnt get his wings properly set he tried to gallop away but the great talons of the rocs foot closed about his body gwenny and jenny screamed together then gwenny collected a few of her scattered wits let him go she cried or ill drop the egg she wiggled the egg with the wand roxanne refused to be bluffed her mental picture showed the egg droppingand right after that the little winged centaur being squished into purple pulp gwenny didnt dare drop the egg while che was all right but she certainly would if the roc hurt him so it was another impasse but now roxanne was in a better bargaining position than before the big bird carried che to a cage set high against a wall she popped him in and slammed the door closed with her beak gwenny saw che try the door but it was securely locked he could not get out he was all right but captive gwenny knew that if she shattered the egg the roc would simply go back and squish che so the impasse remained how was she going to get him free she decided to try the dialogue again maybe she would learn something that the roc wanted more than the three of them to eat roxanne what happened after you encountered the simurgh she asked the roc came to stand at the same distance from the egg as before however gwenny took the precaution of lofting it so that it hovered above the rim of the stone nest if it dropped there it would certainly shatter with half of it falling outside the nest she wouldnt have to guide it at all if she simply dropped the wand the egg was doomed it was evident that roxanne understood it was dangerous to go after gwenny herself however jenny elf was not necessarily safe jenny dont let the roc get near you gwenny called i wont jenny agreed she was hiding under the ramp where it would be difficult for the big bird to grab her the picture formed again young roxanne in her innocence was flying directly toward the simurgh the sitting bird glanced at her the picture filled out with increasing detail becoming a fullfledged dream so that gwenny found it easy to follow in fact it was as if she were experiencing it herself that was part of the nature of dreams they were magically easy to believe even when they made little or no sense so she seemed to be flying over mount pamassus she looked around and saw that the mountain was actually made of huge scrolls and books many were weathered with bushes and even trees overgrowing them so that on the surface they might not be evident but from this vantage they were well pamassus was known as the residence of the muses who were reputed to be literary folk maybe these were books they had written roxanne had no interest in the muses and less in books but was slightly intrigued by the fact that the tomes had accumulated into a mountain what a lot of waste effort the sitting bird twitched one feather suddenly roxannes wings lost purchase she flapped them wildly but they had little effect it was as if the air had stopped having substance so that she could not fly she barely made it to the ground without crashing after that she could not take off again no matter how hard she tried she was mysteriously grounded she was on the side of the mountain she had to move by walking which was embarrassing trees kept obstructing her and she had to knock them down what had happened to her she found a dool and waded in it to cool her feet then she dipped her beak and took a swallow the water was cool but it warmed her throat what kind of water was this then she identified the taste this was a wine spring tiny folk of the human persuasion appeared around the edge of the pool they seemed to be all female and very active they charged in and tried to attack roxanne well that made them that much easier to snap up a good meal was here for the taking she caught one in her beak and took a closer look didnt human folk normally wear clothes she must have misremembered because this one wore none maybe they had come to swim well it hardly mattered she dipped the one in the wine for better flavor then gulped her down she was as delicious as any giant worm so there was no danger of going thirsty or hungry here the wild women kept coming so roxanne kept swallowing them she had never had as good a meal this readily not since she had split a fat sphinx with her male friend rocky they had gorged until satiated i cant believe i ate the whole thing he had squawked that was an exaggeration he had eaten only half but she knew exactly how he felt they had been too heavy to fly and had had to sleep on the ground for several days before getting trim enough to resume normal elevation but it had been worth it that reminded her she spread her wings pumped them and leaped into the air only to flop back into the drink with a ferocious splash that nearly drowned several wild women who had been trying to hack off her feathers she remained ground bound and it wasnt from overeating something was seriously wrong she waded from the pool seeking a suitable roost for the night the wild women followed still trying to stlb her so she made a sweep of one wing and dumped them in a pile back in the pool then she made her way to a niche in the mountain found a suitable outcropping of rock and settled down to rest when the wild worm came at her again she spread her wings and flapped forward and the wind blew them back into the pool after a few times they realized that they werent getting anywhere and let her be now she had time to think how was it that her wings had the power to blow enough air to sweep the wild women into the drink while they couldnt lift her into the air they seemed to be functioning normally except when she tried to fly what could account for this offhand the most reasonable explanation seemed to be magic some kind of curse but how had such a thirig come about then she remembered that the other big bird she hztd been about to visit the one with the iridescent feathers had glanced at her then twitched one featherjust before roxanne fell to the ground that twitch could have been an enchantment that must be a bird with a magic talent but why roxanne had been innocently coming in for a visit why should another bird choose to mess her up like this that was where her thinking faltered it didnt seem to make sense she snoozed and when she woke it was morning she got up and went to the pool for a bath the foolish wild women appeared again and tried to interfere so she ate a few more and blew the rest away she finished her bath took another sip of the warmtasting winewater and strode to the bank she shook herself dry then spread her wings and tried to take off again she could not her wings beat the air furiously blowing up a great cloud of dust but she didnt rise it was as if she were tied to the ground she could not fly a large snake slithered into view a very large one rather than being a morsel for eating this was a potential enemy she set herself making ready to fight hold said the snake in bird talk i have not come to quarrel but to advise roxanne was astonished how is it you speak my language she squawked i am the python of parnassus he replied i speak all languages for it is my duty to guard this mount from intrusion the maenads inform me that you are causing them difficulty oh the wild women they taste good when dunked in wine i agree however they too guard the mount and should not be preyed upon too savagely lest the supply of them be exhausted that would deprive me of my tastiest morsels i must ask you to cease your depreciations on them i will gladly do so the moment i can fly away from this place i never wanted to stay here anyway but something funny happened to me on the way to visiting the roc at the summit that is no roc that is the simurgh the senior creature of xanth and the mortal realm she is the keeper of the seeds and she sits in the tree of seeds and protects the mountain from intrusion by air she allows no flying monsters here you intruded so she grounded you grounded me but i was only coming to say hello i didnt know she was so fussy about visitors now you know the python said well tell her to lift the spell and ill fly away i certainly dont want to associate with anyone so unfriendly the simurgh is not unfriendly she merely enforces the rule she lacks the patience to educate those who somehow remain unfamiliar with her edict you mean she wont let me fly again roxanne asked alarmed what a mean creature not mean merely firm ignorance of the requirement is no excuse but i cant endure forever on the ground roxanne protested im a bird i need to fly then you will have to petition the simurgh for a release from grounding perhaps she will be lenient considering your innocence so it was that roxanne made her way laboriously by foot up to the top of mount pamassus to petition the simurgh you must perform community service the simurghs powerful thought came when you have completed it satisfactorily you will be ungrounded what is this service roxanne squawked you must go to the nameless castle and hatch the egg there that seemed simple enough where is the nameless castle she asked the simurgh did not answer directly instead he twitched a feather suddenly roxanne was there the egg was beautiful but slow in hatching roxarine lost count of the centuries but was sure she was maktng progress toward her ungrounding she followed the rules of this service scrupulously she could eat only those visitors who approached close to the egg sometimes they came in bunches and sometimes singly when there were several she locked the extras in cages awaiting her appetite the spaces between such visits could be brief or long it didnt matter she snoozed betweentimes somehow it seemed to work out she was usually somewhat hungry but never starving it was not bad service actually but she would be glad when it was finally over gwenny was amazed you have been here for centuries roxannes thought reviewed the time scale yes there did seem to have been several centuries she slept so much and so deeply that it was hard to tell but who built the nameless castle who laid the egg what will hatch from it roxanne did not know it was not hers to reason why merely hers to do and fly to eggsit until it hatched that she would faithfully do because she did not want to annoy the simurgh again but che centaur is protected by all winged monsters by order ofthe simurgh gwenny said the same bird who sent you here for your community service you will annoy her something awful if you eat him roxanne knew nothing about that she had never left the nameless castle because she couldnt fly and had not questioned any of the intruders before eating them why should she take the word of an attempted thief that the simurgh had said not to eat him gwenny shook her head baffled the rocs thought made sense on her terms how was she to be convinced that she was mistaken then gwenny heard something it was a low humming perhaps singing the words not quite distinguishable the roc intent on gwenny and the endangered egg was not listening to it it was jenny elftrying her magic it worked only on those who were within hearing range but not paying attention so it wouldnt affect gwenny this time because her mind was right on things but it just might work on the roc if the rocs attention remained distracted from the elf gwenny saw the dream forming however because of the lens in her eye it was like a cloud over jennys head where she hid under the ramp within that expanding cloud a scene appeared at first vague then clarifying it was of a grassy glade with flowers in the foreground and misty mountains in the background in the middleground were glades and sparkling streams and all manner of handsome trees it was completely lovely as jennys scenes usually were gwenny wished she could step into that dream as she had so many times before but she couldnt afford to if she did she would lose concentration on the wand and the egg would drop and shatter leaving the roc nothing to do but destroy all the intruders immediately if she set the egg down first and stepped into the dream the roc could recover the egg and then hunt them down so she had to remain alert but she could watch it from outside this was a new experience seeing reality and the dream at the same time jenny appeared in the dream she walked among the flowers which was one of her favorite things to do being careful not to step on any she bent down to sniff a big purple passion flower carefully because girls were not supposed to get too much of that sort of thing not even those who had been inducted into the adult conspiracy sammy cat appeared in the dream he was snoozing in life near jenny he did the same in the dream there was even a dreamlet cloud over his head within the dream but its details were obscure probably he was dreaming cif himself dreaming of himself dreaming and so on each dream cloud smaller until they became pinpoint small and vanished roxanne roc appeared in the dream she looked sulprised she was surprised her own thought cloud showed it with a picture sliced diagonally one part was where she had just been in the nameless castle the other was where she was now in a lovely glade with an elf girl which one was she to believe why hello roxanne jenny said in the dream gwenny couldnt actually hear the words but she saw jenny talking and knew that was what she would be saying what am i doing here roxanne asked she could talk directly to jenny now because that was the way of it in her dreams all barriers between creatures were broken down and everybody got along harmoniously you are in my dream jenny said it is nicer than reality because everything is perfect here things wont be nice for me until i can fly again roxanne said why you can fly here jenny said amazed roxanne tried it she spread her wings and took offand sailed into the deep blue sky in a moment she was playing tag with a passing cloud it was wonderful but gwenny couldnt watch all of this jenny had given her a chance to get them free so she moved her wand and set the egg carefully back down into the nest then stashed the wand in her pack she ran across the chamber to the row of cages against the wall they were up above her head because though roxanne could not fly she was such a big bird that she could reach far up so gwenny had to climb up the wall that was no trouble because the wall here was made of roughhewn cloud stuff and was easy to grab on to also she remained fairly light because it had not been all that long since che had lightened her so that he could carry her up to the nameless castle she climbed glancing back to make sure that jennys dream remained effective she saw jenny by the ramp and roxanne sitting beside the nest and the dream cloud between them filled with its pleasant wonders the dream roc was looping and swooping in the air absolutely delighted for centuries she had been grounded for all that she was in a castle on a cloud in the air and she was reveling in her newfound flight she would not be eager to leave that dream in any hurry gwenny reached the bottom of the cages she hooked her fingers into their cloudstrand wire and pulled herself up to the front of che centaurs cage che she whispered how does this thing open it is tied by a fragment of a gordian not he said sadly a what a gordian not it is a magical knot that cannot be untied by anyone except the one who tied it the roc tied it so shes the only one who can untie it but then how can i rescue you you cant he said sadly nor can you rescue jenny i fear see whether you can find some way to rescue yourself ill do nothing of the kind she said indignantly youre my companion and nextclosest friend i must rescue you both she looked at the not maybe i could cut it i dont know whether that is wise gwenny glanced over her shoulder at the continuing dream scene jenny cant hold the roc forever ive got to act now if im ever going to you may be correct he agreed reluctantly gwenny hung on with her left hand and dug her knife out of her pack with her right hand she set the blade at the top of the not and began sawing through it the not screamed and flashed the light was almost blinding and the sound was a shrill keening that made the very walls shudder the roc snapped out of the dream she gazed wildly around catching on to what was happening then she leaped at jenny elf catching the girl in her huge talons before she could scramble around the ramp she carried the girl across to the cages flee che cried to gwenny gwenny let go of the cage and dropped to the floor her lightness made the landing tolerable she scooted off to the side avoiding the big bird she found a rocky region and dived behind a boulder meanwhile roxanne had opened the cage tossed jenny in with che and retied the gordian not now two of them were caged gwenny realized that she should recover her control of the egg it was the only way to restrain roxanne who really was trying to do her job misguided as it was in this case she ran toward the egg bringing out her wand but roxanne was already running toward it too and her steps were a whole lot bigger so gwenny aimed the wand but before she could loft the egg the roc reached it and threw herself on it she pulled cloud cord from somewhere and wrapped it around the egg and nest tying it with another gordian not it was now impossible to loft the egg it was anchored to the nest and the nest was anchored to the floor gwenny had lost her chance at it she should have used her wand as soon as she landed on the floor instead of mindlessly fleeing she had panicked and given up her last real chance to make an even fight of it that was hardly a chiefly thing to do not that she would ever get a chance to be chief so maybe she really wasnt qualified to be chief but she hated getting her friends into this disaster with her the roc finished binding the egg and turned her head to fix on gwenny then she pounced gwenny lofted the bird high into the air and over her own head she hadnt even planned on that it had just happened the huge creature hurtled like a stone and crashed into the opposite wall denting her tail her thought cloud showed a mass of squiggles and exclamation marks she was really confused well now maybe gwenny did have a chance because roxanne couldnt fly she was now helpless in the air the wand could control her maybe if she got bashed around enough she would give up the battle the roc righted herself and started for gwenny again this time she didnt leap she walked it didnt matter gwenny lofted her again and smacked her into another wall the third time the bird got smarter she extended her talons and drove them into the cloud stones of the floor when gwenny tried to loft her it didnt work because she was locked onto the floor she took one step and then another keeping one foot anchored gwenny thought of something desperate she ran toward the birds anchored foot roxanne surprised yanked that foot out of the floor so as to grab herand gwenny struck with the wand in that moment and lofted her high but this time she did not smack the roc into the wall it was her own turn to get smarter she held the bird aloft now roxanne was unable to move because she had no purchase and could not fly gwenny had captured her in a fashion but what was she to do with her captive she couldnt hold the roc there forever because she would have to sleep sometime apart from that she had to take the egg back to goblin mountain within a day and there was hardly enough time remaining for that even if she had her friends free and possession of the egg her situation remained desperate no matter what happened to roxanne a new cloud formed in the air between them whose dream was this but it didnt form a picture rather the entire cloud assumed a shape the shape became that of a woman a grown woman with a voluptuous figure and clothing designed to advertise every curve and contour then the face tonned and it was familiar metria gwenny exclaimed what are you doing here the demoness drifted to the floor eering at her the goblin girl she said i might ask you much the duplicate much the what alike identical double reproduction transcript replica remake same whatever she said crossly i am here on business i thought you were going home to be monarch gwenny elected not to correct the misnomer i am trying to but i had to meet my little brother in a challenge he changed the paper and i had to fetch what was between the roc and the hard place so we came here to fetch the crystal egg only were in trouble now thats interesting how soon do you think youll be through here if im not back at goblin mountain within another day nothing will matter so i guess ill be through in a day one way or another the demoness produced a notepad and pen and made a note im working for professor grossclout now setting up the special bleep and i have to survey exotic settings such as this one so ill report that it will be clear next year thank you a special what thats not a confusion its a censorship im not allowed to say anything about it i tried to sneak into it to find out because curiosity is my dominant emotion and i did see nada naga rehearsing but the professor caught me and no one ever told the professor no on anything so now i know all about it but cant tell anyone else its a phenomenal frustration well can you maybe help us while youre here che and jenny are locked in a cage and im lofting roxanne roc but its an impasse and i dont know what to do oh hasnt the rescue party found you yet what rescue party the one the simurghs going to send when she learns of this metria looked around it will be interesting to see whether she learns of it in time well toodleoo the simurgh doesnt yet know gwenny cried despairingly but the demoness was already fading out gwenny was alone again her friends remained caged and the egg was tied down there just didnt seem to be any chance to save them and the egg and get back in time she pondered and came to a conclusion she did not have to be chief she was not sure she was qualified for it anyway but she just could not let her friends be eaten roxanne she said i came here to steal your precious egg i admit that i would be willing to borrow it and return it but i dont think youll agree so now im ready to compromise let my friends and me go and well leave your egg alone the bird considered but roxanne had heard what the demoness said and now knew that gwenny was desperate her thought cloud showed gwenny falling asleep when the roc could then get back to the floor and grab her but you also heard that the simurgh does have an intetest in us gwenny said it seemed that roxanne dismissed that as irrelevant or as an attempt to fool her she would wait then ill bash you against the wall gwenny cried suddenly furious she waved the wand causing the bird to circle wildly in the air but she did not follow through because she feared that roxanne would sink her talons into the wall and so regain her footing which would give her the victory gwenny cast about for something else she saw the rocky region where she had hid for a moment that was a rock garden now she remembered that rocs liked rocky things such as rock candy rock music and rock gardens that must be the birds private garden ill mess up your rock garden gwenny said roxanne squawked that had gotten to her let my friends and me go gwenny repeated but the roc wouldnt so gwenny walked back to the rock garden which she saw was composed of rocks of several sizes ranging from large to huge she pushed against one but it was too heavy for her to budge they all were well she could use the wand she brought it aroundand the bird gyrated oops if she used it on a rock she would have to let roxanne go and that would be disastrous she couldnt make good on this threat either gwenny sat on a rock baffled the guilty sparkle that stained them was finally fading but that didnt make any difference now two of them were caged and the third was mostly helpless she felt tears starting what was she to do okra ogress reached out and grabbed mela on one side and ida on the other holding them steady as the rocket seed capsule exploded fire and smoke billowed out all around them and the capsule shook as if grabbed by a giant then slowly it rose in the air mla and ida were frozen with their eyes welded closed but okra of course lacked the wit to do that so she was pec ing out through the transparent seed casing she saw the capsule rise up through its own smoke which was coming from the bottom end of it and bouncing off the ground it went up higher than the great tree of seeds and headed for an innocent cloud floating above the cloud affrighted tried to scud out of the way but the rocket seed was too swift for it the capsule caught the edge of the cloud and knocked the cloud into a spin rain sprayed out as the cloud lost continence it did not lo k pleased now the capsule was headed up toward the sky fire aiid smoke still thrusting from its base ogressguile the craft the simurghs thought came point it it the nameless castle but where is the okra started then she saw a panel and on the panel were several little pictures some were of mountains one was of a mountain with a big tree at the top like mount pamassus another had goblins swarming over it that would be goblin mountain another was flattopped mountain rushmost another showed creatures sleeping mount everrest several more pictures were of castles one had a zombie by it castle zombie another had a grumpy old gnome by its turret the good magicians castle another was in a lovely orchard castle roogna and one was perched on a cloud okra pondered a moment and thought for another moment and cogitated for a third moment and considered for a fourth moment at that point her head was beginning to overheat so she knew she would have to stop that meant that she would have to take the fourth choice the castle in the air that had to be the nameless castle correct ogress now set the indicator there there was a glowing dot at the moment it was in the middle of the sky but it was too small to be the sun okras arms were both busy holding her companions in place so she used her nose to nudge the dot across the panel to the nameless castle the capsule veered wildly as the dot changed position but steadied on a new course when the dot was left on the nameless castle okra hoped that meant that the capsule was now headed for the right place correct part of your task is done part of it whats the rest of it okra asked but the simurgh did not answer probably she had more important business to attend to why should she care about a minor character ogress except as a momentary tool to accomplish a purpose the craft as the simurgh had called it was now flying horizontally across xanth okra pondered that a moment and managed to translate the key word into one she understood level the craft was flying level instead of up the land of xanth was zooming along below they seemed to be flying northeast back the way the griffins had brought them but faster soon okra saw lake ogrechobee again her home region seemed so different from above she had never dreamed that she would go so far or have such adventures when she set out to achieve main character status there was the kissmee river she must have paddled up but the craft did not follow the river north it continued northeast across the jungle just as the great sea to the east came into sight the capsule slowed the fire stopped belching from its tail and it coasted to a halt on a cloud it bounced and lay still it had arrived okra removed her arms from her companions relax friends she said were there she slid open the panel and fresh air waited in but dont stray far were on a cloud a cloud ida exclaimed as she drew herself out of the compartment how can that be the rocket flew to the nameless castle which happens to be on a cloud okra explained she poked a finger into the cloud stuff testingly it seems strong enough to support usand the castle mela emerged brushing back her hair with one hand i thought we were being incinerated she confessed other things being equal id rather drown but merfolk cant drown okra protested precisely they stood and looked at the castle it was as white as the cloud itself with cloud gray shadows it was large enough for a tribe of ogres okra wondered why it didnt weigh down the cloud and make it sink to the land below but of course it was magic and magic didnt have to account for itself to anything else roxanne must be inside mela said she must be a meanspirited woman if she is going to eat a centaur maybe shes a demoness ida suggested or an ogress okra said most of them are more ferocious than i am mela frowned that brings to mind a possible problem if roxanne likes to eat folk what is to stop her from eating us but we are bringing her the seed of thyme ida said so she shouldnt eat us but she seemed uncertain would the simurgh have sent us here if we were only to be eaten okra asked mela smiled faintly reassured no i think she expects us to find a way around the problem maybe we could use the seed of thyme ida said to protect us until we can give it to her then maybe she wont want to hurt us but how do we use it mela asked well okra was seeded which i suppose must mean that she was given the seeds until she could pass one on maybe she can use it the way she used the rocket okra looked at the seed still in her hand she had no idea how to use it maybe you can invoke it mela suggested thats the way some magic objects are used okra held the little sphere up before her i invoke you seed of thyme she said nothing happened but of course you still have to make it do something mela said tell it to do something thymely thyme speed me up okra said still nothing happened any more ideas she inquired neither of the other two answered they stood as if frozen not even blinking what was the matter with them okra walked to the edge of the cloud and looked down xanth lay below with the edge of the sea in sight nothing seemed to move there either then okra realized that if she had speeded up but the others hadnt it might be this way slow me down thyme she said mela and ida blurred into action their voices came like the quacking of frenzied ducks one zipped out of sight then back what a change in them but there was a change in the rest of xanth too in the distance the sun nudged on toward the horizon as if impatient to be done with its days work the gray shadows of the castle grew longer she could see it all happening oh xanth hadnt really speeded up she had slowed down too far make me normal again thyme she said must tell it to speed you up again mela was saying please okra we dont have much time im back okra said oh wonderful mela said first you got blurry fast then you were like a statue it must be the magic of the seed of thyme yes okra said so if roxanne attacks us we can just speed up and get away from her i wonder whether it also affects others ida asked it seems me that if it can affect one person it might affect another okra tested it thyme speed ida up and slow mela down ida became a blur of motion mela became a statue quick thyme change them back okra said ida slowed to normal and mela quickened to normal the three compared notes and concluded that the seed of thyme could indeed affect others that means it can slow roxanne down without affecting us ida said that might be the best way mela looked at the castle maybe we should slow the whole castle down she said so that if roxanne is about to eat che she wont do it before we come in to rescue him okra faced the castle seed of thyme slow everyone in the nameless castle down she said nothing seemed to happen but they realized that that was deceptive they walked up to the castle the drawbridge was up and the portcullis down the moat was full of water and they did not quite trust what might be in it but okra solved that water slow down the water froze they walked across the frozen surfae but how were they to get into the closed castle there were no low windows and the door was firmly shut maybe you could bash a hole in the wall ida suggested the way you bashed steps into the cliff okra made a fist and tried a tentative bash she managed to chip off a flake of cloud stuff this stuff doesnt seem tough but it is she said it will take me some time to bash a hole in it i dont think we have a lot of time mela said then speed us up ida added so that we can get into the castle quickly okra speeded the three of them up then she started bashing the work was slow but they had plenty of time because she was actually working quite swiftly she bashed a dent in the cloud wall and then a depression and finally a hole then she put in her hand and yanked out more around the edge widening it until it was big enough for them to crawl through they did so and found themselves in an empty cloud chamber the door was closed but okra pushed it open when they passed through it slammed closed again mela tried the handle but the door was locked it seemed that it would open only from the inside now they were in a small hall its walls were made of cloudstuff as was everything else here they followed it until it debouched into a medium hall and followed that until it emptied into a large hall that hall proceeded on into the depths of the castle making the acquaintance of other halls of its size and accepting the tribute of smaller halls this was one huge castle they came to another closed door this time they fetched a cloud couch and used it to wedge open the door so that they could return this way without having to bash the door down then they moved on out into what appeared to be a huge dining hall to which every other door was closed its a good thing we are speeded up mela remarked because otherwise we would not be getting anywhere fast maybe the folk here are upstairs ida said for they had seen no sign of any person other than themselves that seemed to make sense they looked for stairs but wherever they were was sealed behind another door so okra piled chairs on the dining table and stood on them so that she could reach the ceiling then she bashed a hole in it this too took time but there was no other way when the hole was big enough okra drew herself up through it she was on the floor of a monstrous chamber there in the center of the chamber was a huge pedestal supporting what looked like a nest floating above the nest was a roc bird what was going on okra helped haul mela and ida up into the upper chamher the three of them remained speeded up while the creatures in the castle remained slowed down so they did not have to hurry they stood beside their bashed hole and surveyed the situation roxanne ida exclaimed shes the bird rocsanne on the floor below the bird was a rather pretty goblin girl holding a wand the wand was pointed at the bird as if holding the roc at bay to the side were several cages and in one of the cages was a winged centaur and an elf girl the centaur would be che whom they were supposed to save from getting eaten the elf would be jenny okras eyes narrowed that was the one who had taken her status as a main character she certainly didnt look like much she was big and ungainly for an elf and her ears were pointed in a way okra hadnt seen before and her handsshe was missing one finger of each hand what had happened to her more important what could there be about this odd creature to make her worthy of major character status that must be gwendolyn goblin with the wand mela said i think i once heard something about a magic wand the goblins had that would move things around so maybe shes been moving the roc away from her so she wont get eaten and the roc caught the other two before ida agreed maybe we should free them first then we can bring the goblin down through our hole and take them all out before we give roxanne the seed of thyme that made sense to mela okra wasnt sure about releasing the elf but decided not to argue they had to complete their mission for the simurgh so that they could return to naldo naga and gain their quests they went to the cages these were set above the floor but it was easy to climb the rough wall to reach them okra went up and found that the cages were tied shut she tried to untie the knot but it wouldnt budge so she bit through it instead the knot screamed but she didnt care how it felt it should have let her untie it in a moment she had it severed and the cage door open then she took the loose cord left over from the knot and tied it around the body of the winged centaur in a crude harness she carried him out and dropped him down using the rope to prevent him from falling mela and ida caught him below and guided him to a place on the floor it was surprising how slowly he fell through the airbut of course he was falling at the nominal rate which seemed far slower than it was they untied the rope so that okra could pull it up now for the elf okra was tempted just to toss her out without the rope but she knew that mela and ida wouldnt appreciate that of course she might make a mistake and tie the harness just a little too tight who would know it hadnt been an accident but she discovered that no matter how hard she tried she couldnt make the harness too tight her hands insisted on doing it just right what was the matter with her then she realized that it was because of the same thing she resented about this elf her status as a major character no major character could suffer anything truly bad they could be frightened and get into extremely awkward sitnations but they always somehow got out of them the irony was that it was okra who was getting jenny elf out of this awkward situation she had to help her enemy because of the power of the magic that jennys illicit status had how disgusting so she carried the elf to the edge and let her gently down resenting it all the way she would have to find some other way to be rid of her okra jumped down then carried the two creatures in turn to the hole in the floor again she let each down while ida went below to remove the harness finally they took the goblin girl and lowered her down to join the others all three were safe because the roc bird was far too big to fit through the hole now it was time to deal with the roc ida remained with the three below while mela and okra made ready to brace the big bird if roxanne tried to attack okra would slow her down again but they needed to be in the same time frame now okra held the seed of thyme slow us down to regular speed she told it that was the wrong directive the huge bird formerly hold aloft by the goblin girls wand and only now beginning its slow fall dropped to the floor with a featherdenting plop she blinked and looked around okra realized that roxanne had just been dealin with lit i a goblin girl with a wand and now faced an ogre girl instead well she might blink she might think that the one had changed into the other but in a moment she would realize that the wand was gone she did she pounced on okra slow her down okra told the seed then the ioc was frozen in the air just before her talons were able to close on okra okra walked around to the birds rear mela had been standing to the side now she went to hide under the ramp that led up to closed doors its your show mela said keep getting behind her until she pauses long enough to listen suppos she doesnt understand me okra asked then were in trouble we may just have to leave the seed of thyme here with the roc in slow motion and hope the effect wears off after we are safely away from the castle okra thought about that let me test it she said she set the seed down immediately the roc resumed motion she bounced on the floor her talons closing on air okra hastily picked up the seed again and the bird stopped moving now she knew the seed obeyed only the one who was holding it if they tried to leave it behind roxanne would get it and be able to slow the escaping party down and they would all be in her power we are in trouble mela said okra had another notion seed speed the roc up to about threequarter speed ogres couldnt do fractions but she was distressingly lacking in stupidity and did understand them it was one of her several secret shames the bird finished her bounce and skidded along the floor then realizing that she had missed her prey she got her balance and looked around her motions were moderately slow as if she lacked urgency at regular speed they would have been alarmingly fast roxanne okra called we must talk the bird turned set herself and leaped again at okra this time okra walked away and roxanne missed the slowdown was just about right okra now had better reflexes and could avoid the pounces we must talk okra repeated but the bird would not listen she continued to go after okra thinking she was just about to catch her speed us up mela said well have to talk with the folk we just rescued so that we can get them to use the wand for us then well be able to suspend the bird in the air again and make her listen good notion okra speeded them up and the big bird went still they climbed down through the hole to where the other four waited its been such a long time i was getting worried ida said thats because you remained in fast speed mela said we slowed down to normal speed to try to talk to the roc but she wont listen so now we need to consult with these three to see what they know that might help us okra stood before the three speed them up she told the seed of thyme the three became animate oh where are we the elf girl said okra saw that the elf was holding a cat somehow she hadnt noticed before maybe she had more ogreish dullness than she thought how did i get down here the goblin girl said who are you the winged centaur foal said all three of them seemed somewhat confused that might be because two of them had been in a cage a moment before by their perception and the third had been facing the roc i am okra ogress okra replied this is mela merwoman and this is ida human she indicated her companions we have come to save you and to give the seed of thyme to roxanne roc but roxanne wont listen to us the centaur seemed to reorient most swiftly as was to be expected you used magic to conjure us out of the rocs chamber this seed of thyme okra said showing it we made it speed up our time so we could rescue you without the roc stopping us but now we need to talk to her jenny can do that che said but the castle remains sealed so unless you can persuade her to let us go it may be pointless well maybe she will let us go in exchange for the seed mela said we brought it to her but we dont have to give it to her until were safe i think and the simurgh did want her to understand that you are not to be hurt yes the winged monsters are supposed to protect me che agreed because im a winged monster too but roxanne has been eggsitting here for centuries so didnt get the word im glad you came we do need help but we cant just go without the egg gwenny said and well need to travel very swiftly jenny said because gwenny has to take the egg back to goblin mountain tomorrow then she looked uncertain or maybe today we cant be sure how much time has passed now okra frowned she wasnt here to help the elf were just here to save the centaur and give the roc the seed of thyme but i am gwendolyn goblins companion and i am here to help her get the rocs egg che said so if i am to be saved gwenny must be helped mela frowned that doesnt sound quite like centaur logic well im not a grown centaur it is centaur foal logic and jenny is my friend and shes giving a year of service to the good magician to help me in my quest so she must be helped too gwenny said otherwise she wont be able to meet her commitment im sure thats not what the simurgh said okra said but as it happens you need jenny che said okra almost choked i dont need the elf i want to be rid of her shes right jenny said because i got the character she wanted okra stared at her you know i learned and i didnt even seek it i didnt know there was a choice being made i just got lost following sammy and showed up here maybe i should go back after i finish my service to the good magician okra was getting to dislike her less she turned to the centaur why do you say i need the elf because her cat can find almost anything including what you might need and jenny can talk to roxanne with her dreams okra had to admit that those were adequate recommendations so we find out how to settle with roxanne and set you three free she said grudgingly then we go we shall need your help also to get to goblin mountain in time che said the simurgh surely sent you for this reason too yes that makes sense ida said okra about to disagree found herself agreeing she was getting as confused as the rest of them well lets get this done she said so jenny elf went up to the rocs chamber with them there she did her thing which turned out to be a sort of stupid humming or singing okra soon lost interest and looked around the chamberand found herself abruptly in another world this one was very pretty even to an ogres perception with hard gray mountains on the horizon turbulent storm clouds in part of the sky and big gaunt irorlwood trees in the foreground how had she come here she was the one with the seed of thyme so she couldnt have been slowed way down and moved she would have had to be moved a long way because this scene was on the ground while the nameless castle was on a cloud in the air in fact she saw the castle on one of the clouds in the distance who had conjured her to the ground jenny elf and her cat were also there how did this happen okra asked her i did it jenny said its my talent youre a sorceress okra exclaimed no only an elf girl i can imagine a nice place and anyone who hears me sing and isnt paying attention can join me in it but whats the point okra demanded we need to talk to the roc thats right mela said appearing because now im in it too but this isnt getting our business done when roxanne appears well be able to talk to herin this dream jenny explained so where is she okra asked looking around well her attention has to wander before she can come in but we talked to her before jenny looked around also funny she isnt here yet though oh i just realized mela exclaimed shes still in slow motion or were in fast motion it will take ages for her to join us okra glanced at the seed maybe i can speed her up but if i do could she eat us instead of joining this dream im not sure jenny said well lets find out okra said satisfied to make jenny squirm seed of thyme make roxanne join our speed but mela and jenny said together then the roc appeared hey im here again she said she spread her great wings and launched into the sky hey roxanne jenny called we have to talk to you the roc looped about who has to talk to me okra ogress there jenny said okra realized that jenny had done it back to her this might be a dream world but could the roc eat a person here well then ill eat her first roxanne said i dont know how you got out of the cage but this time ill make sure of all of you you wont escape after ive eaten you she oriented on okra and swooped down okra lifted the seed slow her to three quarters of our speed she said the birds wing beats slowed she lost elevation faster than she wanted to she had to pump harder to avoid crashing into the ground even in a dream that might hurt what have you done to me she squawked even her words were slow i used the seed of thyme to slow you to threequarter speed okra replied i can slow you further if you dont behave the roc landed bumpily on the ground and hopped toward them her hops were slow and she seemed to hang longer in the air than she should it would be easy to avoid her what is this seed of thyme she asked still speaking in a somewhat measured manner the simurgh gave it to me to give to you but you must free your captives and not try to eat them and you must give us the egg jenny called never roxanne cried the simurgh sent me to eggsit and i must protect that egg until it hatches but we need it jenny said you cant have it i know the simurgh would never have given it to you it did seem odd to okra that the simurgh would send a roc bird to protect the great crystal egg then allow it to be taken to a mountain of goblins why do you have to have it she asked the elf because gwenny goblin has to fetch what is between a roc and a hard place or she wont get the chance to be the first female goblin chief and the egg is whats between the roc and the hard stone nest you cant have it roxanne repeated okra realized that there might be something else here is the egg the only thing in the nest it must be jenny said we saw it yes thats all i allow in the nest roxanne agreed what about stray feathers okra asked jenny looked at her astonished why that would count too maybe we dont need the egg still you tried to steal the egg roxanne said so i must eat you but you cant eat che centaur okra said no winged monster can nobody ever told me that roxanne said as far as im concerned hes a thief too and deserves to be eaten but if we took only a feather and promised never to return jenny said then no you tried to take the egg but suppose we gave you the seed of thyme okra asked would that make you change your mind i dont want to slow myself to threequarter speed roxanne said but with it you could make yourself any speedor anything else any speed okra said it is a very powerful thing that is why i am able to stop you i just change your speed to something that cant hurt me if you had it you she paused realizing the rocsized significance of it you could speed up the egg until it hatches and you would be free free roxanne exclaimed excited and all you have to do is let them go with a feather okra said will you do that it was evident that even a firmly mindset roc had her price if that is all yes then lets get out of this dream and fetch that feather jenny said but okra was more cautious truce she asked the roc truce the bird agreed but if you try to steal the egg again ill eat you jenny clapped her hands creating her own distraction and the dream vanished they were all back in the rocs chamber they could no longer talk with roxanne but the bird understood them well enough ill go get the feather mela said you dont want to get in range okra just in case that made sense mela walked to the egg roxanne approached it also but did not try to attack actually she was still at threequarter speed which helped mela looked in the nest theres no feather here she said oh there must be jenny cried in anguish maybe something else okra asked nothing but an old shed claw mela said a claw will do if its been between the roc and the hard place okra said mela hauled out the claw it was as long as she was a talon like a long sword come to think of it this must always have been between the roc and hard places because every time she lands on a mountain or the floor or the nest or picks up a stone or a bone this claw was between her and it once she lost it its been in the nest she faced roxanne is it all right to take this the bird nodded it wasnt as if she didnt have plenty of other talons then will you let us go if we give you the seed of thyme okra asked reluctantly the bird nodded again and you know that if you break this agreement youll be in trouble with the simurgh okra asked because shes the one who sent us here roxanne jumped it was obvious that she didnt want that the simurgh had given her a way to get free whenever she chose why should she throw it away by angering the simurgh anew so mela hauled the talon away struggling with its weight and okra walked to the nest and put the seed of thyme in it immediately the time became normal for all of them her commands no longer applied all you have to do is hold it and tell it what to speed up or slow down she said maybe you had better test it before we go to make sure it understands you roxanne came to the nest reached inside it with fter beak and brought up the seed she tucked it under a wing feather and squawked suddenly she was a blur of motion light flooded irito the chamber the bird had activated the seed and speeded up or made the rest of them slow they were now at her mercy then things returned to normal motion mela jenny and okra stood unharmed the bird had not taken advantage of her power over the seed to eat them she had only tested it fortunately then well go now okra said roxanne nodded they climbed back down through the hole and then walked out through the open castle okra carried the talon which was too heavy for mela to haul for long soon they came to the front gate and crossed the drawbridge which was now down for them roxanne had opened everything during her trial with the seed okra had wound up helping jenny elf too okra hoped she would not regret this foolishness it was unogreish for one thing and it still didnt help her achieve her desire to become a major character che was amazed at recent developments one moment he had been in the cage the next he had been in the downstairs chamber with his friends facing a buxom merwoman with legs a surprisingly small and unugly ogress and a young woman whose identity he had almost mistaken but he had been able to reorient rapidly as was proper for a centaur because he had seen two of them in the tapestry they were mela merwoman and okra ogress even as he placed them they were introducing themselves and the third who turned out to be ida human they had been sent by the simurgh to save gwenny goblins party for the simurgh was the original winged monster who had declared that che would someday change the history of xanth and should be protected to facilitate that the ogress had brought roxanne roc a seed of thyme that had proved to be a bit complicated but now it was done and all six of them were on their way back to goblin mountain because che realizing that they could get there in time only with the help of the other three had used juvenile logic to persuade them he would not be abl to get away with that when he grew to be an adult bul he wasnt there yet except for the business about the adult conspiracy which perhaps he could pretend to forget for a few more years it really didnt apply when centaurs werent with humans or crossbreed humans so was of limited concern centaurs preferred to fetch their progeny directly not trusting innocent babies to the carelessness of storks now they stood at the edge of the cloud the nameless castle behind them the day was waning and circumstantial evidence indicated that it was their second day of this quest they had perhaps an hour to get back to goblin mountain he hoped their new companions could enable them to do it will all of us fit in the rocket seed mela asked she wore what che recognized as a freudian slip which tried to slide around to reveal a peek at a truly intriguing panty she also wore freudian slippers which tended to set her feet down where her legs showed a bit too much there was surely an interesting story behind her attire surely we will ida said optimistically its such a big seed now che saw the seed to which she referred it was a big cylinder with translucent sides and a panel it lay on the edge of the cloud he doubted it would hold six folk in any event what was the point they didnt need to cram into a seed they needed to travel swiftly the ogress went to the seed and hauled it up so that it pointed toward the sky pile in she said gruffly che could see that she was not enormously pleased about this association and she especially did not seem to like jenny elf well she had reason it was a real irony that the simurgh should have required the ogress to help rescue the elf did the simurgh have a mean streak they piled into the big seed and lo it turned out to be even larger inside than out and they all did fit then the ogress slid the side panel shut she did somethingand fire and smoke billowed all around the seed and hurled it up off the cloud now the fire and smoke seemed to be coming from the base of the seed blasting out and down as if eager to get away from it well that was better than having it try to burn up the seed maybe that was why the seed was moving so swiftly to escape the fire jenny and gwenny were hugging each other terrified but mela and ida were taking it in stride che looked at the ogress and saw that she was looking at a panel on which were several pictures one picture was glowing a messy pocked rubble heap of a hill that would be goblin mountain he looked out through the transparent side the seed leveled off then zoomed across xanth headed inland che peered down realizing that though he still seemed to be standing upright with the others all them were actually lying flat with respect to xanth this was most interesting magic the cloud bearing the nameless castle had evidently traveled a fair distance during their stay on it because they were not traveling west but northwest he saw the isle of illusion and the gap chasm and dragon country ahead was the smoke of the element of fire but that was beyond their destination was the ogress overshooting the mark then the rocket seed dropped down already arriving at goblin mountain they were going to be there on time it came right at the mountain frightening the goblins on it che almost laughed as he saw them scatter into their holes the seed came to rest in sight of the mountain okra slid the panel open they were there gwenny got over her fright oh how wonderful she exclaimed as they piled out and stood beside the seed you have done me such a favor we did it because of the good magician mela said and nada naga and her brother naldo and the simurgh we are each supposed to have our questions inswered when were done so now well go back to find naldo and hope that he makes good on his word oh naldo will gwenny said he came to help us when the goblins fought the winged monsters because of the alliance he doesnt like goblins at all in fact his peo ple and ours have been at war for centuries but he did it hes the very best creature okra made a wheezing sound che glanced at her whats the matter just my asthma okra wheezed i must have changed altitude too swiftly it will pass in a moment but che was alarmed you mean you have an illness i okra coughed weakly it comes and goes it makes my breath clog up so i lose my strength ive been lucky recently and hardly felt it at all but now it has caught up with me we must get a cure for you che said no it will pass she repeated im surprised it hasnt caught me more often since i left home maybe ive just been moving around so much that it hasnt been able to keep up so maybe it just lay in wait for me here and caught me she coughed again wheezingly you must get on to the mountain with your prize she laid down the rocs talon which now seemed to be too heavy for her to carry che didnt like this but knew she was right gwenny had to get promptly to goblin mountain i hope you get better soon he said you have been a real help to us im sure youll think of a way to get rid of it ida said with her characteristic optimism that would be nice okra agreed making an effort to smile mela and ida and okra climbed back into the seed and pulled the panel closed che and the girls quickly retreated knowing that the fire and smoke would come again goblins were reappearing at their holes and gwenny waved them back but nothing happened the seed capsule just lay there after a while the ogress slid open the panel it wont go slw reported gruffly she still looked weak and worn and her voice was faint maybe you are not yet done with us che suggested yes that must be it ida agreed climbing out it did seem to make sense so they remained a party of six for the nonce and gwenny led the way to the mountain they started toward the mountain the sun was almost singeing the trees to the west there was just time to make it before the day ended so that gwenny would not be disqualified suddenly a monster loomed up on the path before them it was massive with the head of a stag but with a single black horn in its forehead it had four elephants feet a boars tail and the body of a horse it lowed challengingly che happened to be in the lead he stopped this was certainly a monster but not a winged one so it could be a threat to him were only passing by he said halooo it bellowed in its low voice you must pay to use my path gwenny stepped forward i know you hugh mongous monoceros youre always lurking around trying to take what isnt yours this isnt your path this is a goblin path who says the monoceros demanded i say she said he thumped the ground with an elephantine toe the ground shuddered who are you i am gwendolyn goblin soon to be chief of goblin mountain now get out of the way before i move you out ho ho ho it is to laugh you cant move me out you skirted goblette you must pay gwenny brought out her magic wand she aimed it at hugh mongous one of his forefeet lifted uhoh she said the monoceros laughed again ho ho ho is that the best you can do you cute morsel whats the matter che asked the wands weakening she said ive used it a lot today on the roc and such and after a while it loses power and has to recharge overnight the monster is now too heavy for it che looked at the sun which was hastening to end the day they could not afford to be delayed long is there another path we can take yes but it will take too long this is the only direct one from here so youre stuck goblette hugh mongous said pay this is outrageous gwenny said stamping her little foot we have to get through immediately we shall just have to make a deal che said disgusted he faced the monoceros what is your demand i demand that you pay me something for using my path something interesting and different such as maybe that magic wand never gwenny said okra ogress came forward maybe i can help she gasped no you cant gwenny protested youre not well let me try ive been trying to think because that heats my head and sometimes helps clear my throat and i may have found an idea ida clapped her hands maiden style wonderful okra i knew you could do it che kept silent that foolish optimism could become wearing in time okra faced hugh mongous i have something that you might consider to be interesting and different she wheezed do you want it what is it the monoceros asked my asthma it makes me wheeze che had to clap a hand to his jaw to prevent it from dropping could the ogress be serious what a wonderful idea ida exclaimed brightly there it was again she was thrilled about anything at all it does the monster asked somewhat stupidly how loud can you wheeze okra took a labored breath then forced it out wheeeeeez i the creature would never fall for this meanwhile they were wasting precious time che was disgusted ill take it hugh mongous said this time che did not manage to catch his jaw in time that creature was even more stupid than an ogre then okra straightened up extending a hand here it is she said no longer wheezing she set an invisible something on the monsters nose wonderful the monoceros wheezed satisfied it moved out of the path and let them pass they could hear it happily wheezing as they left it behind as a stupid person you are a complete failure che murmured to the ogress i know okra said sadly they moved rapidly to the mountain the goblins stared at the three additional folk but did not attack them because they were with gwenny all three were twice the height of any goblin but gwenny chose a tunnel that was large enough to accommodate them they trouped to the central chamber there were gobble and his henchmen the brat was holding a soiled harpy feather he had found the old wives tail and figured he had won he was just waiting for the day to end without gwennys reappearance it was a joy to see his crestfallen look as they entered the chamber godiva entered her expression was the opposite of the brats you have returned my daughter she exclaimed hurrying across to embrace gwenny behind her were the three male goblins who had served her loyally for years moron idiot and imbecile che had gotten to know them and they really werent bad sorts for goblins when the children had wanted to sneak n tsoda popka to substitute for ugh healthy drinks these three had always been willing accomplices godiva had been aware of this but elected not to make an issue because she was unusually liberal for an adult she thought children should be allowed to have a little bit of fun if it wasnt overdone so while godiva was hugging her daughter the three halfway decent goblins came across to congratulate che and jenny and to meet their new companions these are moron idiot and imbecile che said those are their names and theres nothing odd about them that was so the women wouldnt laugh then to the goblins and these are mela merwoman ida human and okra ogress who are here temporarily until their rocket seed is ready to move again see that no one messes with it right moron said hurrying out the other two remained looking at mela che realized what was happening mela he murmured straighten out your slip the merwoman quickly adjusted the freudian slip which still conspired to give stray males flashing glimpses of her panty che would have to speak to godiva who was an excellent seamstress to see about making mela a regular dress after all suppose underage goblins saw it wasnt as if it was a dull panty its pattern was a most intriguing crisscross of colors that would surely madden the mind of an adult male but wheres whats between a roc and a hard place gobble demanded recovering some impudence right here gwenny said gesturing to okra who still carried the rocs talon but thats just an old claw its supposed to be the fancy egg it was in the stone nest under roxanne roc gwenny said evenly it was between the roc and a hard place it qualifies but that wasnt what i meant he protested i meant the egg gwenny stared at him how could you mean the egg if you didnt write it and if you wrote it you cheated because you werent supposed to know what the challenges were gobble was silent realizing that he could only get himself into trouble so okay you got it but youre not home free sis tomorrows the physical combat physical combat che exclaimed appalled girls dont do that yeah so she loses gobble said with satisfaction he glanced darkly at the three male goblins with gwennys party and after that ill deal with you traitors then he slunk out of the chamber i knew there were three challenges like the ones for getting into the good magicians castle gwenny said know the first consisted of merely being qualified to assume the chiefship which narrows it down to gobble and me the second was performance which we have just finished the third is physical but i thought that just meant building something or showing i could hold a club combati fear that is beyond me but hes just a little brat okra ogress said you could club him with one fist no i couldnt gwenny said im a refined goblin girl and we are never violent in that way it simply is not our nature if we could fight we would not be nice and there would be no point in having a female chief to make the goblins nice che saw the logic but gobble cannot be trusted he said we must check the original document where is it written how the chiefship is won gwenny took them to a small separate chamber there in a chest to which she had the key was an old dirty scroll she brought it out and they read it it was indeed the list of rules for the succession hi che said as he read it there is a combat but its a combat by selected champions gobble and me gwenny agreed glumly no by champions you select so you dont have to fight yourself you merely choose a tough goblin to fight for you and if he wins so do you gobble wont fight himself either hell have someone bigger and meaner but no male goblin will fight for me gwenny said they dont want me to be chief che pondered that does present a problem he said stumped for a solution but im sure you can solve it ida human said brightly because centaurs can solve almost anything then oddly che did get a notion but maybe a female could fight for you he said goblin girls are all nice but thats not necessarily the case for the females of other species ill fight for you jenny elf said no jenny no gwenny said you would be no better than i because youre not mean or tough shes right che said i meant a female from somewhere else tough enough to do the job but who would that be gwenny asked the females of other species really dont care much about goblin politics in fact they dont care much about goblins period i dont know che admitted but i know how to find her well tell us jenny said because theres less than a day to get her here i cant say it directly until certain arrangements are made che said because a certain party has been known to take off without warning seeking what has been mentioned oh jenny said glancing at her little cat sammy come here the cat did and she picked him up and held him firmly but with aa certain device i can see where he is going and suppose the one we want is far away che asked you could not keep up but i think i might he looked at the goblin girl gwenny do you have any light cord something that might tie a very light person to another so that he might be hauled along at whatever velocity is necessary gwenny nodded she hurried away imbecile help me fetch the cord she said and that goblin immediately followed her but suppose he goes through some small hole jenny asked we can frame the search to exclude that sort of thing what are you folk talking about mela asked jennys cat can find anything except home che explained so if we ask sammy to find something and i follow him well find it i will be away for a while on that search but gwenny will see that you three extra visitors have a room and food for the night perhaps tomorrow your rocket will be recharged and you can be on your way we do appreciate the way you have helped us and regret that it has diverted you from your quests thats very nice of you ida said but it seems that our quests are linked to yours and that when you have yours fulfilled then ours will be too i still dont know my destiny he shrugged perhaps maybe you are a lost princess and your kingdom will find you after this is over or maybe shes someones twin sister mela said and her twin will find her and theyll live happily ever after or maybe shell turn out to have a sorceresscaliber magic talent okra suggested just waiting to be discovered oh if only any of it could be true ida said clasping her hands with longing but first we must help gwenny if we can and im sure you can do it che because you are so smart and talented che tried to resist the obvious flattery but it did buoy his confidence maybe this desperate ploy wasnt as farfetched as he feared gwenny returned with some twine this is spider cable she said it is very light but very strong they wove the threadlike twine into a harness that fit about ches body then they made a smaller harness at the other end of the silken line for the cat now the two were innly linked che flicked himself several times with his tail making himself so light he almost floated but he did not try to fly i am ready he announced jenny put the cat down on the floor sammy where is there a female creature who can and will be gwennys champion she asked who can be safely reached by one of us it was a good thing she had remembered to add that last the cat took off che found himself being hauled along bumping the floor and walls but he was so light that the bumps were not uncomfortable they were zooming through the goblin tunnels then out of the mountain and away to the south where were they going not the way they had before when they sought the nameless castle then he remembered something he had forgotten to ask godiva goblin to make a better skirt for mela merwoman oh well maybe he would be back at goblin mountain soon and could do it then soon they were passing the elf territory a startled band of flower elves stared as they whizzed by the elf elm that reminded che of the strangeness of jenny elf with her pointed ears fourfingered hands and huge size for the normal xanth elf was a quarter the height of a human being while jenny was more than half human height matching or slightly exceeding goblin stature she had come from a world unlike xanth and might someday return to it after she completed her service to the good magician that reminded him of something else he had been the closest of friends with jenny for two years ever since she had accidentally crossed into xanth while following sammy she had been a great comfort to him in his time of need and a great companion since then along with gwenny goblin he privately hoped that she would never return to her world of two moons but even if she did not there was something that was bound to separate thetn for the three of them were growing up already they had been inducted into the adult conspiracy and had acted to enforce it on the obnoxious gobble goblin as adults they would have to start going their own separate ways for that was the way of adults so jennys year of service would be only the start of the separation their idyllic juvenile association was doomed by one thing or another that was the tragedy of becoming adult perhaps someday he would understand where it was written that compatible childhood associations should be sundered in favor of new associations with adult strangers darkness was closing it had been late when they returned to goblin mountain and it was later now che would rather have retired for the night but he had to do what he could to help gwenny because if she did not win that final challenge she would be dead and the hope for a kinder gentler goblin tribe would be gone it was his destiny to change the course of the history of xanth and this seemed like the way to do it for this would eliminate the scourge of the goblins in one region of xanth and perhaps sow the seed of a change in other goblin tribs goblins were taken as a whole one of xanths worst scourges along with dragons tangle trees and individual menaces such as fracto the cloud and compewter and the demoness metria so it would be well worthwhile to change the nature of the goblins they passed through the land of the dragons actually all xanth was the land of dragons but they were especially thick here che couldnt see them because it was dark but he could see their plumes of fire it seemed that several dragons were toasting a cloud that had tried to sneak in under cover of night clouds could be very foolish he was bumping worse and realized that some of his weight had seeped back as it did with time he flicked himself again lightening up then sammy leaped into a void it was the gap chasm what was the fool cat up to but ches lightened body now served as a brake so that the cat did not fall at full speed they descended to the depth of the chasm sammy landing neatly on his four paws and che hardly touching then they were off across the floor of the chasm it was a good thing that the gap dragon didnt hunt at night che was probably safe but sammy cat might have been chomped the cat found some sort of path and bounded up the other side che kept himself light so that he wouldnt pull sammy off the steep slope near the top che judged they plunged into a deep cave this was amazing he was sure that gwenny didnt have any friends under the ground on and on they went through caves and passages and caverns at one point they even hurdled a subterranean river sammy couldnt be looking for one of the callicantzari could he or a demon neither of those types would care to support anything like decency in the goblin succession at last they came to much larger caverns illuminated by glowing fungi sammy bounded to a chamber set in the wall of this region and came to a sleeping serpent he stopped this is it che asked this big snake the snake woke it looked at them then it formed a lovely human female head without changing the rest crt its body why che and sammy the head said whatever brings you here nada naga che exclaimed suddenly it made sense this was one formidable female creature who had an interest in better goblin relations the naga folk had even made an alliance with the human folk to help contain the goblin menace to their own tunnels that was how nada had once gotten herself betrothed to prince dolph we need your help quickly he explained nadas human head nodded i see your need che and i would really like to help but i have another commitment i must devote my frill energy to rehearsing for the xanth game that the muse of history is about to write about if i took time away from that i might not do as good a job and if something should happen to me they would have to train a whole new companion and that would be awkward companion he asked a bit blankly i am gwenny goblins companion yes thats the same type of thing as you know it is not necessarily an easy thing to be you wouldnt take a day off from being gwennys companion would you no for he had agreed and a centaur never went back on his word but it is to save gwenny that i am here we need a female to fight for her so that she can be chief and sammy led me here to you if you cant do it she wont be chief and the goblins will kill her and gobble will be chief and theyll be worse than ever oh we cant have that she said believe me che i do want to help and ordinarily i would because the goblins are a worse bane to my kind than to your kind but i am under contract to the demons and i must fulfill it however sammy did not lead you falsely i can refer you to one who should be able to help you more effectively than i could if you can answer one question what question is that why do you seek a female to help gwenny because no goblin male will help her so it has to be he paused realizing his error oh this is horribly embarrassing i made an uncentaurly assumption it doesnt have to be female were not looking for a goblin but any creature who is capable and willing to support gwennys cause nada smiled she was lovely when she did that even with her serpentine torso in fact she was lovely when she did anything gwenny goblin was quite pretty and mela merwoman was physically luscious for all that he was to young to notice but nada was beautiful it was easyo appreciate why prince dolph had loved her even at a young age so my brother naldo should serve your need naldo che said seeing it naldo naga was trained in combat and had even directed the defense of goblin mountain when it had been under siege by the winged monsters he was no friend of the goblins but there was an ancient convention that united the ground monsters against the winged monsters and he had honored it he knew gwenny and her mother godiva personally and he certainly wanted the goblins to reform themselves where is he sammy bounded off but che stretched out his hands and caught the sides of the chamber door the spider cable went taut holding the cat back i didnt say to find him sammy he said i was asking nada then to her you see we used up much of the night getting here and our champion has to be there at noon tomorrow if we go searching all over xanth for him we may be too late for gwenny perhaps i can arrange help she said then to the air professor grossclout may i disturb you a moment a horrendous demon appeared what mushhead dares disturb my repose he thundered then he looked into nadas beautiful face oh its you my dear che realized that nadas perfect features had the power to soothe even the worst of demons that was fortunate professor nada said winsomely my friends che centaur and sammy cat need to be transported quickly to my brother naldo because grossclout gestured negligently suddenly che and sammy were in a dragons nest a dragon and a naga were rolling bones in some kind of game such games were notorious they could last for days and nights and this one seemed to be no exception the dragons near eye widened as he spied che im a winged monster and so are you che said quickly why hello che the naga said he was naldo of course draco wont eat you after all he knows you and is sworn to protect you it is obvious that you are here on some sort of business or did you come to join the game that was right it had been several years since draco had visited the winged centaur family and dragons tended to look somewhat alike to che but now he recognized the firedrake he quickly explained again yes certainly i will be gwendolyns champion naldo said i shall be glad to facilitate the succession of the first female goblin chief he glanced at the bones but first i must finish my game here but the champion must be there by noon never fear ill be there goblin mountain is not all that far from here and i can travel rapidly in my large serpent form just put out a direction sign indicating exactly where the match is to occur and i will appear promptly at noon thank you che said i will return now with the good news how do i get out of this cave for he could see that the nest was in a closed cave with a lake at its base i will take you out and to the ground naldo said hang on che got on the serpentine back and hung on as well as he could naldo slithered out of the nest down the vertical side of the cave and into the lake che held his breath and hoped sammy was also holding his breath as he was dragged along at the end of his tether in a moment they were out of the water and in another moment out of the cave and then naldo was slithering down the clifflike mountain slope to the ground he really knew how to travel in this body tell them i am coming by invitation not invasion naldo said as they stood on the ground so we dont start another war ill do that che agreed then naldo slithered back up the mountain and che set sammy on his back and set off at a lightfooted gallop to the north the cat could not lead the way for they were in effect going home now from the place they had started anyway sammy was surely very tired after his wild run past the gap chasm for that matter che himself was tired he had gotten no sleep and he was still young enough to need it but he had a job to do and he would do it he moved as fast as he could never pausing knowing the way to go he could rest after he got there with his message of hope gwenny would be so pleased as dawn came che reached goblin mountain the sentry recognized him and let him pass but after noon youll be horsemeat you little winged freak the goblin said pleasantly che went to gwennys suite where idiot stood guard the goblin seemed glad to see him i hope you got someone good idiot said cause it wont be nice if gwenny loses that was surely the understatement of the day i did che said and knocked on the door gwenny opened it garbed in her nightie oh che youre back she cried hugging him naldo nagas coming at noon he gasped to be your champion put out a sign saying where the contest is to be then he found a pile of pillows waiting for him and collapsed into them he was asleep almost before he landed but knew that the girls would take care of things da was worried it was almost noon and naldo naga had not yet shown up it wasnt that she didnt believe him but that she feared that something could happen to delay him and that would be disastrous the contest was to be held in the main chamber of the mountain where there was plenty of room for both the combatants and the bloodthirsty spectators it was even possible for some of the lady goblins to peek in from the doorways gobbles champion was already there a horrendous male ogre who was gnawing on a pile of bones while he waited for the fun to begin gobble had promised him a years supply of bones if he won and of course he expected to win moron idiot and imbecile formed a tight group near gwenny they were armed now with goblinsized clubs and looked ugly ida knew this was because they were afraid they were going to have to use them but they were a pitifully small group compared to the hundreds of goblins who surrounded gobble do you know him ida asked okra no he is from the ogrefenogre fen okra replied my tribe hasnt had much contact with them in the past few centuries i understand that they are fierce uncivilized and crude in short the very ideal of ogredom i realize that ogres are justifiably proud of their strength stupidity and ugliness ida said it must be a horror being of their number then she paused suffering a new idea or is it possible that your tastes could run to what is typical for your ogre kind suddenly i can see the sense that would make yes thats the kind of male i like okra said there had been a time when her taste was different but she had evidently matured during her travels and now the notion of a brute male appealed but of course one like that would never notice me because im not strong stupid or ugly well i must admit that youre not stupid or ugly but you were strong enough to bash a hole in the wall of the nameless castle ida reminded her that was because of the seed of thyme which gave me time to bash as long as i needed i couldnt do it otherwise and you breathed so hard that it stopped that dragon on the iron mountain ida said well then i had the madcap on that entirely changed my nature i couldnt have done it in my normal state ida nodded i suppose youre right you dont have the qualities a regular ogre would like but i have to say that those same deficiencies appeal to me too bad youre not an ogre okra said gazing longingly at the male ogre noon neared and still naldo did not appear gwenny looked nervous are you sure you told him here at noon she asked che who had dragged himself up from his slumber for this occasion yes you did have a sign put out for him yes moron made it it said chief challengegoblin mountain let me go check that mela said she walked away to the crude whistles of the goblins and some cries of get out of here fishtail then her freudian slip slipped around to flash a naughty glimpse of her panty and the goblins went silent freaked out it served them right moron went with her to show her where the sign was his eyes had been where they belonged straight ahead must ask godiva to make her a new skirt to cover both her freudian slip and plaid panty che murmured beside ida she could only agree gobble marched into the chamber surrounded by his henchmen well sis wheres your champion he demanded obnoxiously hes on his way gwenny replied well hed better be here at noon or you forfeit wont that be awful haha and the henchmen joined him laughing coarsely mela returned someones changed the sign she said indignantly now it says chief challengemount everrest mount everrest gwenny exclaimed but thats far away from here he must have seen the sign and slithered off to the other mountain ida said realizing what a dastardly deed had been done he cant possibly get back here in time its another one of my brothers horrible tricks gwenny said devastated but then we dont have a champion jenny said noon gobble cried exultantly come on smithereen time for the bashing okra standing beside ida jumped the jump wasnt noticed by anyone else in the general hubbub but ida wondered what had caused it so she inquired why did you jump smithereenthats the ogre i was to marry he was on his way south when i fled home oh then you have met him halfway thats nice but i ran out on him okra said he wont like that maybe he doesnt know since he hasnt yet reached lake ogrechobee that seemed reasonable the ogre crunched the last of his bone and tramped to the center of the chamber me bash make hash he grunted pounding his hairy chest with his ham fists then he lifted his club from the harness on his back and waved it in the air ida was disgusted but she noted that okra was licking her lips tastes certainly did vary so wheres your champion gobble demanded if hes not here smithereen gets to crunch your bones first sis the horror of it was that he wasnt joking because it was the nature of goblin males to be awful and the nature of ogre males to eat folk gwennys life really was on the line you changed the sign gwenny accused him so what so show your champion or forfeit gobble said exultantly it was obvious that he had planned exactly what had happened the girls had been trusting while the brat had cheated without hesitation ida could see that it really would be better for the goblins to be ruled by a female chief ill have to do it myself gwenny said bravely ive got the wand at least hey no wand gobble cried thats magic at a distance thats outlawed oh no hes right gwenny said looking ill you mean he can cheat and you cant mela asked i didnt catch him cheating in time gwenny said she handed the wand to godiva no you cant jenny elf said ill do it instead she stepped out into the center hey foureyes is coming in gobble cried only now shes bat blind instead what a show she cant see okra asked her spectacles were lost and she didnt have time to get new ones che said she can see in a special way but that wont help her against the ogre mela glanced at okra sadly it seems that your desire is about to be granted youll be rid of jenny elf suddenly okra strode forward she caught the elf by the collar and hauled her away from the arena get out of here girl ill do it astonished ida tried to protest but this isnt your quarrel okra you dont care about the goblin succession and you have good reason not to help jenny elf and you cant fight smithereen either none of us can yet even as she spoke the idea was growing that maybe it was possible okra bent to pick up the roc talon they had brought its a dirty job but somebodys got to do it she walked out to meet smithereen the male ogre stared who you he demanded i am okra ogress whom you were supposed to marry instead i am going to bash you into oblivion okra said she poked at him with the point of the talon it was evident that smithereen didnt recognize the name he might never have been told or he might have forgotten since bad memory was part of ogre stupidity hoho you no o he said grabbing the talon in a ham hand okra was jerked off balance she was only half his size and lacked muscle she was obviously no match for him gobble and the henchmen were doubling over with laughter what a silly filly gobble exclaimed shes no filly shes an ogress che muttered and a brave and selfless one then ida got another idea the madcap okra she called thats what you need okra heard she reached into her pack and pulled out the cap she jammed it on her head ho ho smithereen roared fat hat but okra was changing her body seemed to be growing larger and hairier and her face uglier she was enraged sneer he at she she jerked on the talon pulling him forward then pounded a fist into his belly smelly belly she screamed ooof pooof smithereen gasped surprised the blow had evidently had a good deal of force never underestimate the ire of an ogress scorned che murmured intrigued idas belief increased after all okra had fought the dragon the madcap made all the difference perhaps even more so than usual for okra had seemed to like the ogre and it might be reversing the power of her liking turning it into hating as che observed women did not like to be scorned now smithereen was catching on that there was after all some opposition he straightened up forming a ham fist he lifted his massive club whose mass seemed to be almost as much as okras whole body he swung it viciously at her head but okra stepped back and swung the talon it met the club and stopped it ida realized that the talon itself must have magic to enable the roc to land on the toughest surface with all her weight and not break a nail and to hold on to whatever it touched it made a good weapon then okra took the offense she swung the talon bashing his arm out of the way then stabbed him in the chest with the point the thrust wasnt strong enough to impale him but it did make him stagger back she followed up with another stab this time at the head but smithereen did know how to fight he swung his club around again and when okra countered with the talon he reached down with his free hand and grabbed her by the hair he lifted her into the air her cap tilted crazily but remained in place hey thats a foul jenny elf cried there are no fouls in this type of combat gwenny said morosely she seemed not to have phenomenal confidence in the outcome okra heard that no fouls she asked i can do anything i want thats right hairface gobble answered whatcha going to do kiss him and he rolled over again with laughter and his henchmen with him to a brat his age kissing was contemptible okra hauled up both knees and bashed the ogre in the chin he fell back dropping her she landed neatly then used the talon to stab between his legs she wedged it around so that it made him stumble and fall then she leaned over him taking the talon in both hands she was using her hidden advantage and fighting intelligently suddenly gobble got nervous she was actually making a fight of it haha jenny elf cried getting into it your ogre cant match that madcap madcap gobble exclaimed thats magic he ran into the arena behind okra made a terrific leap and grabbed the cap from her head hey ida cried outraged thats cheating you cant interfere so whatcha going to do about it girlface the goblin brat demanded tossing the cap to a henchman without the madcap okra lost her furious power and initiative she stood there over the fallen ogre as if riot knowing what to do next in a moment he would jump back up and pulverize her she couldnt even give him her asthma because she had already given it to hugh mongous the monoceros you can do it okra ida cried desperately believing che could only shake his head optimism was about to collide with reality then okra threw herself down on smithereens body her face landed on his face she put her mouth to his mouth shes doing it mela cried astonished shes kissing him for a moment smithereen lay still then he threw okra off clambered to his feet and opened his huge ugly mouth ugh ugh he cried and charged out of the chamber the goblins gaped huh gobble asked intelligently then ida caught on she did what you said she called she kissed him and he couldnt stand it he fled and okras the winner she beat your champion yet ida realized that this had been a sacrifice for okra because she would rather have made smithereen like her instead of being revolted by her she had thrown away whatever chance she might have had to get together with him gobbles mouth dropped open no fair he cried but gwenny seized the moment its fair there are no fouls she beat him by disgusting him so much he fled he lost and she won and you have lost and i have won now i am chief no he cried despairingly gwenny whirled on the henchmen now you will obey me or be banished arrest gobble stunned the henchmen stood still but moron idiot and imbecile strode eagerly forward ready to do their duty no shes just a stupid girl gobble cried as his henchmen blocked off gwennys three goblins you cant obey her kill her now that makes me mad okra said she lifted the talon and strode toward gobble the henchmen scattered at her approach you cant be mad gobble said you lost the madcap i i i dont need the madcap to be mad at a sniveling brat like you okra said she caught him by the collar and lifted him into the air much as smithereen had lifted her she brought the talon around no no he screamed waving his stubby arms and legs helplessly dont kill me dont kill me why not okra demanded you were going to kill gwenny but shes just a stupid girl well so am i and youre just a bratty boy okra retorted she aimed the point of the talon at his face gobble burst into tears this is what you want to be chief okra asked the henchmen she let gobble drop and turned away she had made her point one by one the henchmen turned to gwenny you are chief one said we dont like it but we must obey you thank you gwenny said as if the issue had never been in doubt she faced gobble get out of here brat i hereby banish you from goblin mountain if you ever return the first goblin who sees you will kill you or suffer the consequence himself gobble got up and attempted some bravado you cant do this ill get you if you dont leave immediately i might change my mind about letting you live gwenny said evenly the brat hesitated then okra took a step toward him gobble quickly fled gwenny acted as if the brat had never existed morol she snapped moron came forward somewhat apprehensively yes chief i appoint you head honcho gwenny said all these henchmen will answer to you you will keep order in goblin mountain and report to me alone gee moron said abashed we have to report to that slug a henchman demanded incredulously then he sailed into the air ida saw that godiva was using her wand you have a problem with that gwenny inquired the henchman sailed over a stalagmite near the edge of the main chamber and hovered over the sharp stone point nno problem the goblin said quickly are you sure gwenny asked sweetly the henchman descended toward the stalagmite butt first quite sure he muttered i dont think i heard that gwenny said the goblin landed on the tip no problem he bellowed i am so glad you got the point gwenny said only then did he nudge off the stone column and come to rest gently on the floor rubbing his posterior for some reason none of the other henchmen expressed any problems either idiot gwenny said and that goblin came forward i am placing you in charge of intelligence uhwhats that word idiot asked blankly spying she said you will make sure that there are no spies in goblin mountain you will give any you find a bath a bath you will keep a big pot of water here which you will heat to boiling she expla ned for the bath he began to get a glimmer he glanced at the henchmen but how will i know whos a spy thats easy it is anyone who says a word against the new chief or any friends of the chief or who does anything that might reflect adversely on goblin mountain might what look bad she clarified dirty deeds dirty words actually those henchmen already look sort of dirty to me he said and i think i heard a dirty word in the mouth of one of them he glanced meaningfully at the one who had said then set up the pot and give them a cold bath she said that should clean them off use soap to wash out their mouths if that doesnt do it heat the water im sure they will unprove as it warms ida saw that gwenny had a fair notion of how to enforce her leadership probably her mother had instructed her idiot set about the job with gusto a huge kettle floated in no doubt assisted by godivas wand goblins started carrying buckets of water to dump into it and bars of soapstone there would not be much spying in goblin mountain after this day imbecile gwenny said and the third goblin appreached i am appointing you the foreign relations officer you will make arrangements to meet with representatives of the other folk of the neighborhood such as the flower elves the griffins and especially the naga we are henceforth going to live in peace with them all in peace he asked amazed and cooperation we may even trade goods with them if any doubt i will go personally to clarify the new order a new figure appeared it was a huge snake it formed a handsome human head hear hear it exclaimed naldo naga che exclaimed you found us a bit late i am afraid naldo agreed there was some difficulty with a sign i turned around as soon as i realized where is the opposing champion he departed gwenny said that was smithereen ogre oh that must have been the one i saw crashing through trees and mountains i asked him where he was going and he said he didnt remember so i asked him where he was coming from and he said he was fleeing a cute ogress that was me okra said i beat him by kissing him yet she looked sad rather than happy naldo glanced at her he said that ogress wasnt very ugly or stupid but she had a secret weapon that destrfyed his will to fight i think you impressed him oh okra said thrilled naldo turned back to gwenny so it is done yon are now chief of goblin mountain yes thanks to you gwenny said you sent fvlela ida and okra to rescue us and then okra won the final challenge for me i owe them all so much and you too i dont think so naldo said i believe the scales are even now but without their help i would never have made it bear with me naldo said if you will allow me to explain i think i can satisfy everyone he glanced around and if you will post a lookout i am expecting another person shortly she should be treated with respect by all means gwenny sent a goblin off to keep an eye out for the person then they gathered in a corner of the chamber so as to be away from the clamor of the ongoing goblin bath naldo coiled his serpentine body and addressed those around him these three he said indicating mela okra and ida herself came to the good magician humfrey to ask their questions instead of answering he sent them to my sister the princess nada naga who sent them on to me when i talked with them i realized why the good magician acted as he did and i did what i had to do i i you sent us to the simurgh ida said and she sent us to rescue che centaur you said you would grant all our wishes if we did precisely now i shall do that naldo looked at okra it is your desire to become a major character yes okra said and you did give me the chance i see that now but i threw it away because i didnt get rid of jenny elf you saved me jenny said i would have been destroyed but you stepped in and beat the ogre you sacrificed what you perceived to be your own welfare for the sake of one you didnt want to help naldo said to okra why did you do that well it just wasnt right to have a blind person fight an ogre okra said and i saw that gwenny did need to be chief so i just had to do it i know i messed up but i guess i just didnt want to get what i wanted that way but maybe its not so bad being a minor character maybe i can work something out with smithereen maybe you can naldo said but that will be another story in this story you do achieve your desire okra okra shook her head confused ida was confused too i told you i gave it up okra said and i told you that you didnt naldo said it may have been true that there was an opening for a particular major character and that jenny elf got it but new openings occur all the time the thing is they are not just given out to those who want them if that were true every mundane would be overrunning xanth wed have mundanes clogging the drains so few have the chance and fewer are called i saw that you had a chance but only if you qualified and the only way you could qualify was by doing something noble so that others would want to see you as a major character that is why the good magician did not answer you he knew that you did not want the thing you asked for and that you could achieve your true desire only if you acted appropriately without knowing its significance you could not act unselfishly if you knew the reward for it you had to remain ignorant until your chance came i gave you that chance and it seems you came through you earned your status i did okra asked bemused you acted selflessly and did a truly good deed at great risk to yourself you saved jenny elf and won the chiefship for gwendolyn goblin in those actions you became a major character he bowed his head briefly i salute you okra ogress and congratulate you on the charmed life which will now be yours can this be true okra asked dazedly jenny elf went to her oh yes thats the way it works she kissed okra on the cheek jenny knows naldo said she routinely does similar things she is about to go to give a years service ti the good magician which she undertook on behalf of her friend gwenny decency and generosity are the hallmarks of major characterdom perhaps the two of you can be friends now oh im sure they can ida said enthusiastically as the two looked at each other and you ida human naldo said turning to her you may be the most remarkable case ive seen you sought your destinybut your destiny was beyond your dreams you too had to remain ignorant if you were to achieve it so the good magician also declined to answer you instead he gave you the same chance he gave okra but what is my destiny ida asked as bemused as okra had been naldo turned to che centaur what do you think it is he asked why i dont know che said surprised but you have an idea come oni know you do because i see it reflected in ida you have conjectured well we only made idle guesses che said when i was about to set off to find a champion we speculated how she might be a princess or somebodys twin or have a sorceresscaliber magic talent but it didnt mean anything it means everything naldo said firmly i suspected it the moment i saw her but i couldnt figure why the good magician had declined to tell her so i assumed that the two aspects of three were fixed but that the third required special handling just as was the case with okras major character status that premature telling would spoil it so i postponed answering until i could verify itand now i have ida is all those things what ida squeaked thrilled and appalled a princess a twin with a strong talent ive never shown any sign of i asked a friend to come here naldo said after she made sure it was safe of course she should be arrlying just about now indeed the posted goblin appeared behind him was a cloaked figure it seemed to be a woman her face could not be seen behind the thick veil yet she looked oddly familiar she came to stand before naldo remaining anonymous ida naldo said your destiny was to be all the things you ever dreamed of being it was your talent which confused me but now it can be revealed first the other two he nodded at the anonymous woman meet your twin sister who was as surprised by the news as you are ida opened her mouth but could not speak she actually was a twin but who is she che asked the woman lifted her veil the others stared they look almost alike okra said so they do naldo said but there are those here who know our visitor the princess ivy of human xanth godiva exclaimed now ida stared the princess ivy ivy took her hand then embraced her i did not believe it at first but now i do she said we finally verified it on the tapestry the stork tried to bring two but lost one and i was the only one who reached castle roogna i never knew so you are princess ida naldo said and now your talent and the reason the good magician declined to identify it it complements ivys talent of enhancement but is even more subtle your magic is that of the idea as your name suggests when you get an idea it comes true every time ida said she was sure something would work it did mela exclaimed she even suggested that okra don the madcap so she could beat the ogre ida realized that it was true she had come to beliee that okra had a chance and then okra had won evn without the madcap she had believed that che would firld a champion and he had even if gobble had managed to mess that up everything she truly believed in had happened but that must be xanths most powerful talent godiva said she could make anything happen just by deciding that it should no naldo said it is obvious that it has never been that easy for ida because her talent has a crucial liability the idea has to come from someone who doesnt know her talent but she didnt know her talent mela said correct that was vital because it meant that she could get ideas on her own and make them come true now that she knows her talent she can no longer do that and none of us here can do it either because now we know her talent so it will continue to be just as tricky to invoke it as it has been before but when it is invoked it is certainly of sorceress caliber as befits a princess but the good magician che said surely he knew surely he did naldo agreed as did the demon professor grossclout and the simurgh but they also knew that ida would not achieve her destiny unless someone who did not know suggested it they also knew that her talent was needed to help rescue you che and to enable gwenny to become chief because ida is a nice optimistic person inclined to believe the best of people and situations without that special type of support your prospects would have been bleak indeed but now the important things have been accomplished and it is only fair that ida know her own nature he turned to her you will be going home to castle roogna with your sister now youyou recognized me ida said when the demon professor conjured us to dracos nest i thought i did he agreed i thought you were ivy then i realized that you werent but that you were so very like her that something special was going on so i started investigating and gradually it came to make sense but you could not be allowed to know until you had seen gwenny through to victory the matter was too important to be risked every person who recognized your nature had to conceal that knowledge until the time was right yes ida agreed faintly she turned to ivy but was i really your twin sister before someone thought of it i mean if it is my talent that makes things come true its true now ivy said we no longer need to worry about what might have been or what might not have been or how any premature revelation of your talent might have changed things thats beautiful mela said im so glad for you ida i hope we can still be friends even if you are now a princess and okra and i are just people of course we can ida exclaimed going to hug her and the ogress im sure it makes no difference then she had a painful second thought except that if my own ideas dont work now friendship is not an idea its a personal choice godiva said you will remain friends if you want to be oh i want to be ida said then a third thought came but you melawhat of your quest you havent found a husband and now i cant get the idea that you will yes it is time to address that matter naldo said i promised all of you fulfillment and now it is mela merwomans turn mela for the record exactly what kind of husband do you seek oh nothing much she said abashed just the smartest handsomest nicest most manly prince available who wont mind my swimming in the sea often and who likes raw fish and who will help me brush out my hair some folk seem to think there is something wrong with a tail or with greenish tresses but which is why the good magician sent you to my sister naldo said and she sent you to me and why you wore that freudian slip and slowed me the color of your panties i must admit that very nearly freaked me out but i knew i had to wait until the rest of your quest was done and your friends had achieved their desires mela blushed a solid plaid you saw my panty but there was more to her blush than that she was evidently foolishly smitten with naldo just as okra was with smithereen just a wee glimpse he said but that was sufficient i know that you are the sexiest crossbreed human in xanth which defines my own simple desire in a wife he changed to his human form and stood there as an extraordinarily handsome man i am the one you seek prince naldo naga until this moment xanths most eligible bachelor i will marry you mela and fulfill your dreams even as you fulfill mine i have no objection to a pretty tail having one myself he changed briefly back to his naga form and i do like to swim on occasion and eat raw fish especially with compatible company i shall be happy to help brush out your greenish hair if you will wear that slip and those panties and sit in my lap while im doing it he shot her a glance that nearly violated the adult conspiracy oh yes mela exclaimed swooningly my sister has been trying to marry me off for years the prince confided and she has at last succeeded come i shall kiss you now and seal the betrothal ida could not even marvel at his assurance because he was a prince and he had been instrumental in helping them all complete their quests he was horribly smart yet as it turned out he had had a nice reason for making them work for their answers mela could not have found a better match she too would become a princess because she would marry a prince all because of that freudian slip and her fancy panty who would have thought that the color of her panties would be so important mela seemed ready to faint but she managed to stave it off because there was just too much to appreciate in the conscious state ida saw that prince naldo was indeed the most intelligent handsome nicest unmarried prince in xanth it hadnt been clear before because he had never shown them his human form but now it was impossible to doubt melas dream had been realized the prince took mela in his arms and kissed her they made xanths loveliest couple even if they were both in human form at the moment only the goblins seemed bored then the freudian slip flashed a glimpse that nudged the male goblins across the line into freakdom naldo drew back half a smidgen and gazed into melas oceanic eyes how do i love sea he asked rhetorically let me count the waves the merwoman seemed about to dissolve she had been warned about his humor a hand touched idas arm she turned to find princess ivy there come sister we must take you to castle roogna to meet your family ida realized that she had indeed achieved her destiny they all had jenny elf reported to the good magicians castle i am here to do my years service she said magician grey murphy was there but youre in the wrong place he said this is the authors note the what never mind youre supposed to be in your own chapter in the main body of the narrative no the story is done gwenny goblin is chief of goblin mountain and che centaur is helping her okra is a major character ida is a twin princess and mela is showing naldo naga her two very fine beware of the adult conspiracy he said worried her two very fine firewater opals jenny continued and maybe something else but thats their business so everything has been wrapped up and im here for my year i i i see you dont understand he said it has to do with the way the muse of history organizes these narratives this one has two groups of three characters each and they take turns with the viewpoint so a cycle was mela ida okra che gwenny and you jenny three such cycles complete the narrative eighteen chapters in all its done to confound the critics i think who dont know anything about literature youre supposed to be viewing chapter eighteen what chapter eighteen jenny demanded i gave gwenny back her contact lens when i got a new pair of spectacles so i cant see dreams anymore is it a dream chapter grey looked flustrated its the final chapter where everything gets wrapped up with a happy ending according to the formula but everythings already wrapped up so theres nothing left for me to view so here i am ready to get this yearlong chore out of the way though id rather be with gwenny and che maybe humfrey can explain it to you he said they went up to the tiny study with its piles of everything the old gnome looked up about time you got here jenny he grumped what kept you but shes supposed to be running chapter eighteen grey protested humfrey scowled clio glitched he said a chapter got mislaid probably because jenny came from a foreign world and so doesnt mesh perfectly with xanth there is no chapter eighteen but that means jenny doesnt get her allotted viewpoint grey said that isnt right so let her handle the credits humfrey said grey threw up his hands all right jenny you will begin your service by handling a mundane chore its highly irregular but we just have to make do here is the list of credits just describe them in your own words ill show you to your room so you wont disturb humfrey jenny took the list it was a strange thing but then everything about the good magicians enterprise was strange hers she realized was not to reason why hers was just to wash and dry or whatever she took a breath and started reading the hit man and the mitten bush were sent by tim hittle the pigly bank was from guy mccutchan the road hog is robert thrbyfill the lemon tree is kanayo agbodike electras daughters dawn and eve and their talents are from abbey wraets esk ogre and bria brassies son brusque is from c m keller and his talent of making things hard and heavy or light and soft is from jason menefree calling a goblin child a goblet is from ronald foster then she came to a paragraph this was a big one it was also a surprise because it related to a character she had just come to know okra ogress and the related detail is from barbara hay hummel she of the pain medicine who brought us rose of roogna in question quest barb is also responsible for the fanciest of the panties mela modeled but did not choose and for canis the dog and the seed of thyme jenny shook her head okra had not only been a minor character she had been fashioned by a mundane no wonder she had been eager to changer her status and what was this about pain medicine someone in pain would really have the desire to escape to fantasy this whole thing was weird she took another breath and resumed the asthma is from carson fredericks the idea of the healing water for gwenny goblins eyes is from deborah jones the reason healing elixir did not cure gwennys or jennys vision is from woodrow w windischaman the contact lenses for gwenny are from kit arnold rene alexander lisa campbell and ann franklin the multiplication table is from john c wear jenny looked up unable to restrain herself thank you john wear she said with the heaviest irony she could muster what a mess that had been she took another breath and went on the pulpit and the putrifly are from patrick brown attila the hunny bee is from john brummel the leaves of absence are from eric meyersfield the gunman is from mark richman the winged fauns are from brent kauffman she looked up again she hoped those folks would just keep their future suggestions to themselves did they have any idea how they had complicated her life and the lives of her friends but then the endless credits took another tack the otterbees are from virginia a johnson the hoofinmouth disease is from christopher onstad the tickle and gooseberry bushes are from w g bliss the madcap is from zoe selengut she looked up again that had turned out to be really useful in the end so maybe these credits werent all mere mischief alister and his dog marbles are from jody lynn nye the nymph who authored the encyclopedia of xanth the propeller plains are from mayfair games the doldrums are from carol jacob the dragon dola is from russell duffer joynt the little skeleton is from david edison thomas hardy provided the inspiration for the pun on far from the madding crowd nada nagas debt to the gourd was pointed out by patrick ware the problem of children exposed to what the adult conspiracy conceals was suggested by n n reits though that treatment may not be precisely what was envisioned this is after all xanth jenny looked up again but it was bad enough she said to no one in particular she resumed her reading the old wives tail and air brush were by tamara bailey darren the boy with the ability to make things into other things was suggested by melinda gordon who was age eight when she wrote isnt it odd that she was just his age the roc and the hard place was the genius of jason rodrigues there will be more about that concept in novel nineteen the algae bra was from robert a hubby relayed from his math teacher dick greseth who says math cant be fun the freudian slip was by cynthia bellah and mount everrest was by charles e brown ivys having a twin sister was the idea of joanna van oorschot who used her magic to make it come true it came true for ivys mundane identity too the authors daughter penny found a friend joana janse exactly her age to the day viously thats no coincidetice joana with the one n must have come into beirig when joanna with the two ns thought up the notion jenny looked up again startled so thats how it hal pened it came from mundania she was amazed at these revealed interactions between xanth and mundania she returned to the list how do i love sea etc was spoken by suzan malles jenny sighed when would it ever end it got worse the derivation of the title was devious in the dawn of history there was the promise or threat of the sound of his horn or the playing of the angel gabriels trumpet signaling the end of the world then stephen donaldson used a similar patterning for his novel the mirror of her dreams then came powerss the stress of her regard xanth of course is lower browin fact about halfway from the brow to the groundand distressingly naughty thus the color of her panties this time jenny merely shook her head realizing that xanth was incorrigible anyway they were nice panties and they had helped mela merwoman to nab her husband which was the point of the whole adventure if jenny ever decided to look for a husband herself she would remember how it was done she resumed reading but why that particular color indeed who says it is a color well the official colors of the authors class at westtown friends school in pennsylvania were plaid and white partly in honor of their chosen female faculty member teacher rachel letchworth who had scottish blood but the printer was unable to reproduce plaid for the yearbook so brown had to be substituted there was a male faculty member master charlie brown but it is unknown whether he had anything to do with this ever since the class colors have been erroneously listed as brown and white those are actually the school colors perhaps this helps correct the record it has been a fortyyear indignity this at any rate is the precedent for using plaid as a color you have a problem with that jenny shook her head listening to what she had read i never questioned plaid as a color she said quickly she looked at the list again there were several more suggestions but they didnt manage to squeeze into this volume probably they will be used in the next then it got really odd because she found herself reading about herselfonly not exactly jenny of mundania the model for jenny elf who was paralyzed by a drunken driver continues to improve she paused she herself derived from a mundane just as okra did and this mundane had chosen her instead of okra to represent her in xanth the concept was so strange she set it aside and resumed reading this report will be over a year out of date by the time you read it but here it is jenny is now able to use a cup and drink by herself she can sit in a chair in the shower washing herself she is in the hospital being trained to use her computer and is getting more facile with it she can use it to call home and her mother has made a game of it by installing a security code so that jenny has to figure out how to break it in order to gain entry to the home computer the first code was simple but each subsequent one is harder so that jenny really has to use her mind since she has much more use of her mind than her body this is good helspeech is improving too but she needs surgery on her jawi would mention the temporomandibular joint but only a nerd would understand the termso that her mouth will be able to move for better enunciation remember jenny was really bashed up and some things that dont show cause her endless complications her mother estimates that jenny has now received over two thousand nice letters and they are still coming in at the rate of three or four a day from all over the world they would really like to answer them but are presently unable its pretty much a fulltime job just surviving however one letter write happened to be in the area and recognized jenny at et storeoh yes it is possible to shop in a wheelchairanel exclaime i wrote to you just so there was a knock on the door jenny opened it gre murphy was there theres been another mistake hsaid embarrassed good magician humfrey forgot you are supposed to report to the demons game to work with nada naga that will complete your service jenny was pleased nadas nice she handed him the sheaf of credits these are weird they always are he agreed yet also true i once lived in mundania and saw how xanth looks from there if i could believe more than just a little of this i would be extremely mixed up she said he nodded it is probably best just to forget it the good magician will conjure you to the demons studio jenny followed him down the hall she knew she would have an interesting experience in the game but she wasnt sure she would forget what she had just read and so we finally get it straightened out and i the author will finish this authors note myself i have just one thing to add it is of a personal nature but important to me while working on this novel in mayhem i attended a memorial service and i spoke there the person being honored was extremely popular in her community and there ere many there to speak well of her i think my own words are selfexplanatory actually i did not speak as well as this rendition makes it seem my thoughts got tangled by emotion and some were left out so this is the full text including what i meant to say as well as what i did my mother sai oh im going and she died i was not ready i did not want her to start that journey so soon i cannot change it but perhaps i can conjecture where it was that she was going call this a fantasy if you will my mother was in her way a creature of trains when she traveled she did not like to fly though she would do so when she had to and i dont think she really liked long car drives either i share these sentiments so im sure it was a train she chose when it came time to make this final journey there is just something about a train in its beauty and power and reliability a train is like portable civilization everything you need or want is there edna st vincent millay put it nicely there isnt a train i wouldnt take no matter where its going you can trust a train now we are here at the station to see my mother off this is a special train it comes from eternity and it is making a round trip when she boards it she finds that many of her friends are on it having boarded at prior stations and more will oin them down the line she has a window seat and beyond that window is all the universe past present and future there is land and sea and sky cities and forests houses and people there is the joy of day and the mystery of night everything is out there and none of it is ever lost one has only to look but there is no need for there is also much within the train there are sleeping compartments and a dining car and a pleasant hall for games and conversation she has the companionship of compatible people including many she never met in life but who are well worth knowing now it is a nice place and she is happy there as she was here and though i am so sad to see her go i hope she rides that train forever
