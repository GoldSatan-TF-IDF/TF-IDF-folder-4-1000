sundown xxx the owl and the pussycat i the valley of delight in all probability your first view of the valley of the yumuri will be from the hermitage of montserrate for it is there that the cocheros drive you up the winding road they take you with the bay at your back and the gorge at your right to the crest of a narrow ridge where the chapel stands once there you overlook the fairest sight in all christendom the loveliest valley in the world as humboldt called it for the yumuri nestles right at your feet a vale of pure delight a glimpse of paradise that bewilders the eye and fills the soul with ecstasy it is larger than it seems at first sight through it meanders the river coiling and uncoiling hidden here and there by jungle growths and seeking final outlet through a cleft in the wall not unlike a crack in the side of a painted bowl the place seems to have been fashioned as a dwelling for dryads and hamadryads for nixies and pixies and all the fabled spirits of forest and stream fairy hands tinted its steep slopes and carpeted its level floor with the richest of green brocades nowhere is there a clash of color nowhere does a naked hillside or monstrous jut of rock obtrude to mar its placid beauty nowhere can you see a crude disfiguring mark of mans handiwork there are only fields and bowers with an occasional thatched roof faded gray by the sun royal palms most perfect of trees are scattered everywhere they stand alone or in stately groves their lush fronds drooping like gigantic ostrich plumes their slim trunks as smooth and regular and white as if turned in a giant lathe and then rubbed with pipeclay in all cuba island of bewitching vistas there is no other yumuri and in all the wide world perhaps there is no valley of moods and aspects so varying you should see it at evening all warm and slumberous all gold and green and purple or at early dawn when the mists are fading like pale memories of dreams and the tints are delicate or again during a tempest when it is a caldron of whirling vapors and when the palmtrees bend like coryphees tossing their arms to the galloping hurricane but whatever the time of day or the season of the year at which you visit it the yumuri will render you wordless with delight and you will vow that it is the happiest valley mens eyes have ever looked upon standing there beside the shrine of our lady of montserrate you will see beyond the cleft through which the river emerges another hill la cumbre from which the view is almost as wonderful and your driver may tell you about the splendid homes that used to grace its slopes in the golden days when cuba had an aristocracy they were classic roman villas such as once lined the via appia little palaces with mosaics and marbles and precious woods imported from europe and furnished with the rarest treasures for in those days the cuban planters were rich and spent their money lavishly melancholy reminders of this splendor exist even now in the shape of a crumbled ruin here and there a lichened pillar an occasional porcelain urn in its place atop a vinegrown bit of wall your cochero may point out a certain grove of orangetrees now little more than a rank tangle and tell you about the quinta of don esteban varona and its hidden treasure about little esteban and rosa the twins and about sebastian the giant slave who died in fury taking with him the secret of the well the spanish main is rich in tales of treasuretrove for when the antilles were most affluent they were least secure and men were put to strange shifts to protect their fortunes certain hoards like jewels of tragic history in time assumed a sort of evil personality not infrequently exercising a dire influence over the lives of those who chanced to fall under their spells it was as if the money were accursed for certainly the seekers often came to evil of such a character was the varona treasure don esteban himself was neither better nor worse than other men of his time and although part of the money he hid was wrung from the toil of slaves and the traffic in their bodies much of it was clean enough and in time the earth purified it all since his acts made so deep an impress and since the treasure he left played so big a part in the destinies of those who came after him it is well that some account of these matters should be given the story please remember is an old one it has been often told and in the telling and retelling it is but natural that a certain glamour a certain tropical extravagance should attach to it therefore you should make allowance for some exaggeration some accretions due to the lapse of time in the main however it is well authenticated and runs parallel to fact dona rosa varona lived barely long enough to learn that she had given birth to twins don esteban whom people knew as a grim man took the blow of his sudden bereavement as became one of his strong fiber leaving the priest upon his knees and the doctor busied with the babies he strode through the house and out into the sunset followed by the wails of the slave women from the negro quarters came the sound of other and even louder lamentations for dona rosa had been well loved and the news of her passing had spread quickly don esteban was at heart a selfish man and now therefore he felt a sullen fierce resentment mingled with his grief what trick was this he asked himself what had he done to merit such misfortune had he not made rich gifts to the church had he not gone on foot to the shrine of our lady of montserrate with a splendid votive offering a pair of eardrops a necklace and a crucifix all of diamonds that quivered in the sunlight like drops of purest water had he not knelt and prayed for his wifes safe delivery and then hung his gifts upon the sacred image as loyola had hung up his weapons before that other counterpart of our lady don esteban scowled at the memory for those gems were of the finest and certainly of a value sufficient to recompense the virgin for any ordinary miracle they were worth five thousand pesos at least he told himself they represented the price of five slaves five of his finest girls schooled in housekeeping and of an age suitable for breeding an extravagance truly don esteban knew the value of money as well as anybody and he swore now that he would give no more to the church he looked up from his unhappy musings to find a gigantic barefooted negro standing before him the slave was middleaged his kinky hair was growing gray but he was of superb proportions and the muscles which showed through the rents in his cotton garments were as smooth and supple as those of a stripling his black face was puckered with grief as he began master is it true that dona rosa the fellow choked yes esteban nodded wearily she is dead sebastian tears came to sebastians eyes and overflowed his cheeks he stood motionless striving to voice his sympathy at length he said she was too good for this world god was jealous and took her to paradise the widowed man cried out angrily paradise what is this but paradise he stared with resentful eyes at the beauty round about him see the yumuri don esteban flung a long arm outward do you think there is a sight like that in heaven and yonder he turned to the harbor far below with its fleet of sailingships resting like a flock of gulls upon a sea of quicksilver beyond the bay twenty miles distant a range of hazy mountains hid the horizon facing to the south esteban looked up the full length of the valley of the san juan clear to the majestic pan de matanzas a wonderful sight indeed then his eyes returned as they always did to the yumuri valley of delight paradise indeed he muttered i gave her everything she gained nothing by dying with a grave thoughtfulness which proved him superior to the ordinary slave sebastian replied true she had all that any womans heart could desire but in return for your goodness she gave you children you have lost her but you have gained an heir and a beautiful girl baby who will grow to be another dona rosa i grieved as you grieve once upon a time for my woman died in childbirth too you remember but my daughter lives and she has brought sunshine into my old age that is the purpose of children he paused and shifted his weight uncertainly digging his stiff black toes into the dirt after a time he said slowly excellency now about the well yes what about it esteban lifted smoldering eyes did the dona rosa confide her share of the secret to any one those priests and those doctors you know she died without speaking then it rests between you and me it does unless you have babbled master sebastian drew himself up and there was real dignity in his black face understand my whole fortune is there everything even to the deeds of patent for the plantations if i thought there was danger of your betraying me i would have your tongue pulled out and your eyes torn from their sockets the black man spoke with a simplicity that carried conviction you have seen me tested you know i am faithful but master this secret is a great burden for my old shoulders and i have been thinking times are unsettled don esteban and death comes without warning you are known to be the richest man in this province and these government officials are robbers suppose i should be left alone what then the planter considered for a moment they are my countrymen but a curse on them he said finally well when my children are old enough to hold their tongues they will have to be told if im gone you shall be the one to tell them now leave me this is no time to speak of such things sebastian went as noiselessly as he had come on his way back to his quarters he took the path to the well the place where most of his time was ordinarily spent sebastian had dug this well and with his own hands he had beautified its surroundings until they were the loveliest on the varona grounds the rock for the building of the quinta had been quarried here and in the center of the resulting depression grassgrown and flowering now was the well itself its waters seeped from subterranean caverns and filtered pure and cool through the porous country rock plantain palm orange and tamarind trees bordered the hollow over the rocky walls ran a riot of vines and ferns and ornamental plants it was sebastians task to keep this place green and thither he took his way from force of habit through the twilight came pancho cueto the manager a youngish man with a narrow face and bold closeset eyes spying sebastian he began so don esteban has an heir at last the slave rubbed his eyes with the heel of his huge yellow palm and answered respectfully yes don pancho two little angels a boy and a girl his gray brows drew together in a painful frown dona rosa was a saint no doubt there is great rejoicing in heaven at her coming eh what do you think umm possibly don esteban will miss her for a time and then i dare say he will remarry at the negros exclamation cueto cried so and why not everybody knows how rich he is from oriente to pinar del rio the women have heard about his treasure what treasure asked sebastian after an instants pause cuetos dark eyes gleamed resentfully at this show of ignorance but he laughed ho theres a careful fellow for you no wonder he trusts you but do you think i have neither eyes nor ears my good sebastian you know all about that treasure in fact you know far more about many things than don esteban would care to have you tell come now dont you sebastians face was like a mask carved from ebony of what does this treasure consist he inquired i have never heard about it of gold of jewels of silver bars and precious ornaments cuetos head was thrust forward his nostrils were dilated his teeth gleamed oh it is somewhere about as you very well know bah dont deny it im no fool what becomes of the money from the slave girls eh and the sugar crops too does it go to buy arms and ammunition for the rebels no don esteban hides it and you help him come he cried disregarding sebastians murmurs of protest did you ever think how fabulous that fortune must be by this time did you ever think that one little gem one bag of gold would buy your freedom don esteban has promised to buy my freedom and the freedom of my girl so the manager was plainly surprised i didnt know that after a moment he began to laugh and yet you pretend to know nothing about that treasure ha youre a good boy sebastian and so i am i admire you were both loyal to our master eh but now about evangelina cuetos face took on a craftier expression she is a likely girl and when she grows up she will be worth more than you her father dont forget that don esteban is before all else a business man be careful that some one doesnt make him so good an offer for your girl that he will forget his promise and sell her sebastian uttered a hoarse animal cry and the whites of his eyes showed through the gloom he would never sell evangelina cueto laughed aloud once more of course he would not dare eh i am only teasing you but see you have given yourself away everything you tell me proves that you know all about that treasure i know but one thing the slave declared stiffening himself slowly and that is to be faithful to don esteban he turned and departed leaving pancho cueto staring after him meditatively in the days following the birth of his children and the death of his wife don esteban varona as had been his custom steered a middle course in politics in that way managing to avoid a clash with the spanish officials who ruled the island or an open break with his cuban neighbors who rebelled beneath their wrongs this was no easy thing to do for the agents of the crown were uniformly corrupt and quite ruthless while most of the nativeborn were either openly or secretly in sympathy with the revolution in the orient but esteban dealt diplomatically with both factions and went on raising slaves and sugar to his own great profit owing to the impossibility of importing negroes the market steadily improved and esteban reaped a handsome profit from those he had on hand especially when his crop of young girls matured his sugarplantations prospered too and pancho cueto who managed them continued to wonder where the money went the twins esteban and rosa developed into healthy children and became the pride of sebastian and his daughter into whose care they had been given as for evangelina the young negress she grew tall and strong and handsome until she was the finest slave girl in the neighborhood whenever sebastian looked at her he thanked god for his happy circumstances then one day don esteban varona remarried and the dona isabel who had been a famous habana beauty came to live at the quinta the daughter of impoverished parents she had heard and thought much about the mysterious treasure of la cumbre there followed a period of feasting and entertainment of music and merrymaking spanish officials prominent civilians of matanzas and the countryside drove up the hill to welcome don estebans bride but before the first fervor of his honeymoon cooled the groom began to fear that he had made a serious mistake dona isabel he discovered was both vain and selfish not only did she crave luxury and display but with singular persistence she demanded to know all about her husbands financial affairs now don esteban was no longer young age had soured him with suspicion and when once he saw himself as the victim of a mercenary marriage he turned bitterly against his wife her curiosity he sullenly resented and he unblushingly denied his possession of any considerable wealth in fact he tried with malicious ingenuity to make her believe him a poor man but isabel was not of the sort to be readily deceived finding her arts and coquetries of no avail she flew into a rage and a furious quarrel ensued the first of many for the lady could not rest without knowing all there was to know about the treasure avaricious to her fingertips she itched to weigh those bags of precious metal and yearned to see those jewels burning upon her bosom her mercenary mind magnified their value many times and her anger at don estebans obstinacy deepened to a smoldering hatred she searched the quinta of course whenever she had a chance but she discovered nothing with the result that the mystery began to engross her whole thought she pried into the obscurest corners she questioned the slaves she lay awake at night listening to estebans breathing in the hope of surprising his secret from his dreams naturally such a life was trying to the husband but as his wifes obsession grew his determination to foil her only strengthened outwardly of course the pair maintained a show of harmony for they were proud and they occupied a position of some consequence in the community but their private relations went from bad to worse at length a time came when they lived in frank enmity when isabel never spoke to esteban except in reproach or anger and when esteban unlocked his lips only to taunt his wife with the fact that she had been thwarted despite her cunning in most quarters as time went on the story of the varona treasure was forgotten or at least put down as legendary only isabel who in spite of her husbands secretiveness learned much and pancho cueto who kept his own account of the annual income from the business held the matter in serious remembrance the overseer was a patient man he watched with interest the growing discord at the quinta and planned to profit by it should occasion offer it was only natural under such conditions that dona isabel should learn to dislike her stepchildren esteban had told her frankly that they would inherit whatever fortune he possessed the thought that after all she might never share in the treasure for which she had sacrificed her youth and beauty was like to drive the woman mad and as may be imagined she found ways to vent her spite upon the twins she widened her hatred so as to include old sebastian and his daughter and even went so far as to persecute evangelinas sweetheart a slave named asensio it had not taken dona isabel long to guess the reason of sebastians many privileges and one of her first efforts had been to win the old mans confidence it was in vain however that she flattered and cajoled or stormed and threatened sebastian withstood her as a towering ceiba withstands the summer heat and the winter hurricane his firmness made her vindictive and so in time she laid a scheme to estrange him from his master dona isabel was crafty she began to complain about evangelina but it was only after many months that she ventured to suggest to her husband that he sell the girl esteban of course refused pointblank he was too fond of sebastians daughter he declared to think of such a thing so that is it sneered dona isabel well she is young and shapely and handsome as wenches go i rather suspected you were fond of her with difficulty esteban restrained an oath you mistake my meaning he said stiffly sebastian has served me faithfully and evangelina plays with my children she is good to them she is more of a mother to them than you have ever been is that why you dress her like a lady bah a likely story isabel tossed her fine dark head im not blind i see what goes on about me this will make a pretty scandal among your friends she as black as the pit and you woman shouted the planter you have a sting like a scorpion i wont have that wench in my house isabel flared out at him goaded to fury by his wifes senseless accusation esteban cried your house by what license do you call it yours am i not married to you damnation yes as a leech is married to its victim you suck my blood your blood the woman laughed shrilly you have no blood your veins run vinegar you are a miser miser miser i grow sick of the word it is all you find to taunt me with confess that you married me for my money he roared of course i did do you think a woman of my beauty would marry you for anything else but a fine bargain i made vampire wife or vampire i intend to rule this house and i refuse to be shamed by a thicklipped african her airs tell her story she is insolent to me but i shant endure it she laughs at me well your friends shall laugh at you silence commanded esteban sell her no sell her or without waiting to hear her threat esteban tossed his arms above his head and fled from the room flinging himself into the saddle he spurred down the hill and through the town to the casino de espanol where he spent the night at cards with the spanish officials but he did not sell evangelina in the days that followed many similar scenes occurred and as estebans home life grew more unhappy his dissipations increased he drank and gambled heavily he brought his friends to the quinta with him and strove to forget domestic unpleasantness in boisterous revelry his wife however found opportunities enough to weary and exasperate him with reproaches regarding the slave girl ii spanish gold the twins were seven years old when dona isabels schemes bore their first bitter fruit and the occasion was a particularly uproarious night when don esteban entertained a crowd of his castilian friends little rosa was awakened at a late hour by the laughter and shouts of her fathers guests she was afraid for there was something strange about the voices some quality to them which was foreign to the childs experience creeping into her brothers room she awoke him and together they listened don mario de castano was singing a song the words of which were lost but which brought a yell of approval from his companions the twins distinguished the voice of don pablo peza too don pablo whose magnificent black beard had so often excited their admiration yes and there was col mendoza y linares doubtless in his splendid uniform these gentlemen were well and favorably known to the boy and girl yet rosa began to whimper and when esteban tried to reassure her his own voice was thin and reedy from fright in the midst of their agitation they heard some one weeping there came a rush of feet down the hallway and the next instant evangelina flung herself into the room a summer moon flooded the chamber with radiance and enabled her to see the two small white figures sitting up in the middle of the bed evangelina fell upon her knees before them little master little mistress she sobbed you will save me wont you we love each other eh see then what a crime this is say that you will save me she was beside herself and her voice was hoarse and cracked from grief she wrung her hands she rocked herself from side to side she kissed the twins nightgowns tugging at them convulsively the children were frightened but they managed to quaver what has happened who has harmed you don pablo peza wept the negress your father has sold me to him lost me at cards oh i shall die sebastian wont believe it he is praying and asensio o god but what can they do to help me you alone can save me you wont let don pablo take me away it would kill me wait esteban scrambled out of bed and stood beside his dusky nurse and playmate dont cry any more ill tell papa that you dont like don pablo rosa followed yes come along brother she cried shrilly well tell don pablo to go home and leave our evangelina my blessed doves but will they listen to you moaned the slave papa does whatever we ask they assured her gravely if he should growl well come back and hide you in the big wardrobe where nobody will ever find you then hand in hand with their long nightgowns lifted to their knees they pattered out into the hall and down toward the livingroom whence came the shouting and the laughter don mario de castano who was facing the door stopped in the midst of a ribald song to cry god be praised whats this i see the others looked and then burst into merriment for across the litter of cards and dice and empty glasses they saw a dimpled girl and boy as like as two peas they were just out of bed they were peering through the smoke and blinking like two little owls their evident embarrassment amused the guests hugely so you awaken the household with your songs some one chided don mario two cherubs from heaven another exclaimed and a third cried a toast to estebans beautiful children but the father lurched forward a frown upon his face what is this my dears he inquired thickly run back to your beds this is no place for you we love evangelina piped the twins you must not let don pablo have her if you please evangelina they nodded we love her she plays with us every day we want her to stay here she belongs to us accustomed as they were to prompt compliance with their demands they spoke imperiously but they had never seen a frown like this upon their fathers face and at his refusal their voices grew squeaky with excitement and uncertainty go to your rooms my sweethearts don esteban directed finally we want evangelina she belongs to us they chorused stubbornly don pablo shook with laughter so she belongs to you eh and im to be robbed of my winnings very well then come and give me a kiss both of you and ill see what can be done but the children saw that don pablos face was strangely flushed that his eyes were wild and his magnificent beard was wet with wine therefore they hung back you won your bet fairly esteban growled at him pay no heed to these babies evangelina is ours the little ones bravely repeated then their father exploded the devil am i dreaming where have you learned to oppose me back to your beds both of you seeing them hesitate he shouted for his wife ho there isabel my love come put these imps to rest or must i teach them manners with my palm a fine thing truly are they to be allowed to roam the house at will and get a fever mere mention of their stepmothers name was enough for rosa and esteban they scuttled away as fast as they could go and when dona isabel came to their rooms a few moments later she found them in their beds with their eyes deceitfully squeezed shut evangelina was cowering in a corner isabel had overheard the wager and her soul was evilly alight she jerked the slave girl to her feet and with a blow of her palm sent her to her quarters then she turned her attention to the twins when she left them they were weeping silently both for themselves and for evangelina whom they dearly loved meanwhile don mario had resumed his singing day was breaking when esteban varona bade his guests goodby at the door of his house as he stood there sebastian came to him out of the mists of the dawn the old man had been waiting for hours he was half crazed from apprehension and now cast himself prone before his master begging for evangelina don pablo in whom the liquor was dying cursed impatiently caramba have i won the treasure of your whole establishment he inquired perhaps you value this wench at more than a thousand pesos if so you will say that i cheated you no shes only an ordinary girl my wife doesnt like her and so i determined to get rid of her she is yours fairly enough varona told him then send her to my house ill breed her to salvador my cochero hes the strongest man i have sebastian uttered a strangled cry and rose to his feet master you must not silence ordered esteban wine never agreed with him and this morning its effects combined with his losses at gambling had put him in a nasty temper go about your business what do you mean by this anyhow he shouted but sebastian dazed of mind and sick of soul went on unheeding she is my girl you promised me her freedom i warn you eh the planter swayed forward and with blazing eyes surveyed his slave esteban knew that he had done a foul thing in risking the girl upon the turn of a card and an inner voice warned him that he would repent his action when he became sober but in his present mood this very knowledge enraged him the more you warn me of what he growled at this moment neither master nor man knew exactly what he said or did sebastian raised his hand on high in reality the gesture was meant to call heaven as a witness to his years of faithful service but misconstruing his intent pablo peza brought his ridingwhip down across the old mans back crying ho none of that a shudder ran through sebastians frame whirling he seized don pablos wrist and tore the whip from his fingers although the spaniard was a strong man he uttered a cry of pain at this indignity to a guest esteban flew into a fury pancho he cried ho pancho when the manager came running esteban explained this fool is dangerous he raised his hand to me and to don pablo sebastians protests were drowned by the angry voices of the others tie him to yonder grating directed esteban who was still in the grip of a senseless rage flog him well and make haste about it sebastian who had no time in which to recover himself made but a weak resistance when pancho cueto locked his wrists into a pair of clumsy oldfashioned manacles first passing the chain around one of the bars of the iron windowgrating which esteban had indicated sebastian felt that his whole world was tumbling about his ears he thought he must be dreaming cueto swung a heavy lash the sound of his blows echoed through the quinta and they summoned among others dona isabel who watched the scene from behind her shutter with much satisfaction the guests looked on approvingly sebastian made no outcry the face he turned to his master however was puckered with reproach and bewilderment the whip bit deep it drew blood and raised welts the thickness of ones thumb nevertheless for the first few moments the victim suffered less in body than in spirit his brain was so benumbed so shocked with other excitations that he was wellnigh insensible to physical pain that evangelina flesh of his flesh had been sold that his lifelong faithfulness had brought such reward as this that esteban light of his soul had turned against him all this was simply astounding more his simple mind could not compass for the moment gradually however he began to resent the shrieking injustice of it all and unsuspected forces gathered inside of him they grew until his frame was shaken by primitive savage impulses after a time don esteban cried that will do cueto leave him now for the flies to punish they will remind him of his insolence then the guests departed and esteban staggered into the house and went to bed all that morning sebastian stood with his hands chained high over his head the sun grew hotter and ever hotter upon his lacerated back the blood dried and clotted there a cloud of flies gathered swarming over the raw gashes left by cuetos whip before leaving for don pablos quinta evangelina came to bid her father an agonized farewell and for a long time after she had gone the old man stood motionless senseless scarcely breathing nor did the other slaves venture to approach him to offer sympathy or succor they passed with heads averted and with fear in their hearts since don estebans nerves or perhaps it was his conscience did not permit him to sleep he arose about noontime and dressed himself he was still drunk and the mad rage of the early morning still possessed him therefore when he mounted his horse he pretended not to see the figure chained to the windowgrating sebastians affection for his master was doglike and he had taken his punishment as a dog takes his more in surprise than in anger but at this proof of callous indifference a fire kindled in the old fellows breast hotter by far than the fever from his flyblown scores he was thirsty too but that was the least of his sufferings sometime during the afternoon the negro heard himself addressed through the window against the bars of which he leaned the speaker was dona isabel she had waited patiently until she knew he must be faint from exhaustion and then she had let herself into the room behind the grating whence she could talk to him without fear of observation do you suffer sebastian she began in a tone of gentleness and pity yes mistress the speakers tongue was thick and swollen la la what a crime and you the most faithful slave in all cuba yes mistress can i help you the negro raised his head he shook his body to rid himself of the insects which were devouring him give me a drink of water he said hoarsely surely a great gourdful all cool and dripping from the well but first i want you to tell me something come now let us have an understanding with each other a drink for the love of christ panted the old man and dona isabel saw how cracked and dry were his thick lips how near the torture had come to prostrating him ill do more she promised and her voice was like honey ill tell pancho cueto to unlock you even if i risk estebans anger by so doing you have suffered too much my good fellow indeed you have well i can help you now and in the future or i can make your life just such a misery as it has been today will you be my friend will you tell me something she was close to the window her black eyes were gleaming her face was ablaze with greed what can i tell you oh you know very well ive asked it often enough but you have lied just as my husband has lied to me he is a miser he has no heart he cares for nobody as you can see you must hate him now even as i hate him there was a silence during which dona isabel tried to read the expression on that tortured face in the sunlight do you perhaps then tell me is there really a treasure or the woman gasped she choked she could scarcely force the question for fear of disappointment tell me there is sebastian she clutched the bars and shook them ive heard so many lies that i begin to doubt the old man nodded oh yes there is a treasure said he god you have seen it isabel was trembling as if with an ague what is it like how much is there good sebastian ill give you water ill have you set free if you tell me how much i dont know but there is much pieces of spanish gold silver coins in casks and in little boxes the boxes are bound with iron and have hasps and staples bars of precious metal and little paper packages of gems all tied up and hidden in leather bags sebastian could hear his listener panting her bloodless fingers were wrapped tightly around the bars above his head yes go on there are ornaments too god knows they must have come from heaven they are so beautiful and pearls from the caribbean as large as plums are you speaking the truth every peso every bar every knickknack i have handled with my own hands did i not make the hidingplace all alone senora everything is there just as i tell you and more the grants of title from the crown for this quinta and the sugarplantations they are there too don esteban used to fear the government officials so he hid his papers securely without them the lands belong to no one you understand of course yes yes but the jewels god where are they hidden you would never guess sebastians voice gathered strength ten thousand men in ten thousand years would never find the place and nobody knows the secret but don esteban and me i believe you i knew all the time it was here well where is it sebastian hesitated and said piteously i am dying isabel could scarcely contain herself ill give you water but first tell me where where god in heaven cant you see that i too am perishing i must have a drink tell me first sebastian lifted his head and meeting the speakers eyes laughed hoarsely at the sound of his unnatural merriment isabel recoiled as if stung she stared at the slaves face in amazement and then in fury she stammered incoherently you you have been lying oh no the treasure is there the greatest treasure in all cuba but you shall never know where it is ill see to that it was you who sold my girl it was you who brought me to this it was your hand that whipped me well ill tell don esteban how you tried to bribe his secret from me what do you think hell do then eh youll feel the lash on your white back you fool dona isabel looked murder ill punish you for this ill make you speak if i have to rub your wounds with salt but sebastian closed his eyes wearily you cant make me suffer more than i have suffered he said and now i curse you may that treasure be the death of you may you live in torture like mine the rest of your days may your beauty turn to ugliness such that men will spit at you may you never know peace again until you die in poverty and want but dona isabel being superstitious fled with her fingers in her ears nor did she undertake to make good her barbarous threat realizing opportunely that it would only serve to betray her desperate intentions and put her husband further on his guard instead she shut herself into her room where she paced the floor racking her brain to guess where the hidingplace could be or to devise some means of silencing sebastians tongue to feel that she had been overmatched to know that there was indeed a treasure to think that the two who knew where it was had been laughing at her all this time filled the woman with an agony approaching that which sebastian suffered from his flies as the sun was sinking beyond the farther rim of the yumuri and the valley was beginning to fill with shadows esteban varona rode up the hill his temper was more evil than ever if that were possible for he had drunk again in an effort to drown the memory of his earlier actions with him rode half a dozen or more of his friends coming to dine and put in another night at his expense there were pablo peza and mario de castano once more col mendoza y linares old pedro miron the advocate and others of less consequence whom esteban had gathered from the spanish club the host dismounted and lurched across the courtyard to sebastian so my fine fellow he began have you had enough of rebellion by this time why did you have him flogged the advocate inquired esteban explained briefly he dared to raise his hand in anger against one of my guests sebastians face was working as he turned upon his master to say i would be lying if i told you that i am sorry for what i did it is you have done wrong your soul is black with this crime where is my girl the devil to hear you talk one would think you were a free man the planters eyes were bleared and he brandished his ridingwhip threateningly i do as i please with my slaves i tolerate no insolence your girl well shes in the house of salvador don pablos cochero where she belongs ive warned him that he will have to tame her unruly spirit as i have tamed yours sebastian had hung sick and limp against the grating but at these words he suddenly roused it was as if a current of electricity had galvanized him he strained at his manacles and the bars groaned under his weight his eyes began to roll his lips drew back over his blue gums noting his expression of ferocity esteban cut at his naked back with the ridingwhip crying ho not subdued yet eh you need another flogging curse you and all that is yours roared the maddened slave may you know the misery you have put upon me may you rot for a million years in hell the whip was rising and falling now for esteban had lost what little selfcontrol the liquor had left to him may your childrens bodies grow filthy with disease may they starve may they sebastian was yelling though his voice was hoarse with pain the lash drew blood with every blow meanwhile he wrenched and tugged at his bonds with the fury of a maniac pablo your machete quick panted the slaveowner gods blood ill make an end of this black fiend once for all esteban varonas guests had looked on at the scene with the same mild interest they would display at the whipping of a balky horse and now that the animal threatened to become dangerous it was in their view quite the proper thing to put it out of the way don pablo peza stepped toward his mare to draw the machete from its scabbard but he did not hand it to his friend he heard a shout and turned in time to see a wonderful and a terrible thing sebastian had braced his naked feet against the wall he had bowed his back and bent his massive shoulders a back and a pair of shoulders that looked as bony and muscular as those of an ox and he was heaving with every ounce of strength in his enormous body as pablo stared he saw the heavy grating come away from its anchorage in the solid masonry as a shrub is uprooted from soft ground the rods bent and twisted there was a clank and rattle and clash of metal upon the flags and then sebastian turned upon his tormentor a free man save only for the wide iron bracelets and their connecting chain he was quite insane his face was frightful to behold it was apelike in its animal rage and he towered above his master like some fabled creature out of the african jungle of his forefathers sebastians fists alone would have been formidable weapons but they were armored and weighted with the oldfashioned handwrought irons which pancho cueto had locked upon them wrapping the chain in his fingers the slave leaped at esteban and struck once the sound of the blow was sickening for the whole bony structure of esteban varonas head gave way there was a horrified cry from the other white men don pablo peza ran forward shouting he swung his machete but sebastian met him before the blow could descend and they went down together upon the hard stones again sebastian smote with his massive hands wrapped in the chain and his wrists encased in steel and this time it was as if don pablos head had been caught between a hammer and an anvil the negros strength exceptional at all times was multiplied tenfold he had run amuck when he arose the machete was in his grasp and don pablos brains were on his knuckles it all happened in far less time than it takes to tell the onlookers had not yet recovered from their first consternation in fact they were still fumbling and tugging at whatever weapons they carried when sebastian came toward them brandishing the blade on high pedro miron the advocate was the third to fall he tried to scramble out of the negros path but being an old man his limbs were too stiff to serve him and he went down shrieking by now the horses had caught the scent of hot blood and were plunging furiously the clatter of their hoofs mingling with the blasphemies of the riders while sebastians bestial roaring made the commotion even more hideous estebans guests fought as much for their lives as for vengeance upon the slayer for sebastian was like a gorilla he seemed intent upon killing them all he vented his fury upon whatever came within his reach he struck at men and animals alike and the shrieks of wounded horses added to the din it was a frightful combat it seemed incredible that one man could work such dreadful havoc in so short a time varona and two of his friends were dead two more were badly wounded and a peruvian stallion lay kicking on the flagging when col mendoza y linares finally managed to get a bullet home in the black mans brain those who came running to learn the cause of the hubbub turned away sick and pallid for the paved yard was a shambles pancho cueto called upon the slaves to help him but they slunk back to their quarters dumb with terror and dismay all that night people from the town below came and went and the quinta resounded to sobs and lamentations but of all the relatives of the dead and wounded dona isabel took her bereavement hardest strange to say she could not be comforted she wept she screamed she tore her hair tasting the full nauseousness of the cup her own avarice had prepared now when it was too late she realized that she had overreached herself having caused the death of the only two who knew the secret of the treasure she remembered also sebastians statement that even the deeds of patent for the land were hidden with the rest where ten thousand men in ten thousand years could never find them impressed by her manifestations of grief estebans friends reasoned that the widow must have loved her husband dearly they told one another they had wronged her iii the oreilly age and easy living had caused don mario de castano the sugar merchant to take on weight he had in truth become so fat that he waddled like a penguin when he walked and when he rode the springs of his french victoria gave up in despair they glued themselves together face to face and don mario felt every rut and every rock in the road nor was the merchant any less heavy in mind than in body for he was both very rich and very serious and nothing is more ponderous than a rich fat man who takes his riches and his fatness seriously in disposition don mario was practical and unromantic he boasted that he had never had an illusion never an interest outside of his business and yet on the day this story opens this prosaic personage in spite of his bulging waistband and his taut neckband in spite of his short breath and his prickly heat was in a very whirl of pleasurable excitement don mario in fact suffered the greatest of all illusions he was in love and he believed himself beloved the object of his adoration was little rosa varona the daughter of his onetime friend esteban at thought of her the planter glowed with ardor at any rate he took it to be ardor although it might have been the fever from that summer rash which so afflicted him and his heart fluttered in a way dangerous to one of his apoplectic tendencies to be sure he had met rosa only twice since her return from her yankee school but twice had been enough with prompt decision he had resolved to do her the honor of making her his wife now with a person of don marios importance to decide for himself is to decide for others and inasmuch as he knew that dona isabel rosas stepmother was notoriously mercenary and had not done at all well since her husbands death it did not occur to him to doubt that his suit would prosper it was in fact to make terms with her that he rode forth in the heat of this particular afternoon notwithstanding the rivulets of perspiration that were coursing down every fold of his flesh and regardless of the fact that the body of his victoria was tipped at a drunken angle as if struggling to escape the burdens of his great weight don mario felt a jauntiness of body and of spirit almost like that of youth he saw himself as a splendid prince riding toward the humble home of some obscure maiden whom he had graciously chosen to be his mate his arrival threw dona isabel into a flutter the woman could scarcely contain her curiosity when she came to meet him for he was not the sort of man to inconvenience himself by mere social visits their first formal greetings over don mario surveyed the bare livingroom and remarked lugubriously i see many changes here no doubt the widow agreed times have been hard since poor estebans death what a terrible calamity that was i shudder when i think of it said he i was his guest on the night previous you remember in fact i witnessed his wager of the negro girl evangelina the root of the whole tragedy well well who would have believed that old slave her father would have run mad at losing her a shocking affair truly and one i shall never get out of my mind shocking yes but what do you think of a rich man like esteban who would leave his family destitute who would die without revealing the place where he had stored his treasure dona isabel it was plain felt her wrongs keenly she spoke with as much spirit as if her husband had permitted himself to be killed purely out of spite toward her de castano shook his round bullet head saying with some impatience you still believe in that treasure eh my dear senora the only treasure varona left was his adorable children and your admirable self immediately the speaker regretted his words for he remembered too late that dona isabel was reputed to be a trifle unbalanced on this subject of the varona treasure i do not believe i know the widow answered with more than necessary vehemence what became of all estebans money if he did not bury it he never gave any to me for he was a miser you know as well as i that he carried on a stupendous business in slaves and sugar and it was common knowledge that he hid every peso for fear of his enemies but where where that is the question you if any one should know after all the years you have spent in hunting for it the merchant observed dios mio almost before esteban was buried you began the search people said you were going to tear this house down well i never found a trace i had holes dug in the gardens too you see no senora it is possible to hide anything except money no man can conceal that where another will not find it isabels face had grown hard and avaricious even during this brief talk her eyes were glowing plainly she was as far as ever from giving up her longcherished conviction i dont ask anybody to believe the story she said resentfully all the same it is true there are pieces of spanish gold and silver coins in boxes bound with iron and fitted with hasps and staples packages of gems pearls from the caribbean as large as plums oh sebastian told me all about it of course of course i shall not argue the matter don mario dismissed the subject with a wave of his plump hand now dona isabel as if it were not enough to lose that treasure the widow continued stormily the government must free all our slaves tse tse and now that there is no longer a profit in sugar my plantations no profit in sugar what are you saying queried the caller oh you have a way of prospering what touches your fingers turns to gold but you are not at the mercy of an administrador precisely i am my own manager if your crops do not pay then pancho cueto is cheating you he is capable of it get rid of him but i didnt come here to talk about estebans hidden treasure nor his plantations nor pancho cueto i came here to talk about your stepdaughter rosa so dona isabel looked up quickly she interests me she is more beautiful than the stars don mario rolled his eyes toward the high ceiling which like the sky was tinted a vivid cerulean blue she personifies every virtue she is delectable he pursed his wet lips daintily picked a kiss from between them with his thumb and finger and snapped it into the air inasmuch as isabel had always hated the girl venomously she did not trust herself to comment upon her callers enthusiasm she is now eighteen the fat suitor went on ecstatically and so altogether charming but why waste time in pretty speeches i have decided to marry her de castano plucked a heavily scented silk handkerchief from his pocket and wiped a beading of moisture from his brow and upper lip he had a habit of perspiring when roused from his usual lethargy rosa has a will of her own guardedly ventured the stepmother don mario broke out testily naturally so have we all now let us speak plainly you know me i am a person of importance i am rich enough to afford what i want and i pay well you understand well then you are rosas guardian and you can bend her to your desires if that were only so exclaimed the woman she and esteban what children what tempers just like their fathers they have never liked me they disobey me at every opportunity they exercise the most diabolical ingenuity in making my life miserable they were to be their fathers heirs you know and they blame me for his death for our poverty and for all the other misfortunes that have overtaken us we live like cats and dogs don mario had been drumming his fat fingers impatiently upon the arm of his chair now he exclaimed your pardon senora but i am just now very little interested in your domestic relations they do not thrill me as my own prospective happiness does what you say about rosa only makes me more eager for i loathe a sleepy woman now tell me is she has she anyaffairs of the heart nno unless perhaps a flirtation with that young american juan oreilly dona isabel gave the name its spanish pronunciation of orailye juan oreilly oreilly oh yes but what has he to offer a woman he is little more than a clerk that is what i tell her oh it hasnt gone far as yet good don mario rose to leave for the exertion of his ride had made him thirsty you may name your own reward for helping me and i will pay it the day rosa marries me now kindly advise her of my intentions and tell her i shall come to see her soon it was quite true that johnnie oreilly or the oreilly as his friends called him had little in the way of worldly advantage to offer any girl and it was precisely because of this fact that he had accepted a position here in cuba where from the very nature of things promotion was likely to be more rapid than in the new york office of his firm he had come to this outoftheway place prepared to live the lonely life of an exile if an oreilly could be lonely anywhere and for a brief time he had been glum enough but the oreillys from time immemorial had been born and bred to exile it was their breath their meat and drink and this particular member of the clan thrived upon it quite as well as had the other johnnies and michaels and andys who had journeyed to far shores the oreillys were audacious men a bit too heedless of their own good perhaps a bit too lighthearted readily to impress a grave world with their varied abilities but sterling men for all that ambitious men men with lime in their bones and possessed of a high and ready chivalry that made friends for them wherever their wandering feet strayed spain france and the two americas had welcomed oreillys of one sort or another even cuba had the family name written large upon her scroll so johnnie of new york and matanzas although at first he felt himself a stranger in a strange land was not so considered by the cubans a dancing eye speaks every language a singing heart gathers its own audience before the young irishamerican had more than a bowing acquaintance with the commonest spanish verbs he had a calling acquaintance with some of the most exclusive people of matanzas he puzzled them to be sure for they could not fathom the reason for his everbubbling gladness but they strove to catch its secret and striving they made friends with him oreilly did not puzzle their daughters nearly so much more than one aristocratic senorita felt sure that she quite understood the tall blond stranger with the laughing eyes or could understand him if he gave her half a chance and so as had been the case with other oreillys in other lands johnnies exile became no exile at all he had adjusted himself serenely to his surroundings when rosa varona returned from school but with her coming away went all his complacency his contentment vanished he experienced a total change in his opinions his hopes and his ambitions he discovered for example that matanzas was by no means the outoftheway place he had considered it on the contrary after meeting rosa once by accident twice by design and three times by mutual arrangement it had dawned upon him that this was the chief city of cuba if not perhaps the hub around which the whole world revolved certainly it was the most agreeable of all cities since it contained everything that was necessary for mans happiness yet despite the thrill of his awakening oreilly was not at all pleased with himself for as it happened there was another girl back home and during his first year of loneliness he had written to her more freely and more frequently than any man on such a salary as his had a right to do oreilly laid no claims to literary gifts nevertheless it seemed to him as he looked back upon it that his pen must have been dipped in magic and in moonlight for the girl had expressed an eager willingness to share his interesting economic problems and in fact was waiting for him to give her the legal right inasmuch as her father was oreillys company it may be seen that rosa varonas homecoming seriously complicated matters not only from a sentimental but from a business standpoint it was in a thoughtful mood that he rode up la cumbre toward the quinta de esteban late on the afternoon of don marios visit instead of going directly to the house as the merchant had done oreilly turned off from the road and after tethering his horse in a cluster of guava bushes proceeded on foot he did not like dona isabel nor did dona isabel like him moreover he had a particular reason for avoiding her today just inside the varona premises he paused an instant to admire the outlook the quinta commanded an excellent view of the yumuri on the one hand and of the town and harbor on the other no one ever climbed the hill from the city to gaze over into that hidden valley without feeling a pleasurable surprise at finding it still there we are accustomed to think of perfect beauty as unsubstantial evanescent but the yumuri never changed and in that lay its supremest wonder through what had once been welltended grounds oreilly made his way to a sort of sunken garden which in spite of neglect still remained the most charming nook upon the place and there he sat down to wait for rosa the hollow was effectually screened from view by a growth of plantain palm orange and tamarind trees over the rocky walls ran a profusion of flowering plants and vines in the center of the open space was an old well its masonry curb all but crumbled away when rosa at last appeared oreilly felt called upon to tell her somewhat dizzily that she was beyond doubt the sweetest flower on all the quinta de esteban and since this somewhat hackneyed remark was the boldest speech he had ever made to her she blushed prettily flashing him a dimpled smile of mingled pleasure and surprise oh but i assure you im in no sweet temper said she just now im tremendously angry why its that stepmother isabel so youve been quarreling again eh well shes the easiest woman in all matanzas to quarrel with perhaps the only one who doesnt see something good in me im afraid to talk to her for fear shed convince me im wholly abominable rosa laughed showing her fine regular teeth oreilly thought he had never seen teeth so even and white yes she is a difficult person if she dreamed that i see you as often as i do well rosa lifted her eloquent hands and eyes heavenward i suppose thats why i enjoy doing it i so dearly love to spite her i see oreilly puckered his brows and nodded but why in that case havent you seen me oftener we might just as well have made the good ladys life totally unbearable silly she knows nothing about it with a flirtatious sigh rosa added thats what robs the affair of its chief pleasure since it does not bother her in the least i think i will not allow you to come any more after judicious consideration oreilly pretended to agree theres no fun in wreaking a horrible revenge when your enemy isnt wise to it he acknowledged since its your idea to irritate your stepmother perhaps it would annoy her more if i made love directly to her rosa tittered and then inquired naively can you make love senor can i its the one ability an oreilly inherits listen to this now reaching forth he took rosas fingers in his wait he cried as she resisted pretend that youre mrs varona your own stepmother and that this is her dimpled hand im holding ohh the girl allowed his grasp to remain but isabels hand isnt dimpled its thin and bony ive felt it on my ears often enough dont interrupt he told her isabel my little darling little la la shes as tall and ugly as a chimney hush ive held my tongue as long as i can but now its running away of its own accord and i must tell you how mad i am about you the first time i saw you it was at the ball in the spanish club again rosa drew away sharply at which oreilly laid his other hand over the one in his palm saying quickly you and your stepdaughter rosa do you remember that first waltz of ours sure i thought i was in heaven with you in my arms and your eyes shining into mine and i told you so so you make the same pretty speeches to all women eh the girl reproached him isabel sweetheart i lose my breath when i think of you my lips pucker up for kisses isabel exclaimed a voice and the lovers started guiltily apart they turned to find esteban rosas twin brother staring at them oddly isabel he repeated whats this you interrupted our theatricals i was rehearsing an impassioned proposal to your beloved stepmother oreilly explained with a pretense of annoyance yes senor oreilly believes he can infuriate isabel by laying siege to her hes a foolish person rosas cheeks were faintly flushed and her color deepened at the amusement in estebans eyes he makes love wretchedly what little i overheard wasnt bad esteban declared then he took oreillys hand esteban was a handsome boy straight slim and manly and his resemblance to rosa was startling with a look engaging in its frank directness he said rosa told me about your meetings here and i came to apologize for our stepmothers discourtesy im sorry we cant invite you into our house but you understand rosa and i are not like her we are quite liberal in our views we are almost americans as you see i dare say thats what makes isabel hate americans so bitterly wouldnt it please her to know that im becoming cubanized as fast as ever i can ventured the caller oh she hates cubans too laughed the brother shes spanish you know well its fortunate you didnt see her today brr what a temper we had our theatricals too i asked her for money as usual and as usual she refused it was like a scene from a play shell walk in her sleep tonight if ever rosa nodded soberly and oreilly suppressing some light reply that had sprung to his lips inquired curiously what do you mean by that brother and sister joined in explaining that dona isabel was given to peculiar actions especially after periods of excitement or anger and that one of her eccentricities had taken the form of somnambulistic wanderings oh shes crazy enough esteban concluded i believe its her evil conscience rosa explained further she used to steal about at night hoping to surprise papa or sebastian going or coming from the treasure they were both killed as you know and the secret of the hidingplace was lost now isabel declares that they come to her in her sleep and that she has to help them hunt for it whether she wishes or not it is retribution the speaker drew up her shoulders and shivered but esteban smiled bah he exclaimed ill believe in ghosts when i see one then with a shake of his head isabel has never given up the hope of finding that treasure she would like to see rosa married and me fighting with the insurrectos so that she might have a free hand in her search oreilly scanned the speaker silently for a moment then he said with a gravity unusual in him i wonder if you know that youre suspected of working for the insurrecto cause indeed i didnt know well its a fact oreilly heard rosa gasp faintly is it true he asked i am a cuban estebans smile was a trifle grim cuban your people were spanish true but no spaniard ever raised a spanish child in cuba we are cubans rosa and i at this statement the sister cried hush it is dangerous to speak in that way with this new war growing every day but oreilly is our good friend esteban protested of course i am the american agreed and for that reason i spoke i hope youre not too deeply involved with the rebels there esteban do you hear turning to oreilly rosa said imploringly please reason with him hes young and headstrong and he wont listen to me esteban frowned young eh well sometimes the young are called upon to do work that older men wouldnt care to undertake what work oreillys eyes were still upon him you can tell me i think i can the other agreed well then i know everybody in matanzas i go everywhere and the spanish officers talk plainly before me somebody must be the eyes and the ears for colonel lopez colonel lopez exclaimed oreilly esteban nodded rosas face as she looked at the two men was white and worried for a time the three of them sat silent then the american said slowly youll be shot if youre caught rosa whispered yes think of it some one must run chances esteban averred were fighting tyranny all cuba is ablaze i must do my part but sooner or later youll be discovered then what persisted oreilly esteban shrugged who knows therell be time enough when what of rosa at this question the brother stirred uneasily and dropped his eyes oreilly laid a hand upon his arm you have no right to jeopardize her safety without you to whom could she turn the girl flashed her admirer a grateful glance senor you for one would see that she but im going away oreilly felt rather than saw rosa start for his face was averted purposely he kept his gaze upon esteban for he didnt wish to see the slow pallor that rose in the girls cheeks the look of pain that crept into her eyes i came here to tell you both goodby i may be gone for some time i i dont know when i can get back im sorry esteban told him with genuine regret we have grown very fond of you you will leave many friends here in matanzas im sure but you will come back before long eh yes as soon as i can that is if he did not finish the sentence good youre one of us in the mean time ill remember what you say and at least ill be careful by no means wanting in tact esteban rose briskly and after shaking hands with oreilly left the two lovers to say farewell as best suited them but for once oreillys ready tongue was silent the laughter was gone from his blue eyes when he turned to the girl at his side you say you are going away rosa inquired breathlessly but why im going partly because of this war and partly because of something else i tried to tell you yesterday but i couldnt when the revolution started everybody thought it was merely a local uprising and i wrote my company to that effect but bless you it has spread like fire and now the whole eastern end of the island is ablaze esteban says it will be more terrible than the ten years war god forbid and yet all the old fighters are back again nobody believed that maximo gomez had returned but its true and the maceos are here too from costa rica antonio has already gained control of most of santiago province and hes sweeping westward of course the spaniards minimize the reports of his success and we here dont understand whats really going on anyhow business has stopped and my employers have ordered me home to find out whats happened to their profits they seem to hold me personally responsible for this insurrection i see and when you have told them the truth you will come back is that it i perhaps you said there was something else oreillys hesitation became an embarrassed silence he tried to laugh it off there is otherwise id stay right here and tell my penurious friends to whistle for their profits it seems im cursed with a fatal beauty you may have noticed it no well perhaps its a magnificent business ability that i have anyhow the president of my company has a notion that id make him a good soninlaw i oh cried rosa and at her tone oreilly hurried on these rich men have the most absurd ideas i suppose ill have to then you are in love senor the young man nodded vigorously indeed i am with the sweetest girl in cuba thats the whole trouble thats why im hurrying home to resign before im fired not daring to look too long or too deeply into rosa varonas eyes until she had taken in the whole truth he waited staring at his feet im sort of glad it has come to a showdown and i can speak out im hoping shell miss me after a moment he ventured will she er will you rosa i miss you rosa lifted her brows in pretended amazement then she tipped her head daintily to one side as if weighing his question earnestly you are amusing of course but i wont have much time to think about you for i am so soon to be married married what oreilly started violently and the girl exclaimed with wellfeigned concern oh senor you have wounded yourself again on that thornbush this place is growing up to brambles it wasnt my finger something pierced me through the heart married nonsense indeed do you think im so ugly nobody would have me good lord you oreilly swallowed hard i wont tell you the truth when you know it so well the richest man in matanzas asked for my hand this very afternoon who mario de castano yes oreilly laughed with relief and though rosa tried to look offended she was forced to smile hes fat i know she admitted and he makes funny noises when he breathes but he is richer than croesus and i adore rich men i hate em announced oreilly then for a second time he took rosas dimpled hand saying earnestly im sure you know now why i make love so badly dear its my irish conscience and youll wait until i come back wont you will you be gone very long she asked oreilly looked deeply now into the dark eyes turned to his and found that at last there was no coquetry in them anywhere nothing but a lonesome hungry yearning and with a glad incoherent exclamation he held out his arms rosa varona crept into them then with a sigh she upturned her lips to his ill wait forever she said iv retribution although for a long time dona isabel had been sure in her own mind that pancho cueto her administrador was robbing her she had never mustered courage to call him to a reckoning and there was a reason for her cowardice nevertheless de castanos blunt accusation coupled with her own urgent needs served to fix her resolution and on the day after the merchants visit she sent for the overseer who at the time was living on one of the plantations once the message was on its way isabel fell into a condition bordering upon panic and was half minded to countermand her order she spent an evening of suspense and a miserable night this last however was nothing unusual with her she was accustomed to unpleasant dreams and she was not surprised when old familiar shapes came to harass her nor in view of her somnambulistic vagaries was she greatly concerned to find when she woke in the morning that her slippers were stained and that her skirt was bedraggled with dew and filled with burs scarcely a month passed that she did not walk in her sleep cueto was plainly curious to learn why he had been sent for but since he asked no questions his employer was forced to open the subject herself several times he led up to it unsuccessfully then she took the plunge through dry white lips she began my dear pancho times are hard the plantations are failing and so pancho cuetos eyes were set close to his nose his face was long and thin and harsh he regarded the speaker with such a sinister unblinking stare that she could scarcely finish and so i can no longer afford to retain you as administrador times will improve he said impossible this war threatens to bring utter ruin and now that esteban and rosa are home they spend money like water i groan with poverty yes they are extravagant it is the more reason for me to remain in your service no no i tell you im bankrupt so then the remedy is simple sell a part of your land although this suggestion came naturally enough dona isabel turned cold and felt her smile stiffen into a grimace she wondered if cueto could be feeling her out deliberately sell the varona lands she queried after a momentary struggle with herself esteban would rise from his grave no it was his wish that the plantations go to his children intact and his wish is sacred to you eh cueto nodded his approval although his smile was disconcerting an admirable sentiment it does you honor but speaking on this subject i am reminded of that dispute with jose oroz over the boundary to la joya he is a rascal that oroz he would steal the sap out of your standing cane if he could i have promised to show him the original deed to la joya and to furnish him with the proofs about the boundary line that would be better than a lawsuit wouldnt it decidedly but i will settle with him myself cueto lifted an admonitory hand his face alight with the faintest glimmer of ironic mirth i couldnt trust you to the mercies of that rascal he said piously no i shall go on as i am even at a sacrifice to myself i love don estebans children as my very own and you senora isabel knew that she must win a complete victory at once or accept irretrievable defeat never she interrupted with a tone of finality i cant accept your sacrifice i am not worthy kindly arrange to turn over your books of account at once i shall make you as handsome a present as my circumstances will permit in recognition of your long and faithful service then pancho cueto did an unexpected thing he laughed shortly and shook his head dona isabel was ready to faint and her voice quavered as she went on understand me we part the best of friends despite all i have heard against you i do not believe these stories people tell for you probably have enemies even if all they say were true i should force myself to be lenient because of your affection for my husband the man rose still smiling it is i who have been lenient said he eh speak plainly gladly i have long suspected that don esteban hid the deeds of his property with the rest of his valuables and now that you admit dona isabel recoiled sharply admit are you mad deeds what are you talking about her eyes met his bravely enough but she could feel her lips trembling loosely casting aside all pretense the overseer exclaimed por el amor de dios an end to this i know why you sent for me you think i have been robbing you well to be honest so i have why should i toil as i do while you and those twins live here in luxury and idleness squandering money to which you have no right have i lost my reason gasped the widow no right at least no better right than i dont you understand you have no title to those plantations they are mine for i have paid the taxes out of my own pockets now these many years taxes what do you mean i paid them the receipts are in my name god such perfidy and you who knew him the deeds have been lost for so long that the property would have reverted to the crown had it not been for me you doubt that eh well appeal to the court and you will find that it is true for that matter the officials make new laws to fit each case and should they learn that esteban varona died intestate they would arrange somehow to seize all his property and leave you without a roof over your head fortunately i can prevent that for i have a title that will stand in want of a better one there was a momentary silence while the unhappy woman struggled with herself then you took advantage of my ignorance of business to rob me she declared well i know something about the government officials if they would make a law to fit my case they will make one to fit yours when i tell them what you have done perhaps you will not fare so well with them as you expect she was fighting now with the desperation of one cornered perhaps cueto shrugged that is what i want to talk to you about if only you will be sensible now then let us be frank inasmuch as were both in much the same fix hadnt we better continue our present arrangements he stared unblinkingly at his listener oh i mean it is it not better for you to be content with what my generosity prompts me to give rather than to risk ruin for both of us by grasping for too much merciful god the outrage i warrant you have grown rich through your stealing isabels voice had gone flat with consternation rich well not exactly but comfortably well off cueto actually smiled again no doubt my frankness is a shock to you you are angry at my proposition eh never mind you will think better of it in time if you are a sensible woman what a fiend have you no sentiment oh senora i am all sentiment don esteban was my benefactor i revere his memory and i feel it my duty to see that his family does not want that is why i have provided for you and will continue to provide in proper measure but now since at last we enjoy such confidential relations let us have no more of these miserable suspicions of each other let us entirely forget this unpleasant misunderstanding and be the same good friends as before having said this pancho cueto stood silent a moment in polite expectancy then receiving no intelligible reply he bowed low and left the room to the avaricious dona isabel cuetos frank acknowledgment of theft was maddening and the realization that she was helpless nay dependent upon his charity for her living fairly crucified her proud spirit all day she brooded and by the time evening came she had worked herself into such a state of nerves that she could eat no dinner locking herself into her room she paced the floor now wringing her hands now twisting in agony upon her bed now biting her wrists in an endeavor to clear her head and to devise some means of outwitting this treacherous overseer but mere thought of the law frightened her the longer she pondered her situation the more she realized her own impotence there was no doubt that the courts were corrupt they were notoriously venal at best and this war had made them worse graft was rampant everywhere to confess publicly that esteban varona had left no deeds no title to his property would indeed be the sheerest folly no cueto had her at his mercy sometime during the course of the evening a wild idea came to isabel knowing that the manager would spend the night beneath her roof she planned to kill him at first it seemed a simple thing to do merely a matter of a dagger or a pistol while he slept but further thought revealed appalling risks and difficulties and she decided to wait poison was far safer that night she lay awake a long time putting her scheme into final shape and then for an interval that seemed longer she hung poised in those penumbral regions midway between wakefulness and slumber through her mind meanwhile there passed a whirling phantasmagoria an interminable procession of figures of memories real yet unreal convincing yet unconvincing when she did at last lose all awareness of reality the effect was merely to enhance the vividness of those phantoms to lend substance to her vaporous visions constant brooding over the treasure had long since affected dona isabels brain and as a consequence she often dreamed about it she dreamed about it again tonight and strangely enough her dreams were pleasant sebastian appeared but for once he neither cursed nor threatened her and esteban when he came was again the lover who had courted her in habana it was all very wonderful very exciting very real dona isabel found herself robed for him in her weddinggown of white and realized that she was beautiful it seemed also as if her powers of attraction were magically enhanced for she exercised a potent influence over him her senses were quickened a thousandfold too for instance she could see great distances a novel and agreeable sensation she enjoyed strange unsuspected perfumes she heard the music of distant waterfalls and understood the whispered language of the breeze it was amazing delightful esteban and she were walking through the grounds of the quinta and he was telling her about his casks of spanish sovereigns about those boxes bound with iron about the gold and silver ornaments of heavenly beauty and the pearls as large as plums as he talked isabel felt herself grow hot and cold with anticipation she experienced spasms of delight she felt that she must dance must run must cast her arms aloft in ecstasy never had she experienced so keen an intoxication of joy as now while esteban was leading her toward the treasure and wooing her with youthful ardor then of a sudden isabels whole dreamworld dissolved she awoke or thought she did at hearing her name shouted but although she underwent the mental and the physical shock of being startled from slumber although she felt the first swift fright of a person aroused to strange surroundings she knew on the instant that she must still be asleep for everything about her was dim and dark the air was cold and damp wet grass rose to her knees it flashed through her mind that she had simply been whirled from a pleasant dream into one of terror as she fought with herself to throw off the illusion of this nightmare its reality became overwhelming warring incongruous sensations far too swift for her mind to compass were crowded into the minutest fraction of time before she could half realize her own condition she felt herself plunged into space now the sensation of falling was not strange to isabel it is common to all sufferers from nightmare nevertheless she experienced the dawn of a horror such as she had never guessed she heard herself scream hoarsely fearfully and knew too late that she was indeed awake then whirling chaos a sudden blinding crash of lights and sounds nothing more esteban varona sat until a late hour that night over a letter which required the utmost care in its composition it was written upon the thinnest of paper and when it was finished the writer inclosed it in an envelope of the same material esteban put the letter in his pocket without addressing it then he extinguished his light tiptoed to the door connecting his and rosas rooms and listened no sound whatever came to his ears for his sister slept like a kitten reassured he stole out into the hall here he paused a moment with his ear first to pancho cuetos door and then to the door of his stepmothers room he could hear the overseers heavy breathing and isabels senseless babbling the latter was moaning and muttering ceaselessly but being accustomed to her restlessness esteban paid no heed letting himself out into the night he took the path that led to the old sunken garden nocturnal birds were chirruping his way was barred with spiderwebs heavy with dew and gleaming in the moonlight like tiny ropes of jewels the odor of gardenias was overpowering he passed close by the well and its gaping black mouth only half protected by the broken coping reminded him that he had promised rosa to cover it with planks in its present condition it was a menace to animals if not to human beings who were unaware of its presence he told himself he would attend to it on the morrow seating himself on one of the old stone benches the young man lit a cigarette and composed himself to wait he sat there for a long time grumbling inwardly for the night was damp and he was sleepy but at last a figure stole out of the gloom and joined him the newcomer was a ragged negro dressed in the fashion of the poorer country people well asensio i thought youd never come ill get a fever from this esteban said irritably it is a long way don esteban and evangelina made me wait until dark i tell you we have to be careful these days what is the news what did you hear asensio sighed gratefully as he seated himself one hears a great deal but one never knows what to believe there is fighting in santa clara and maceo sweeps westward taking the unaddressed letter from his pocket esteban said i have another message for colonel lopez that lopez hes here today and there tomorrow one can never find him well you must find him and immediately asensio this letter contains important news so important in fact esteban laughed lightly that if you find yourself in danger from the spaniards id advise you to chew it up and swallow it as quickly as you can ill remember that said the negro for theres danger enough still i fear these spaniards less than the guerrilleros they are everywhere they call themselves patriots but they are nothing more than robbers they asensio paused abruptly he seized his companion by the arm and leaning forward stared across the level garden into the shadows opposite something was moving there under the trees the men could see that it was white and formless and that it pursued an erratic course whats that gasped the negro he began to tremble violently and his breath became audible esteban was compelled to hold him down by main force jesus cristo its old don esteban your father they say he walks at midnight carrying his head in his two hands young varona managed to whisper with some show of courage hush wait i dont believe in ghosts nevertheless he was on the point of setting asensio an example of undignified flight when the mysterious object emerged from the shadows into the open moonlight then he sighed with relief ahh now i see it is my stepmother she is asleep asleep asensio was incredulous he was still so unnerved by his first fright that esteban dared not release him yes her eyes are open but she sees nothing i dont like such things the negro confessed in a shaky voice how can she walk if she is asleep if her eyes are open how can she help seeing us you know she hates evangelina and me i tell you she sees nothing knows nothing for a moment or two they watched the progress of the whiterobed figure then esteban stirred and rose from his seat shes too close to that well there is he started forward a pace or two they say people who walk at night go mad if theyre awakened too suddenly and yet dona isabel was talking in a low throaty unnatural tone her words were meaningless but the effect at that hour and in those surroundings was bizarre and fearsome esteban felt his scalp prickling uncomfortably this was very creepy when the somnambulists deliberate progress toward the mouth of the well continued he called her name softly dona isabel then he repeated it louder dona isabel wake up the woman seemed to hear and yet not to hear she turned her head to listen but continued to walk dont be alarmed he said reassuringly it is only esteban dona isabel stop esteban sprang forward shouting at the top of his voice for at the sound of his name isabel had abruptly swerved to her right a movement which brought her dangerously close to the lip of the well stop go back screamed the young man above his warning there came a shriek shrill and agonized a wail of such abysmal terror as to shock the night birds and the insects into stillness dona isabel slipped or stumbled to her knees she balanced briefly clutching at random while the earth and crumbling cement gave way beneath her then she slid forward and disappeared almost out from between estebans hands there was a noisy rattle of rock and pebble and a great splash far below a chuckle of little stones striking the water then a faint bubbling nothing more the stepson stood in his tracks sick blind with horror he was swaying over the opening when asensio dragged him back pancho cueto being a heavy sleeper was the last to be roused by estebans outcries when he had hurriedly slipped into his clothes in response to the pounding on his door the few servants that the establishment supported had been thoroughly awakened esteban was shouting at them explaining that dona isabel had met with an accident he was calling for a lantern too and a stout rope cueto thought they must all be out of their minds until he learned what had befallen the mistress of the house then being a man of action he too issued swift orders with the result that by the time he and esteban had run to the well both rope and lantern were ready for their use before esteban could form and fit a loop for his shoulders there was sufficient help on hand to lower him into the treacherous abyss it was a commentary upon dona isabels character that during the long slow moments of uncertainty while esteban was being lowered the negroes exhibited more curiosity than concern over her fate in halfpleased excitement they whispered and giggled and muttered together while pancho lay prone at the edge of the orifice directing them how to manipulate the rope that was a gruesome task which fell to esteban for the well had been long unused its sides were oozing slime its waters were stale and black he was on the point of fainting when he finally climbed out leaving the negroes to hoist the dripping inert weight which he had found at the bottom old sebastians curse had come true dona isabel had met the fate he had called down upon her that day when he hung exhausted in his chains and when the flies tormented him the treasure for which the woman had intrigued so tirelessly had been her death like an ignis fatuus it had lured her to destruction furthermore as if in orirnmest irony she had been permitted at the very last to find it living she had searched to no purpose whatsoever dying she had almost grasped it in her arms once the first excitement had abated and a messenger had been sent to town cueto drew esteban aside and questioned him a shocking tragedy and most peculiar said the overseer nothing could amaze me more exactly and all because of her sleepwalking im all in a tremble she was asleep you are sure have i not told you so esteban was impatient but it is said that people given to that peculiarity never come to grief they say some sixth sense guides them gives them warning of pitfalls and dangers i i cant understand that well was a menace to a waking person i didnt realize how near to it she was and when i cried out to her it seemed only to hasten her steps the young man shuddered for the horror of the thing was still in his mind tell me how did you come to be there at such an hour eh esteban saw the malevolent curiosity in cuetos face and started i that is my affair surely you dont think come come you can trust me the overseer winked and smiled i had business that took me there stiffly declared the younger man exactly and a profitable business it proved cueto laughed openly now well i dont mind telling you dona isabels death is no disappointment to any one anybody could see stop esteban was turning alternately red and white you seem to imply something outrageous now let us be sensible i understand you perfectly my boy but an officer of the guardia civil may arrive at any moment and he will want to know how you came to be with your stepmother when she plunged into that trap so prepare yourself if only you had not given the alarm if only you had waited until morning but in the dead of night alone he will think it queer suppose too he learns that you and dona isabel quarreled the other day over money matters young varona recovered himself quickly he was watching his inquisitor now with a faintly speculative frown when cueto had finished esteban said dona isabel and i frequently quarreled over money matters so there is nothing strange in that you would like me to confess to some black iniquity that would make us better friends eh well it so happens that i was not alone tonight but that another person saw the poor womans death and can bear me out in everything i say no pancho you overreach yourself now then esteban was quicktempered and for years he had struggled against an instinctive distrust and dislike of the plantation manager remember that i have become the head of this house and your employer you will do better to think of your own affairs than of mine do you understand me i have long suspected that certain matters of yours need attention and at the first opportunity i intend to have a careful reckoning with you i think you know i have a good head for figures turning his back upon the elder man he walked away now it did not occur to cueto really to doubt the boys innocence though the circumstances of dona isabels death were suspicious enough to raise a question in any mind but in view of estebans threat he thought it wise to protect himself by setting a backfire it was with some such vague idea in his head that he turned to the sunken garden as the first gray light of dawn appeared he hoped to gain some inspiration by examining the place again and as it proved he succeeded beyond his most sanguine expectations as he sat on an old stone bench moodily repicturing the catastrophe as esteban had described it his attention fell upon an envelope at his feet it was sealed it was unaddressed cueto idly broke it open and began to read before he had gone far he started then he cast a furtive glance about but the place was secluded he was unobserved when he finished reading he rose smiling he no longer feared esteban on the contrary he rather pitied the young fool for here between his fingers was that which not only promised to remove the boy from his path forever but to place in his hands the entire varona estates fate was kind after years of patient scheming cueto had obtained his reward one afternoon perhaps a week later don mario de castano came puffing and blowing up to the quinta demanding to see rosa without a moments delay the girl appeared before her caller had managed to dry up the streams of perspiration resulting from his exertions with a directness unusual even in him don mario began rosa my dear you and esteban have been discovered i was at lunch with the comandante when i learned the truth through friendship i prevailed upon him to give you an hours grace what do you mean don mario inquired the girl come come the planter cried impatiently dont you see you can trust me god the recklessness the folly of young people could you not leave this insurrection to your elders or perhaps you thought it a matter of no great importance an amusing thing don mario rosa interrupted i dont know what you are talking about you dont eh the callers wet cheeks grew redder he blew like a porpoise then call esteban quickly there is not a moment to lose when the brother appeared de castano blurted out at him accusingly well sir a fine fix youve put yourself in i came here to warn you but rosa pretends ignorance perhaps you will be interested to learn that colonel fernandez has issued orders to arrest you and your sister as agents of the insurrectos what esteban drew back rosa turned white as a lily and laid a fluttering hand upon her throat you two will sleep tonight in san severino grimly announced the rotund visitor you know what that means cubans who enter the castillo seldom come out have you noticed the big sharks that swim about under the walls of it do you know what bait keeps them there well ill tell you its the bodies of rebel sympathizersfoolish people like you who call themselves patriots rosa uttered a smothered cry colonel fernandez don mario proceeded impressively did me this favor knowing me to be a suitor for rosas hand in spite of his duty and the evidence he evidence what evidence esteban asked sharply for one thing your own letter to lopez the rebel warning him to beware of the trap prepared for him in santa clara and advising him of the government force at sabanilla oh dont try to deny it i read it with my own eyes and it means death in the ensuing silence the fat mans asthmatic breathing sounded loudly it was like the respirations of an excited eavesdropper at last rosa said faintly esteban i warned you esteban was taken aback but it was plain that he was not in the least frightened they havent caught me yet he laughed you say they intend to arrest me also rosa eyed the caller anxiously exactly but why yes who accuses her and of what esteban indignantly demanded that also i have discovered through the courtesy of colonel fernandez your accuser is none other than pancho cueto cueto yes he has denounced both of you as rebels and the letter is only part of his proof i believe i dont know what other evidence he has but take my word for it the government does not require much proof these days suspicion is enough now then you can guess why i am here i am not without influence i can save rosa but for you esteban i fear i can do nothing you must look out for yourself well what do you say were wasting precious time standing here with our mouths open when esteban saw how pale his sister had grown he took her in his arms saying gently im sorry dear its all my fault then to the merchant it was very good of you to warn us ha don mario fanned himself im glad you appreciate my efforts its a good thing to have the right kind of a friend ill marry rosa within an hour and i fancy my name will be a sufficient shield rosa turned to her elderly suitor and made a deep courtesy i am unworthy of the honor said she you see i i do not love you don mario love exploded the visitor god bless you what has love to do with the matter esteban will have to ride for his life in ten minutes and your property will be seized so you had better make yourself ready to go with me but rosa shook her head eh what ails you what do you expect to do i shall go with esteban said the girl this calm announcement seemed to stupefy de castano he sat down heavily in the nearest chair and with his wet handkerchief poised in one pudgy hand he stared fixedly at the speaker his eyes were round and bulging the sweat streamed unheeded from his temples he resembled some queer bloated marine monster just emerged from the sea and momentarily dazzled by the light you youre mad he finally gasped esteban tell her what it means but this esteban could not do for he himself had not the faintest notion of what was in store for him war seemed to him a glorious thing he had been told that the hills were peopled with patriots he was very young his heart was ablaze with hatred for the spaniards and for pancho cueto he longed to risk his life for a free cuba therefore he said rosa shall do as she pleases if we must be exiles we shall share each others hardships it will not be for long idiot stormed the fat man better that you gave her to the sharks below san severino there is no law no safety for women outside of the cities the island is in anarchy these patriots you talk about are the blacks the mulattoes the lowest laziest savages in cuba please don mario the girl pleaded i cannot marry you for i love another eh i love another im betrothed to oreilly the american and hes coming back to marry me de castano twisted himself laboriously out of his chair and waddled toward the door he was purple with rage and mortification on the threshold he paused to wheeze very well then go im done with both of you i would have lent you a hand with this rascal cueto but now he will fall heir to your entire property well it is a time for bandits i i unable to think of a parting speech sufficiently bitter to match his disappointment don mario plunged out into the sunlight muttering and stammering to himself within an hour the twins were on their way up the yumuri toward the home of asensio and evangelina for it was thither that they naturally turned it was well that they had made haste for as they rode down into the valley up the other side of the hill from matanzas came a squad of the guardia civil and at its head rode pancho cueto v a cry from the wilderness new york seemed almost like a foreign city to johnnie oreilly when he stepped out into it on the morning after his arrival for one thing it was bleak and cold the north wind hailing direct from baffins bay had teeth and it bit so cruelly that he was glad when he found shelter in the building which housed the offices of the carter importing company the tropics had thinned oreillys blood for the cuban winds bear a kiss instead of a sting therefore he paused in the lower hallway jostled by the morning crowds and tried to warm himself the truth is oreilly was not only cold but frightened he was far from weakhearted in fact few oreillys were that and johnnie had an ingrained selfassurance which might have been mistaken for impudence but for the winning smile that went with it yet all the way from havana he had seen in his minds eye old sam carter intrenched behind his flattopped desk and that picture had more than once caused him to forget the carefully rehearsed speech in which he intended to resign his position as an employee and his prospects as a soninlaw that desk of mr carters was always bare and orderly cleared for action like the deck of a battleship and over it many engagements had been fought for the man behind it never shirked a conflict his was a vigorous and irascible temperament compounded of oldfashioned slowburning black powder and nitroglycerine a combination of incalculable destructive power it was a perilously unstable mixture tool at times nothing less than a flame served to ignite it on other occasions the office force pussyfooted past carters door on felt soles and even then the slightest jar often caused the untoward thing to let go in either event there was a deafening roar much smoke and a deal of damage oreilly felt sure that whatever the condition of mr carters digestion or the serenity of his mind at the beginning of their interview the news he had to impart would serve as an effective detonator after which it would be every man for himself it was not the effect of his report concerning the firms unprofitable cuban connections which oreilly feared would cause the decks to heave and the ship to rock samuel carter could take calmly the most disturbing financial reverse it was the blow to his pride at learning that anybody could prefer another girl to his daughter johnnie shook his shoulders and stamped his feet but the chill in his bones refused to go he did gain courage however by thinking of rosa varona as he had last seen her with arms outstretched with eyes tearfilled with yearning lips aquiver at his going the picture warmed him magically and it was with a restored determination to make a clean breast of the matter and face the worst that he took the elevator the office force of the carter importing company looked up when the firms cuban representative entered the door but its personnel having changed as the result of one of those periodical disruptions that occurred in the inner office he was not recognized until he presented himself to mr slack samuel carters private and intimidated secretary mr slack smiled wanly and extended a clammy nerveless hand as cold and limber as a dead fish youre expected said he mr carter is waiting to see you before leaving for california seeing me wont make his trip any pleasanter oreilly said somberly we were afraid you wouldnt get out of cuba thought we might have to get the american consul at work really i didnt know i was so important oh youre the office pet and well you know it mr slacks pleasantry was tinged with envy for he had never been able to appreciate oreilly conditions are bad eh yes anybody can leave the other told him its getting back thats difficult the spaniards dont like us and i dare say they have good reason with all this talk of intervention and the secret help were lending the insurrectos they held me up in havana tried to prove i was a spy they were positively peeved when they failed snippy people those spaniards well ill tell mr carter youre here the secretary glided unobtrusively toward the private office disappeared glided softly into view again and waggled a boneless forefinger invitingly oreilly went to meet his employer as a man marches to execution his heart sank further at the welcome he received for the importer gave him a veritable embrace he patted him on the back and inquired three times as to his health oreilly was anything but cold now he was perspiring profusely and he felt his collar growing limp to shatter this old mans eager hopes would be like kicking a child in the face carter had never been so enthusiastic so demonstrative there was something almost theatrical in his greeting it dismayed oreilly immensely to realize what a hold he must have upon his employers affections although the latter had a reputation for selfcontrol he appeared to be in a perfect flutter now he assumed a boisterousness which seemed strained and wholly out of keeping with the circumstances his actions vaguely reminded the younger man of an ambling drafthorse trying to gallop and when for the fourth time mr carter inquired solicitously concerning his visitors wellbeing johnnies dismay turned to amazement with a heavy playfulness mr carter at length remarked well my boy you made a fizzle of it didnt you the tone was almost complimentary yes sir im a bright and shining failure oreilly acknowledged hopefully now dont yes sir me were friends arent we good understand i dont blame you in the least its that idiotic revolution that spoiled our business i cant understand those people lord you did splendidly under the circumstances they have reason enough to revolt oppression tyranny corruption oreilly mumbled the familiar words in a numb paralysis at mr carters jovial familiarity all latin countries are corrupt announced the importer always have been and always will be they thrive under oppression politics is purely a business proposition with those people however i dare say this uprising wont last long oreilly welcomed this trend of the conversation anything was better than fulsome praise and the discussion would delay the coming crash it seemed strange however that samuel carter should take time to discourse about generalities johnnie wondered why the old man didnt get down to cases its more than an uprising sir he said the rebels have overrun the eastern end of the island and when i left maceo and gomez were sweeping west bah it takes money to run a war they have money desperately argued oreilly marti raised more than a million dollars and every cuban cigarmaker in the united states gives a part of his wages every week to the cause the best blood of cuba is in the fight the rebels are poorly armed but if our government recognizes their belligerency theyll soon fix that spain is about busted she cant stand the strain i predict theyll quit fighting as soon as they get hungry the government is starving them out however theyve wound up our affairs for the time being and mr carter carefully shifted the position of an inkwell a calendar and a paperknife that brings us to a consideration of your and my affairs doesnt it ahem you remember our bargain i was to give you a chance and you were to make good before you er planned any er matrimonial foolishness with my daughter yes sir oreilly felt that the moment had come for his carefully rehearsed speech but unhappily he could not remember how the swansong started he racked his brain for the opening words mr carter too was unaccountably silent he opened his lips then closed them both men after an awkward pause cleared their throats in unison and eyed each other expectantly another moment dragged past then they chorused i have an unpleasant each broke off at the echo of his own words whats that inquired the importer nnothing you were saying i was thinking how lucky it is that you and elsa waited hmm very fortunate again mr carter rearranged his desk fittings she has deep feelings got a conscience too conscience is a fine thing in a woman so few of em have it we sometimes differ elsa and i but when she sets her heart on a thing i see that she gets it even if i think she oughtnt to have it whats the use of having children if you cant spoil em eh he looked up with a sort of resentful challenge and when his listener appeared to agree with him he sighed with satisfaction early marriages are silly but she seems to think otherwise maybe shes right anyhow shes licked me im done she wants to be married right away before we go west thats why i waited to see you at once youre a sensible fellow johnnie no foolishness about you you wont object will you we men have to take our medicine its quite out of the question stammered the unhappy oreilly come come its tough on you i know but the fuse had begun to sputter johnnie had a horrified vision of himself being dragged unwillingly to the altar elsa is going to have what she wants if i have to break something if youll be sensible ill stand behind you like a father and teach you the business im getting old and ethelbert could never learn it otherwise the old mans jaw set his eyes began to gleam angrily who is ethelbert faintly inquired oreilly why dammit hes the fellow ive been telling you about hes not so bad as he sounds hes really a nice boy elsa is in love with another man is that what you mean good lord yes dont you understand english i didnt think youd take it so hard i was going to make a place for you here in the office but of course if say what the deuce ails you samuel carter stared with amazement for the injured victim of his daughters fickleness had leaped to his feet and was shaking his hand vigorously meanwhile uttering unintelligible sounds that seemed to signify relief pleasure delight anything except what the old man expected are you crazy or am i he queried yes sir delirious its this way sir ive changed my mind too oh you have ive met the dearest sweetest oreilly choked then began again the dearest loveliest never mind the birdcalls dont coo i get enough of that at home dont tell me shes dearer and sweeter than elsa another girl well ill be damned young man youre a fool yes sir slightly mollified by this ready acknowledgment mr carter grunted with relief humph it turned out better than i thought why i i was positively terrified when you walked in and to think you didnt need any sympathy i do need that job though it will enable me to get married nonsense better wait i dont believe in early engagements oh yes you do well that depends but say youre a pretty nervy youth to turn down my daughter and then hold me up for a job all in the same breath here dont dance on my rug i ought to be offended and i am but get out while i telephone elsa so she can dance too oreilly spent that evening in writing a long letter to rosa varona during the next few days his high spirits proved a trial and an affront to mr slack who now that his employer had departed for the west had assumed a subdued and gloomy dignity to match the somber responsibilities of his position other letters went forward by succeeding posts and there was no doubt now that oreillys pen was tipped with magic he tingled when he reread what he had written he bade rosa prepare for his return and their immediate marriage the fun and the excitement of planning their future caused him to fill page after page with thrilling details of the flathunting homefitting excursions they would take upon their return to new york he wrote her ecstatic descriptions of a suite of grand rapids furniture he had priced he wasted a thousand emotional words over a set of china he had picked out and the results of a preliminary trip into the apartmenthouse district required a convulsive threepart letter to relate it is remarkable with what poetic fervor what strength of feeling a lover can describe a fiveroom flat with what glories he can furnish it out of a modest salary and still leave enough for a life of luxury but oreillys letters did not always touch upon practical things there was a wide streak of romance in him and much of what he wrote was the sort of thing which romantic lovers always write tender foolish worshipful thoughts which half abashed him when he read them over but that rosa would thrill to them he had no doubt nor had he any fear that she would hesitate to leave her native land for him oreillys love was unlimited his trust in the girl was absolute he knew moreover that she loved and trusted him this to be sure was a miracle a unique phenomenon which never ceased to amaze him he did not dream that every man had felt the same vague wonder and so the time passed rapidly but strange to say there came no answer to those letters oreilly chafed he cursed the revolution which had made communication so uncertain at length he cabled but still the days dragged on with no result gradually his impatience gave way to apprehension unreasonable conjectures besieged his mind and destroyed his peace great was his relief therefore when one day a worn stained envelope addressed in rosas hand was laid upon his desk the american stamp the key west postmark looked strange but her first letter oreilly wondered if his first letter to her could possibly have moved her as this moved him he kissed the envelope where her lips had caressed it in the sealing then with eager fingers he broke it open it was a generous epistle long and closely written but as he read his keen delight turned to dismay and when he had turned the last thin page his brain was in wildest turmoil he thought he must be dreaming he turned sick aching eyes upon his surroundings to prove this thing a nightmare but the prosaic clink of a typewriter and the drone of a voice dictating quotations on brazilian coffee were conclusive evidence to the contrary those pages between his thumb and finger were real yes and that was rosas writing could it be that he had misunderstood anything he turned to the beginning and attempted to read but his hands shook so that he was obliged to lay the letter flat upon his desk rosas spanish training had been severely tried the stiff quaint formality of her opening paragraphs only served to emphasize her final frightened cry for help my dearly beloved it is with diffidence and hesitation that i take my pen in hand for i fear you may consider me unduly forward in writing to you without solicitation believe me i appreciate the reserve which a young lady of refinement should practise even in her correspondence with the gentleman who has honored her with his promise of marriage but my circumstances are such as to banish consideration of the social niceties alas what events have followed your departure from matanzas what misfortunes have overtaken esteban and me that happiness could be so swiftly succeeded by misery that want could follow plenty that peril could tread so closely upon the heels of safety where to begin how to tell you i scarcely know my hand shakes my eyes are blinded nor dare i trust myself to believe that this letter will ever reach you for we are refugees esteban and i fugitives outcasts living in the manigua with asensio and evangelina former slaves of our father such poverty such indescribable circumstances but they were our only friends and they took us in when we were homeless so we love them i see you stare at these words i hear you say that rosa has gone mad like her wicked stepmother indeed sometimes i think i have but no i write facts it is a relief to put them down even though you never read them good asensio will take this letter on his horse to the insurrecto camp many miles away and there give it to colonel lopez our only friend who promises that in some mysterious way it will escape the eyes of our enemies and reach your country yes we have enemies we who have harmed no one wait until i tell you but if this letter reaches you and i send it with a prayer what then i dare not think too long of that for the hearts of men are not like the hearts of women what will you say when you learn that the rosa varona whom you favored with your admiration is not the rosa of today i hear you murmur the girl forgets herself but oh the standards of yesterday are gone and my reserve is gone too i am a hunted creature oreilly felt a great pain in his breast at the thought that rosa had for an instant doubted him but she did not really doubt those misgivings were but momentary the abandon of her appeal showed that in her heart of hearts she knew his love to be unshakable she had compelled herself to start with the death of dona isabel and to give him a succinct account of all that had followed oreilly read the story fascinated here amid these surroundings with the rattle of typewriters and the tinkle of telephonebells in his ears it all seemed wholly improbable fancifully unreal like the workings of some turgid melodrama that is how we came to live with asensio and his wife the letter went on imagine it a bohio hidden away far up the yumuri and so insignificant as to escape attention we are no longer people of consequence or authority our safety depends upon our inconspicuousness we hide as do the timid animals though nature has not given us their skill in avoiding danger i do not like the wilderness it frightens me at night i hear things rustling through the thatch above my head in the morning my feet touch a bare earthen floor we live on fruits and vegetables from evangelinas garden with now and then a fowl or a bite of meat when asensio is fortunate esteban does not seem to mind but i cannot accommodate myself to these barbarous surroundings sometimes i bite my tongue to keep from complaining for that i know would grieve him the whole country is in chaos there is no work nothing but suspicion hatred and violence oh what desolation this war has wrought esteban has already become a guerrillero he has stolen a cow and so we have milk for our coffee but there is only a handful of coffee left and little hope of more marauding bands of spaniards are everywhere and the country people tell atrocious tales about them how will it end how long before they will discover us and the worst will happen soon after our arrival esteban went to the camp of colonel lopez to arrange for us to join his army but returned heartbroken it was impossible it seems on my account conditions with the patriots are worse than with us here and the colonel acknowledged frankly that he could not be burdened with a woman in his command so esteban has given up for the present his dream of fighting and devotes himself to protecting me you see there is no sanctuary no help but his right arm the towns are in spanish hands the manigua is infested with lawless men and there is no place in which to hide me so i feel myself a burden esteban has plans to arm a band of his own i am numb with dread of what it may lead to for his hatred is centered upon cueto that false servant whose wickedness reduced us to this extremity esteban is so young and reckless if only you were here to counsel him if only you were here oh my dearest juan if only you were hereto take me in your arms and banish this ever constant terror at my heart if only you were here to tell me that you love me still in spite of my misfortune see the tears are falling as i write my eyes are dim my fingers trace uncertain letters on the sheet and i can only steady them when i remember that you promised to return you will return will you not i could not write like this if i were sure that you would read these lines my nightly prayerbut i will not tell you of my prayers for fate may guide this letter to you after all and the hearts of men do change in those dark hours when my doubts arise i try to tell myself that you will surely come and search me out sometimes i play a game with evangelina our only game we gather wild flowers we assort the few belongings that i managed to bring with me and i array myself for you and then i smile and laugh for a little while and she tells me i am beautiful enough to please you but the flowers fade and i know that beauty too will fade in such surroundings what then i ask myself when you return to cuba see my faith is strong again avoid matanzas for your own sake and mine don mario wanted to marry me to save me this exile but i refused i told him i was pledged to you and he was furious he is powerful he would balk you and there is always room for one more in san severino pancho cueto too living in luxury upon the fruits of his crime would certainly consider you a menace to his security you see how cunning my love for you has made me if i could come to you i would but i am marked so if you still desire me you must search me out you will i pin my faith to that as to the cross to doubt would be to perish if we should have to find another hidingplace and that is always likely you can learn of our whereabouts from colonel lopez alas if you had asked me to go with you that day i would have followed you for my heart beat then as it beats today for you alone the candle is burning low and it will soon be daylight and then this letter must begin its long uncertain journey i must creep into my bed now to pray and then to dream it is cold before the dawn and the thatch above me rustles i am very poor and sad and lonely oreilly but my cheeks are full and red my lips could learn to smile again and you would not be ashamed of me asensio is rising he goes to find his horse and i must close god grant this reaches you some time somehow i trust the many blots upon the paper will not give you a wrong impression of my writing for i am neat and i write nicely only now the ink is poor and there is very little of it there is little of anything here at asensios house except tears of those i fear there are too many to please you my juan for men do not like tears therefore i try to smile as i sign myself your loving and your faithful rosa o god come quickly if you love me vi the quest begins when oreilly had finished his second reading of the letter there were fresh blots upon the pitifully untidy pages i write nicely only the ink is poor there is little of anything here at asensios house it is cold before the dawn poor little rosa he had always thought of her as so proud so highspirited so playful but another rosa had written this letter her appeal stirred every chord of tenderness every impulse of chivalry in his impressionable irish nature she doubted him she feared he would not come to her well he would set her doubts at rest o god come quickly if you love me he leaped to his feet he dashed the tears from his eyes mr slack looked up astonished at the apparition which burst in upon him he was accustomed to oreillys high head of steam and disapproved of it but he had never seen the fellow so surcharged as now he was positively jumpy his voice was sharp his hands were unsteady his eyes were bright and blue and hard i want my salary quick johnnie began mr slack resented emotion he abominated haste he had cultivated what he considered to be a thorough commercial deliberation my dear man he said id advise you i dont want advice i want money snapped the other ive quit resigned skipped fled indeed when does your resignation take effect immediately and if you dont move like lightning it will take effect upon your person mr carter would never bother mr carter now stiffen your spine long enough to write my check if you dont oreilly compressed his lips and breathed ominously through his nostrils he laid a heavy and persuasive hand upon the secretarys shoulder hump yourself old jellyfish there was a queer wild light in oreillys eye and for once mr slack took orders from an underling he humped himself johnnies other preparations were conducted with equal vigor and promptitude within two hours his belongings were packed but for all his haste his mind was working clearly rosas warning not to come to matanzas was no doubt warranted and his own unpleasant experiences with the customs men at havana were still fresh enough to be vivid the spaniards were intensely suspicious of all americans especially incoming ones as he had reason to know and since he was nearly as well acquainted in the one place as in the other it seemed to be the part of wisdom to slip into the country through a side door the seat of war was in the east the rebels held that part of the island once there and in touch with them it would surely be no difficult task to evade the local authorities and join colonel lopez oreilly pondered these thoughts briefly then seized his hat and hastened downtown to the office of the cuban junta at this time the newspapers of the united states were devoting much space to the insular uprising the first stories of spanish atrocities later alas destined to become all too familiar were gaining public attention and there were few readers who did not know something about the activities of that body of patriots who made their headquarters at new street it was from this place that the revolution was largely financed so the papers said it was there that the filibustering expeditions supplying arms and ammunition originated to new street oreilly went there was nothing martial about the atmosphere of the juntas offices there were no war maps on the walls no stands of arms nor recruiting officers in evidence not even a hint of intrigue or conspiracy the place was rather meanly furnished and it was disappointingly commonplace a businesslike young man inquired oreillys errand johnnie made known a part of it and then asked to see some one in authority in consequence perhaps of his irish smile or of that persuasiveness which he could render almost irresistible when he willed it was not long before he gained admittance to the presence of mr enriquez a distinguished scholarly cuban of middle age you say you have important business with me the latter inquired speaking with an accent of refinement oreilly plunged boldly into the heart of the matter which had brought him thither when he had finished his tale mr enriquez inquired but how do you expect me to help you i want your advice more than your help although you might tell me where i can find colonel lopez enriquez eyed his caller keenly that information would be very well worth having said he but you understand we know little about what is going on in cuba far less than the spaniards themselves im afraid i cant help you you dont take me for a spy do you johnnie asked with his friendly grin ah you dont look like one but we never know whom to trust this young lady in whom you are interested who is she her name is varona miss rosa varona so enriquez raised his brows not by any chance the heiress to that famous varona treasure exactly if there is such a thing there ensued a pause while the cuban drummed softly upon his desk with his fingertips her brother esteban told me that he was working for your cause i warned him to be careful but oreillys voice grew suddenly husky here read this i want you to believe me reverently he laid rosas letter before her countryman im not in the habit of showing my letters to strangers but i guess thatll convince you im not a spy he sat silently while the letter was being read nor was he disappointed in the result mr enriquez raised dark compassionate eyes to his saying this is a touching letter sir i thank you for allowing me to see it no i dont doubt you now poor cuba her sons must be brave her daughters patient well you understand why i must go quickly and why i cant chance delay by going either to matanzas or to havana i want to land somewhere farther east and i want you to help me to find colonel lopez mr enriquez frowned thoughtfully what i just told you is literally true he said at last we work in the dark up here and we dont know the whereabouts of our troops we are suspicious of strangers too as we have reason to be but i have a thought he excused himself and left the room when he returned he explained i dont have to tell you that we are watched all the time and that for us to assist you openly would be liable to defeat your purpose but i have just telephoned to a man i can trust and i have told him your story he has relatives in cuba and he agrees to help you if he can his name is alvarado writing an address upon a card he handed it to oreilly go to him tell him what you have told me and do as he directs another thing dont return here unless it is necessary otherwise when you land in cuba you may have cause to regret it mr enriquez extended his hand and when oreilly tried to thank him he shook his head it is nothing i wish you success but i fear you have tackled a big proposition dr alvarado a high type of the cuban professional man was expecting oreilly he listened patiently to his callers somewhat breathless recital you do well to avoid the cities where you are known he agreed it would be madness under the circumstances even to be seen in matanzas those enemies of your friends would have you deported but just how to reach the insurrectos if youd merely give me a letter saying im a friend the doctor promptly negatived this suggestion surely you dont think it can be done as easily as that he inquired in the first place wherever you land you will be watched and probably searched such a letter if discovered would not only end your chances but it would bring certain disaster upon those to whom it was written i have no right to jeopardize the lives of those i hold dear these are perilous times for all good cubans mr oreilly enriquez told me about that poor girl she bears a famous name and i want to help her he removed his glasses and wiped them absentmindedly there are three alvarados living he resumed my two brothers tomas and ignacio reside in cuba and we all work for the cause of independence in our own ways i am fortunately situated but they are surrounded by dangers and i must ask you to be extremely careful in communicating with them for i am placing their lives in your hands and i love them dearly i shall do exactly as you say very well then go to neuvitas where tomas lives there is a steamer leaving in three of four days and you can arrange passage on her he is a dentist meet him somehow and make yourself known by repeating this sentence i come from felipe he told me how you whipped him to keep him from going to the ten years war that will be enough he will ask you who you are and what you want i see its a sort of password no ive never had reason to communicate with him in this way noting the bewilderment in oreillys face alvarado smiled you wont need to say anything more no living soul except tomas and i knows that he thrashed me but it is true i was young i wanted to go to the war but he took it out of me with a bamboo later we bound ourselves never to mention it he will understand from the message that i trust you and he will help you to reach the rebels if such a thing is possible but tell me when you have found miss varona what then why ill bring her out how do you think you can walk into any seaport and take ship you will be tagged and numbered by the authorities once you disappear into the manigua you will be a marked man well then ill marry her right there im an american citizen dont build too much on that fact either the doctor warned spanish jails are strong and your country has never compelled that respect for its nationals which other countries insist upon perhaps but the first thing is to find miss varona and learn that shes safe i dont much care what happens after that alvarado nodded and smiled good what would this world be without sentiment it loves a lover i like your spirit and i hope soon to have the pleasure of again seeing you and meeting your wife oreilly flushed and stammered whereupon the good cuban patted him on the shoulder come and see me when you get back and bring me news of tomas now adios compadre adios senor i am deeply grateful oreilly had no difficulty in securing passage direct to neuvitas on the english steamer dunham castle and a few days later he saw the atlantic highlands dissolve into the mists of a winter afternoon as the ship headed outward into a nasty running sea it proved to be a wretched trip off hatteras the dunham castle labored heavily for twelve hours and bad weather followed her clear into the old bahama channel not until she had thrust her nose into the narrow entrance of neuvitas harbor did she wholly cease her seasick plunging but then the weather changed with bewildering suddenness cuba when it came fairly into sight lay bathed in golden sunshine all warmth and welcome like a bride upon an azure couch the moist breath from her fragrant shores swept over the steamers decks and johnnie oreilly sniffed it joyfully he had brought little luggage with him only an extra suit of khaki a few toilet articles and a colts revolver the companion of his earlier cuban days he was holding the weapon in his hand debating how and where to conceal it when the first officer paused in the stateroom door and spying it exclaimed hello smuggling arms to the insurrectos eh oreilly laughed its an old friend i dont know just what to do with it ill tell you the mate volunteered lead your old friend out here to the rail shake hands with him and drop him overboard before he gets you into trouble really i mean it they wont let you land with that hardware take my tip but johnnie hesitated though his intentions were far from warlike he could not bring himself in view of his secret plans to part with his only weapon he examined his extra pair of khaki trousers and discovering a considerable surplus of cloth at each inside seam he took needle and thread and managed to sew the gun in so that it hung close against the inside of his right leg when he donned the garment it felt queer and uncomfortable but it did not appear to be noticeable so long as he stood upright with some pride in his stratagem he laid off his winter suit and changed into lighter clothing neuvitas was scorching under a midday sun when he came on deck its low square houses were glaring white here and there a splotch of vivid cuban blue stood out the rickety wormeaten piling of its waterfront resembled rows of rotten snaggly teeth smiling out of a chalky face mottled with unhealthy artificial spots of color gusts of wind from the shore brought feverish odors as if the city were sick and exhaled a tainted breath but beyond the hills were clean and green the fields were rich and ripe that was the cuba which oreilly knew a spanish transport close by was languidly discharging uniformed troops lighters of military supplies were being unloaded the sound of a bugle floated from the shore moored to the docks or anchored in the harbor were several shallowdraught tinclad coastpatrol craft from the staffs of which streamed the red and yellow bars of spain although there were but a few passengers on the dunham castle they were subjected to a long delay during which suspicious customs men searched their baggage and questioned them finally however oreilly found himself free to go ashore he had passed the ordeal handily and now he was eager to reach some lodgingplace where he could remove that revolver which knocked against his leg so awkwardly at every step once on the dock he gave his bag to a negro and led the way toward the street at the last moment however just as he was about to plant his feet upon solid earth he was halted by two men who rose from a bench where they had been idling they carried the tasseled canes of the secret service and oreilly felt his heart jump with a murmured apology one of them relieved the negro of the valise while the other began to search oreillys person for concealed weapons he began at johnnies shoulders and patted one pocket after another fanning him in the fashion approved of policemen now too late the american regretted his refusal to heed the mates warning it seemed certain that he was in for trouble but he drew his heels together and stood with the revolver pressed between his legs praying that those exploratory palms would not encounter it when the officer had slapped every pocket ending at the hips he nodded his companion snapped shut the valise and handed it back to the porter oreilly paused a moment or two later to wipe the abundant perspiration from his face even yet his pulse was pounding erratically he hoped the future held no more surprises of this sort for he feared that his nerve might fail him el gran hotel europea neuvitass leading hostelry belied its name it was far from large and certainly it was anything but european except perhaps in its proprietors extravagant and unamerican desire to please at any cost the building was old and dirty the open cafe fronting upon the sidewalk of the main street was full of flies and dust from the unclean roadway lay thick upon its stonetopped tables moreover a recognizable odor of decay issued from the patio or perhaps from the kitchen behind it after oreillys first meal he was sure it came from the latter place even suspected that the odor flattered actual conditions but it was the best hotel the place afforded and senor carbajal was the most attentive of hosts he was a globular unctuous little man this carbajal he reminded oreilly of a drop of oil he evinced an unusual interest in the affairs of his american guest and soon developed a habit of popping into the latters room at unexpected moments ostensibly to see that all was as it should be now there was very little in the room to need attention only a bed with a cheesecloth mosquitonet a washstand and a towering smelly clothespress of spanish architecture which looked as if it might have a dark and sinister history when for the third time he appeared without knocking oreilly suspected something you have everything eh mr carbajal teetered upon the balls of his feet while his small black eyes roved inquisitively everything in abundance there is water eh the proprietor peered dutifully into the pitcher incidentally taking stock of oreillys toilet articles a veritable ocean of it one never knows these servants are so lazy but your other baggage your trunk i have no trunk so i took you to be a great traveler i am selling goods eh no indeed then you are a pleasure traveler you see the sights is that it well cuba is beautiful most beautiful judging from what i have seen mr carbajal wagged a pudgy forefinger at his guest tut tut you know cuba you speak the language better than a native you cant fool me sly one he wrinkled his face and winked both eyes it was an invitation to further confidence and he was disappointed when it passed unnoticed well you americans are a brave people he continued with an obvious effort to keep the conversation going you like to be where the fighting is not i im a timid man ho ha ha the proprietor cackled then he became pensive there is nothing here at neuvitas to interest a tourist except the war im not a tourist indeed now that is interesting mr carbajal seated himself on the edge of the bed where he could look into oreillys travelingbag not a tourist not a travelingman now what could possibly bring you to cuba oreilly eyed his inquisitor gravely a subtle melancholy darkened his agreeable countenance i travel for my health said he you health carbajals frame began to heave his bulging abdomen oscillated as if shaken by some hidden hand good ha theres another joke for you im a sick man oreilly insisted hollowly from what malady do you suffer inquired the hotelkeeper rheumatism rheumatism that is no more than a pain in the joints a stiffness there i knew it oreilly exclaimed in triumph rising he seized his hosts moist hands and shook them violently you give me courage you make a new man of me these doctors enjoy a fellows agony theyd like to bury him theyd never recommend this climate no pain in the joints you say stiffness that proves the abominable affliction is practically unknown here i thank you sir you dont look sick mumbled carbajal not like the other american what other american a peculiar fellow he went on to puerto principe what a cough and he was as thin as a wire he bled at the mouth too all the time when he was not reviling my hotel youll see him if you go there provided he hasnt come apart with his coughing i believe he writes for newspapers well it is my pleasure to serve you command me at any hour mr carbajal rose reluctantly and went wheezing downstairs to his grimy tables and the flies oreilly was not in the least deceived it was plain to him that the hotel man was in close touch with the spanish authorities and he began to feel the need of some better excuse some valid business reason for being here such as would allay suspicion once for all but he could think of nothing better than his rheumatism and to that he determined to cling vii the man who would know life later that day oreilly set out to reconnoiter the city of neuvitas he was followed of course he had expected as much and the circumstances amused rather than alarmed him but when he returned to his hotel and found that his room had been visited during his absence he felt a hint of uneasiness evidently as doctor alvarado had forecast the authorities were interested in him and he had further evidence of the fact when he learned that the room next him was occupied by the very man who had shadowed him on the street inasmuch as the intervening wall was no more than a thin partition through which his very breathing could be heard while his every movement could doubtless be spied upon oreilly saw the need of caution and he began to cast about for a place to hide that colts revolver the presence of which was assuming the proportions of a menace now that his belongings had been examined three times that day the next step would probably be another search of his person unless in the mean time he could definitely establish his innocence of purpose which was unlikely it behooved him to rid himself of the weapon without delay this however was a problem he could not bring himself to throw the thing away and his bare bedroom offered no place of concealment late that evening he called mr carbajal and asked him if it were possible to take a bath mr carbajal assured him that it was el gran hotel europea was first class in every respect no expense had been spared in its equipment senor orailye had indeed done well in patronizing it for it boasted the best cuarto de bano in the whole city a room moreover which was devoted exclusively to the purposes of bathing and it was a large room large enough to accommodate a dozen guests at once to be sure it would require say half an hour to make it ready for it was stored with hay for the horses which drew the bus to and from the depot but if the senor would have patience it could soon be restored to its original purpose mr carbajal himself would see that there was a river of hot water oreilly thanked him an hour later he paraded barefoot down the hall wrapped in a blanket he had purposely left his clothes behind him and the door of his room unlocked but under his naked left arm he carried the revolver he was a long time in his bath when he returned to his chamber he found his garments very nearly as he had left them he smiled as he crept into bed and tucked the netting under his thin mattress they could search him now whenever they pleased for the revolver and its box of precious cartridges reposed on a duty beam over the bathroom where no one would ever think of looking during breakfast and afterward throughout an aimless morning stroll oreilly felt watchful eyes upon him when he returned to his hotel he found mr carbajal in the cafe concocting refrescos for some military officers who scanned the american with bold hostile glances oreilly complained to the proprietor of a toothache at once mr carbajal was sympathetic he was also admonitory blaming the affliction upon that bath of the previous evening excessive bathing he declared was injurious particularly in the winter season it opened ones pores and it dried ones skin and rendered one liable to the attacks of every disease heat perspiration was it wise to resort to unnatural and artificial means in order to rid oneself of a trifling annoyance if perspiration were injurious nature would not have provided it in fact it was natures method of keeping the body clean and if people were unreasonably fastidious about such things a little cologne would render them even more agreeable to the senses than any number of baths that was the purpose of cologne this habit of bathing at fixed intervals of a week or two regardless of conditions might be and probably was responsible for all of oreillys rheumatism mr carbajal for one knew better than to overdo the thing he had never suffered an ache or a pain in his life and his teeth were perfectly sound as he demonstrated by beating vigorously upon them with his mixingspoon oreilly was impressed by this argument he acknowledged but unfortunately it did not remedy the pain which was killing him during the hottest part of the day when he knew the town would be asleep he reappeared in the cafe his cheek in his hand he declared that something had to be done at once and inquired the name and address of the best local dentist mr carbajal named several among them dr tomas alvarado whereupon his guest hurried away followed at a respectful distance by the secret agent finding doctor alvarados office was closed as he had anticipated oreilly proceeded to the doctors residence there was some delay when he rang the bell but eventually the dentist himself appeared oreilly recognized him from his resemblance to his brother he addressed him in english i come from felipe he began he well remembers the day you whipped him to keep him from going to the ten years war the languor of doctor alvarados siesta vanished he started his eyes widened who are you he muttered my name is oreilly i am an american a friend so dont be alarmed the man you see approaching is following me but he thinks i have come to you with a toothache what do you want i want your help in joining the insurrectos by this time the detective had come within earshot making an effort at selfpossession the dentist said very well i will meet you at my office in a halfhour and see what can be done then he bowed oreilly raised his hat and turned away doctor alvarados dentists chair faced a fulllength window one of several which after the cuban fashion opened directly upon the sidewalk rendering both the waitingroom and the office almost as public as the street itself every one of these windows was wide open when johnnie arrived but it seemed that the dentist knew what he was about for when his patient had taken his seat and he had begun an examination of the troublesome tooth he said under his breath i too am watched talk to me in english when i press thus upon your gum you will know that some one is passing now then what is the meaning of your amazing message from felipe while doctor alvarado pretended to treat a perfectly sound molar johnnie managed despite frequent interruptions to make known the reason and circumstances of his presence but there are no rebels around here alvarado told him you could escape to the country perhaps but what then where would you go how would they know who you are thats what i want to find out the cuban pondered youll have to go to puerto principe he said at length our men are operating in that neighborhood and my brother ignacio will know how to reach them ill give you a message to him similar to the one you brought me from felipe then he smiled ive just thought of the very thing years ago i lent him a book which i particularly prized and one of his children damaged it i was furious i declared i would never lend him another and i never have now then ill give you that very volume hand it to him and say that i asked you to return it to him id like to see his face when he receives it oreilly thanked him promising to use every precaution in delivering the message the very care necessary in communicating between brother and brother made him realize more clearly than hitherto that he was among enemies the next morning he paid carbajals score and took the train to the interior in his bag was tomas alvarados precious volume and in the same coach with him rode the secret service man in its general features puerto principe differed little from the other cuban cities oreilly knew it was compactly built it was very old and it looked its centuries its streets were particularly narrow and crooked having been purposely laid out in labyrinthian mazes so the story goes in order to fool the pirates in some ways it was quaint and unusual for instance here and there were queer tinajones vast venerable earthen jars for holding rainwater each inscribed with the date when it left the potters wheel then too there was a remarkable number of churches massive structures grayed by time and in the northern distance blue against the sky oreilly had a glimpse of the cubitas range where he knew the insurrectos were in camp that was his goal it seemed almost within his grasp he was tempted to abandon caution and make a dash for it until he discovered that the city was well guarded one needed a pass to enter or to leave puerto principe and moreover the city had no suburbs no scattered residences outside its boundaries when one came to the end of a street one found oneself in an open field faced by a barbedwire barrier and on every road leading from the town stood a fortina a little fort of brick or logs in which were stationed spanish soldiers the streets were alive with uniformed men patrols were everywhere and martial law prevailed for the first time oreilly began to perceive the strength of that mailed hand which held the island so tightly judging from the preparations here one must conclude that spain had no intention of relinquishing her last new world possession after a stroll through the city during which he carefully used his eyes johnnie asked himself how the illdrilled illequipped loosely organized insurrectos could hope to overthrow so solid a power as this backed as it seemed to be by unlimited means and unlimited armies of trained troops it looked like a hopeless undertaking no seaport no city scarcely a hamlet in fact so far as oreilly knew was held by the rebels they lurked in the woods or rode the savannas in ragged bands here today there tomorrow to aid or comfort them was treason they appeared out of the jungles at unexpected moments they faded like the mists of the dawn theirs was an apparitional warfare and even their biggest victories were signals for retreat how could they think to win it seemed impossible that such resistance as they offered could wear down and conquer the resources of spain yet the very numbers and alertness of the spanish troops argued a somewhat formidable opposition did it not also argue an allpervading restlessness which might some day escape control oreilly of course had no part in this quarrel but it struck him as a wicked waste to destroy to ravage and to slay when settlement was so easy the motive behind this prodigal extravagance of blood and gold was nothing but foolish resistance of a principle a little yielding a little diminution of harshness a little compassion on the part of the mother country and these men who were killing one another would embrace and proclaim their blood brotherhood pondering such thoughts as these oreilly returned to his hotel as he sat in the cafe sipping an orangeade he heard some one speaking in atrocious spanish and looked up to see that another american had entered the stranger was a tall funereal young man with pallid cheeks and hollow burning eyes he was asking for icewater but what he said resembled anything except the language of the country hey george he cried try gimme a vasso of agwa con yellow he pronounced the words with elaborate pains make it a long one a waiter eyed him tolerantly but with no faintest sign of understanding agwa con yellow agwa with ice ice ice the man repeated loudly still failing of a response he shouted dont you know what ice is he wrapped his long lean arms about himself and shivered cold icie freezum brrr savvy inspiration came to the waiter a smile irradiated his countenance and with a murmured apology for his stupidity he hurried away oreilly stepped over to the strangers table and introduced himself the hotelkeeper in neuvitas told me id find you here he said your name is branch leslie branch so carbajal said youd find me here eh oh the greasy little liar he didnt believe it he thought his cooking would have killed me long ago and it nearly did this time mr branchs bony frame underwent a genuine shudder and his face was convulsed with loathing did you try his butter made in denmark during the early victorian period i hate antiques cant eat anything oily carbajals in the secret service nice fat little spy so i suspected mr branchs beverage appeared at this moment with a flourish the waiter placed a small glass and a bottle of dark liquid before him branch stared at it then rolled a fiercely smoldering eye upward whats that he inquired oreilly read the label its bitters said he bitters and i asked for yellow a glass of agwa with yellow branchs voice shook im dying of a fever and this ivorybilled toucan brings me a quart of poison bullets it was impossible to describe the suggestion of profanity with which the speaker colored this innocuous expletive weak as i am i shall gnaw his windpipe he bared his teeth suggestively and raised two talonlike hands the waiter was puzzled but not alarmed he embraced himself as his customer had done and shuddered then pointing at the bitters he nodded encouragingly oreilly forestalled an outburst by translating his countrymans wants un vaso de agua con hielo said he and the attendant was all apologies so you speak the lingo marveled mr branch well i cant get the hang of it dont like it dont like anything spanish hell of a country isnt it where the ice is yellow and the butter is meant to kill you and does oreilly laughed youve been studying a guidebook with complete glossary of spanish phrases by the way carbajal said you are a writer mr branch nodded listlessly im supposed to report this insurrection but the spaniards wont let me they edit my stuff to suit themselves im getting tired of the farce going home dont dare the speaker tapped his concave chest bum lungs i came down here to shuffle off and im waiting for it to happen what brings you to cuba im here for my health too the real invalid stared i have rheumatism going to sweat it out eh well theres nothing to do but sweat branch was racked by a coughing spasm that shook his reedy frame sweat and cough bullets no mistake about that hospital bark is there when he had regained his breath he said see here im going to take a chance with you for i like your looks my newspaper work is a bluff i dont send enough stuff to keep me alive i come here to cure my lungs and i want you to help me do it oreilly stared at the man in surprise how can i help you he asked by taking me with you with me where to the insurrectos of course the men eyed each other fixedly what makes you think oreilly began oh dont say it ive got a hunch i dont know what your game is probably dynamite theres a story that the rebels have sent for some american experts to teach them how to use the stuff and god knows they need instruction anyhow i cant swallow that rheumatism talk i thought you might give me a lift take me along will you and how would that benefit your cough johnnie inquired curiously mr branch hesitated well ill tell you he said after a moment im afraid to die this way by inches and hours im scared to death it seemed impossible that the sick mans cheeks could further blanch but they became fairly livid while a beading of moisture appeared upon his upper lip god youve no idea how it gets on a fellows nerves to see himself slipping slipping id like to end it suddenly like that he voiced the last sentence abruptly and snapped his fingers ive tried to bump off but no courage funny isnt it well the doctors told me another new york winter would put me in a rosewood showcase ive tried colorado and its no good see so i decided to join the cubans and let a bullet do the trick i never did like the spaniards their cooking is too greasy then too id like to have a thrill before i cash in taste the salt of life as somebody expressed it thats war its the biggest game in the world what do you think of the idea not much oreilly said honestly difference in temperament i suppose it is a sick fancy but ive got it unfortunately now that im here these romeos wont let me get out of town if youre what i think you are give me a hand im a rotten coward but ill fight if the cubans will take me where are the cubans oh theyre out yonder in the hills i know all about em come over to my quarters and ill show you a map if youre interested i am said oreilly and rising he followed his new acquaintance viii the spanish doubloon on the whole pancho cuetos plans had worked smoothly after denouncing the varona twins as traitors he had managed to have himself appointed trustee for the crown for all their properties consummation for which he had worked from the moment he read that letter of estebans on the morning after dona isabels death to be sure the overseer had acquired title of a sort to the plantation by paying the taxes over a period of years but it was the quinta itself which he desired the quinta de esteban with its hidden gold that there was a treasure cueto had never doubted and once the place was his to do with as he chose he began his search cueto was a tireless thoroughgoing man therefore he did not set about his explorations in the haphazard manner of dona isabel commencing at the lower edge of the grounds he ripped them up with a series of deep trenches and crosscuts it was a task that required the labor of many men for several weeks and when it was finished there was scarcely a growing thing left upon the place only a few of the larger trees remained cueto was disappointed at finding nothing but he was not discouraged next he tore down the old slave barracoons and the outbuildings after which he completely wrecked the residence itself he pulled it apart bit by bit brick by brick he even dug up its foundations but without the reward of so much as a single peseta finally when the villa was but a heap of rubbish and the grounds a scar upon the slope of la cumbre he desisted baffled incredulous while all matanzas laughed at him having sacrificed his choicest residence he retired in chagrin to the plantation of la joya but cueto was now a man with a grievance he burned with rage and his contempt for the boy and girl he had wronged soured into hatred such time as he did not spend in racking his brain to explain the disappearance of the dead estebans riches he devoted to cursing the living esteban and his sister who it seemed to him were somehow to blame for his wrecked hopes in time he began to realize also that so long as they lived they would jeopardize his tenure of their property public feeling at present was high there was intense bitterness against all rebels but the war would end some day what then cueto asked himself sympathy was ever on the side of the weak and oppressed there would come a day of reckoning as if to swell his discomfiture and strengthen his fears out from the hills at the head of the yumuri issued rumors of a little band of guerrilleros under the leadership of a beardless boy a band of blacks who were making the upper valley unsafe for spanish scouting parties cursing the name of varona pancho cueto armed himself he did not venture far alone and like dona isabel before him he began to have bad dreams at night one day a field of cuetos cane was burned and his laborers reported seeing esteban and some negroes riding into the wood the overseer took horse within the hour and rode pellmell to matanzas in the city at this time was a certain colonel cobo in command of spanish volunteers those execrable convict troops from the isle of pines whose atrocities had already marked them as wolves rather than men and to him pancho went with his story ah yes that varona boy ive heard of him cobo remarked when his caller had finished his account he has reason to hate you i dare say for you robbed him the colonel smiled disagreeably he was a disagreeable fellow so dark of skin as to lend credence to the gossip regarding his parentage a loud strutting domineering person whose record in santa clara province was such that only the men discussed it cueto murmured something to the effect that the law had placed him in his position as trustee for the crown and should therefore protect him but colonel cobos respect for the law it seemed was slight in his view there was but one law in the land the law of force why do you come to me he asked that fellow is a desperado pancho declared he should be destroyed bah the country is overrun with desperadoes of his kind and worse burning crops is nothing new id make an end of him soon enough but nearly all of my men are in cardenas we have work enough to do id make it worth while if you could put an end to him pancho said hesitatingly then recalling some of those stories about colonel cobo he added there are two of them you know a boy and a girl ah yes i remember i can direct you to the house of asensio where they live umm cobo was thoughtful a girl how old is she eighteen ugly as an alligator ill warrant ha the most ravishing creature in all matanzas all the men were mad over her cuetos eyes gleamed craftily for he believed he had measured cobos caliber she should have married old castano and all his money but she was heart and soul in the revolution she and the boy were spying on us you know and sending the information to that rebel lopez lopez spies were they the worst kind youd scarcely believe it of a beautiful girl with her culture and refinement i tell you it broke more than one heart de castano for instance has never recovered he sits all day in the casino and grieves for her such hair and eyes such skin as white as milk and flesh as pure as the petals of a flower well you wouldnt believe such charms existed colonel cobo the guerrilla licked his full red lips and ran a strong square hand over his curly shortcropped hair you say you know where she where they are living ah perfectly its less than a nights ride theres no one except the boy to reckon with how much is he worth to you bluntly inquired the soldier and cueto sat down to make the best terms possible do you think he received my letter rosa asked of her brother one evening as they sat on the board bench by asensios door it was a familiar question to esteban he had answered it many times oh yes he declared lopezs messenger got through to key west then why doesnt he come but my dear you must be patient think of his difficulties the girl sighed i do i think of nothing else sometimes i feel that he is here i seem to feel his presence then again the most terrible doubts assail me you know there was another woman perhaps what an idea esteban exclaimed as if he could think of any one after knowing you did he not assure you that he was going to new york for the sole purpose of breaking off that affair well then this subject always distressed young varona therefore he changed it come you havent heard of my good fortune i captured another fine snake today a big sleepy fellow believe me hell wake up when i set fire to his tail hell go like the wind and with every foot he goes away will go more of pancho cuetos profits you intend to burn more of his fields absently inquired the girl every one of them you should have seen those rats when we soaked them with oil and set them afire they scampered fast but their hair is short they dont run far these snakes will be better it seems terrible to destroy our own property esteban broke out excitedly he could not discuss pancho cueto without losing control of himself would you permit that traitor to fatten upon the profits of our plantations he thinks he is safe he is preparing for a rich crop at high prices but he shall never reap a dollar from varona land as long as i live i shall ruin him as he ruined us rosa shook her dark head sadly and we are indeed ruined think of our beautiful house all our beautiful things too we used to consider ourselves poor but how little we knew of real poverty there are so many things i want have we nothing left i thought it best to buy those rifles the brother murmured dropping his eyes it was one chance in a million no doubt it was it seems those spaniards will sell their souls exactly we can dig food from the earth and pluck it from the trees but good mausers dont grow on every bush besides of what use would money be to us when we have no place to spend it true after a moment rosa mused aloud i wonder if cueto found the treasure if only we had that he didnt find it esteban declared positively i he hesitated i think i know why he didnt yes i think i know where it is esteban rosa stared roundeyed at her brother oh i mean it ive been thinking so ever since where is it breathlessly inquired the girl after a furtive look over his shoulder esteban whispered in the well youre joking no no think for yourself it was old sebastian who dug that well yes and he alone shared fathers confidence that sunken garden was all sebastians work he spent all his time there although he was a big strong man and capable of any task no one else was allowed to tend it why ill tell you they feared to let any one else draw the water isabel searched for years if that treasure had been above ground her sharp nose would have smelled it out and now cueto has moved the very earth rosa sat back disappointed so thats your theory its more than a theory the boy insisted look at this from the pocket of his cotton trousers he produced an oddlooking coin which he placed in rosas hand why its gold its a spanish doubloon she said its the first one i ever saw where did you find it youll think im crazy when i tell you sometimes i think so myself i found it in isabels hand when i took her from the well rosa was stricken speechless she clutched it tightly esteban hurried on but as i made the rope fast her hand relaxed and i saw it in the lanternlight it was as if well as if she gave it to me i was too badly frightened to think much about it as you may imagine it was a horrible place all slime and foul water the rocks were slippery but that coin was in her fingers rosa managed to say impossible then she must have had it when she fell no no i saw her hands upstretched her fingers open in the moonlight its uncanny perhaps yes perhaps some unseen hand led her to the place so that we should at last come into our own who knows i didnt bother my head about the matter at first what with our flight and all but now i reason that there must be other coins where this one came from theres no doubt that father hid his money he turned his slaves into gold he bought jewels precious metal anything he could hide well perhaps there were old coins in the lot the water in the well is shallow isabel must have groped this piece from the bottom some day i shall explore the hole and we shall see rosa flung her arms rapturously about her brothers neck and kissed him wouldnt it be glorious she cried wouldnt it be wonderful to be rich and to want for nothing to have fine clothes and good things to eat once more good things to eat her lip quivered oh im so hungry poor little girl wait till oreilly hears about this rosa was all excitement once more hell be glad he came and got me if he does come esteban caressed her hell come never fear you remember he warned me to be careful well i i blame myself for bringing you to this for myself of course i dont mind but for you this life must be terrible i know it every time i leave you my heart is in my throat for fear of what may happen in my absence and yet i cant always be at your side there you acknowledge that i handicap you except for me you would be making a glorious name for yourself nothing of the sort more probably id be getting myself killed no its better this way we must be brave and patient and think of what is waiting for us at the bottom of that well it was indeed a great piece of luck which had enabled esteban varona to buy a halfdozen mausers from a spanish soldier through asensios acquaintance he had profited by the dishonesty of an enemy and although it had taken all his money to effect the purchase esteban considered the sacrifice well worth while the fire of patriotism burned fiercely in him as did his hatred of pancho cueto and the four trusty young negroes to whom he had given rifles made with asensio and himself an armed party large enough to be reckoned with these blacks were excitable fellows and wretched marksmen but on the other hand each and every one had been raised with a machete at his hip and knew how to use it after a few preliminary forays under estebans leadership they had absorbed a bit of discipline and were beginning to feel a military ardor in the cuban field forces there were many negroes and many of their fellowpatriots fought better or endured the hardships of guerrilla warfare more cheerfully than they gen antonio maceo was of mixed blood and yet his leadership was characterized not only by rare judgment and ability but also by an exalted abandon of personal bravery his several brothers rendered cuba services scarcely less distinguished and they were but of a few of many darkskinned heroes this struggle for independence was no patricians war the best stock of the island fought side by side with fieldhands at dawn of the morning following his talk with rosa when the members of his command assembled esteban was up and ready he had made his preparations to destroy pancho cuetos fields and since the road over the hills to la joya was long he had summoned them early be careful rosa implored him i shall die of suspense it is for you to be careful he laughed keep a good watch and conceal yourself at the first alarm however i think we have taught these bandits a lesson as for cueto he would run to the jungle if he saw us he has the heart of a mouse he kissed his sister affectionately and then rode off at the head of his tattered band rosa waved him a last farewell as he disappeared into the woods then to occupy herself she helped evangelina with what little housework there was to do later going with her to the garden patch where the viandas grew evangelinas early devotion to her mistress had not diminished with time if anything it had deepened when emancipation came she would have returned to the service of her beloved twins had it not been for dona isabels refusal to accept her as it was she and asensio had married and by means of rosas surreptitious help they had managed to buy this little piece of land rosa had practised selfdenial to make the purchase possible and her selfsacrifice had borne fruit that act of childish beneficence had created a refuge for esteban and herself and had ripened the negro womans affection into idolatry evangelinas joy at having the girl to herself where she could daily see her touch her serve her was tempered only by the knowledge of rosas unhappiness she scolded and tyrannized she mothered and adored the girl to her hearts content she watched over her like a hawk she deemed no labor in her service too exacting it would have gone ill with any one who offered harm to rosa for evangelina was strong and capable she had the arms and the hands of a man and she possessed the smoldering black temper of sebastian her father even in peaceful times few people came to this clearing in the woods far off from the maintraveled roads of the yumuri and the day as usual passed uneventfully evangelina worked with one eye upon her rosa the other watchfully alert for danger when evening came she prepared their scanty meal upbraiding rosa meanwhile for her attempts to assist her then they sat for an hour or two on the bench outside the door talking about juan orailye and the probable hour of his coming there were no candles in asensios house now and had there been neither woman would have dared light one to hunted creatures darkness is a friend danger stalks under the sun when rosa fretted about her brother the negress reassured her dont be frightened little dove he has the makings of a great soldier its a good thing for the spaniards that he isnt general cuba would be free in no time hes so reckless oh he knows what hes doing besides asensio wouldnt let him be hurt i took pains to tell him that if ever he permitted esteban to suffer so much as a scratch i would disembowel him with his own machete he knows me now then it is growing cool and the night air carries fevers creep into your bed and dream about that handsome lover of yours no ill keep watch with you evangelina was indignant go she stormed what will happen to those red cheeks if you dont sleep do you think the american will want to marry an old woman with wrinkles he may be here tomorrow yes i have a certain feeling about it rosa obeyed although reluctantly ill sleep for a while she compromised then ill come out and take my turn this exactly suited the elder woman who knew something about the slumbers of youth nevertheless dawn was still a long way off when true to her promise rosa emerged from the hut with an apology for having slept so long evangelina protested though her eyes were heavy and she had been yawning prodigiously for hours but for once the girl was firm i cant sleep she declared why force me to lie staring into the dark while you suffer having finally prevailed in her determination she seated herself in the warm place evangelina had vacated and curling her small feet under her she settled herself chin in hand to think of oreilly it was a good time to think for the jungle was very still and the night like a velvet curtain we had better leave the horses here pancho cueto hesitatingly addressed the dim blur which he knew to be colonel cobo the colonel of volunteers was in a vile temper what with the long night ride and an error of cuetos which had considerably lengthened the journey where is the house growled the officer not far but the path is rocky and the horses feet god yes there was a creak of saddle leathers and a groan as the colonel dismounted now my good cueto he threatened another of your mistakes and ill give you something to remember me by damnation what a night as black as hell it will be daylight before we know it the other said nervously excellent then i can see to deal with you if youve fooled me a curt order brought his men out of their saddles one of their number was detailed to guard the animals while the rest fell in behind cueto and followed him up the trail by the starglow ix marauders the surprise was easily effected for colonel cobos men were accomplished in this sort of work rosa crouching upon her bench heard nothing saw nothing until out of the shadows beside her human forms materialized her white dress like a dim phosphorescent glow in dark waters betrayed her presence and as she sprang to her feet rough hands seized her she screamed once twice then a palm closed over her mouth and she began to struggle like a cat evangelina who had waked at the first outcry met the marauders as they rushed through the door the hush of the sleeping jungle was shattered now there were shouts and curses loudly bellowed orders a great scuffling and pounding of feet upon the dirt floor of the hut the rickety barkcovered walls bulged and creaked over all sounded the shrieks of the negress battling in the pitchblack interior like an animal in its lair then some one set fire to the thatch the flames licked up the dead palmleaves to the ridgepole and the surroundings leaped into view rosa saw a swarthy thickset man in the uniform of a colonel of volunteers and behind him pancho cueto tearing the hand from her lips for a moment she cried cuetos name but he gave no heed he was straining his gaze upon the door of the bohio in the immediate expectation of seeing esteban emerge he clutched a revolver in his hand but it was plain from the nerveless way in which he held the weapon that he had little stomach for the adventure he was in fact more inclined to run than to stand his ground rosa shrieked his name again then she heard the officer say where is the young fellow i hear nothing but the squeals of that common wench evangelinas cries of rage and defiance suddenly ceased and with them the sounds of combat from the blazing bohio ran two armed men brushing sparks from their clothing a third followed dragging evangelina by one naked arm the black woman was inert her scanty garments were wellnigh ripped from her body she lay huddled where the soldier flung her rosa felt herself swooning and she knew nothing of what immediately followed after a time she felt herself shaken and heard the colonel addressing her come come he was saying why dont you answer me he dragged her farther from what was now a roaring furnace where is your precious brother and that black fellow rosa could only stare dully it seems we missed them said cueto more of your bungling cobo broke out at him wrathfully god ive a mind to toss you into that fire he turned his attention once more to rosa and with a jerk that shook her into fuller consciousness repeated where are they speak to me gone she gasped gone she struggled weakly toward cueto imploring him pancho dont you know me well weve taught him a lesson said cueto grinning apprehensively at cobo weve accomplished something anyhow eh he nodded at rosa shes all that i told you look at her colonel cobo took time to scrutinize his prisoner he turned her about in the light from the burning dwelling then he agreed yes shes a pretty little spy quite a prize truly now then his thick lips spread he spoke to her more gently i want you to tell me about that brother of yours eh cueto said i would find him here ha still frightened i see well i have a way with women i dare say youll be glad to tell me everything by and by then seeing that his men risked a scorching in their search of the hut and were already quarreling over the scanty plunder which it afforded he turned from rosa to call them away profiting by his inattention rosa wriggled out of his grasp and ran to evangelina who lay face down in the dirt her limbs sprawled loosely she flung herself upon the prostrate body and cried the black womans name but she could awaken no response the first pink of dawn was now deepening in the east and as soon as it had grown light enough to see to travel colonel cobo prepared to return to his horses the roof and walls of the bohio had fallen away to ashes its skeleton of poles and its few pieces of crude furniture alone were smoldering when he called his men together and gave the word to go come my sweetheart he addressed himself to the girl leave that carrion for the buzzards rosa looked up to find him leering at her she brushed the tears from her eyes crying go away in gods name havent you done harm enough oh but youre going with me the girl rose her face was colorless she was aquiver with indignation leave me she stormed what have i done to you dont caramba a temper and you have strength too as i discovered must i bind those pretty hands or colonel cobo reached forth laughing and encircled her in his powerful arms rosa fought him as she had fought at the first moment of desperation but he lifted her easily and went striding across the field behind his men estebans party made good time over the hills and into the san juan for asensio knew the country well midafternoon found them in sight of la joya cuetos cane was thick and high it was ready for the knife or for the torch making a detour the incendiaries approached it from the east in order to have the tradewinds at their backs they dismounted in the shelter of a wood and removed the bags which they had carried on their saddles inside these bags were several snakes the largest perhaps eight feet in length to the tail of each the negroes fastened a leather thong and then to each thong a length of telegraphwire the end of which had been bent into a loop to hold a bundle of oilsoaked waste these preliminaries accomplished they bore the reptiles into the canefields at widely separated places and lighted the waste esteban from his saddle saw the first wisps of smoke arise and grow and unwind into long ribbons reaching deep into the standing crop soon tongues of flame appeared and the green tops of the cane began to shrivel and to wave as the steady east wind took effect from the nearest conflagration a great snapping and crackling of juicy stalks arose the thin dry strippings with which the earth was carpeted formed a vast tinder bed and once the fire was started there was no checking it smoke billowed upward and was hurried westward before the breeze in a dozen places the fields burst into flame from somewhere came a faint shouting then a shot or two and finally the ringing of a bell esteban waited only until he saw that his work of devastation was well under way then he led his followers back toward the hills at sunset he reined in upon the crest of a ridge and looked behind him into the valley the whole sky was black with smoke as if a city were in flames removing his wide jipijapa hat the young man swept a mocking salutation to the east so now good pancho cueto he cried i leave you the compliments of those twins you love so well in the shelter of a ravine the party took time to eat supper their first meal since leaving home and it was after dark when they finished the negroes who were thoroughly tired were for spending the night here but esteban more cautious than they would not have it so accordingly the men remounted their weary horses though not without some grumbling and set out it was slow traveling for the woods were dark and the trails were blind the men were fairly obliged to feel their way at length they crossed the summit and worked down toward the yumuri but it seemed as if daylight would never come a weary ride esteban yawned i shall sleep for a week asensio agreed that cueto will be furious said he some day perhaps he and i will meet face to face then i shall kill him esteban reined in his horse look said he yonder is a light the other horsemen crowded close staring through the darkness it was very still in the woods dawn was less than half an hour away what is evangelina thinking about asensio muttered but see it grows brighter there followed a moment or two during which there was no sound except the breathing of the horses and the creak of saddle leathers as the riders craned their necks to see over the low treetops below them then esteban cried come im afraid its our house fear gripped him but he managed to say calmly perhaps there has been an accident asensio muttering excitedly was trying to crowd past him for a few yards the two horses brushed along side by side the distant point of light had become a glare now it winked balefully through the openings as the party hurried toward it but it was still a long way off and the eastern sky had grown rosy before the dense woods of the hillside gave way to the sparser growth of the low ground esteban turned a sick white face over his shoulder and jerked out his orders then he kicked his tired mount into a swifter gallop it was he who first broke out into the clearing one glance and the story was told the hut was but a crumbling skeleton of charred poles strung out across the little field of malangas yuccas and sweetpotatoes were several hilarious volunteers their arms filled with loot from the cabin behind them strode an officer bearing rosa struggling against his breast esteban did not pause he drove his horse headlong through the soft red earth of the garden his sudden appearance seemed briefly to paralyze the marauders it was a moment before they could drop their spoils unsling their rifles and begin to fire at him and by that time he had covered half the distance to his sister those rifleshots came faintly to estebans ears he scarcely heard them he merely lowered his head and rode straight at that blackvisaged colonel sobbing and whimpering in his fury but in spite of his speed he made no difficult target a bullet brought his horse down and the boy went flying over its neck nothing but the loose loam saved him from injury as he rose to his feet breathless and covered with the red dirt there came a swift thudding of hoofs and asensio swept past him like a rocket esteban caught one glimpse of the negros face a fleeting vision of white teeth bared to the gums of distended yellow eyes of flat distorted features then asensio was fairly upon colonel cobo the colonel who had dropped his burden now tried to dodge asensio slashed once at him with his long murderous machete but the next instant he was engaged with a trooper who had fired almost into his face the other negroes also were in the open by this time yelling and firing as fast as they could work the bolts of their rifles and although they aimed at nothing in particular the effect of their fusillade was all that could be wished cobos men led by the terrified pancho cueto turned and fled for cover believing themselves in danger of annihilation nor was the colonel himself in any condition to rally them for asensios blade had cloven one full dark cheek to the bone and the shock and pain had unnerved him he was frightened at sight of the blood that streamed down over the breast of his white tunic and so when he saw his men turn tail he followed suit lunging through the lush garden growth holding his wound in his hand and shrieking profane commands which went unheeded the field was small the jungle was close at hand a moment and the interlopers had vanished into it all but one who lay kicking among the broad malangaleaves and over whom asensio kept spurring his terrified horse hacking downward with insane fury this was the first handtohand encounter estebans men had had and their swift victory rendered them ferocious flinging their guns aside they went crashing into the brush on the trail of their enemies rosa found herself in her brothers arms sobbing out the story of the outrage and quivering at every sound of the chase he was caressing her and telling her to have no further fears both of them were fairly hysterical even before esteban had heard all lorenzo the mulatto reappeared leading three cavalry horses and shouting extravagant praises of his own bravery esteban complimented him and the fellow galloped away again voicing the most bloodcurdling threats evangelina thanks to her thick skull was not dead in the course of time under rosas and estebans ministrations she regained her senses and when the other men returned they found her lying sick and dazed but otherwise quite whole then there beside the ruins of the hut was a strange scene of rejoicing asensio recovered now from his burst of savagery was tearful compassionate his comrades laughed and chattered and bragged about their prodigious deeds of valor over and over they recounted their versions of the encounter each more fanciful than the other until it seemed that they must have left the forest filled with corpses esteban alone was grave he had heard of colonel cobo and remembering that denimclad figure out yonder in the trampled garden he knew that serious consequences would follow the volunteers were revengeful their colonel was not the sort of man to forgive a deep humiliation doubtless he would put a price upon the heads of all of them and certainly he would never allow them another encounter upon anything like even terms then too the narrowness of rosas escape caused the boys heart to dissolve with terror after a conference with asensio he decided that they must prepare for flight and late that afternoon they all set out to seek a safer refuge evangelina in tears at leaving her precious garden plot their led horse one of those lorenzo had captured carried a pitifully light burden only some tools some pans and kettles and a roll of charred bedclothes johnnie oreilly had no difficulty in locating the residence of ignacio alvarado but to communicate with him was quite another matter inasmuch as his every step was dogged by that persistent shadow from neuvitas leslie branch had told him enough about conditions here in puerto principe to make him extremely cautious and after their first talk he had once more concealed his revolver in a safe hidingplace taking good care thereafter that nothing in his conduct should awaken suspicion unfortunately his room was on the second floor of the hotel and hence his goings and comings were always open to observation but he noted that a window at one end of the upper hall overlooked a sloping tileroofed shed and that the garden wall behind the hotel premises was not provided with those barbarous spikes or broken bottles which decorate so many cuban walls it promised him a means of egress when the time should come to use it in this hall moreover directly opposite his door there was an oil bracketlamp which gave light to the passageway and which was forever going out a fact which the young man noted with satisfaction one evening several days after his arrival a sudden rainstorm drove oreilly indoors and as he ascended to his room he saw that the lamp in the hallway flared and smoked at every gust of wind it was very dark outside he reasoned that the streets would be deserted hastily securing that book which alvarado the dentist had given him he took a position close inside his door when he heard the spy pass and enter the next chamber he stole out into the hall and breathed into the lampchimney a moment later he was safely through the window and was working his way down the shed roof praying that his movements had not been seen and that the tiles were firm the rain was driving in sheets and he was wet to the skin when he dropped into the patio nevertheless he was laughing to himself he nimbly scaled the wall crossed an inclosure climbed a second wall and descended into a dark side street taking advantage of the densest shadows and the numerous overhanging balconies he set out at a brisk trot a light showed through the barred windows of the alvarado home indicating that the family was in after some fumbling oreilly laid hold of the latch then without knocking he opened the front door and stepped in he found himself as he had expected in the parlor a highceilinged sparsely furnished room with a glazed floor of spanish mosaics his sudden appearance threw the occupants into alarm a woman cried out sharply a man whom oreilly identified as ignacio alvarado himself leaped to his feet and faced him exclaiming who are you im a friend dont be alarmed johnnie summoned his most agreeable smile then he extended the sodden package he had carried beneath his arm i come from your brother tomas he asked me to hand you this book and to say that he is returning it with his thanks what are you saying plainly the speaker did not comprehend there was nothing but apprehension in his voice oreilly tore the wet paper from the volume and laid it in alvarados hand look at it please and youll understand i didnt take time to knock for fear i might be followed alvarado stared first at the book then at his caller after a moment he made a sign to his wife who left the room wetting his lips he inquired with an effort what do you want oreilly told him in a few words alvarado showed relief he even smiled i see but caramba you gave me a start and this book ha tomas will have his jokes it is well you took precautions for i am under surveillance ill help you yes but you must not come here again return to your hotel and let me think senor alvarado frowned in deepest thought then he said i have it every morning at half past nine a man wearing a panama hat and a gray silk necktie with a large gold pin will pass along the sidewalk across the street from the isla de cuba you will know him one day i cannot promise how soon he will lift his hat thus and wipe his face you understand good follow him he will give you final directions meanwhile i will make known your presence to certain of our friends who can be trusted you know manin the druggist well you can talk to him and he will keep you posted as to our progress now go before some one comes oreilly wrung the cubans hand then he stepped out into the night leaving a pool of water on the clean blue tiles where he had stood x oreilly talks hog latin in the days that followed his call on ignacio alvarado oreilly behaved so openly that the secret service agent detailed to watch him relaxed his vigilance certainly there was nothing suspicious in the conduct of a fellow who sat all the morning tipped back in a hotel chair languidly scanning the passersby whose afternoons were spent on the streets or at the sodafountain in martins drugstore and whose evenings were devoted to aimless gossip with his countryman the newspaper writer manifestly this oreilly was a harmless person but the spy did not guess how frantic johnnie was becoming at this delay how he inwardly chafed and fretted when two weeks had rolled by and still no signal had come manin told him to be patient he assured him that word had been sent into the cubitas hills and that friends were busy in his behalf but johnnie was eager to be up and doing this inaction paralyzed him it made him almost ill to think how much time had slipped away then too his money was running low at last however the day arrived when the man with the gray necktie raised his hat and wiped his brow as he passed the isla de cuba johnnie could scarcely hold himself in his chair by and by he rose stretching himself and sauntered after the fellow for several blocks he kept him in sight but without receiving any further sign the man paused to greet friends he stopped at several shops and his aimless wanderings continued for the best part of an hour during which he led the way to the outskirts of the city fortunately oreillys shadow was nowhere in sight without a glance over his shoulder the man turned into a large walled inclosure when johnnie followed he found himself in one of the old cemeteries ahead of him up a shady avenue bordered with trees the stranger hurried then he swerved to his left and when oreilly came to the point where he had disappeared there was nobody in sight apprehending that he had made some mistake in the signal oreilly hastened down the walk then at last to his great relief he heard a sibilant psst psst it came from behind a screen of shrubbery and there he found the cuban waiting the latter began rapidly our plans are complete listen closely one week from today at ten oclock in the morning you must be in manins drugstore directly across the street you will see two negroes with three horses at fifteen minutes past ten walk out san rafael street to the edge of the city where the hospital stands the negroes will follow you there is a fort near by i know it commands the road you will be challenged if you pass it so turn in at the hospital but do not enter the gates for the negroes will overtake you at that point they will stop to adjust the saron of the lead horse that will be your signal mount him and ride fast the spaniards will fire at you but if you are hit one of the blacks will take you on his horse if one of them is hit or his horse falls you must stop and take him up ride out half a mile and you will find a band of insurrectos in the woods at the right they know you are coming now adois and good luck with a smile and a quick grip of the hand the messenger walked swiftly away oreilly returned to his hotel at last one week and this numbing heartbreaking delay would end he would be free to take up his quest oreilly choked at the thought the blood drummed in his ears rosa would think he was never coming she would surely believe that his heart had changed as if it could o god come quickly if you love me well a week was only seven days he longed to risk those spanish bullets this very hour but those seven days were more than a week they were seven eternities the hours were like lead oreilly could compose his mind to nothing he was in a fever of impatience meanwhile he was compelled to see a good deal of leslie branch the reporter was anything but cheerful company for believing firmly in the steady progress of his malady he was weighed down by the deepest melancholy the fellow was a veritable cave of despair he voiced neverceasing complaints nothing suited him and but for something likable in the man an effect due in part to the fact that his chronic irritation took amusing forms he would have been an intolerable bore to cheer him up was quite impossible and although it seemed to johnnie that the cuban climate agreed with him and that he lacked only strength of will to cheat the grave the mere suggestion of such a thought was offensive to the invalid he construed every optimistic word every effort at encouragement either as a reflection upon his sincerity or as the indication of a heartless indifference to his sufferings he continued to talk wistfully about joining the insurrectos and oreilly would have been glad to put him in the way of realizing his fantastic ambition to taste the salt of life had it been in his power but since he himself depended upon friends unknown to him he did not dare to risk complicating matters in fact he did not even tell branch of his coming adventure the day of days dawned at last and johnnie was early at manins sodafountain drinking insipid beverages and anxiously watching the street in due time the negroes appeared their straw sarons laden with produce which they innocently disposed of oreilly began to consult his watch with such frequency that the druggist joked him manins banter was interrupted by a buglecall down the street came perhaps two hundred mounted troops they wheeled into san rafael street at a gallop and disappeared in the direction of the suburbs now what does that mean murmured the druggist wait here while i go to the roof where i can see something oreilly tried to compose himself meanwhile becoming aware of a growing excitement in the street pedestrians had halted shopkeepers had come to their doors questions were flying from mouth to mouth then from the direction of the fort at the end of san rafael street sounded a faint rattling fusillade more buglecalls and finally the thin distant shouting of men rebels some one cried dios mio they are attacking the city they have audacity eh the roofs were black with people now manin came hurrying down into the store something has gone wrong he whispered theyre fighting out yonder in the woods there has been some treachery it is tenfifteen said oreilly i must be going manin stared at him you dont understand those black fellows are getting their horses ready im going the druggist tried to force johnnie into a chair madman he panted i tell you our friends have been betrayed they are retreating go back to your hotel quickly for the first time during their acquaintance manin heard the goodnatured american curse oreillys blue eyes were blazing he had let go of himself completely im going he cried hoarsely all the damned spaniards in cuba wont stop me god ive waited too long i should have made a break idiot stormed the druggist you wish to die eh oreilly ripped out another oath and fought off the others restraining hands very well then cried manin but have some thought of us who have risked our lives for you suppose you should escape how would our troops receive you now would they not think you had cunningly arranged this trap a light of reason slowly reappeared in the younger mans eyes no manin pressed his advantage you must wait until he broke off abruptly and stepped behind his counter for a man in the uniform of a spanish lieutenant had entered the store the newcomer walked directly to oreilly he was a cleancut alert young fellow after a searching glance around the place he spoke in a voice audible to both men senor you are in danger tonight at midnight you will be arrested i beg of you to see that there is nothing incriminating in your possession oreillys face betrayed his amazement arrested what for on what charge the stranger shrugged i dont know that newspaper man will be arrested at the same moment so you had better warn him but be careful where and how you do so for all his movements are watched all his words are overheard why do you tell me this you is it some scheme to to incriminate me oreilly inquired manin was leaning over the counter his face drawn with anxiety his lips framing the same question no the lieutenant shook his head i am a friend a cuban in spite of this uniform if you repeat my words i shall be shot within the hour i implore you his voice became more urgent to heed my warning i dont know what you had to do with this skirmish out san rafael street but a short time ago a message came from the fortina that insurrectos were in the woods close by i hope it will not prove to be a bloody encounter and now remember midnight he bowed turned to the door and was gone manin heaved a sigh of relief caramba he gave me a fright i thought my time had come but what did i tell you eh that fellow is a cuban spy no doubt we have many friends well you see what would have happened if you had tried to go now then you must prepare yourself for the worst perhaps a halfhour later oreilly saw the cavalry squadron returning to its barracks the men were laughing they were shouting brief boastful accounts of their encounter to the people on the sidewalks two of them were sick and white they lurched in their saddles and were supported by their comrades but it was not upon them that the eyes of the onlookers centered through the filth of the street behind the cavalcade trailed a limp bundle of rags which had once been a man it was tied to a rope and it dragged heavily its limbs were loose its face blackened by mud stared blindly skyward oreilly gazed at the object with horrified fascination then with a sudden sick feeling of dizziness he retired to his room asking himself if he were responsible for that poor fellows death meanwhile the citizens of puerto principe looked on with stony eyes there was no cheering among them only a hush in their chatter above which sounded the rattle of accoutrements the clumpclump of hoofs and the exultant voices of the spanish troopers for some reason or other leslie branch was nowhere to be found his room was locked and no one had seen him hence there was no possibility of warning him until that evening when he appeared while oreilly was making a pretense of eating dinner where the devil have you been the latter inquired anxiously been getting out my weekly joke about the revolution had to write up this mornings battle couldnt work in my room so i sit down and dont jump when i tell you what has happened were going to be pinched at midnight why midnight i dont know unless thats the fashionable hour for military calls whats it all about i guess they dont like us have you got anything incriminating about you nno nothing except my citizens papers and a letter of introduction to general maximo gomez oreilly suddenly lost what appetite remained to him nothing except a letter to general gomez he cried good lord branch were you ever shot at sunrise the reporter coughed dismally nno its too damp i suppose you mean to hint id better destroy that letter eh just as quickly as possible where is it in my room hmm then im not sure youll have a chance to destroy it oreilly was thinking rapidly from what i was told i suspect you are being watched even there bullets i thought as much would you mind using some other oath oreilly broke out irritably ive always considered bullets weak and ineffective but it has a significance theres a new lodger in the room next to me ive heard him moving around ill bet hes got a peephole in the wall branch was visibly excited quite likely i have the same kind of a neighbor that is he watching us now leslie cast a hostile eye at the man his friend indicated looks like a miserable spy doesnt he but say how am i going to make away with that letter im trying to think said johnnie after a time he rose from the table and the two strolled out johnnie was still thinking when the two arrived at branchs quarters oreilly scrutinized the room as closely as he dared and then sat for some time idly gossiping both men were under a considerable strain for they thought it more than likely that hostile eyes were upon them it gave them an uncomfortable thrill and while it seemed a simple thing to burn that letter of introduction they realized that if their suspicions were correct such a procedure would only serve to deepen their difficulties nothing they could later say would explain to the satisfaction of the authorities so questionable an act the mere destruction of a mysterious document particularly at this late hour would look altogether too queer it might easily cause their complete undoing inasmuch as his enemies were waiting only for an excuse to be rid of him oreilly knew that deportation was the least he could expect and at the thought his fingers itched to hold that letter over the lampchimney imprisonment almost any punishment was better than deportation that would mean beginning all over again while he was talking he used his eyes and finally a plan suggested itself to make doubly sure that his words would not be understood he inquired casually do you speak any foreign languages sure spanish and hog latin in spite of himself oreilly grinned then making use of that incoherent derangement of syllables upon the use of which every american boy prides himself he directed branchs attention to the tiles of the roof overhead the reporters wits were sharp his eyes brightened he nodded his instant understanding the house had but one story its roof was constructed of the common halfround cuban tiling each piece about two feet long these tiles were laid in parallel rows from ridgepole to eave and these rows were locked together by other tiling laid bottom side up over them where the convex faces of the lower layer overlapped after the fashion of shingles were numerous interstices due to imperfections in manufacture more than one of these was large enough to form a hidingplace for a letter continuing to disguise his language oreilly directed his companion to open the table drawer in which the unwelcome document reposed and to see that it was where he could instantly lay hands upon it in the dark branch did as he was told for some time longer they talked then they rose as if to leave the room oreilly took his stand near the door and directly beneath the most promising crevice in the roof which at this point was perhaps nine feet from the floor branch stooped over the table and breathed into the lampchimney the room was plunged into darkness there followed a faint rustling of paper the next instant he was at oreillys side stooping johnnie seized him about the knees and lifted him there was the briefest pause then feeling a pinch upon his shoulder oreilly lowered his burden noiselessly and the two men left the room when they were safely out in the street branch rubbed his head and complained bullets youre strong you nearly broke a rafter with my head but i guess i got em out of sight them yes i hid my american papers too these dons are sore on yankees you know im going to be an englishman and youd better follow suit im the the youngest son of the earl of pawtucket and youd better tell em your uncle was the duke of ireland or something xi the hand of the captaingeneral on the stroke of midnight oreilly was arrested after a thorough search of his person and his premises he was escorted to government headquarters where he found leslie branch the invalid looked taller thinner more bloodless than ever and his air of settled gloom admirably became the situation hello earl what luck johnnie flashed at him good an officer sharply commanded them to be silent there ensued a long delay introduced perhaps for its effect upon the prisoners then they were led into a large room where it seemed the entire staff of the spanish garrison was waiting it was an imposing collection of uniforms a row of grim faces and hostile eyes which the two americans beheld spread out upon a table in front of the officers were the personal belongings of both men the prisoners were ordered to stand side by side facing their accusers then each in turn was subjected to a rigorous examination owing to his acquaintance with spanish oreilly was able to defend himself without the aid of an interpreter he began by asserting that he had come to cuba for his health and declared that he had endeavored at all times since his arrival to conduct himself in strict conformity with local regulations if in any way he had offended he had not done so intentionally he denied having the remotest connection with the rebels and demanded an explanation of his arrest but his plausible words did not in the least affect his hearers general antuna the comandante a squarefaced man with the airs of a courtier but with the bold hard eyes of a fighter leaned forward saying so you suffer from ill health senor i do severely rheumatism the general nodded three days ago you were overtaken by a rainstorm while walking through the city yes sir when the rain had passed you returned to your hotel at the junction of san rafael and estrella streets a pool of water had gathered and you leaped it am i right no doubt general antuna consulted a report before him that pool measured six feet four inches in width do you ask me to believe that a person suffering from rheumatism could do that leslie branch shifted his weight and wet his lips but oreilly only shrugged impatiently my dear general said he did you never experience a neuralgia well then was the pain continuous in this climate my affliction troubles me very little that is why i remain here from among the articles in front of him the general selected a solitary caliber revolver cartridge and holding it up said what do you say to this i dont know what to say where did it come from it was found in the cloth pocket of your valise oreilly frowned then a light of understanding irradiated his frank countenance it must have lain there ever since i left matanzas three months ago ha matanzas fiercely ejaculated a colonel what were you doing in matanzas it was unnecessary to prevaricate now johnnie told of his earlier connection with the carter importing company gave names dates and facts to bear out his statements and challenged his accusers to verify them undoubtedly some of his hearers were impressed but they were by no means convinced of the innocence of his present purpose and in fact the ferocious colonel seemed to regard past residence in cuba as proof conclusive of a present connection with the rebels johnnie gathered that he was suspected of being one of those american engineers who were reported to have been engaged to instruct the enemy in the use of explosives his inquisitors did their best to wring such an admission from him or to entrap him into the use of some technical phrase some slip of the tongue which would verify their suspicions they even examined his hands with minutest care as if to find some telltale callous or chemical discoloration which would convict him then finally to give him the lie absolute the aggressive colonel seized a nickelplated atomizer from the table and brandished it triumphantly before the young mens eyes enough of this pretense he cried what is this instrument eh it is evidently an atomizer a nasal syringe i never saw it before its mine said leslie branch but the colonel did not heed the interruption ha and pray explain its use johnnie undertook to do so but it was plain that his words carried no conviction for his mocking inquisitor gave a loud snort and gestured eloquently to his commander there you have it he declared proudly this impostor betrays himself the other officers were eying the unfamiliar article curiously one of them ventured gingerly to handle it they exchanged whispers what do you call it the general inquired leaning forward this was the colonels moment i will tell you he said with a sneer at oreilly i am something of a genius at mechanical inventions and therefore i am not for a moment deceived by this fellows common lies this he paused dramatically and held his brother officers with a burning glance this instrument in my opinion was devised for the purpose of injecting fulminate of mercury into dynamite there was a breathless hush the spaniards stared at the little syringe with amazement and how does it operate queried one it is one of those ingenious yankee contrivances i have never seen one quite like it but my intelligence makes its principle plain evidently one inserts the tube into the dynamite so and presses the bulb there came a loud cry from general antuna who had bent closer he clapped his hands to his face and staggered from his chair for in suiting his action to his words the colonel had squeezed the bulb with the result that a spray of salt water had squirted fairly into his superior officers interested and attentive countenance my eyes dios mio i am blinded for life shouted the unhappy general and his subordinates looked on frozen with consternation the author of this calamity blanched he was stricken dumb with horror some one cried a doctor quickly jesus cristo such carelessness this is terrible another stammered it will explode next there was a concerted scramble away from the table leslie branch laughed it was the first time that oreilly had ever heard him give audible evidence of amusement his reedy frame was shaken as by a painful spasm his colorless face was distorted and from his lips issued queer hysterical barks and chortles tell em its nothing but brine he said chokingly when this welcome intelligence had been translated and when the general had proved it to be true there was a great sigh of relief followed by a subdued titter at the colonels expense the latter was chagrined having made himself and the comandante ridiculous he took refuge behind an assumption of somber and offended dignity but it was plain that he still considered these americans dangerous people and that his suspicions were as keen as ever the interruption served to end oreillys ordeal for the moment at least and attention was now turned to his companion it was evident from the first that branchs case was hopeless he readily acknowledged himself to be a newspaper writer and admitted having sent articles for publication through the mails this was quite enough from the attitude of the military men it promised to go hard with him but he sprung a surprise by boldly proclaiming himself an english citizen and warning his captors not to treat him with the contempt or with the severity they reserved for americans curiously his words had an effect judgment for the moment was suspended and the two prisoners were led away after which another delay ensued at last oreilly was recalled but when he reentered the big room he found general antuna awaiting him alone permit me to apologize for the inconvenience we have put you to the comandante began then am i free you are i thank you the generals hard eyes gleamed personally i at no time put faith in the idea that you are a powder expert said he no i had my own suspicions and i regret to say this inquiry has not in the least served to lessen them indeed may i ask of what you suspect me johnnie was genuinely interested the general spoke with force and gravity mr oreilly i believe you to be a far greater menace to the interests of my country than well than a score of dynamite experts i believe you are a writer the american smiled are writers such dangerous people that altogether depends upon circumstances the united states is inclined to recognize the belligerency of these cuban rebels and her relations with spain are becoming daily more strained illfeeling grows and all because of the exaggerations the mendacities that have gone forth from here to your newspapers we are determined to put down this uprising in our own way we will tolerate no foreign interference war is never a pleasant thing but you journalists have magnified its horrors and misrepresented the cause of spain until you threaten to bring on another and a more horrible combat now then you understand what i mean when i say that you are more dangerous than a powder expert that your pen can do more injury can cause the death of more spanish troops than could a regiment of americans with dynamite your english friend makes no secret of his business so we shall escort him to neuvitas and see him safely out of the country once for all and yet you permit me to remain johnnie was surprised for the present yes that is my official message to you privately however the speaker eyed oreilly with a disconcerting expression i would like to warn you you are a bright fellow and you have a way with you theres no denying it under other conditions it would be a pleasure to know you better it grieves me therefore to warn you that your further stay in cuba will not be pleasant i almost regret that there is no conclusive evidence against you it would so simplify matters come now hadnt you better acknowledge that i have guessed your secret oreillys perplexity was changing to dismay for it seemed to him he was being played with nevertheless he shook his head i would only be deceiving you sir he said general antuna sighed then i see embarrassments ahead for both of us more arrests not necessarily understand me i speak as one gentleman to another but you must have noticed that americans are unpopular with our troops eh they are impulsive these troopers accidents cannot be prevented suppose something should happen to you there is the trouble you came to cuba to enjoy its climate you cannot be expected to remain indoors of course not well among our soldiers are many new recruits patriotic enthusiastic young fellows but careless they are wretchedly unproficient marksmen and they havent learned the dangers of promiscuous rifle fire they are forever shooting at things merely to score a hit would you believe it oh i have to discipline them frequently to think of you going abroad through the streets therefore worries me intensely your solicitude is touching oreilly bowed mockingly but disregarding his tone general antuna proceeded in the same false key suppose you should be found dead some day imagine my feelings the speakers tone and expression were eloquent of concern how could i fix the responsibility by having me followed as usual i dare say oreilly said bitterly oh you will of course be shadowed day and night in fact to be quite sure of your er safety i shall ask you to permit one of my men to accompany you everywhere and even to share your room we shall try never to lose sight of you depend upon it but these detectives are careless fellows at best i dont trust them of course such precautions would exonerate me from all blame and relieve my government from any responsibility for injury to you but nevertheless it would tend to complicate relations already strained you see i am quite honest with you the general allowed time for his words to sink in then he sighed once more i wish you could find another climate equally beneficial to your rheumatism it would lift a great load from my mind i could offer you the hospitality of an escort to neuvitas and your friend mr branch is such good company he would so shorten your trip to new york the speaker paused hopefully that same sardonic flicker was on his lips johnme could not summon an answering smile for his heart was like lead he realized now the utter futility of resistance he knew that to remain in puerto principe after this thinly veiled warning would be to court destruction and destruction of a shocking character against which it would be impossible to guard even an espionage stricter than that to which he had been subjected would utterly defeat his plans after a moment of thought he said gravely i appreciate the delicacy of your consideration sir and i shall go general antuna leaped to his feet his grim face alight striding to oreilly he pressed his hands he seemed upon the point of embracing him i thank you he cried you render me a supreme service see i breathe easy permit me to offer you refreshment one of our famous spanish wines no then the best cigar in all cuba his expressions of gratitude were fulsome he swore that oreilly had done him the greatest favor of his life but his words were like poison to his hearer you embarrass me oreilly told him endeavoring to carry off his defeat with some show of grace in his bitterness he could not refrain from adding if my accursed affliction returns perhaps we shall meet again before long either here or elsewhere oh i have little hope for such a pleasure the general quickly replied but if we do meet remember we spaniards have a cure for rheumatism it is unpleasant but efficacious a little nickelplated pill that is all general antunas teeth shone for an instant there is another remedy not quite so immediate in its effect but a good one i have tried it and found it excellent drink plenty of cocoanutwater that is the cuban remedy the other i call the spanish cure cocoanuts are splendid i shall see that a crate of the choicest fruit is placed aboard your steamer accept them with my compliments and when you partake of them think of me oreilly did think of general antuna not only when he was escorted to the railway station at daylight but when he and branch took their seats and their guards filed in behind them he assured himself moodily that he would not cease to think of that sardonic old joker for a long time to come he cursed savagely the memory of these wasted weeks the narrow margin of his failure filled him with a sick feeling of dismay and impotence his mind quailed at the consequence of this new delay where was rosa now how and when would he return with difficulty he resisted the impulse to fling himself from the moving train but he composed himself by the thought that cuba was not fenced about with bayonets he would come back leslie branch broke in upon his gloomy preoccupation by asking how much money have you less than ten dollars youre rich my landlady cleaned me is it the practice of beneficent monarchies to provide transportation for their departing guests undoubtedly branch coughed dismally it ll be all right if they just buy me a ticket to the first fog one more hemorrhage and ill wing my way aloft god id hate to be buried at sea cheer up oreilly reassured him irritably there may be ice aboard ice leslie gasped oh bullets in marked contrast to the difficulties of entering cuba was the ease of leaving it a ship was sailing from neuvitas on the very afternoon when the two americans arrived and they were hurried aboard not until the anchor was up did their military escort depart from them with angry brooding eyes oreilly watched the white houses along the waterfront dwindle away the mangrove swamps slip past and the hills rise out of their purple haze when the salt breath of the trades came to his nostrils he turned into his stateroom and taking the crate of cocoanuts with which general antuna had thoughtfully provided him he bore it to the rail and dropped it overboard rheumatism was a fool disease anyhow he muttered great news esteban varona announced one day as he dismounted after a foraging trip into the yumuri we met some of lacrets men and they told us that spain has recalled captaingeneral campos he acknowledges himself powerless to stem the flood of cuban revolution what do you say to that does that mean the end of the war rosa eagerly inquired oh no they have sent a new man hes in havana now a dark little old fellow who never smiles he has a long nose and a big chin he dresses all in black a very jewbird in appearance from what i hear his name is weyler valeriano weyler marquis of teneriffe esteban laughed tolerantly for as yet the name of weyler meant nothing to him no wonder we knew nothing about it said the girl we hide like animals and we see no one for weeks at a time i sometimes wonder how oreilly will manage to find us oh hell manage it somehow esteban declared cheerfully then he ran an approving eye over the new bohio and the new garden plot which evangelina had courageously begun were not so badly fixed are we at least colonel cobo wont find us so readily this time cobo shuddered the girl i dream about him esteban scowled ive seen him at a distance several times but he takes pains to guard himself well when he comes into the yumuri they say hes trying to destroy the whole valley he will never forget esteban covertly appraised his sisters charms but respecting her terror of cobo he did not speak his thoughts he was certain however that rosa knew as well as he what motive lay behind the fellows tireless persecutions of the valley dwellers for in spite of their isolation stories of cobo had reached the refugeesstories that had rendered both the boy and the girl sick with apprehension the colonel it seemed had nearly died of his machete wound and on recovering he had sworn to exterminate the wasps that had stung him he had sworn other oaths too oaths that robbed esteban of his sleep esteban idolized his sister her loyalty to him was the most precious thing of his life therefore the thought of that swarthy ruffian hunting her down as a hound hangs to the trail of a doe awoke in him a terrible anger second only to his hatred for the guerrilla chief was his bitterness against the traitor pancho cueto who had capped his villainy by setting this new peril upon them and since rosas safety and his own honor called for the death of both men he had sworn that somehow he would effect it it was of course a difficult matter to get at the colonel of volunteers but cueto still lived in the midst of his blackened fields and it was against him that the boy was now planning to launch his first blow the mention of cobos name had momentarily distracted estebans thoughts now he collected them and said wait i am forgetting something see what lacrets men handed me they are posted from one end of the island to the other he displayed a printed bando or proclamation signed by the new captaingeneral and read as follows all inhabitants of the country districts or those who reside outside the lines of fortifications of the towns shall within a period of eight days enter the towns which are occupied by the troops any individual found outside the lines in the country at the expiration of this period shall be considered a rebel and shall be dealt with as such it was that inhuman order of concentration the result of which proved to be without parallel in military history an order which gave its savage author the name of being the archfiend of a nation reputed peculiarly cruel neither esteban nor rosa however grasped the full significance of the proclamation no one could have done so no eye could have foreseen the merciless butchery of noncombatants the starvation and death by disease of hordes of helpless men women and children herded into the cities four hundred thousand cubans driven from their homes into shelterless prison camps more than two hundred thousand dead from hunger and disease a fruitful land laid bare of all that could serve as food and changed to an ashgray desolation gaunt famine from oriente to pinar del rio that was the sequel to those printed words of weyler the butcher which esteban read eight days when is the time up rosa inquired bless you this is already two weeks old her brother told her why then it means that well be shot if were caught exactly but we shant be caught eh let the timid ones take fright at the squeaks of this old blackbird let them go into the cities we shall have the more to eat esteban crumpled the paper in his hand and dropped it meanwhile i shall proceed toward my settlement with pancho cueto his very careless confidence gave rosa courage xii when the world ran backward esteban went about his plan of destroying pancho cueto with youthful energy and zest first he secured at some pains a halfstick of dynamite a cap and fuse and a gallon or more of kerosene then he assembled his followers and led them once again into the san juan this time the ride to la joya was longer than before and since every member of the little band was proscribed esteban insisted upon the greatest caution but there was little need of especial care for the country was already depopulated as a result of weylers proclamation fields were empty houses silent no living creatures stirred except in the treetops and the very birds seemed frightened subdued it struck young varona queerly it was as if the whole land was in mourning he saw nothing but blackbirds somberhued vultures dismal judeabirds with their ebony plumage and yellow beaks far up the valley a funeral pall of smoke hung in the sky itself that was where the spaniards were burning the houses of those too slow in obeying the order of concentration la joya however was still tenanted when early in the evening its rightful owner arrived the house and some of its outbuildings showed lights esteban concealed his men while the horses cropped and the negroes rested he fitted fuse and cap to his precious piece of dynamite it was likely he thought that cueto had provided himself with a bodyguard and knowing the plantation house as he did he had no intention of battering weakly at its stout ironwood door while his quarry took fright and slipped away now while esteban was thus busied pancho cueto was entertaining an unwelcome guest in the late afternoon he had been surprised by the visit of a dozen or more volunteers and inasmuch as his relations with their colonel had been none of the friendliest since that illstarred expedition into the yumuri he had felt a chill of apprehension on seeing the redoubtable cobo himself at their head the colonel had explained that he was returning from a trip up the san juan taken for the purpose of rounding up those inhabitants who had been dilatory in obeying the new orders from havana that smoke to the southward was from fires of his kindling he had burned a good many crops and houses and punished a good many people and since this was exactly the sort of task he liked he was in no unpleasant mood he had demanded of cueto lodging for himself and his troop announcing that a part of his command was somewhere behind and would rejoin him later in the night cueto had welcomed his visitor in all humility he put up the soldiers in the bate of the sugarmill and then installed cobo in his best room after which he ransacked the house for food and drink and tobacco later he and the colonel sat long over their supper for the latters exultant humor continued cobo it transpired was delighted with the new captaingeneral a man of blood and iron a man after his own heart this weyler he predicted would put an end to the insurrection there would be no more of camposs weak merciful methods which were in reality nothing less than encouragement to revolt cueto of course agreed were sweeping the country as with a broom and already matanzas is bulging with refugees the officer told him they call themselves pacificos but they carry information and aid our enemies well have no more of that will it not be a great expense to feed so many people cueto ventured let them feed themselves is it our fault that they make such measures necessary by no means once we have them safe we shall exterminate all whom we encounter in the country the speaker drank deeply of cuetos good wine and smacked his lips its the kind of work i like extermination they have had their warning from now on we shall spare neither man woman nor child the men are traitors the women breed and the children grow up cueto nodded his complete approval of this program oh decidedly said he this spirit of violence must be stamped out or none of us will be safe let me tell you i myself live in constant dread of that young villain varona i hope you havent forgotten him forgotten him colonel cobo fingered a lately healed scar which further disfigured his ugly face then he cursed frightfully its by gods mercy alone that im alive tonight and i havent forgotten the girl either shell have to come in along with the others the boy may stay out but she cant he licked his lips wait until i have finished with this valley ill drive the yumuri next as a hunter drives a thicket for his game and nothing will slip through his thoughts once turned upon rosa the colonel could talk of little else and cueto realized that the girl had indeed made a deep impression upon him the overseer was well pleased and when cobo finally took himself off to bed he followed in better spirits than he had enjoyed for some time for one thing it was agreeable to look forward to a night of undisturbed repose panchos apprehensions had fattened upon themselves and he had been living of late in a nightmare of terror but it seemed to him that he had barely closed his eyes when he was awakened by a tremendous vibration and found himself in the center of the floor undecided whether he had been hurled from his bed or whether he had leaped thither still in a daze he heard a shout from the direction of cobos room then a din of other voices followed by a rush of feet the next instant his door was flung back and he saw by the light of highheld torches esteban varona and a ragged rabble of black men cueto knew that he faced death he uttered a shrill scream of terror and seizing the revolver which was always close at his hand he fired blindly then his foes were upon him what happened thereafter took but an instant he dodged a blow from estebans clubbed rifle only to behold the flash of a machete crying out again he tried to guard himself from the descending blade but too late the sound of his hoarse terror died in his throat half born quick soak the bed with oil and fire it esteban directed then he ran out into the hall to investigate that other shouting he found the chamber whence it issued and tried to smash the door but at the second blow he heard a gunshot from within and the wood splintered outward almost into his face simultaneously from somewhere outside the house arose the notes of a spanish buglecall young varona waited to hear no more nor did his men realizing the peril into which they had been led they bolted from the house as fast as they could go there was no need for questions from the direction of the sugarmill came bellowed orders and the sound of men shouting to their horses evidently those were troops and trained troops too for they took no time to saddle they were up and mounted almost before the marauders had gained the backs of their own animals there was no opportunity to choose a retreat across the fields esteban spurred down the driveway toward the main calzada yelling to his men to follow him the approach to la joya was by way of a notable avenue perhaps a halfmile in length and bordered by tall even rows of royal palms these stately trees shaded the avenue by day and lent it a cavernlike gloom by night near the public causeway the road was cut through a bit of rising ground and was walled by steep banks overgrown with vines into the black tunnel formed by the palms the fugitives plunged with the clatter of hoofs close behind them those of the volunteers who pressed them hardest began to shoot wildly for this typically cuban refusal to stand ground enraged them beyond measure estebans party would doubtless have made good their escape had it not been for that other guerrillero returning from its raid but as it happened the two forces met in the sunken road nothing but the darkness and the headlong approach of the fleeing men saved them from immediate destruction for the collision occurred between banks too steep for a horse to climb and with that yelling pack too close behind to permit of retreat instantly there began a blind battle in these desperately cramped quarters after the first moment or two friend and foe were indistinguishable and the men of both parties began firing or thrusting at whatever loomed nearest out of the gloom the narrow ravine quickly became a place of utter confusion a volcano of blasphemies a press of jostling plunging struggling bodies horses reared and bit at one another riders fought stirrup to stirrup with clubbed rifles and machetes saddles were emptied and the terrified horses bolted some of them lunged up the banks only to tumble down again their threshing limbs and sharpshod hoofs working more havoc than blows from oldtime battlehammers meanwhile those of cobos men who had ridden out from the sugarmill naturally attributed this new uproar to a stand of their enemies and began to rake the road with rifle fire then in obedience to the commands of their halfclad colonel they charged a moment and they were fighting hand to hand with their returning comrades spaniard clashed with spaniard and somewhere in the melee the six marauders battled for their lives of course after the first moment of conflict esteban had not been able to exert the least control over his men in fact he could not make himself heard nor could he spare the breath to shout he was too desperately engaged when the full truth of the situation dawned upon him he gave up hope for his life and at first merely strove to wreak such havoc as he could yet while some of his faculties were completely numbed in the stress of that whitehot moment others remained singularly clear the shock of his surprise the imminence of his peril rendered him dead to any emotion save dismay and yet strangely enough he remembered rosas pressing need for him and more for her sake than for his own fought to extricate himself from the confusion his rifle was empty he had its hot barrel in his hands he dimly distinguished asensio wielding his machete then he found himself down and half stunned he was running here and there to avoid lunging horses he was tripping and falling but meanwhile as opportunity offered he continued to use his clubbed weapon something smote him heavily at last whether a hoof or a gunstock he could not telland next he was on allfours trying to drag himself out of this ratpit but his limbs were queerly rebellious and he was sick he had never experienced anything quite like this and he thought he must be wounded it greatly surprised him to find that he could struggle upward through the brambles even though it was hard work men were fighting all around and below him meanwhile and he wondered vaguely what made them kill one another when he and his negroes were all dead or dying it seemed very strange of a piece with the general unreality of things and it troubled him not a little at last he gained the top of the bank and managed to assume an upright position clinging to the bole of a palmtree one of his arms was useless he discovered and he realized with a curious shock that it was broken he was bleeding too from more than one wound but he could walk after a fashion he was inclined to stay and finish the fight but he recollected that rosa would be waiting for him and that he must go to her and so he set out across the fields staggering through the charred cane stubble the night was not so black as it had been and this puzzled him until he saw that the plantation house was ablaze flames were belching from its windows casting abroad a lurid radiance and remembering pancho cueto esteban laughed by and by after he was well away his numbness passed and he began to suffer excruciating pain the pain had been there all the time so it seemed he was simply gaining the capacity to feel it he was ready to die now he was so ill moreover his left arm dangled and got in his way only that subconscious realization of the necessity to keep going for rosas sake sustained him after a while he found himself on a forest trail then he came to other fields and labored across them fortune finally led his feet down into a creekbed and he drank greedily sitting upon a stone and scooping the water up in his one useful hand he was a long time in quenching his thirst and a longer time in getting up but he finally managed this and he succeeded thereafter in keeping on his feet daylight came at last to show him his way more than once he paused alarmed at voices in the woods only to find that the sounds issued from his own throat it had grown very hot now so hot that heatwaves obscured his vision and caused the most absurd forms to take shape he began to hunt aimlessly for water but there was none evidently this heat had parched the land dried up the streams and set the stones afire it was incredible but true esteban reasoned that he must be near home by this time for he had been traveling for days for years the country indeed was altogether unfamiliar he could not recall ever having seen the path he trod but for that matter everything was strange in the first place he knew that he was going west and yet the morning sun persisted in beating hotly into his face that alone convinced him that things had gone awry with the world he could remember a great convulsion of some sort but just what it was he had no clear idea evidently though it had been sufficient to change the rotation of the earth yes that was it the earth was running backward upon its axis he could actually feel it whirling under his feet no wonder his journey seemed so long he was laboring over a gigantic treadmill balancing like an equilibrist upon a revolving sphere well it was a simple matter to stop walking sit down and allow himself to be spun backward around to the place where rosa was waiting he pondered this idea for some time until its absurdity became apparent undoubtedly he must be going out of his head he saw that it was necessary to keep walking until the backspin of that treadmill brought rosa to him but the time came when he could walk no farther he tried repeatedly and failed and meanwhile the earth spun even more rapidly threatening to whirl him off into space it was a terrible sensation he lay down and hugged the ground clinging to roots and sobbing weakly rosa he knew was just around the next bend in the trail he called to her but she did not answer and he dared not attempt to creep forward because his grip was failing he could feel his fingers slipping slipping it was agony he summoned his last atom of determination but to no avail he gave up finally and felt himself propelled dizzily outward into immeasurable voids his last thought as he went whirling end over end through space was of his sister she would never know how hard he had tried to reach her xiii capitulation late on the second day after the battle asensio returned to his bohio rosa and evangelina already frantic at the delay heard him crying to them while he was still hidden in the woods and knew that the worst had happened there was little need for him to tell his story for he was weaponless stained and bloody he had crossed the hills on foot after a miraculous escape from that ravine of death of his companions he knew nothing whatever the mention of estebans name caused him to beat his breast and cry aloud he was weak and feverish and his incoherent story of the midnight encounter was so highly colored that rosa nearly swooned with horror the girl stood swaying while he told how the night had betrayed them how he had wrought incredible feats of valor before the shifting tide of battle had spewed him out the end of the sunken road and left him half dead in the grass asensio had lain there until finding himself growing stronger he had burrowed into a tangle of vines at the foot of a wall where he had remained until the fighting ceased when the spaniards had finally discovered their mistake and had ceased riding one another down when lights came and he heard colonel cobo cursing them like one insane he had wriggled away crossed the calzada and hidden in the woods until dawn he had been walking ever since he had come home to die rosa heard only parts of the story for her mind was numbed her heart frozen her emotion was too deep for tears it paralyzed her for the time being she merely stood staring her dark eyes glazed her ashen lips apart finally something snapped and she knew nothing more until hours afterward when she found herself upon her comfortless bed with evangelina bending over her all night she had lain inert in a merciful stupor it was not until the next morning that she gradually came out of her coma then it was that the negress was really alarmed fearing that if the girl did rally her mind would be affected but rosa was young and despite her fragility of form she was strong too strong it seemed to her and possessed of too deep a capacity for suffering how she ever survived those next few days days when she prayed hourly to die was a mystery and when she found that she could at last shed tears what agony the bond between her and esteban had been stronger than usually exists between sister and brother he had been her other self in him she had centered her love her pride her ambition the two had never quarreled no angry word had ever passed between them their mutual understanding moreover had been almost more than human and where the one was concerned the other had been utterly unselfish to lose esteban therefore split the girls soul and heart asunder she felt that she could not stand without him born into the world at the same hour welded into unity by their mothers supreme pain the boy and girl were of the same flesh and spirit they were animated by the same lifecurrent never had the one been ill but that the other had suffered corresponding symptoms never had the one been sad or gay but that the other had felt a like reaction personalities so closely knit together are not uncommon and to sever them is often dangerous into rosas life however there had come one interest which she could not share with her twin that was her love for oreilly spanishreared women as a rule do not play with love when it comes they welcome it even though it be that first infatuation so often scorned by older colder people so it was with rosa varona whatever might have been the true nature of her first feeling for the irishamerican suffering and meditation had deepened and strengthened it into a mature and genuine passion as the wise men of old found wisdom in cave or desert so rosa in her solitude had learned the truth about herself now in the hour of her extremity thoughts of oreilly acted as a potent medicine her hungry yearning for him and her faith in his coming stimulated her desire to live and so aided her recovery the day arrived when her brain was normal and when she could creep about the hut but she was only the ghost of the girl she had been she seldom spoke and she never smiled she sat for hours staring out into the sunshine and when she found tears upon her cheeks she was surprised for it seemed to her that she must long ago have shed the very last asensio likewise recovered but he too was sadly changed there was no longer any martial spirit in him he feared the spaniards and tales of their atrocities cowed him then cobo came into the yumuri the valley already wellnigh deserted was filled to the brim with smoke from burning fields and houses and through it the sun showed like a copper shield refugees passed the bohio bound farther into the hills and asensio told the two women that he and they must also go so the three gathered up what few things they could carry on their backs and fled they did not stop until they had gained the fastnesses of the pan de matanzas here they built a shelter and again took up the problem of living which was now more difficult than ever asensio would not have been greatly inconvenienced by the change had he been alone for certain fruits grew wild in the forests and the earth where the spaniards had not trod was full of roots upon which a creature of his primitive habits could have managed to live but hampered as he was by two women one of whom was as delicate as a flower asensio found his task extremely difficult and it grew daily more difficult for there were other people here in the woods and moreover the country round about was being steadily scoured by the enemy who had orders to destroy every living growing thing that was capable of sustaining human life stock was butchered and left to rot trees were cut down rootfields burned weylers policy of frightfulness was in full sway and starvation was driving its reluctant victims into his net meanwhile roving bands of guerrillas searched out and killed the stronger and the more tenacious families the pan de matanzas so called because of its resemblance to a mighty loaf of bread became a mockery to the hungry people cowering in its shelter bread rosa varona could not remember when she had last tasted such a luxury raw cane cocoanuts the tasteless fruita bomba roots the pith from palm tops these were her articles of diet and she did not thrive upon them she was always more or less hungry she was ragged too and she shivered miserably through the long chill nights rosa could measure the change in her appearance only by studying her reflection from the surface of the spring where she drew water but she could see that she had become very thin and she judged that the color had entirely gone from her cheeks it saddened her for oreillys sake time came when asensio spoke of giving up the struggle and going in they were gradually starving he said and rosa was ill the risk of discovery was ever present it was better to go while they had the strength than slowly but surely to perish here he had heard that there were twenty thousand reconcentrados in matanzas in such a crowd they could easily manage to hide themselves they would at least be fed along with the others no one had told asensio that the government was leaving its prisoners to shift for themselves supplying them with not a pound of food nor a square inch of shelter evangelina at first demurred to this idea declaring that rosa would never be allowed to reach the city since the roads were patrolled by lawless bands of troops nevertheless her husband continued to argue rosa herself took no part in the discussion for it did not greatly matter to her whether she stayed or went misery bred desperation at last evangelinas courage failed her and she allowed herself to be won over she began her preparations by disguising rosa gathering herbs and berries she made a stain with which she colored the girls face and body then she sewed a bundle of leaves into the back of rosas waist so that when the latter stooped her shoulders and walked with a stick her appearance of deformity was complete on the night before their departure rosa varona prayed long and earnestly asking little for herself but much for the two black people who had suffered so much for her she prayed also that oreilly would come before it was too late xiv a woman with a mission within a few hours after oreillys return to new york he telephoned to felipe alvarado explaining briefly the disastrous failure of his cuban trip i feared as much the doctor told him you were lucky to escape with your life well im going back of course but have you made any plans not yet i dare say ill have to join some filibustering outfit wont you intercede for me with the junta theyre constantly sending parties umm not quite so often as that alvarado was silent for a moment then he said dine with me tonight and well talk it over im eager for news of my brothers and there is some one i wish you to meet she is interested in our cause she a woman yes and an unusual woman she has contributed liberally to our cause i would like you to meet her very well but ive only one suit of clothes and it looks as if id slept in it oh bother the clothes laughed the physician ive given most of mine to my destitute countrymen dont expect too much to eat either every extra dollar you know goes the same way as my extra trousers it will be a sort of patriotic poverty party come at seven please dining out eh lucky devil said leslie branch when he had learned of his companions invitation and to meet a philanthropic old lady gee maybe shell offer to adopt you who knows i wish youd offer to lend me a clean shirt ill do it readily agreed the other ill stake you to my last one but keep it clean have a care for the cuffs a little inadvertency with the soup may ruin my prospects for a job you understand dont you that our next meal after this one may depend upon this shirts prosperous appearance branch dove into his bag and emerged with a stiffly laundered shirt done up in a cuban newspaper he unwrapped the garment and gazed fondly upon it murmuring tis a pretty thing is it not his exertions had brought on a violent coughingspell which left him weak and gasping but when he had regained his breath he went on in the same key again i solemnly warn you that this spotless bosom is our bulwark against poverty one stain may cut down my space rates editors are an infernally fastidious lot fortunately they want facts about the war in cuba and im full of em ive fought in the trenches and heard the song of grape and canister grapefruit and canned goods you mean oreilly grinned well i shall write with both in mind the hope of one will stir memories of the other and who is there to dispute me at least i know what a battle should be like and i shall thrill my readers with imaginary combats oreilly eyed the speaker with appreciation on the way north he had learned to know leslie branch and to like him for he had discovered that the man possessed a rare and pleasing peculiarity of disposition ordinarily branch was bitter irritable pessimistic but when his luck was worst and his fortunes lowest he brightened up it seemed that he reacted naturally automatically against misfortune certainly his and oreillys plight upon leaving cuba had been sufficiently unpleasant for they were almost penniless and the invalid moreover knew that he was facing a probably fatal climate nevertheless once they were at sea he had ceased his grumbling and had surprised his travelingcompanion by assuming a genuinely cheerful mien even yet oreilly was not over his amazement he could not make up his mind whether the man was animated by desperate courage or merely by hopeless resignation but whatever the truth the effect of this typical perversity had been most agreeable and when leslie cheerfully volunteered to share the proceeds of his newspaper work during their stay in new york thus enabling his friend to seize the first chance of returning to cuba johnnies affection for him was cemented but branchs very cheerfulness worried him it seemed to betoken that the fellow was sicker than he would confess that evening oreilly anticipated his dinner engagement by a few moments in order to have a word alone with alvarado ive seen enriquez he told the doctor but he wont promise to send me through he says the junta is besieged by fellows who want to fight for cuba and of course i dont when i appealed in rosas name he told me truthfully enough i dare say that there are thousands of cuban women as badly in need of succor as she he says this is no time for private considerations quite so the doctor agreed we hear frightful stories about this new concentration policy i cant believe them oh i guess they are true it is the more reason why i must get back at once oreilly said earnestly this lady who is coming here tonight has influence with enriquez you remember i told you that she has contributed liberally she might help you ill implore her to put in a word for me who is she well shes my pet nurse a nurse oreillys eyes opened wide a nurse with money i didnt know there was such a thing neither did i theyre rarer even than rich doctors alvarado acknowledged but you see nursing is merely miss evanss avocation shes one of the few wealthy women i know who have real ideals and live up to them oh she has a mission johnnies interest in doctor alvarados other guest suddenly fell away and his tone indicated as much as the doctor was about to reply the ringing of the doorbell summoned him away oreilly had met women with ideals with purposes with avocations and his opinion of them was low women who had missions were always tiresome he had discovered this one it appeared was unusual only in that she had adopted a particularly exacting form of charitable work nursing even as a rich womans diversion must be anything but agreeable oreilly pictured this evans person in his mind a large plain elderly creature obsessed with impractical ideas of uplifting the masses she would undoubtedly bore him stiff with stories of her work she would reproach him with neglect of his duties to the suffering johnnie was too poor to be charitable and too deeply engrossed at the moment with his own troubles to care anything whatever about the masses and she was a miss that meant that she wore thick glasses and probably kept cats a ringing laugh from the cramped hallway interrupted these reflections then a moment later doctor alvarado was introducing oreilly to a young woman so completely out of the picture so utterly the opposite of his preconceived notions that he was momentarily at a loss johnnie found himself looking into a pair of frank gray eyes and felt his hand seized by a firm almost masculine grasp miss evans according to his first dazzling impression was about the most fetching creature he had ever seen and about the last person by whom any young man could be bored if she kept cats they must be pedigreed persian cats and well worth keeping johnnie decided the girl and she was a girl had brought into the room an electric vitality a breeziness hard to describe her eyes were humorous and intelligent her teeth which she seemed always ready to show in a friendly generous smile were strong and white and sparkling altogether she was such a vision of healthy unaffected and smartly gottenup young womanhood that oreilly could only stammer his acknowledgment of the introduction inwardly berating himself for his awkwardness he was aware of alvarados amusement and this added to his embarrassment the doctor has told me all about you miss evans addressed johnnie over her shoulder as she laid off her furs and a stylish little turban hat im dying to hear what happened on your trip so am i confessed alvarado you know mr oreilly has seen my brothers you men must go right ahead and talk as if i werent here i wont interrupt except with a few vivas or carambas or what are some other ladylike spanish exclamations there arent very many johnnie acknowledged i always try to swear in english alvarado placed an affectionate hand upon miss evanss shoulder oreilly this girl has done more for cuba than any of us she has spent a small fortune for medical supplies said he those poor men must live on quinine the girl exclaimed any one who can bear to take the stuff ought to have all he wants ive a perfect passion for giving pills oh you may joke about it all the same if others would make the same sacrifice miss evans interrupted breezily it wasnt any sacrifice at all thats the worst of it the salve i bought was really for my conscience if you must know i squander altogether too much on myself then turning to oreilly i love extravagance dont you dearly its my one unconquerable vice he told her he thought grimly of the four dollars in his pocket which represented his and leslie branchs total wealth but it seemed to him that he was called upon to agree with anything miss evans might choose to say oreilly liked this girl he had liked her the instant she favored him with her friendly smile and so trusting fatuously to his masculine powers of observation he tried to analyze her he could not guess her age for an expensive ladies tailor can baffle the most discriminating eye certainly however she was not too old he had an idea that she would tell him her exact age if he asked her while he could not call her beautiful she was something immensely better she was alive human interesting and interested the fact that she did not take her mission overseriously proved that she was also sensible beyond most women yes that was it norine evans was a perfectly sensible unspoiled young person who showed the admirable effects of clean living and clean thinking coupled with a normal sturdy constitution oreilly told himself that here was a girl who could pour tea nurse a sick man or throw a baseball and she was as good as her promise she did not interrupt when during dinner alvarado led johnnie to talk about his latest experience in cuba but on the contrary her unflagging interest induced oreilly to address his talk more often to her than to the doctor he soon discovered that she understood the cuban situation as well as or better than he and that her sympathies were keen when she did speak it was to ask intelligent questions some of which by the way it taxed oreillys wits to answer satisfactorily heretofore johnnie had looked upon the war primarily as an unfortunate condition of affairs which had played the mischief with his own personal fortunes he had not allowed himself to be very deeply affected by the rights or the wrongs of either party but norine evans took a much deeper and broader view of the matter she was genuinely moved by the gallant struggle of the cuban people and when the dinner was over she exploded a surprise which left both men speechless this settles it with me she announced im going down there alvarado stared at her for a moment my dear he began but she warned him dont argue with me you know i detest arguments ive been thinking about it for some time and it is quite impossible the doctor declared firmly and oreilly agreed of course you could go to havana said the latter but you wouldnt be allowed to see anything im going right to the insurrectos with you with me oreilly could not conceal his lack of enthusiasm i dont know that the junta will take me they will if i ask them alvarado inquired what ever put such a ridiculous idea into your head the girl laughed its the only kind of ideas i have but there are ten thousand reasons why i want to go in the first place i fairly itch to give pills you say the rebels have no hospitals no nurses we do the best we can with our equipment well ill supply better equipment and ill handle it myself im in earnest you shant stop me oreilly was uncomfortably aware of the speakers determination protests had no effect upon her her clear cheeks had flushed her eyes were dancing evidently here was a girl who did very much as she chose you dont realize what you are saying he told her gravely youd have to go as a filibuster on some decrepit unseaworthy freighter loaded to the guards and crowded with men of all sorts its dangerous business running the spanish blockade if captured you would be treated just like the rest of us lovely wed land in small boats some dark night maybe wed have a fight and if you got through what then life in a bark hut with nothing to eat bugs snakes hardships that decides me i eat too much doctor alvarado tells me i do i adore huts and i dont seriously object to insects the physician stirred uneasily its utterly absurd he expostulated some women might do it but youre not the sort you are pardon me a most attractive young person youd be thrown among rough men mr oreilly will look out for me but for that matter i can take care of myself oh its of no use trying to discourage me i always have my own way im completely spoiled your family will never consent oreilly ventured whereupon miss evans laughed i havent such a thing im alone and unencumbered no girl was ever so fortunate but wait ill settle this whole thing in a minute she quitted the table ran to alvarados telephone and called a number shes after enriquez groaned the physician hes weak he cant refuse her anything i dont want a woman on my hands oreilly whispered fiercely suppose she got sick good lord id have to nurse her he wiped a sudden moisture from his brow oh she wont get sick shell probably nurse you and and all the other men youll like it too and you will all fall in love with her everybody does and start fighting among yourselves there she has enriquez listen johnnie shivered apprehensively at the directness with which miss evans put her request you understand i want to go and see for myself she was saying if you need medicines ill give them bushels of the nastiest stuff i can buy ill organize a field hospital oh very well call it a bribe if you like anyhow ive fully determined to go and mr oreilly has volunteered to take care of me hes charmed with the idea miss evans giggled that means youll have to take him along too there followed a pause during which the two men exchanged dismayed glances she doesnt seem to care what she says oreilly murmured butill put a flea in enriquezs ear put it in writing please there was another wait now read it to me good miss evans fairly purred over the telephone send it to me by messenger right away thats a dear im at doctor alvarados house and hes beside himself with joy thanks awfully youre so nice a moment and she was back in the diningroom facing her two friends a picture of triumph you have nothing more to say about it she gloated the provisional government of cuba through its new york representatives extends to miss norine evans an invitation to visit its temporary headquarters in the sierra de somethingorother and deems it an honor to have her as its guest so long as she wishes to remain there it requests that all military and civil officers afford her every safety and convenience within their power thats practically what mr enriquez read to me in fifteen minutes it will be here in black and white now then lets celebrate she executed a dance step pirouetted around the room then plumped herself down into her chair she rattled her cup and saucer noisily crying fill them up doctor gloom lets drink to cuba libre johnnie managed to smile as he raised his demitasse heres to my success as a chaperon said he im disliked by the spaniards and now the cubans will hate me i can see happy days ahead xv filibusters leslie branch was asleep when oreilly returned to their room but he awoke sufficiently to listen to the latters breathless account of the dinnerparty im rattled johnnie confessed why that girl just bounced right into the middle of everything and and i cant bounce her out again you say shes young and pretty and rich leslie was incredulous yyes all of that umm doctor alvarado must mix a good cocktail why because youre drunk and delirious they dont come that way my boy when theyre rich theyre old and ugly i tell you this girl is young and stunning of course she is branch agreed soothingly now go to sleep and dont think any more about her theres a good boy everything will be all right in the morning perhaps it never happened perhaps you didnt meet any woman at all the speaker yawned and turned over dont be an ass johnnie cried impatiently what are we going to do with a woman on our hands we dont divide her with me what are you going to do the truth is plain this miss evans is in love with you and you dont know it she sees in you her soul mate well if you dont want her i want her ill eat her medicine ill even marry the poor old soul if shes rich oreilly arose early the next morning and hurried down to the office of the junta hoping that he could convince mr enriquez of the folly of allowing norine evans to have her way by the light of day miss evanss project seemed more harebrained than ever and he suspected that enriquez had acquiesced in it only because of a natural inability to refuse anything to a pretty woman that was typically cuban but his respect for miss evanss energy and initiative deepened when on arriving at new street he discovered that she had forestalled him and was even then closeted with the man he had come to see johnnie waited uneasily he was dismayed when the girl finally appeared with enriquez in tow for the mans face was radiant its all settled she announced at sight of oreilly ive speeded them up youre an early riser the latter remarked i hardly expected enriquez broke in such enthusiasm such ardor she whirls a person off his feet it seems that the junta lacks money for another expedition so ive made up the deficit well be off in a week really then youre actually going of course it was like a gift from heaven enriquez cried our last embarrassment is removed and but johnnie interrupted him youre crazy both of you he declared irritably cuba is no place for an american girl im not thinking so much about the danger of capture on the way down as the hardship after she gets there and the fact that she will be thrown among all sorts of men the elder man lifted his head every cuban will know who miss evans is and what she has done for our cause you do not seem to have a high regard for our chivalry sir there norine was triumphant there is bound to be some danger of course enriquez continued for the coast is well patrolled but once the expedition is landed miss evans will be among friends she will be as safe in our camps as if she were in her own home dont be hateful and argumentative or ill begin to think youre a born chaperon miss evans exclaimed come make up your mind to endure me and now youre going to help me buy my tropical outfit with a smile and a nod at enriquez she took oreillys arm and bore him away in spite of his panicstruck protestations that he knew less than nothing about womans requirements she led him uptown and she kept him at her side all that morning while she made her purchases then when she had loaded him down with parcels she invited him to take her to lunch the girl was so keenly alive and so delighted with the prospect of adventure that johnnie could not long remain displeased with her she had an irresistible way about her and he soon found himself sharing her good spirits she had a healthy appetite too when oreilly set out for his lodgings after escorting her home he walked in order to save car fare clams consomme chicken salad french pastry and other extravagances had reduced his capital to zero the days of idle waiting that followed were trying even to one of oreillys philosophic habit of mind he could learn nothing about the juntas plans and owing to his complete uncertainty he was unable to get work leslie branch too failed to find steady employment though he managed by the sale of an occasional column to keep them both from actual suffering his cough meanwhile grew worse day by day for the spring was late and raw as a result his spirits rose and he became the best of all possible good companions johnnie who was becoming constantly more fond of him felt his anxiety increase in proportion to this improvement in mood it seemed to him that branch was on the very verge of a collapse at last there came a message which brought them great joy enriquez directed them to be in readiness to leave jersey city at seven oclock the following morning neither man slept much that night as they waited in the huge barnlike station enriquez appeared with norine evans upon his arm the girls color was high she was tremulous with excitement leslie branch who saw her for the first time emitted a low whistle of surprise glory be that goddess he cried and i called her a poor old soul when norine took his bony bloodless hand in her warm grasp and flashed him her frank friendly smile he capitulated instantly in hyperbolical terms he strove to voice his pleasure at the meeting but he lost the thread of his thought and floundered so hopelessly among his words that norine said laughingly now mr branch bold buccaneers dont make pretty speeches hitch up your belt and say hello norine ill call you leslie dont call me leslie he begged call me often then he beamed upon the others as if this medieval pun were both startling and original it was plain that he wholly and inanely approved of norine evans enriquez was introducing a newcomer now one major ramos a squarejawed forceful cuban who it seemed was to be in command of the expedition my duties end here enriquez explained major ramos will take charge of you and you must do exactly as he directs ask no questions for he wont answer them do you think you can follow instructions certainly not i shant even try norine told him im fairly bursting with curiosity at this moment remember ramos not a word i promise smiled the major goodby and good luck enriquez shook hands all around then he bowed and kissed miss evanss fingers i shall pray that you escape all danger senorita and i shall see that cuba remembers her debt to you when he had gone the three americans followed their new guide through the iron gates major ramos proved that he knew how to obey orders even though the other members of his party did not he remained utterly deaf to miss evanss entreaties that he let her know something about the plans of the expedition he would not even tell her where he was taking her where the other filibusters had assembled or from what port their ship would sail he did go so far however as to explain that an inkling of the juntas plans had leaked out and that determined efforts to upset them were being made efforts which necessitated the greatest care on his part this of course whetted the girls curiosity but to her most artful queries he opposed a baffling silence when philadelphia washington then baltimore and finally richmond were left behind miss evans was in truth ready to explode and her two companions were in a similar frame of mind major ramos was not naturally a silent man he had all the loquacity of the latin and all the latins appreciation of a pretty woman he made no secret of the fact that his orders irked him despite his official reserve he proved himself a pleasant travelingcompanion and he talked freely on all but one subject he played a good game of cards too and he devoted himself with admirable courtesy to norines comfort it was not until the train was approaching charleston that he finally announced now then my first command this is the end of our journey the other members of the expedition are here but i must ask you not to talk with them or with any strangers for our friends are being watched by detectives in the employ of the spanish minister at washington and by united states deputymarshals one little indiscretion might ruin everything spies oh goody cried miss evans the local authorities intend to seize any vessel we try to sail on we must be careful the hotel to which major ramos led his guests appeared to be well filled there were many cubans in the lobby and the air was heavy with the aroma of their strong black cigarettes as the major entered they turned interested and expectant faces toward him and they eyed his companions with frank curiosity miss evans became the target for more than one warmly admiring glance as for oreilly the familiar odor of those cuban cigarettes the snatches of spanish conversation which he overheard awoke in him a great excitement he realized with an odd thrill that these eager darkvisaged men were now his friends and comrades and that those americans loitering watchfully among them were his enemies the spies of whom ramos had spoken there were at least a score of the latter and all were plainly stamped with the distinctive marks of their calling that they too were interested in the latest arrivals was soon made evident by their efforts to get acquainted to norine evans it was all immensely exciting the attention she evoked delighted her vastly and she was almost offended when oreilly threatened one particularly forward sleuth with a thrashing thereby ending her fun it was a strangely restless gathering the cubans sat in groups or in pairs with their heads together smoking furiously and whispering pausing now and then to glare balefully at some detective who drew within earshot every hour increased the strain on the street it became known that a party of filibusters was in the city and curious townspeople came to investigate while others journeyed to the waterfront to stare at the big oceangoing tug which had slipped into the harbor on the evening previous when they learned that she was none other than the dauntless that most famous of cuban blockaderunners and that dynamite johnny obrien himself was in command interest grew the exploits of that redoubtable mariner were familiar to the citizens of charleston and their sympathies were quite naturally with the cause he served therefore they were disappointed to behold a revenue cutter at anchor close alongside the dauntless her steam was up she was ready for instant action it seemed impossible for dynamite johnny to get his cargo and his passengers aboard under her very nose some imaginative person claimed to have a tip that the dauntless intended to ram the revenue cutter and a warning to that effect appeared in the evening paper together with the rumor that a spanish cruiser was waiting just outside the threemile limit charleston awoke with a start and the cuban patriots who found themselves the object of this sudden interest buzzed like flies they muttered and whispered more mysteriously than ever and consumed even greater quantities of tobacco the detectives became painfully alert to oreilly and his two companions it seemed that the expedition had already failed through some blunder its plans had evidently become known and all was ruined that was the worst of these cubans they couldnt keep a secret branch stalked the hotel lobby like a restless wraith oreilly was furious of the entire party ramos alone maintained an unruffled pleasantry he spent the evening in miss evanss company quite oblivious to the general feeling of dismay on the next afternoon word was quietly passed to get ready and the filibusters carrying their scant handbaggage began to leave the hotel in groups followed of course by the watchful spies as the three americans prepared for departure norine whispered listen everything is all right were not going aboard the dauntless at all shes here as a blind are you sure oreilly shot her a quick glance major ramos himself gave that story to the newspapers its all a part of his plan i promised not to tell but i just cant help myself gee im having a good time leslie branch shook his head mournfully you may enjoy it but i dont he grumbled well end by being pinched and that will finish me one week in a damp cell with my lungs oreilly whose spirits had risen magically clapped him heartily on the back crying congratulations youre feeling better i never felt worse the other complained nonsense thats the first kick youve made since we hit cold weather by the time we reach cuba youll be nice and melancholy and your cough will be all gone ramos led his three charges to the railroad station and into the rear coach of a southbound train where the other members of the expedition had already found seats as they climbed aboard a secret service agent essayed to follow them but he was stopped by a brakeman who said you cant ride in here this is a special car some sort of a picnic party theyre wops or greeks or something other detectives who attempted to invade the privacy of that rear coach after the train had gotten under way were also denied meanwhile the filibusters cast restraint aside and for the first time intermingled freely evening came then night and still the party was jerked along at the tail of the train without a hint as to its destination about midnight those who were not dozing noted that they had stopped at an obscure pinewoods junction and that when the train got under way once more their own car did not move the ruse was now apparent owing to the lateness of the hour it was doubtful if any one in the forward coaches was aware that the train was lighter by one car there was a brief delay then a locomotive crept out from a siding coupled up to the standing car and drew it off upon another track soon the excursion party was being rushed swiftly toward the coast some twenty miles away major ramos came down the aisle laughing and spoke to his american proteges well what do you think of that eh imagine the feelings of those good deputymarshals when they wake up i bet theyll rub their eyes miss evans bounced excitedly in her seat she clapped her hands you must have friends in high places oreilly grinned and the cuban agreed yes i purposely drew attention to us in charleston while our ship was loading shes ready and waiting for us now and by daylight we ought to be safely out to sea meanwhile the dauntless has weighed anchor and is steaming north followed i hope by all the revenue cutters hereabouts it was the darkest time of the night when the special train came to a stop at a bridge spanning one of the deep southern rivers in the stream below dimly outlined in the gloom lay the fair play a small tramp steamer her crew were up and awake the new arrivals were hurried aboard and within a halfhour she was feeling her way seaward with daylight caution gave way to haste and the rusty little tramp began to drive forward for all she was worth she cleared the threemile limit safely and then turned south not a craft was in sight not a smudge of smoke discolored the skyline it had been a trying night for the filibusters and when the low coastline was dropped astern they began to think of sleep breakfast of a sort was served on deck after which those favored ones who had berths sought them while their less fortunate companions stretched out wherever they could find a place johnnie oreilly was not one of those who slept he was too much elated already he could see the hills of cuba dozing behind their purple veils in fancy he felt the fierce white heat from closewalled streets and scented the odors of mangly swamps he heard the ceaseless sighing of royal palms how he had hungered for it all how he had raged at his delays cubas spell was upon him he knew now that he loved the island and that he would never feel at rest on other soil it had seemed so small a matter to return it had seemed so easy to seek out rosa and to save her yet the days had grown into weeks the weeks had aged into months well he had done his best he had never rested from the moment of rosas first appeal her enemies had foiled him once but there would be no turning back this time rather a firingsquad or a dungeon in cabanas than that oreilly had taken his bitter medicine as becomes a man he had maintained a calm if not a cheerful front but now that every throb of the propeller bore him closer to his hearts desire he felt a growing jubilation a mounting restlessness that was hard to master his pulse was pounding his breath swelled in his lungs sleep that was for those who merely risked their lives for cuba hunger no food could satisfy a starving soul rest he would never rest until he held rosa varona in his arms this rusty sluggish tub was standing still into the midst of his preoccupation norine evans forced herself announcing breathlessly oh but im excited theyre hoisting a cannon out of the hold and putting it together so that we can fight if we have to now dont you wish youd stayed at home oreilly smiled at her good heavens no im having the time of my life i nearly died of curiosity at first until i found major ramoss tongue hmm you found it all right he appears to be completely conquered iim afraid so the girl acknowledged with a little grimace youd think hed never seen a woman before hes very intense very you dont expect me as your chaperon to approve of your behavior why youve been flirting outrageously i had to flirt a little i simply had to know what was going on but i fixed him indeed i couldnt let him spoil my fun could i of course not well i put a damper on him i told him about you about us oreilly was puzzled what do you mean he inquired you wont be angry will you when he waxed romantic i told him he had come into my life too late i confessed that i was in love with another man with you as her hearer drew back in dismay miss evans added quickly oh dont be frightened that isnt half of course youre joking johnnie stammered indeed im not i thought it would discourage him but it didnt so i told him a whopper i said we were engaged the speaker tittered she was delighted with herself engaged to be married certainly people arent engaged to to go fishing are they i had to tell him something he was getting positively feverish if hed kept it up id have told him we were secretly married this may be funny the young man said stiffly but i dont see it oh dont look so glum im not going to hold you to it you know why miss evanss bantering manner ceased and she said earnestly doctor alvarado told me your story and i think it is splendid im going to help you find that little rosa if youll let me you were thinking about her when i came up werent you johnnie nodded you might talk to me about her if you care to oreillys voice was husky and low as he said i darent trust myself im afraid shes so young so sweet so beautiful and these are wartimes im almost afraid to think norine saw her companions cheeks blanch slowly saw his laughing eyes grow grave saw the muscular brown hand upon the rail tighten until the knuckles were white impulsively she laid her palm over his dont let yourself worry she said if money would buy her safety you could have all that i have just be brave and true and patient and youll find her im sure you will and in the mean time dont mind my frivolity its just my way you see this is my first taste of life and it has gone to my head xvi the city among the leaves the night was moonless and warm an impalpable haze dimmed the starglow only the diffused illumination of the open sea enabled the passengers of the fair play to identify that blacker darkness on the horizon ahead of them as land the ship herself was no more than a formless blot stealing through the gloom and save for the phosphorescence at bow and stern no light betrayed her presence not even so much as the flare of a match or the coal from a cigar or cigarette orders of the strictest had been issued and the expedicionarios gathered along the rails were not inclined to disregard them for only two nights before the fair play in spite of every precaution had shoved her nose fairly into a hornets nest and had managed to escape only by virtue of the darkness and the speed of her engines she had approached within a mile or two of the prearranged landingplace when over the mangroves had flared the blinding white light of a spanish patrolboat like a thief surprised at his work the tramp had turned tail and fled never pausing until she lay safe among the bahama banks now she was feeling her way back some distance to the westward major ramos was on the bridge with the captain two men were taking soundings in a blind search for that steep wall which forms the side of the old bahama channel when the lead finally gave them warning the fair play lost her headway and came to a stop rolling lazily in the silence that ensued leslie branchs recurrent cough barked loudly theyre afraid to go closer on account of the reef oreilly explained to his companions that must be it that i hear norine ventured or maybe its just the roaring in my ears probably the latter said branch im scared stiff i dont like reefs are there any sharks in these waters plenty well im glad im thin the sick man murmured major ramos spoke in a low tone from the darkness above calling for a volunteer boats crew to reconnoiter and to look for an opening through the reef before the words were out of his mouth oreilly had offered himself ten minutes later he found himself at the steeringoar of one of the ships lifeboats heading shoreward a hundred yards and the fair play was lost to view but keeping his face set toward that inky horizon oreilly guided his boat perhaps a halfmile nearer before ordering his crew to cease rowing now through the stillness came a low slow pulsating whisper the voice of the barrier reef the tradewinds had died with the sun and only the gentlest groundswell was running nevertheless when the boat drew farther in the sound increased alarmingly and soon a white breaker streak showed dimly where the coral teeth of the reef bit through there was a long nights work ahead time pressed and so oreilly altered his course and cruised along outside the white water urging his crew to lustier strokes it was haphazard work this search for an opening and every hour of delay increased the danger of discovery a mile two miles it seemed like ten to the taut oarsmen and then a black hiatus of still water showed in the phosphorescent foam oreilly explored it briefly then he turned back toward the ship when he had gone as far as he dared he lit a lantern and shielding its rays from the shore with his coat flashed it seaward after a short interval a dim red eye winked once out of the blackness oreilly steered for it soon he and his crew were aboard and the ship was groping her way toward the break in the reef meanwhile her deck became a scene of feverish activity out from her hold came cases of ammunition and medical supplies the fieldpiece on the bow was hurriedly dismounted the small boats of which there were an extra number were swung out with the result that when the fair play had manoeuvered as close as she dared everything was in readiness many of these expedicionarios were professional men clerks cigarmakers and the like few of them had ever done hard manual labor yet they fell to their tasks willingly enough while they worked a close watch with night glasses was maintained from the bridge oreilly took the first load through the reef and discharged it upon a sandy beach no one seemed to know positively whether this was the mainland or some key and there was no time for exploration in either event there was no choice of action every man tumbled overboard and waded ashore with a packingcase he dropped this in the sand above hightide mark and then ran back for another it was swift hot work from the darkness on each side came the sounds of other boat crews similarly engaged johnnie was back alongside the ship and ready for a second cargo before the last tender had set out upon its first trip and then for several hours this slavish activity continued some crews lost themselves in the gloom fetched up on the reef and were forced to dump their freight into the foam trusting to salvage it when daylight came every one was wet to the skin bodies steamed in the heat men who had pulled at oars until their hands were raw and bleeding cursed and groaned at their own fatigue but there was little shirking those whose strength completely failed them dropped in the sand and rested until they could resume their labors daylight was coming when the last boat cast off and the fair play with a hoarse triumphant blast of her whistle faded into the north her part in the expedition at an end oreilly bore norine evans ashore in his arms and when he placed her feet upon cuban soil she hugged him crying we fooled them johnnie but if it hadnt been for you wed have turned back the captain was afraid of the reef i dont mind telling you i was afraid too he sighed wearily now then about all we have to fear are spanish coastguards dawn showed the voyagers that they were indeed fortunate for they were upon the mainland of cuba and as far as they could see both east and west the reef was unbroken there was still some uncertainty as to their precise position for the jungle at their backs shut off their view of the interior but that gave them little concern men were lolling about exhausted but major ramos allowed them no time for rest he roused them and kept them on the go until the priceless supplies had been collected within the shelter of the brush then he broke open certain packages and distributed arms among his followers even while this was going on there came an alarm over the low promontory that cut off the eastern coastline a streamer of smoke was seen there was a scurry for cover the little band lay low and watched while a spanish cruiser stole past not more than a mile outside the line of froth the three americans who were munching a tasteless breakfast of pilotbread were joined by major ramos he was no longer the immaculate personage he had been he was barefooted his clothes were torn his trousers were rolled up to the knee and whitened by seawater while the revolver at his hip and the bandolier of cartridges over his shoulder lent him an incongruously ferocious appearance ever since norine had so rudely shattered his romantic fancies the major had treated both her and oreilly with a stiff and distant formality he began now by saying i am despatching a message to general gomezs headquarters asking him to send a packtrain and an escort for these supplies there is danger here perhaps you would like to go on with the couriers oreilly accepted eagerly then thinking of the girl he said doubtfully im afraid miss evans isnt equal to the trip nonsense im equal to anything norine declared and indeed she looked capable enough as she stood there in her short walkingsuit and stout boots branch alone declined the invitation vowing that he was too weak to budge if there was the faintest prospect of riding to the interior he infinitely preferred to await the opportunity he said even at the risk of an attack by spanish soldiers in the mean time it took oreilly but a short time to collect the few articles necessary for the trip indeed his bundle was so small that norine was dismayed cant i take any clothes she inquired in a panic i cant live without a change it is something youll have to learn he told her an insurrecto with two shirts is wealthy some of them havent any isnt it likely to rain on us its almost sure to miss evans pondered this prospect then she laughed it must feel funny she said there were three other members of the travelingparty men who knew something of the country round about they were good fighters doubtless but in spite of their shiny new weapons they resembled soldiers even less than did their major all were dressed as they had been when they left new york one even wore a derby hat and pointed patentleather shoes nevertheless norine evans thought the little cavalcade presented quite a martial appearance as it filed away into the jungle the first few miles were trying for the coast was swampy and thickly grown up to underbrush but in time the jungle gave place to higher timber and to open savannas deep in guineagrass soon after noon the travelers came to a farm the owner of which was known to one of the guides and here a stop was made in order to secure horses and food it was a charming little rancho the palmthatched house was set in a grove of mamey and mango trees all heavily burdened with fruit there was a viandapatch and wonder of wonders there were a halfdozen cows dozing in the shade spying these animals norine promptly demanded a glass of milk and oreilly translated her request to the farmer the man was obliging until he learned that the american lady purposed drinking the milk fresh and warm then he refused positively fresh milk was full of fever he explained it was alive with germs he would bring her instead some which had been boiled and salted in the usual cuban manner this he did but after one bitter mouthful norine insisted upon her original request with a dubious shake of his head and a further warning the farmer directed his son to oblige the pretty lady by milking one of the cows he made it plain however that he disclaimed all responsibility for the result johnnie who was badly fagged from the previous nights work found a shady spot and stretched himself out for a nap he inquired idly if there were any spaniards in the vicinity and learned that there were but that they seldom came this way wed never see them here if it were not for these sin verguenzas may a bad lightning split them who take money to show them the bridlepaths the countryman explained id like to guide them once id lead them into a swamp and leave them to sink in the mud then id go back and cut off their heads ha that would be a satisfaction now wouldnt it oreilly agreed sleepily that it would doubtless be a very great satisfaction indeed im as good a patriot as god ever made the fellow ran on you can see that eh but what do you think i have a brother a very blood brother who would sell himself for a peseta he passed here the other day at the head of a whole spanish guerrillero the speaker bared his teeth and spat viciously christ how i would like to cut his throat the shade was grateful oreilly dozed he was awakened by being roughly shaken and he found the man with the derby hat bending over him the fellow was excited his eyes were ringed with white his expression bespoke the liveliest alarm loud voices came from the rear of the bohio whats the matter spaniards johnnie was on his feet in an instant no no your senorita the man gasped for the love of god come quickly he set off at a run and johnnie followed a prey to sudden sick misgivings around the house they dashed and into a group the center of which was norine herself a gourdful of milk in one hand a partially devoured mango in the other at first glance there seemed to be nothing amiss but the owner of the farm was dancing he was trying to seize first the mango then the drinkingvessel his wife was wringing her hands and crying shrilly god have mercy so young so beautiful what a pity the two filibusters and the farmers eldest son all visibly perturbed likewise joined in the commotion while the smaller children looked on from the background and whimpered whats happened oreilly demanded breathlessly norine turned a puzzled face to him meanwhile warding off the farmers attack i cant quite make out she said they all talk at once please ask them what ive done mechanically she raised the ripe mango to her lips whereupon the ranchero with a yell leaped upon her and violently wrenched it out of her fingers facing oreilly the man panted there you saw her she wouldnt listen to my wife oh i warned her wailed the woman but it was too late you must tell her what she has done said the fellow in the stiff hat well what has she done johnnie managed to inquire whereupon every one began a separate explanation she will never become your wife look thats not her first mango enough to destroy an army you can see for yourself wait ask her how many she ate ask her senor i implore you there was a silence while johnnie translated the question and repeated the answer she says she doesnt remember they are so nice and ripe so nice and ripe shouted the owner of the farm tearing his hair so nice and ripe echoed his wife so nice and ripe groaned the man who had awakened oreilly major ramos told me to guard her with my life because she is the guest of cuba well i shall kill myself the country woman laid a trembling hand upon norines arm inquiring gently how are you feeling my beautiful dove sick eh what on earth ails these people inquired the object of all this solicitude i havent made away with a baby maybe theyre afraid i wont pay for my food light came to oreilly i remember now said he mangoes and milk are supposed to be poisonous the woman wants to know how you feel poisonous nonsense they taste splendid tell her im still half starved it proved now that one of the three members of the landingparty possessed an unsuspected knowledge of english which modesty alone had prevented him from revealing under the stress of his emotion he broke out oh missy those fruit is skill you i dont believe it miss evans declared it skill you all right maybe you got a headache here eh the speaker laid a hand upon his abdomen and leaned forward expectantly nothing but an aching void this confession or a garbled translation of it was enough for the others it confirmed their worst fears the farmer volunteered to ride for the nearest priest but hesitated declaring it a waste of time inasmuch as the lady would be dead in half an hour his wife ran to the house for her crucifix and rosary which latter she insisted upon hanging around norines neck after that she directed the men to carry the sufferer indoors her intention being to make her guests last moments as comfortable as possible when norine refused to be carried she was warned that the least exertion would but hasten the end which was alas all too near oreilly was impressed in spite of himself by this weight of conviction especially when the cubans ridiculed his suggestion that the combination of milk and mango might not prove altogether fatal to an american nothing they assured him could possibly be deadlier than this abominable mixture the victim herself however remained skeptical she alone treated the matter lightly and although she did finally consent to lie down it was merely to please the others and because she was tired they have set their minds on seeing me expire and theyre such nice people im almost ashamed to disappoint them she confided to oreilly but really im too hungry to die now dont forget to call me when dinner is ready honestly do you feel all right he asked of her never better the meal was slow in coming for not only were the cooking arrangements primitive but the apprehensive housewife could not long remain away from the sickroom she made frequent visits thereto and after each she reported in a whisper the condition of the patient the lady looked very white her breathing was becoming slower she was unconscious all would soon be over it was better to let her pass painlessly to paradise than to torture her with useless remedies realizing that the poison had at last begun to work the men tiptoed to the door and peered in compassionately whereupon the sufferer roused herself sufficiently to call them a lot of rubbernecks and bid them begone her mind wanders explained the man of the house and then to cheer oreilly he added she is young and strong she may linger until evening the meal was set at last however the men were stealthily attacking it suddenly the sick woman swept out from her retreat and sat down among them senorita this is suicide they implored then as she ignored them and helped herself liberally to the food their own appetites vanished and they pushed themselves away from the table with a twinkle in his eye oreilly said gravely dying people have strange fancies pray dont thwart her indifference so callous on the part of a lover shocked the cubans they rebuked oreilly silently it was plain that they considered americans a barbarously coldblooded race meanwhile they apprehensively watched norines every mouthful when after a time no ill effects having appeared she suggested departing they whispered together they agreed at last that it was perhaps the course of wisdom to humor her she was the guest of their government it would not do to displease her inasmuch as her end was inevitable it could matter little whether she died here or elsewhere accordingly they saddled their borrowed horses and set out all that afternoon norine was an object of the tenderest solicitude on the part of her three cuban guides they momentarily expected to see her stricken then when she gave no sign of distress they marveled and expressed great admiration at her fortitude in enduring pain that night was spent at another farmhouse when on the next morning norine not only was seen to be alive and well but insisted upon making her breakfast of mangoes and milk the fellow in the derby hat flung his hands on high and told oreilly it is no less than a miracle but now she courts the wrath of god senor as for me i shall never again associate with eccentric persons who delight to fly in the face of providence it is my opinion that all americans are crazy the party had penetrated to the foothills of the sierra de cubitas now and as they ascended the scenery changed rarely is the cuban landscape anything but pleasing for the most part green pastures sown with stately palmtrees and laid out as if for a picnic alternate with low rolling hills and in but few places are the altitudes at all impressive it is a smiling island it has been said too that everything in it is friendly to man the people are amiable warmhearted the very animals and insects are harmless cuban cattle are shy but trusting cuban horses are patient and affectionate the serpents have no poison and although the spiders and the scorpions grow large and forbidding their sting is ineffective but here in the cubitas range all was different the land was stern and forbidding canons deep and damp raised dripping walls to the sky bridlepaths skirted ledges that were bold and fearsome or lost themselves in gloomy jungles as noisome as spanish dungeons hidden away in these fastnesses the rebel government had established its capital here safe from surprise the soldiers of gomez and maceo and garcia rested between attacks nursing their wounded and recruiting their strength for further sallies it was a strange seat of government no nation ever had a stranger for the state buildings were huts of bark and leaves the army was uniformed in rags cookfires smoldered in the open glades cavalry horses grazed in the grassy streets and woodsmoke drifted over them the second evening brought oreilly and miss evans safely through and at news of the expeditions success a packtrain was made ready to go to its assistance norines letter from the new york junta was read and the young woman was warmly welcomed one of the better huts was vacated for her use and the officers of the provisional government called to pay their respects xvii the city of beggars there were other americans in cubitas as oreilly soon discovered during his first inspection of the village he heard himself hailed in his own language and a young man in dirty white trousers and jacket strode toward him welcome to our city the stranger cried im judson captain of artillery departmento del oriente and youre the fellow who came with that quinine lady arent you oreilly acknowledged his identity and judson grinned the whole camp is talking about her and those mangoes jove its a wonder she didnt die of fright something tells me youre irish anyhow you look as if youd enjoy a scrap know anything about artillery nothing whatever im sorry we need gunners still you know as much as the rest of us did when we came im not a fighter johnnie told him im here on other business captain judson was plainly disappointed nevertheless he volunteered to assist his countryman in any way possible have you met the old man he inquired general gomez no id like to meet him come along then ill introduce you this is about the right time of day for it hell probably be in good humor he has dyspepsia you know and hes not always pleasant it was nearly sundown the eastern slopes were in shadow and supper was cooking as the two men passed down the wide street between its rows of bohios the fragrance of burning fagots was heavy in the air that odor which is sweet in the nostrils of every man who knows and loves the outofdoors to oreilly it was like the scents of araby for his hopes were high his feet were light and he believed his goal was in sight gen maximo gomez father of patriots bulwark of the cuban cause was seated in a hammock reading some letters oreilly recognized him instantly from the many pictures he had seen gomez was a keen wiry old man the color of his swarthy sunbitten cheeks was thrown into deeper relief by his snowwhite mustache and goatee he looked up at judsons salute and then turned a pail of brilliant eyes as hard as glass upon oreilly his was an irascible brooding face it had in it something of the sternness the exalted detachment of the eagle and oreilly gained a hint of the personality behind it maximo gomez was counted one of the worlds ablest guerrilla leaders and indeed it had required the quenchless enthusiasm of a real military genius to fuse into a homogeneous fighting force the illassorted rabble of nondescripts whom gomez led to school them to privation and to render them sufficiently mobile to defy successfully ten times their number of trained troops this however was precisely what the old portorican had done and in doing it he had won the admiration of military students he it was more than any other who bore the burden of cubas unequal struggle it was gomezs cunning and gomezs indomitable will which had already subjugated half the island of cuba it was gomezs stubborn unflagging resistance which was destined to shatter for all time the hopes of spain in the new world with a bluntness not unkind he asked oreilly what had brought him to cuba then before the young man could answer he gestured with a letter in his hand saying major ramos gives you splendid credit for helping him to land his expedition but he says you didnt come to fight with us what does he mean when oreilly explained the reason for his presence the old fighter nodded so you wish to go west eh yes sir i want to find colonel lopez lopez miguel lopez the general inquired quickly i believe thats his name at any rate the colonel lopez who has been operating in matanzas province you see he knows the whereabouts of my friends well you wont have to look far for him general gomezs leathery countenance lightened into a smile he happens to be right here in cubitas calling judson to him he said amigo take mr oreilly to colonel lopez you will find him somewhere about i am sorry we are not to have this young fellow for a soldier he looks like a real man and quite equal to five quintos eh it was the habit of the cubans to refer to their enemies as quintos the fifth part of a man with a wave of his hand gomez returned to his reading as judson led his companion away he said when you have finished with lopez come to my shack and well have supper and ill introduce you to the rest of our gang you wont get much to eat for were short of grub but its worse where lopez comes from col miguel lopez a handsome animated fellow took oreillys hand in a hearty clasp when they were introduced but a moment later his smile gave way to a frown and his brow darkened so you are that oreilly from matanzas said he i know you now but i never expected we would meet esteban varona told you about me did he not the colonel inclined his head im here at last after the devils own time ive been trying every way to get through the spaniards stopped me at puerto principe they sent me back home you know ive been half crazy i you oreilly swallowed hard you know where esteban is tell me have you heard nothing nothing whatever that is nothing since rosa his sister you understand she and i are engaged yes yes esteban told me all about you something in the cubans gravity of manner gave oreilly warning a sudden fear assailed him his voice shook as he asked what is it my god not bad news there was no need for the officer to answer in his averted gaze oreilly read confirmation of his sickest apprehensions the men faced each other for a long moment while the color slowly drove out of the americans cheeks leaving him pallid stricken he wet his lips to speak but his voice was no more than a dry throaty rustle tell me which one he whispered both oreilly recoiled a spasm distorted his chalky face he began to shake weakly and his fingers plucked aimlessly at each other lopez took him by the arm try to control yourself said he sit here while i try to tell you what little i know or would it not be better to wait awhile until you are calmer as the young man made no answer except to stare at him in a white agony of suspense he sighed very well then as you wish but you must be a man like the rest of us i too have suffered my father lopezs mustached lip drew back and his teeth showed through died in the laurel ditch at cabanas on the very day after my first victory they shot him an old man christ it is because of such things that we cubans fight while we starve that we shall continue to fight until no spaniard is left upon this island we have all faced something like that which you are facing now our parents murdered our sisters and our sweethearts wronged oreilly huddled where he had sunk upon the bench uttered a gasping inarticulate cry and covered his face as if from a lash i will tell you all i know which isnt much esteban varona came to me soon after he and his sister had fled from their home he wanted to join my forces but we were harassed on every side and i didnt dare take the girl no woman could have endured the hardships we suffered so i convinced him that his first duty was to her rather than to his country and he agreed he was a fine boy he had spirit he bought some stolen rifles and armed a band of his own which wasnt a bad idea i used to hear about him nobody cared to molest him i can tell you until finally he killed some of the regular troops then of course they went after him meanwhile he managed to destroy his own plantations which cueto had robbed him of you knew cueto yes well esteban put an end to him after a while rode right up to la joya one night broke in the door and macheted the scoundrel in his bed but there was a mistake of some sort it seems that a body of cobos volunteers were somewhere close by and the two parties met i have never learned all the details of the affair and the stories of that fight which came to me are too preposterous for belief still esteban and his men must have fought like demons for they killed some incredible number but they were human they could not defeat a regiment it seems that only one or two of them escaped esteban did he colonel lopez nodded then he said gravely cobo takes no prisoners i was in the rubi hills at the time fighting hard and it was six weeks before i got back into matanzas naturally when i heard what had happened i tried to find the girl but weyler was concentrating the pacificos by that time and there was nobody left in the yumuri it was a desert then you dont know positively that she that she wait there is no doubt that the boy was killed but of rosas fate i can only form my own opinion however one of estebans men joined my troops later and i not only learned something about the girl but also why esteban had been so relentlessly pursued it was all cobos doings you have heard of the fellow no well you will the speakers tone was eloquent of hatred he is worse than the worst of them a monster he had seen miss varona she was a beautiful girl go on whispered the lover i discovered that she didnt at first obey weylers edict she and the two negroes they were former slaves of her father i believe took refuge in the pan de matanzas later on cobos men made a raid and killed a great many some few escaped into the high ravines but miss varona was not one of them out of regard for esteban i made careful search but i could find no trace of her and yet you dont know what happened oreilly ventured youre not sure no but i tell you again cobos men take no prisoners when i heard about that raid i gave up looking for her this cobo the americans voice shook in spite of his effort to hold it steady i shall hope to meet him some time the sudden fury that filled colonel lopezs face was almost hidden by the gloom yes oh yes he cried quickly and you are but one of a hundred i am another in my command there is a standing order to spare neither cobo nor any of his assassins they neither expect nor receive quarter from us now companero the cuban dropped a hand on oreillys bowed head i am sorry that i had to bring you such evil tidings but we are men and this is war no no it isnt war its merciless savagery to murder children and to outrage women why that violates all the ethics of warfare ethics the colonel cried harshly ethics hell is without ethics why look for ethics in war violence injustice insanitychaos that is war it is mans agony womans despair it is a defiance of god war is without mercy without law it is well it is the absence of all law all good there was a considerable silence then lopez went on in another key we cubans carry heavy hearts but our wrongs have made us mighty and our sufferings have made us brave here in the orient we do well enough but believe me you cannot imagine the desolation and the suffering farther west whole provinces made barren and their inhabitants either dead or dying the world has never seen anything like weylers slaughter of the innocents if there is indeed a god and sometimes i doubt it he will not permit this horror to continue from every pool of cuban blood another patriot will spring up until we drive that archfiend and his armies into the sea go back to your own country now and if your grief has made you one of us in sympathy tell the world what that black butcher in havana is doing and beg your government to recognize our belligerency so that we may have arms arms it was some time before oreilly spoke then he said quietly i am not going back i am going to stay here and look for rosa so exclaimed the colonel well why not so long as we do not know precisely what has happened to her we can at least hope but if i were you i would rather think of her as dead than as a prisoner in some concentration camp you dont know what those camps are like my friend but i do now i shall leave you one needs to be alone at such an hour eh with a pressure of his hand colonel lopez walked away into the darkness judson and his adventurous countryman did not see oreilly that night nor in fact did any one but the next morning he appeared before general gomez he was haggard sick listless the old portorican had heard from lopez in the mean time he was sympathetic i am sorry you came all the way to hear such bad news he said war is a sad hopeless business but i havent given up hope oreilly said i want to stay here and and fight i inferred as much from what lopez told me the general nodded his white head well youll make a good soldier and we shall be glad to have you he extended his hand and oreilly took it gratefully the city of matanzas was pacified so ran the boastful bando of the captaingeneral and this was no exaggeration as any one could see from the number of beggars there of all his military operations this pacification of the western towns and provinces was the most conspicuously successful and the one which gave valeriano weyler the keenest satisfaction for nowhere did rebellion lift its head except perhaps among the ranks of those disaffected men who hid in the hills with nothing above them but the open sky as for the population at large it was cured of treason it no longer resisted even weakly the law of spain the reason was that it lay dying weylers cure was simple efficacious it consisted of extermination swift and pitiless poverty had been common in matanzas even before the war but now there were so many beggars in the city that nobody undertook to count them when the refugees began to pour in by the thousands and when it became apparent that the government intended to let them starve the better citizens undertook an effort at relief but times were hard food was scarce and prices high moreover it soon transpired that the military frowned upon everything like organized charity and in consequence the newcomers were perforce abandoned to their own devices these country people were dumb and terrified at the misfortunes which had overtaken them they wandered the streets in aimless bewilderment fearful of what blow might next befall they were not used to begging and therefore they did not often implore alms but all day long they asked for work for bread that their little ones might live work however was even scarcer than food and the time soon came when they crouched upon curbs and doorsteps hopeless beaten silently reproachful of those more fortunate than they their eyes grew big and hollow their outstretched hands grew gaunt and skinny the sound of weeping women and fretting babies became a common thing to hear in the suburbs just within the ring of guardian forts an area of cultivation was set aside and here the prisoners put up huts of yagua comfortless bark shelters which were well enough perhaps in fair weather but sadly ineffective against wind and rain here housed with hunger and crowded together in indescribable squalor they dwelt seeking comfort in their common wretchedness since they had no farm implements no seeds no means whatever of cultivating this ground apportioned to their use it remained untilled while they grew hungrier day by day outside the lines there were yams potatoes edible roots and such for the spaniards work of desolation had not been quite complete and no hand can rob the cuban soil of all its riches but the pacificos were not allowed to leave the city fish were plentiful in the harbor too but to catch them was forbidden sentries were on guard with ready rifles and bared machetes every morning through the filthy reconcentrado quarter guerrillas drove packmules bearing the mutilated bodies of those who had dared during the night to seek food surreptitiously sometimes they dragged these ghastly reminders at the ends of ropes this indeed was a favorite way with them dogs and cats became choice articles of diet until they disappeared the government did supply one quality of food however at intervals it distributed yucca roots but these were starchy and almost indigestible from eating them the children grew pinched in limb and face while their abdomens bloated hugely matanzas became peopled with a race of grotesquely misshapen little folks gnomes with young bodies but with faces old and sick of course disease became epidemic for in the leaky hovels dirtfloored and destitute of any convenience there could be no effort at sanitation conditions became unspeakable the children died first then the aged and infirm deaths in the street were not uncommon nearly every morning bodies were found beneath the portales starving creatures crept to the market in the hope of begging a stray bit of food and some of them died there between the empty stalls the deathwagons heavy with their daily freight rumbled ceaselessly through the streets adding to the giant piles of unburied corpses outside the city typhoid smallpox yellow fever raged unchecked the hospitals were crowded and even in them the commonest necessities were lacking it is believed that men have returned from the grave but no one either spaniard or cuban had ever been known to return from one of these pesthouses and in consequence those who were stricken preferred to remain and to die among their dear ones yes matanzas was pacified weylers boast was true nowhere in the entire province was a field in cultivation nowhere outside the garrisoned towns was a house left standing nor was the city of matanzas the only concentration camp there were others dotted through santa clara habana and pinar del rio in them half a million people cried for food truly no rebellious land was ever more completely pacified than this no peoples spirits ever more completely crushed voices no longer preached resistance they prayed to our lady of pity for a merciful conclusion of this misery hands were upraised but only to implore in leaky huts from jucaro to cape san antonio the dead lay huddled thickly into matanzas city of beggary and death came rosa varona and her two negro companions looking for relief they made the journey without mishap for they were too destitute to warrant plundering and rosas disguise concealed what charms remained to her but once they had entered the city what an awakening what suffering what poverty what rags they saw the three of them grew weak with dismay at the horror of it all but there was no retreat asensio built a makeshift shelter close under la cumbre from it the ruins of the quinta de esteban were visible and there they settled down to live they had hoped to lose themselves among the other prisoners and in this they were successful for none of their miserable neighbors were in any condition to notice them and there was nothing sufficiently conspicuous about two tattered blacks and their hunchbacked daughter to draw attention from the soldiers asensio foraged zealously and at first he managed somehow to secure enough food for his little family he developed a real talent for discovering vegetables and fruits he stole he begged and he found food where there was none one day the soldiers seized him and put him to work on the fortifications along with a gang of other men who appeared strong enough to stand hard labor asensio was not paid for this but he was allowed one meal a day and he succeeded in bringing home each night a share of his allotment it is surprising how little nourishment will sustain life rosa and her two friends had long felt the pinch of hunger but now they plumbed new depths of privation for there were days when asensio and his fellowconscripts received nothing at all after a time evangelina began making baskets and weaving palmleaf hats which she sold at six cents each she taught rosa the craft and they worked from dawn until dark striving with nimble tireless fingers to supplement asensios rations and postpone starvation but it was a hopeless task other nimble fingers worked as tirelessly as theirs and the demand for hats was limited their hut overlooked the road to san severino that via dolorosa on which condemned prisoners were marched out to execution and in time the women learned to recognize the peculiar blaring notes of a certain cornet which signified that another cuban cock was about to crow when in the damp of dewy mornings they heard that bugle they ceased their weaving long enough to cross themselves and whisper a prayer for the souls of those who were on their way to die but this was the only respite they allowed themselves rosa meditated much upon the contrast between her present and her former condition matanzas was the city of her birth and time was when she had trod its streets in arrogance and pride when she had possessed friends by the score among its residents but of all these there was not one to whom she dared appeal in this her hour of need these were harsh times spanish hatred of the revolutionists was bitter and of the cuban sympathizers none were left moreover estebans denouncement as a traitor had estranged all who remained loyal to the crown and so far as rosa herself was concerned she knew that it would not matter to them that she had cleaved to him merely from sisterly devotion by that act she had made herself a common enemy and they would scarcely sympathize with her plight the girl had learned only too well what spirit was abroad but even had she felt assured of meeting sympathy her pride was pure castilian and it would never down she a varona whose name was one to conjure with whose lineage was of the highest she to beg the thing was quite impossible one crumb so taken would have choked her rosa preferred to suffer proudly and await the hour when hunger or disease would at last blot out her memories of happy days and end this nightmare misery then too she dreaded any risk of discovery by old mario de castano who was a hard vindictive man his parting words had shown her that he would never forgive the slight she had put upon him and she did not wish to put his threats to the test once rosa saw him on her way to buy a few centavos worth of sweetpotatoes he was huddled in his victoria a huge bladder of flesh and he rode the streets deaf to the plaints of starving children blind to the misery of beseeching mothers rosa shrank into a doorway and drew her tattered shawl closer over her face for fear don mario might recognize in this misshapen body and in these pinched discolored features the beauteous blossom he had craved nor did she forget colonel cobo the mans memory haunted her asleep and awake of him she was most desperately afraid when for the first time she saw him riding at the head of his cutthroats she was like to swoon in her tracks and for a whole day thereafter she cowered in the hut trembling at every sound in these dark hours she recalled the stories of the old varona treasure and estebans interesting theory of its whereabouts but she could not bring herself to put much faith in either at the time of her brothers recital she had been swayed by his conviction but now on cooler thought a dozen explanations of dona isabels possession of that doubloon offered themselves no one of which seemed less probable than estebans of course it was barely possible that there was indeed a treasure and even that estebans surmise had been correct but it was little more than a remote possibility distance lends a rosy color of reality to our most absurd imaginings but like the haze that tints a faroff landscape it dissolves upon approach now that rosa was here in sight of the ruined quinta itself her hopes and halfbeliefs faded she wanted oh so desperately to believe in it but the grinding misery of her situation made it hard to do so wonders like that came true only in fairy stories she told herself and certainly she had no cause to consider herself a favorite of fortune more than once she was tempted to confide in evangelina and asensio but she thought better of it although she put implicit faith in evangelinas discretion she knew that asensio was not the sort of fellow to be trusted with a secret of great magnitudehe was boastful talkative excitable he was just the sort to bring destruction upon all of them rosa had sufficient intelligence to realize that even if she found her fathers riches they would only constitute another and a greater menace to the lives of all of them nevertheless she wished to set her mind at rest once and for all taking evangelina with her she climbed la cumbre one day in search of roots and vegetables it turned out to be a sad experience for both women the negress wept noisily at the destruction wrought by pancho cueto and rosa was overcome by painful memories little that was familiar remained evidence of cuetos alldevouring greed spoke from the sprouting furrows his men had dug from the naked trees they had felled and piled in orderly heaps from the stones and mortar of the house itself tears blinded rosa after a time she left the black woman mourning among the ruins and stole away to the sunken garden here the marks of vandalism were less noticeable nevertheless few signs of beauty remained neglected vines drooped spiritlessly from the ledges such fruittrees as had been spared were sickly and untended time and the elements had all but completed the disheartening work the well remained although it had been planked over but it was partially filled up with rubbish as rosa discovered when she peered into it only a tiny pool of scum was in the bottom after a long scrutiny the girl arose convinced at last of her brothers delusion and vaguely ashamed of her own credulity this was about the last repository that such a man as don esteban her father would have been likely to select for after all the most valuable part of his fortune had consisted of the deeds of title to the plantations no if ever there had been a treasure it was hidden elsewhere all of value that this well contained for rosa was her memory of a happiness departed of such memories the well the whole place was brimful here as a child she had romped with esteban here as a girl she had dreamed her first dreams and here oreilly her smiling knight had found her yonder was the very spot where he had held her in his arms and begged her to await the day of his return well she had waited but was that rosa varona who had promised so freely and so confidently this pitiful rosa whose bones protruded through her rags it could not be happiness contentment hope these were fictions only misery despair and pain were real but it had been a glorious dream at any rate a dream which rosa vowed to cherish always evangelina found the girl sitting in the sun her thin face radiant her great eyes wet but smiling come little dove said the negress there is nothing here to eat we must get back to our weaving xviii speaking of food it was part of the strategy practised by the cuban leaders to divide their forces into separate columns for the purpose of raiding the smaller spanish garrisons and harassing the troops sent to their relief reassembling these bands only when and where some telling blow was to be struck not only had the military value of this practice been amply demonstrated but it had been proved a necessity owing to the fact that the insurrectos were compelled to live off the country when oreilly and branch enlisted in the army of the orient they were assigned to the command of colonel miguel lopez and it was under his leadership that they made their first acquaintance with the peculiar methods of cuban warfare active service for the two americans began at once scarcely a week had passed before leslie branch gained his opportunity of tasting the salt of life in its full flavor for the young matanzas colonel was one of the few cuban commanders who really enjoyed a fight there had been at first some doubt of branchs fitness to take the field at all he had suffered a severe hemorrhage shortly after his arrival at cubitas and it was only after a hysterical demonstration on his part that he had been accepted as a soldier he simply would not be left behind at first the cubans regarded him with mingled contempt and pity for certainly no less promising volunteer had ever taken service with them nevertheless he would doubtless have made many friends among them had he not begun his service by refusing to abide by discipline of any sort and by scorning all instruction in the use of arms declaring this to be in his case a silly waste of effort such an attitude very naturally aroused resentment among the other men it was not long before they began to grumble at the liberty allowed this headstrong weakling but upon the occasion of the very first fight this illwill disappeared as if by magic for although branch deliberately disobeyed orders he nevertheless displayed such amazing audacity in the face of the enemy such a theatrical contempt for bullets as to stupefy every one moreover he lived up to his reputation he continued to be insanely daring varying his exploits to correspond with his moods with the result that he attained a popularity which was unique nay sensational his conduct in the face of this general admiration was no less unexpected than his behavior under fire branch gruffly refused to accept any tribute whatever he snarled he fairly barked at those of his comrades who tried to express their appreciation of his conduct a demeanor which of course awakened even greater admiration among the cubans he was uniformly surly and sour he sneered he scoffed he found fault he had the tongue of a common scold and he used it with malevolent abandon it was fortunate indeed that he knew no spanish and that most of his companions were equally ignorant of english for mere admiration even of the fervent latin quality would scarcely have been proof against his spleen as it was his campmates endured his vituperations blandly putting him down as a pleasing eccentric in whom there blazed a curious but inspiring spirit of patriotism oreilly alone understood the reason for the fellows morbid irritability his suicidal recklessness but when he privately remonstrated he was gruffly told to mind his own business branch flatly refused to modify his conduct he seemed really bent upon cheating the disease that made his life a misery but as usual fate was perverse she refused to humor the sick mans hope when after blindly inviting death leslie had emerged from several engagements unscathed his surprise and perhaps a natural relief at finding himself whole became tinged with a certain apprehension lest he survive those deliberately courted dangers only to succumb to the ills and privations of camp life cuban equipment was of the scantiest cuban dews are heavy cuban nights are cool these were perils indeed for a weaklunged invalid branch began to fret rain filled him with more terror than fixed bayonets a chill caused him keener consternation than did a thousand spaniards he began to have agonizing visions of himself lying in some leaky hovel of a hospital it was typical of his peculiar irritability that he held oreilly in some way responsible and vented upon him his bitterness of spirit the fellows tongue grew ever sharper his society became intolerable his gloom oppressive and irresistibly contagious when after several weeks of campaigning the column went into camp for a short rest oreilly decided that he would try to throw off the burden of leslies overwhelming dejection and if possible shift a portion of it upon the shoulders of captain judson on the day after their arrival oreilly and the big artilleryman took advantage of a pleasant stream to bathe and wash their clothes then while they lay in their hammocks enjoying the luxury of a tattered oilcloth shelter and waiting for the sun to dry their garments oreilly spoke what was in his mind im getting about fed up on leslie he declared hes the worlds champion crepehanger and hes painted the whole world such a deep despondent blue that im completely dismal youve got to take him off my hands judson grunted what ails him well he wears a wreath of immortelles day and night havent you guessed why he runs such desperate chances hes sick thinks hes going to die anyhow and wants to finish the job quick im the one who has to endure him suicide it amounts to that the devil judson pondered for a moment cant you cheer him up i oreilly lifted his hands in a gesture of helplessness when i try he gets sore at my heartless indifference when i sympathize he declares im nudging him closer to his grave says im kicking the crutches out from under him hes just plain vitriol i id rather live with an adder oreillys youthful asistente who at the moment was painstakingly manufacturing a huge black cigar for himself out of some purloined tobacco pricked up his ears at the mention of branchs name and now edged closer exclaiming carumba theres a hero for you meester branch is the bravest man i ever seen our people call him el demonio oreilly jerked his head toward the cuban you see hes made the hit of his life and yet he resents it the cubans are beginning to think he carries a rabbits foot no rabbits foot about it the captain asserted hes just so blamed thin the spaniards cant hit him its like shooting at the edge of a playingcard annie oakley is the only one who can do that well my nerves are frayed out ive argued myself hoarse but he misconstrues everything i say i wish youd convince him that he has a chance to get well it might alter his disposition if something doesnt alter it ill be courtmartialed for shooting a man in his sleep and ill hit him right in the middle no matter how slim he is oreilly compressed his lips firmly the asistente who had finished rolling his cigar now lighted it and repeated yes sir meester branch is the bravest man i ever seen you remember that first battle eh those spaniards seen him comin and threw down their guns and beat it jesus cristo i laugh to skill myself that day jacket was at once the youngest and the most profane member of colonel lopezs entire command the most shocking oaths fell from his beardless lips whenever he opened them to speak english and oreillys efforts to break the boy of the habit proved quite unavailing colonel miguel continued jacket he say if hes got a hunnerd sick men like el demonio hell march to habana by god what you think of that judson rolled in his hammock until his eyes rested upon the youth then he said youre quite a man of arms yourself for a halfportion eh the object of this remark was not quite sure that he understood i mean youre a pretty good fighter for a little fellow hell yes agreed the youth i can fight better look out that some big spaniard doesnt carry you off in his pocket and eat you oreilly warned at which the boy grinned and shook his head he was just becoming accustomed to the american habit of banter and was beginning to like it jacket would make a bitter mouthful judson ventured the lad smiled gently and drew on his huge cigar you betcher life thatspaniard would spit me out quick enough this camagueyan boy was a character he was perhaps sixteen and small for his age a mere child in fact nevertheless he was a seasoned veteran and his american campmates had grown exceedingly fond of him he was a pretty graceful youngster his eyes were large and soft and dark his face was as sensitive and mobile as that of a girl and yet despite his youth he had won a reputation for daring and ferocity quite as notable in its way as was the renown of leslie branch there were many of these immature soldiers among the insurrectos and most of them were in some way distinguished for valor war it seems fattens upon the tenderest of foods and every army has its boys its wondrous wellbeloved infants whom their older comrades tease torment and idolize impetuous drunk with youth and keeping no company with care they form the very aristocracy of fighting forces they gaily undertake the maddest of adventures and by their examples they fire the courage of their maturer comrades all history is spiced with their exploits jacket was one of these and he was perhaps the truest patriot of any soldier in miguel lopezs band for liberty to him was not a mere abstraction or a principle but something real tangible alive something worthy of the highest sacrifice in his person all the wrongs of cuba burned perpetually it mattered not that he himself had never suffered his spirit was the spirit of his country pure exalted undefiled he stood for what the others fought for in order to expand his knowledge of english of which by the way he was inordinately proud jacket had volunteered to serve as oreillys striker and the result had been a fast friendship it was oreilly who had given the boy his nickname a name prompted by a marked eccentricity for although jacket possessed the two garments which constituted the ordinary insurrecto uniform he made a practice of wearing only one on chilly nights or on formal occasions he wore both waistcoat and trousers but at other times he dispensed entirely with the latter and his legs went naked they were naked now as with the modesty of complete unconsciousness he squatted in the shade puffing thoughtfully at his giant cheroot once jackets mind was fastened upon any subject it remained there and after a time he continued yes i bet i dont taste good to no spaniard did i told you about that battle of pino bravo eh he turned his big brown eyes upward to oreilly cristo i skill moren a dozen men that day oh jacket the americans cried you monstrous little liar commented oreilly si senors the boy went on complacently that day i skill moren six men it was this way we came on them from behind and they dont see us phui we skill plenty all right it was a hot scrimmage judson attested some of luques niggers those tall lean hungry fellows from santiago managed to hack their way through a wire fence and get behind a detachment of the enemy who had made a stand under a hill they charged and for a wonder they got close enough to use their machetes it was bloody work the kind you read about no quarter somehow jacket managed to be right in the middle of the butchery hes a bravo kid all right muy malo there was a moments silence then judson continued funny thing happened afterward though jacket had to do his turn at picket duty that night and he got scared of the dark we heard him squalling and screaming jacket started to his feet thats a dam lie he exclaimed resentfully im not scared of no dark didnt you holler till you woke the whole camp i aint scared of no dark the boy repeated but his pride his complacency had suddenly vanished he dug his toes into the dirt in his eyes were tears of mortification his cigar had evidently become tasteless for he removed it from his lips and gazed at it indifferently did you cry oreilly smiled and the lad nodded reluctantly did he cry judson echoed why we thought we were attacked he put the whole camp in an uproar what was the trouble jacket i i was the boys smooth brown cheeks paled and his moist eyes dilated at the memory i aint scared of any spaniard when hes alive but its different when hes dead i could see dead ones everywhere he shuddered involuntarily they fetched me to general gomez and caramba hes mad but after i tell him what i seen in the dark he say i dont have to go back there no more he let me go to sleep longside of his hammock and bimeby i quit cryin i aint never stood no picket duty since that night i wont do it it was plain that discussion of this unhappy subject was deeply distasteful to the youthful hero of pino bravo for he edged away and a moment later disappeared queer little youngster captain judson said meditatively he idolizes you oreilly nodded yes poor little kid i wonder what will become of him after the war after the war he mused i wonder if it will ever end humph if we had more generals like gomez and garcia and maceo weve got three better generals than they you mean generals june july and august oh yes the artilleryman nodded his understanding theres no end of yellowjack among the spaniards speaking of that what do you think of miss evanss work in the field hospitals judson shifted his weight so that his eyes could rest upon a white tent which showed through the greenery at a distance it was the one tent in all the encampment and it had been erected that very morning to shelter norine evans but just arrived from headquarters in the cubitas hills the captains lids were half closed his heavy homely face was softened by a peculiar rapt expression he did not seem to expect an answer to his question i dont think much of it oreilly confessed you dont judson brought himself back to earth with a start humph well i think its perfectly wonderful i think shes the most wonderful woman and his voice died out he turned once more in the direction of the tent oreilly smiled understanding now the reason for his companions reckless almost frenzied use of soap and water that morning and his cheerful stoicism in the hands of a volunteer barber more accustomed to the uses of a machete than a razor evidently judson had fallen too along with major ramos and colonel lopez and leslie branch and all the rest well it was to be expected before he had been a week in cuba oreilly had noticed that miss evans was a mystery and a delight to nearly every man she met so youve got it eh he inquired got what judson did not turn his eyes it it if you cant talk english talk spanish oreilly was not perturbed by this gruffness i think her presence here is the silliest the most scandalous thing i ever heard of said he the idea of a girl of her accomplishments her means alone in cuba why its criminal judsons gunnysacking hammock bulged beneath him it threatened to give way as he sat up with a jerk and swung his bare legs over the side his face was dark he was scowling his chin was pugnaciously outthrust and his voice rumbled as he exclaimed the deuce it is say i dont like the way you talk about that girl you dont eh oreilly eyed him quizzically would you care to have your sister do what shes doing thats not the point you cant compare her with ordinary women well this isnt an ordinary environment for a woman no matter who she is these cubans are bound to talk about her are they judson glared at the speaker id like to hear em id like to see somebody get fresh why say he clenched his powerful hands id fill their hospitals until they bulged after a moment he continued i spose its natural for you to worry since youre responsible for her being here in a way but his tone changed he relaxed and lay back in his hammock oh well youre about the only man i cant hate jealous are you i didnt know you were in so deep the other shook his head oh im daffy dyou think shed have me not a chance hey why not im a good big husky ill get a government job when the war is over and thats just the trouble shell fall for some poor sickly unfortunate with one leg shes the sort that always does shes the sort that has to have something to mother lord id give a good deal to see her safely back in new york judson it seemed had a better understanding of artillery than of women he pondered oreillys statement seriously and his face clouded some sickly fellow some fellow like branch eh after a moment he continued more hopefully well it wont be him hell soon be dead theres some consolation in that i could almost oreilly motioned for silence for at that moment branch himself approached his long face set in lines of discontent even deeper than usual he had been wandering about the camp in one of his restless fits and now he began say what do you think ive been doing i dunno captain judson answered morosely cheering the sick and wounded shedding smiles and sunshine as usual i suppose hunh youre a funny guy arent you about as comical as a chloroform cone you make me laugh you do just like a broken leg well ive been looking up some grub for miss evans and i cant find any cant find any nothing fit for her to eat you dont expect her to live on this infernal eternal and internal beef stew branch shuddered and gagged slightly ive eaten parts of animals that were never intended to be eaten this rebel grub is killing me whatll it do to her didnt major ramos bring anything along oreilly asked he says theres a famine at cubitas wed better look into this judson exclaimed and finding that his clothes were dry he hurriedly began to dress himself together the three men made an investigation of the camps resources only to discover that branch was right there was indeed but little food of any kind and that little was of the coarsest ordinarily such a condition of affairs would have occasioned them no surprise for the men were becoming accustomed to a more or less chronic scarcity of provisions but the presence of norine evans put quite a different complexion upon the matter they were still discussing the situation when miss evans having finished her afternoon nap threw open the flaps of her tent and stepped out when she had listened to the account apologetically submitted by her three friends she drew her brows together saying plaintively oh dear weve been going short for a week and major ramos told me wed fare better when we got here i had my mouth all set for a banquet couldnt you even find the poor dog a bone norine was thinner and browner than when she had come to cuba but she in no way showed the effect of any serious or continued lack of nourishment in fact a simple diet and an outdoor life had agreed with her amazingly im afraid the cupboard is bare oreilly acknowledged theyre getting ready to slaughter another guttapercha ox branch said gloomily hes a veteran of the ten years war that means stew again stew one punctureproof rubber ox and a bushel of sweetpotatoes for four hundred men do you know what i want for dinner norine inquired lamb chops with green peas some nice white bread a salad and coffee the three men looked at her anxiously judson stirred uneasily thats what i want i dont expect to get it with a sigh of relief the captain exclaimed i thought you were giving your order goodness no with a laugh the girl seated herself upon her one campchair inviting her callers to dispose themselves on the ground about her if you can stand the food i dare say i can now then tell me what youve been doing since you left cubitas ive been frightened to death that some of you would be hurt thats one reason why ive been working night and day helping to get the hospitals in shape i cant bear to think of our boys being wounded not much chance of our getting shot oreilly told her but leslie he needs a good talking to he has gone into the hero business branch uttered a disdainful grunt nothing of the sort im a sick man if id rather get shot than suffer a slow death from neglect its my own business isnt it imagine feeding an invalid on boiled bicycle tires gee id like to have a meal of nice nourishing ptomaines for a change hero humph norine eyed the complainant critically then said the diet agrees with you you look better than you did branch turned a somber glance upon her and gave vent to a bitter sneering laugh it was plain that he believed she too was attempting to pull the wool over his eyes i wish i could find some poisonous toadstools id eat em raw listen norine went on lets play a game well imagine this is delmonicos and well all take turns ordering the best things to eat that we can think of the one who orders best wins well call the game she frowned thoughtfully call it vittles oreilly suggested vittles it is maybe it will give us an appetite for supper leslie you begin come now hand your hat to the hatboy then follow the head waiter this way sir table for one very good sir heres a cool one in front of the electric fan we have an exceptional selection of cold dishes today sir perhaps you would like a nice halibut salad no halibut salad branch answered striving valiantly to enter into the spirit of norines pretending i had it for breakfast and say turn off that fan im just back from cuba now then you may bring me some oysters oysters are out of season oreilly murmured politely but our clams are very fine some oysters branch insisted stubbornly after that a cup of chicken broth a grilled sweetbread and toast melba joe judson put an abrupt end to the invalids meal by hurling a clod at him crying youre in delmonicos not in battle creek let somebody order who knows how well have steak and onions all around i want strawberries norine cried theyre ripe now strawberries and cream ohh think of it there was a tense silence which oreilly broke by saying i guess vittles isnt a very good game after all it doesnt seem to fill my wants the girl acknowledged lets talk about something else miss evans did seem truly concerned for the welfare of her boys as she termed the little group of americans whom she had met and she showed by asking numerous questions that her interest was keen the men were glad to talk and she soon gained an insight into the peculiar aimless unsatisfactory and yet effective method of warfare practised by the insurrecto armies they told her of the endless marches and countermarches the occasional skirmishes the feints the inconclusive engagements which were all a part of the general strategy operations which served to keep the enemy constantly on guard like a blind swordsman and would it was hoped eventually wear down his patience and endurance in her turn norine related something of what she was doing and how her labor of mercy progressed im nearly discouraged she confessed finally everything is so different to what i thought it would be and im so weak and ineffective the medical supplies i brought are nearly all gone and ive learned what hard work it is fitting up hospitals when theres nothing to fit them up with i cant teach these people to take care of themselves they seem to consider precautions against disease as a confession of cowardice summer the yellowfever season is here and well im getting disheartened disheartened and hungry theyre new sensations to me she sighed i imagined i was going to work wonders i thought i was going to be a florence nightingale and the men were going to idolize me dont they judson demanded no that is not in exactly the way i expected they all want to marry her oreilly explained insolent bunch growled the captain then he swallowed hard and said but for that matter so do i why joe norine cast a startled glance at the big fellow its a fact he asserted doggedly i might as well declare myself here and now theres always a gang of eavesdroppers hanging around you he means you leslie oreilly said hadnt you better take a walk branch rolled a hostile eye at the artilleryman and his lip curled ill not move when he gets through ill propose how silly you boys can be norine laughed i dare say the others are joking too but joking oreilly grinned not at all im the only single man in camp who isnt in love with you when you arrived this morning there was a general stampede for the river ill bet the fish in this stream will taste of soap for years to come as if to point oreillys words at the moment appeared colonel lopez shaved bloodraw and clad in a recently laundered uniform which was still damp the three americans rose to salute him but discipline was lax and he waved them back to their seats other eyes than his too had noted miss evanss reappearance after her siesta for major ramos norines escort from headquarters soon joined the group and he was followed by two camagueyan lieutenants these latter were youths of some family standing before the war they had been dandies and they still had an excellent opinion of their physical charms but unfortunately they spoke no english and hence their attentions to norine had been somewhat vague and pointless they possessed eloquent eyes however and now they languished melting glances upon her the meaning of which she had no difficulty in translating weve been talking about food leslie branch advised his commanding officer miss evans isnt a burning patriot like the rest of us and so of course she cant share our ravenous appetite for beef cooked and eaten on the hoof so lopezs handsome face clouded you are hungry then norine confessed that she was im starving said she i havent had a decent meal for a week god be praised i know where there is a goat not two leagues away said the colonel but i dont want a goat norine complained i want well pickles and jam and sardines and candy and toothpowder real boardingschool luxuries id just like to rob a general store lopez furrowed his brows and lost himself in thought later while the others were talking he drew ramos aside and for a while they kept their heads together then they invited judson to join their council it was not until perhaps an hour later that oreilly had a chance for a confidential talk with norine for in the mean time other officers came to pay their respects but when the last one had reluctantly departed he said ive been talking to joe about you and i dont think its right for you to be running around alone this way you know how mad that sort of talk makes me she warned him yes just the same ill never feel easy until youre safe home again and ill never stop bothering you until in the first place im not alone i take a woman with me everywhere a mrs ruiz bah shes no more of a chaperon than i am norine uttered an impatient exclamation is this a time to consider such things oh i dare say the nature of your work is unconventional and excuses a good deal but you dont understand the latin mind as i do these cubans have different standards than ours theyre very apt to think i dont care what they think the girl declared so long as i think im doing right thats final there was a brief pause then oreilly admitted im not seriously concerned over that part of it either for you are the best judge of what is right and proper what does concern me however is the effect all this may have upon you yourself youre impractical romantic norine laughed shortly but he went on stubbornly and just the sort of girl to be carried away by some extravagant impulse what makes you think im impractical and romantic you wouldnt be here otherwise very well what are you trying to get at what do you mean by some extravagant impulse im afraid oreilly hesitated then voiced a fear which had troubled him more than he cared to acknowledge im afraid of some silly entanglement some love affair norines laughter rang out spontaneous unaffected it served to relieve the momentary tension which had sprung up between them all these men are attracted to you as it is quite natural they should be oreilly hurried on im worried to death for fear youll forget that youre too blamed good for any of them what a conscientious duenna you are she told him but rest easy im thoroughly homesick and ready to flunk it all at the first good excuse ill make you a promise johnnie if i decide to fall in love with any of these ragged heroes ill choose you most of them think there is something between us anyhow i dont quite understand how i manage to resist you oreilly told her for i think youre perfectly splendid probably thats why id hate to see you married to some onelegged veteran of this amateur war women dont marry legs she told him lightly then more seriously she asked what are you doing about rosa im waiting to hear from matanzas province when i joined the army i had to go where i was sent of course but general gomez has started inquiries and as soon as i learn something definite i shall follow it up i shall go where the trail leads you still have hope he nodded i refuse to let myself doubt when oreilly joined judson for supper the latter met him with a broad grin on his face well said he it seems you started something with your game of vittles you can get ready to saddle up when the moon rises what do you mean the colonel took miss evans at her word were going to raid san antonio de los banos two hundred of us to get her some pickles and jam and candy and toothpowder xix that sick man from san antonio certain histories of the cuban war for independence speak of the battle of san antonio de los banos they relate how one thousand patriots captured the village after a gallant and sanguinary resistance by its spanish garrison how they released the prisoners in the local jail replenished their own supplies and then retired in the face of enemy reinforcements it is quite a stirring story to read and it has but one fault a fault by the way not uncommon in histories it is mainly untrue in the first place the engagement was in no sense a battle but merely a raid the number of troops engaged was perhaps onefifth of the generous total ascribed by the historians and as a military manoeuver it served no purpose whatsoever that the cubans delivered a spirited attack there is no denying as a matter of fact the engagement was characterized by an abandon by a lack of caution truly sensational the reason being that the insurrectos were half starved and stormed the town much as hungry hoboes attack a lunchcounter nevertheless since the affair had a direct bearing upon the fortunes of several people connected with this story it is perhaps worth relating the baths of st anthony consisted of a sulphur spring which for many years had been held in high regard by gouty and rheumatic camagueyans around this spring a village had arisen which boasted rather better shops than the ordinary country town it was this fact which had induced the gallant and obliging colonel lopez to attack it for as he explained to his american friends if any place outside of habana was likely to contain pickles jam sardines candy toothpowder and such other delicacies as appeared necessary to the contentment of a visiting american lady san antonio de los banos was the one colonel lopez did not believe in half measures once he had determined to prove his devotion to norine evans he would have sacrificed himself and the flower of his command he would have wasted his last precious threepound shell in breaching the walls of san antonio de los banos rather than fail but as a matter of fact the village had no walls and it was defended only by a couple of blockhouses therefore the colonel left his artillery behind perhaps its name was the most impressive thing about san antonio de los banos its streets were narrow and steep and stony and its flinty little plaza was flanked by stores of the customary sort the fronts of which were open so that mounted customers from the country might ride in to make their purchases crowning two commanding eminences just outside the village limits were the loopholed fortinas where for months past the spanish garrison had been dozing lopez and his troop approached the town in the early morning as they deployed for the attack the colonel issued private instructions to certain members of his command oreilly you and senor branch will enter one grocerystore after another you will purchase that jam those sardines and whatever else you think miss evans would like captain judson you and major ramos will go to the apothecaryshop i understand there is a very good one and look for toothpowder and candy and the like i shall see that the streets are cleared then i shall endeavor to discover some pickles but as god is my judge i doubt if there is such a thing this side of habana leslie branch whose temper had not improved with the long night ride inquired caustically do you expect us to buy the groceries well im broke and so is oreilly have you no money asked the colonel vastly surprised i havent tipped my hat to a dollar since i quit newspaper work whats more i want to do a little shopping for myself oreilly agreed if you dont give us some change colonel well have to open a charge account in your name carmaba muttered lopez i intended to borrow from you gentlemen well never mind well commandeer what we wish in the name of the republic lopezs attack proved a complete surprise both to the citizens and to the garrison of the town the rebel bugle gave the first warning of what was afoot and before the castilian troops who were loitering off duty could regain their quarters before the citizens could take cover or the shopkeepers close and bar their heavy wooden shutters two hundred ragged horsemen were yelling down the streets there followed a typical cuban engagement ten shouts to one shot there was a mad charge on the heels of the scurrying populace a scattering poppop of rifles cheers cries shrieks of defiance and farflung insults directed at the fortinas bugles blew on the hilltops the defenders armed themselves and began to fire into the village but since the insurrectos were now well sheltered by the houses and only a portion of certain streets could be raked from the forts the spanish bullets did no harm obedient to orders a number of lopezs men dismounted and took positions whence they could guard against a sally thus leaving the rest of the command free to raid the stores in the outskirts of the town mausers spoke the dust leaped and leaden messengers whined through the air as locusts settle upon a standing crop so did the army of liberators descend upon the shops of san antonio de los banos it was great fun great excitement while it lasted for the town was distracted and its citizens had neither time nor inclination to resist some of the shopkeepers indeed to prove their loyalty openly welcomed the invaders others however lacking time to close up fled incontinently leaving their goods unguarded oreilly with branch and jacket close at his heels whirled his horse into the first bodega he came to the store was stocked with general merchandise but its owner evidently a spaniard did not tarry to set a price upon any of it as the three horsemen came clattering in at the front he went flying out at the rear and although oreilly called reassuringly after him his only answer was the slamming of a back door followed by swiftly diminishing cries of fright plainly that rush of ragged men those shots those ferocious shouts from the plaza were too much for the peaceful shopkeeper and his family and they had taken refuge in some neighbors garden there was no time to waste johnnie dismounted and walking to the shelves where some imported canned goods were displayed he began to select those delicacies for which he had been sent the devoted jacket was at his side the little cuban exercised no restraint he seized whatever was most handy meanwhile cursing ferociously as befitted a bloodthirsty bandit boys are natural robbers and at this opportunity for loot jackets soul flamed savagely and he swept the shelves bare as he went hey leslie get something to carry this stuff in oreilly directed over his shoulder receiving only a muttered reply he turned to find that his fellowcountryman had cut down a string of perhaps two dozen large straw sombreros and was attempting to select one that fitted his head oh look branch murmured forty dollars worth of lids but all too small they must have been made on the head of a cane take the whole string but get us something to wrap up this grub in hurry spurred by oreillys tone and by a lively rattle of rifleshots outside leslie disappeared into the livingquarters at the back of the store a moment later he emerged with a huge armful of bedclothes evidently snatched at random trailing behind him like a bridal veil was a mosquitonet which in his haste he had torn from its fastenings i guess this is poor he exulted bedding pillows mosquitonet ill sleep comfortable after this from somewhere came the faint smothered wailing of a baby eloquent testimony of the precipitate haste with which the terrified storekeeper and his wife had fled dumping his burden of sheets blankets and brilliantly colored cotton quilts upon the floor branch selected two of the stoutest and began to knot the corners together he had scarcely finished when judson reined in at the door and called to oreilly weve cleaned out the drugstore better get a move on you for we may have to run any minute ive just heard about some cuban prisoners in the calaboose gimme a hand and well let em out sure oreilly quickly remounted meanwhile directing jacket to load the canned goods upon his horse and ride for the open country he looked back a few moments later to see his asistente emerge from the bodega perched between two queerlooking improvised saddlebags bulging with plunder the pony was overloaded but in obedience to the frantic urgings of its barelegged rider it managed to break into a shambling trot branch reappeared too looping the eightfoot string of straw hats to his saddlehorn and balancing before him the remainder of the bedding done up in a gaudy quilt sharing in the general consternation at the attack the jail guards had disappeared leaving lopezs men free to break into the prison when oreilly joined them the work was well under way the municipal building of san antonio was a thickwalled structure with ironbarred windows and stout doors but the latter soon gave way and the attackers poured in seizing whatever implements they could find judson and oreilly went from cell to cell battering prying smashing leaving their comrades to rescue the inmates this jail was a poor affair it could scarcely be dignified by the name of a prison nevertheless true prison conditions prevailed in it and it was evidently conducted in typically spanish fashion the corridors were dark and odorous the cells unspeakably foul oreilly and judson saw heard smelled enough to convince them that no matter how guilty the prisoners might be they had been amply punished for their crimes this too was swift work the building echoed to rushing yelling men while outside a fitful accompaniment of gunshots urged the rescuers to greater haste while the americans smashed lock after lock their comrades dragged the astonished inmates from their kennels hustled them into the street and took them up behind their saddles the raid was over retreat was sounding when judson and oreilly ran out of the prison remounted and joined their comrades who were streaming back toward the plaza whew judson wiped the sweat out of his eyes no chance to ask these fellows what they were in for no need to ask them said johnnie a month in there would be too much for a murderer the druggist said most of em are just patriots and every holiday the spaniards shoot one or two theres no cockfighting so its the only sunday amusement they have did you notice that sick guy yes he looked to me like he was plain starved our fellows had to carry him colonel lopez galloped up to inquire anxiously did you find those eatables eh yes sir and a lot more good but i failed pickles caramba nobody here ever heard of one did we lose any men judson asked not one but ramos was badly cut so then he got to close quarters with some spaniard oh no the colonel grinned he was in too great a hurry and broke open a showcase with his fist the retreating cubans still maintained their uproar discharging their rifles into the air shrieking defiance at their invisible foes and voicing insulting invitations to combat this ferocity however served only to terrify further the civil population and to close the shutters of san antonio the tighter meanwhile the loyal troops remained safely in their blockhouses pouring a steady fire into the town and despite this admirable display of courage the visitors showed a deep respect for their enemies markmanship taking advantage of whatever shelter there was leslie branch of course proved the solitary exception as usual he exposed himself recklessly and rode the middle of the streets regardless of those sudden explosions of dust beneath his horses feet or those unexpected showers of plaster from above he had spent his time assiduously ransacking the deserted shops and in addition to his huge bundle of bedding and his long string of straw hats he now possessed a miscellaneous assortment of plunder in which were a bolt of calico a pair of shoes a collection of cookingutensils an umbrella and strangest of all a large giltframed mirror the safety of these articles seemed to concern him far more than his own spying oreilly he shouted say whats the spanish word for clothingstore i need a new suit dont be an idiot johnnie yelled at him keep under cover but branch only shook his head they couldnt hit anything he cried the next instant as if to punctuate his remark a spent bullet smashed the mirror and sprinkled the speaker with particles of glass it was only by a miracle that he escaped injury branch reined in his horse examined the wreck then with a petulant exclamation cast the useless frame away come on johnnie judson growled the damn fool wants to get shot the sick mans bravado roused in oreilly a feeling of mingled resentment and apprehension but further warning would obviously be a waste of breath nevertheless being a little too tenderhearted to follow judsons nonchalant example and ride on oreilly held in his horse meanwhile keeping an anxious eye upon his friend the latter was in no hurry he jogged along leisurely evidently on the lookout for an opportunity to replenish his wardrobe truth to say this needed replenishing leslie resembled a scarecrow clad in a suit of soiled pajamas but by this time most of the shops had their shutters up when the last one had been left behind oreilly spurred his horse into a gallop relieved to know that the worst was over the raiders had approached san antonio de los banos across the fields at the rear but colonel lopez led their retreat by way of the camino real which followed the riverbank this road for a short distance was exposed to the fire from one fort then it was sheltered by a bit of rising ground oreilly among the last to cross the zone of fire was just congratulating himself upon the fortunate outcome of the skirmish when he saw colonel lopez ride to the crest of a knoll rise in his stirrups and lifting his cupped hands to his lips direct a loud shout back toward the town lopez was followed by several of his men who likewise began to yell and to wave their arms excitedly johnnie turned to discover that leslie branch had lagged far behind and now as if to cap his fantastic performances had dismounted and was descending the riverbank to a place where a large washing had been spread upon the stones to dry he was quite exposed and a spiteful crackle from the nearest blockhouse showed that the spaniards were determined to bring him down mauser bullets ricocheted among the rocks even from this distance their sharp explosions were audible others broke the surface of the stream into little geysers as if a school of fish were leaping while johnnie looked on in breathless apprehension branch appropriated several suits that promised to fit him then he climbed up the bank remounted his horse and ambled slowly out of range now this was precisely the sort of harebrained exploit which delights a cuban audience when leslie rejoined his comrades therefore he was greeted with shouts and cheers caramba he would risk his life for a clean shirt theres a fellow for you he enjoys the hum of these spanish bees bravo tell us what the bullets said to you they cried crowding around him in an admiring circle oreilly unable to contain himself burst forth in a rage you infernal fool do you want to be shot robbing a clothesline rats ejaculated leslie sourly i told you i had to have some clothes lopez ought to courtmartial you what are you going to do with that junk now that you have it you cant take it with you on the march you wait and see said the other im going to be comfortable if he paused with a peculiar startled expression on his face did you hear anything he queried after a moment no what oh nothing the two men rode on in silence for a time then leslie said queer thing happened back there while those romeos were popping at me i heard a baby crying a baby sure i suppose it was the washerwomans kid when we flushed her she probably vamped out and left it in the grass anyhow it let up an awful holler jacket and the other lootladen soldiers had been sent on ahead together with those troopers who were sharing mounts with the rescued prisoners they were now waiting perhaps two miles from town for their companions to overtake them as the column came up and halted oreilly addressed a remark to leslie branch but in the middle of it the faint unmistakable complaint of a child came to his ears listen he exclaimed what on earth ive been hearing it right along branch said i i thought i had the willies the nearest riders abruptly ceased their chatter they questioned one another mutely doubting their own ears again came that thin muffled wail whereupon oreilly cried in astonishment leslie why it its in your bundle he pointed to the formless roll of bedding which hung from his friends saddlehorn gwan youre crazy branch slipped to the ground seized the bundle in his arms and bore it to the roadside with shaking hands he tugged at the knotted corners of the comforter pure imagination he muttered testily theres nothing in here but bedclothes i just grabbed an armful the last word ended in a yell leslie sprang into the air as if his exploring fingers had encountered a coiled serpent oh my god he poised as if upon the point of flight johnnie look its alive whats alive what is it with a sudden desperate courage branch bent forward and spread out the bedding there exposed to the bulging eyes of the onlookers was a very tiny very brown baby it was a young baby it was quite naked its eyes exposed to the sudden glare of the morning sun closed tightly one small hand all but lost itself in the wide toothless cavity that served as a mouth its ten ridiculous toes curled and uncurled in a most amazing fashion oh my god branch repeated aghast its just bborn its eyes arent open the cubans who had momentarily been stricken dumb with amazement suddenly broke into voluble speech the clamor served to attract colonel lopez who was riding past whats the matter here he demanded forcing his horse through the ring which had formed about el demonio and his bundle one startled look and the colonel flung himself out of his saddle whose baby is that he demanded i i why its mine i mean i branchs eyes were glued upon the child in horrified fascination he choked and stammered and waved his hands impotently come come speak up what does this mean lopezs voice grew stern she must have bebeen asleep i just grabbed you know i branchs face became suddenly stricken look out he shouted hoarsely shes going to cry or something he was right the baby showed every sign of a firm determination to voice her indignation at the outrage she had suffered her hand stole out of her mouth her fists closed her face puckered ominously lopez stooped wrapped her in a sheet then took her awkwardly in his arms he bent a blazing glance upon the kidnapper but he had no chance to speak before the storm of wailings broke news of leslies exploit was spreading men were shouting and gesticulating to their comrades to come and see el demonios spoils there was a great chattering and crowding and no little smothered laughter meanwhile colonel lopez was using every desperate device to soothe the infant but without success at last he strode up to leslie and extended his burden here he said harshly shes yours i surrender her leslie drew back no you dont i wouldnt touch her for a thousand dollars he cried but lopez was firm he spoke in a tone of command do as i tell you take her a fine outrage to steal a baby what are we going to do with her we cant send her back the town is crazy ive no doubt i shall hear from this in spite of leslies choking protests in spite of his feeble resistance lopez pressed the noisy stranger into his arms then turned to his men and directed them to be off branch remained motionless he was stupefied he held the baby gingerly not daring to put it down dreading to keep it his eyes were rolling he began to perspire freely stretching a timid detaining hand toward lopez he inquired huskily what shall i do with her god knows i dont snapped the officer i shall have to think but meanwhile i hold you responsible for her come now we must be going leslie swallowed hard his face became overspread with a sicklier pallor whatll i do when she gets hungry lopez could not restrain a smile you should have thought about that compadre well i know where there is a milk cow not three leagues from here ill send a man to borrow it from the owner and drive it to our camp or perhaps his handsome face hardened again perhaps you would prefer to take this child back where you found it no i oh theyd tear me limb from limb exactly branch turned his head from side to side in desperation he wet his lips its the youngest one i ever had anything to do with maybe it isnt used to cows milk he ventured unfortunately that is the only kind i can offer it take care of it until i find some way of notifying its people oreilly had looked on at his friends embarrassment with malicious enjoyment but realizing that branch would undoubtedly try to foist upon him the responsibility of caring for the baby he slipped away and rode over to where captain judson was engaged in making a litter upon which to carry the sick prisoner they had rescued from the jail when he had apprised the artilleryman of what branch had found in his roll of purloined bedding the latter smiled broadly serves him right judson chuckled well make him sit up nights with it maybe itll improve his disposition more seriously he explained this chap here is all in im afraid we arent going to get him through following judsons glance oreilly beheld an emaciated figure lying in the shade of a nearby guavabush the man was clad in filthy rags his face was dirty and overgrown with a months beard a pair of restless eyes stared unblinkingly at the brazen sky his lips were moving from them issued a steady patter of words but otherwise he showed no sign of life you said he was starving johnnie dismounted and lent judson a hand with his task thats what i thought at first but hes sick i suppose its that damned dungeon fever then wed better look after him ourselves these cubans are mighty careless you know we can swing him between our horses and judson looked up to discover that johnnie was poised rigidly his mouth open his hands halted in midair the sick mans voice had risen and oreilly with a peculiar expression of amazement upon his face was straining his ears to hear what he said eh whats the matter judson inquired for a moment oreilly remained frozen in his attitude then without a word he strode to the sufferer he bent forward staring into the vacant upturned face a cry burst from his throat a cry that was like a sob and kneeling he gathered the frail filthy figure into his arms esteban he cried esteban this is oreilly orailye dont you know me oreilly your friend your brother for gods sake tell me what theyve done to you look at me esteban look at me look at me oh esteban such eagerness such thankfulness such passionate pity were in his friends hoarse voice that judson drew closer he noticed that the faintest flame of reason flickered for an instant in the sick mans hollow eyes then they began to rove again and the same rustling whisper recommenced judson had heard something of oreillys story he had heard mention of esteban and rosa varona he stood therefore in silent wonderment listening to the incoherent words that poured from his friends lips oreilly held the boy tenderly in his arms tears rolled down his cheeks as he implored esteban to hear and to heed him try to hear me try there was fierce agony in the cry where is rosa rosa youre safe now you can tell me youre safe with oreilly i came back i came back for you and rosa where is she is she dead other men were assembling now the column was ready to move but judson signaled to colonel lopez and made known the identity of the sick stranger the colonel came forward swiftly and laid a hand upon oreillys shoulder saying so you were right after all esteban varona didnt die god must have sent us to san antonio to deliver him hes sick sick oreilly said huskily those spaniards look what theyve done to him his voice changed he cried fiercely well im late again im always just a little bit too late hell die before he can tell me wait take hold of yourself well do all that can be done to save him now come we must be going or all san antonio will be upon us oreilly roused put him in my arms he ordered ill carry him to camp myself but lopez shook his head saying gently its a long march and the litter would be better for him thank heaven we have an angel of mercy awaiting us and she will know how to make him well when the troop resumed its retreat esteban varona lay suspended upon a swinging bed between oreillys and judsons horses although they carried him as carefully as they could throughout that long hot journey he never ceased his babbling and never awoke to his surroundings xx el demonios child during the next few days oreilly had reason to bless the happy chance which had brought norine evans to cuba during the return journey from san antonio de los banos he had discovered how really ill esteban varona was how weak his hold upon life the young man showed the marks of wasting illness and of cruel abuse starvation neglect and disease had all but done for him after listening to his ravings oreilly began to fear that the poor fellows mind was permanently affected it was an appalling possibility one to which he could not reconcile himself to think that somewhere in that fevered brain was perhaps locked the truth about rosas fate if not the secret of her whereabouts and yet to be unable to wring an intelligent answer to a single question was intolerable the hours of that ride were among the longest oreilly had ever passed but norine evans gave him new heart she took complete charge of the sick man upon his arrival in camp then in her brisk matteroffact way she directed oreilly to go and get some muchneeded rest esteban was ill very ill she admitted there was no competent doctor near and her own facilities for nursing were primitive indeed nevertheless she expressed confidence that she could cure him and reminded oreilly that nature has a blessed way of building up a resistance to environment as a result of her good cheer oreilly managed to enjoy a nights sleep leslie branch was later than the others in arriving for the baby proved to be a trial and a handicap his comrades had refused him any assistance on the homeward journey they expressed a deep hoarse condemnation of his conduct and pretended to consider that he had sacrificed all claims to their friendship and regard branch took this seriously and he was in a state bordering upon desperation when he reached camp in the hope of unloading his unwelcome burden upon norine evans he hurried directly to her tent but norine had heard the story lopez had warned her therefore she waved him away dont ask me to mother your stolen child she said oh but youve got to he declared in a panic youve just got to well i wont in the first place i have a sick man in my tent but look listen this baby dislikes me ive nearly dropped it a dozen times i im going to leave it anyhow but norine remained firm in her refusal you shant leave your foundling at my door if you intend to steal babies you should make up your mind to take care of them she was itching to seize the hungry little mite but she restrained the impulse go ahead and keep it amused until the cow arrives she told him keep it amused amuse a starving brat tragically cried the man in heavens name how why play with it cuddle it give it your watch anything but dont allow it to cry it may injure itself branch glared resentfully then he changed his tactics and began to plead oh norine he implored i just cant do it im all fagged out now and besides ive got the only watch in camp that keeps time i didnt sleep any last night and itll keep me awake all tonight its a nice baby really it needs a woman norine parted the flaps of her tent and pointed inside where esteban varona lay upon her cot his eyes were staring his lips were moving mrs ruiz and i will have our hands full with that poor chap for all we know he may have some contagious disease branch was utterly shameless utterly selfish and uncompassionate im sick too sicker than he is have a heart remember i risked my life to get you something nice to eat yes the most ridiculous procedure i ever heard of what ever made you do such a crazy thing norine was honestly indignant now i did it for you it seems to me that the least you can do in return the least and the most i can do is to try and save this poor mans life she firmly reasserted now run along id take the baby if i could but i simply cant itll die on me branch protested nonsense its the healthiest little thing i ever saw wait until it has its supper youll see she disappeared into her tent and branch reluctantly turned away next he bore the infant to judson and oreilly in turn but both gruffly refused to assume the least responsibility for it in the matter of advice concerning its welfare however they were more obliging they were willing to discuss the theory of childrearing with him as long as he would listen but their advice merely caused him to glare balefully and to curse them nor did he regard it as a mark of friendship on their part when they collected an audience that evening to watch him milk the cow a procedure by the way not devoid of excitement and hazard inasmuch as branchs knowledge of cows was even more theoretical than his knowledge of babies leslie had begun by this time to realize that there existed a general conspiracy against him he met it with sullen resentment he deeply regretted his ignorance of the spanish language however for a thousand epithets and insults clamored for translation now there are cows which an amateur can milk and there are other kinds this particular cow was shy apprehensive peevish branchs unpractised fumbling irritated her being herself a nomad of the savannas she was accustomed to firm masterful men therefore when leslie attempted courteously apologetically to separate her from her milk she turned and hooked him el demonios audience who had been looking on with rapt attention applauded this show of spirit branch was unwontedly meek he acknowledged his total inexperience and begged his friends almost politely to call for a substitute judson explained gravely these cubans dont know any more about cows than you do oreilly agreed theyre good bullfighters but they cant milk leslie eyed the speakers white with rage he was trembling you think youre damned funny dont you youre having a jubilee with me well im game ill go through with it if youll hold her ill milk her ill milk her till she hollers obligingly oreilly took the animal by the horns and judson laid hold of her tail stretch her tight leslie commanded dont give her an inch of slack or ill quit when his friends had braced themselves he moved toward the cow once more but this time from the opposite quarter noting the direction of his approach the onlookers gave vent to a low murmur of expectancy they drew closer strangely enough the animal stood quiet for a time lost in amazement perhaps and leslie managed to cover the bottom of his big tin cup with milk but at last the outrage proved too much for her she slowly lifted one hind foot and poised it jerkily she seemed to consider the next move for a moment then she kicked forward and sent branch flying can you beat that oreilly exclaimed in apparent wonderment why she walloped you with the back of her hand judson too affected great amazement most cows are lefthanded he declared try her on the other side branch dried the milk from his face then in a shaking voice cried have a good time with me its your last chance it seemed for a while that the enterprise was doomed to failure but at last a pint or more of milk was secured and this leslie proceeded to dilute with warm water from a nearby campfire even then however his difficulties were not over he had supposed that any baby knew enough to drink it took him half an hour to discover his mistake having long since given up the hope of any active assistance from his audience he doggedly set to work to fashion a nursingbottle he succeeded in due time after making use of a flask the stem of an unused cigaretteholder and a handkerchief when he finally took seat and began awkwardly coaxing the fretful child to drink the cubans voiced their appreciation of the picture they were courteous they did not laugh nevertheless the sight of their eccentric irascible rebellious el demonio tamely nursing a child in the firelight filled them with luxurious soulsatisfying enjoyment oreilly was up at daylight to offer his services in caring for esteban varona but norine declined them his fever is down a little and he has taken some nourishment she reported that food you boys risked your silly lives for may come in handy after all i dare say he wont be able to talk to me today oreilly ventured not today nor for many days im afraid if you dont mind then ill hang around and listen to what he says he told her wistfully he might drop a word about rosa to be sure so far hes scarcely mentioned her i cant understand much that he says of course but mrs ruiz tells me its all jumbled and quite unintelligible how is leslies baby this morning oh it passed a good night it was awake and had ordered breakfast when i got up leslie was making a fire to scald out its bottle he says he didnt close his eyes all night poor fellow im going to help him norine declared please dont lopez wants to teach him a lesson and this is the best thing that could possibly have happened we have told him that theres no chance of returning the baby and he thinks hes elected to keep it indefinitely as a matter of fact jacket is going to take a letter to the comandante at san antonio this morning advising him that the child is safe and asking him to send for it at once isnt that risky norine inquired wont the comandante attack us if he learns where we are lopez doesnt think so those spaniards are usually pretty scrupulous on points of honor there was some difficulty in getting a messenger but jacket volunteered he volunteers for anything that boy they wouldnt be likely to hurt a kid like him if they should why we have the baby you see although norine had pretended to wash her hands of all responsibility for branchs little charge she was by no means so inhuman as she appeared during the day she kept a jealous eye upon it and especially upon its diet fortunately for all concerned it was a goodnatured child so long as its stomach was full it was contented it slept a good deal and what time it was awake it sucked its fist and suffered itself to be variously entertained by the men there were of course a number of fellows who could see no humor at all in el demonios plight nor any reason for adding to his embarrassments these came to his aid in numerous ways it was an idle day there was nothing to do except play with the baby before night came the child had established itself as a general favorite even branch himself had become interested in it say ive learned a lot about kids from this one he confided to oreilly at dinnertime i always thought young babies were just damp soursmelling little animals but this one has character she knows me already and im getting so i can pick her up without feeling that im going to puncture her shes full of dimples too got em everywhere what do you think wed better name her she probably has a name do you expect to keep her permanently branch considered i wouldnt have thought of such a thing yesterday but how are we going to get rid of her thats the question we cant just leave her with the first family we come to these country people have more kids than they know what to do with thinking about taking her on the march with us oreilly looked up much amused i dont see why it couldnt be done the men wouldnt mind and shed make a dandy mascot oreilly shook his head this isnt a baseball team what about the babys mother bullets fine mother she was to desert her child ill bet shes glad to get rid of it people like that dont have any more affection than cattle they dont deserve to have children whats more they dont know how to care for them id like to raise this kid according to my own ideas branchs face lightened suddenly say ive just thought of a name for her what bullets are you swearing or naming her wouldnt that be a good name its new and it means something raid battle rain of bullets see bullets branch that doesnt sound bad with deliberate malice oreilly said gravely of course if you adopt her you can name her what you choose but shes a mighty brown baby i have my suspicions that shes a mulatto branch was shocked indignant that childs as white as you are he sputtered then noting the twinkle in oreillys eyes he turned away muttering angrily strangely enough leslies fantastic suggestion found echo in more than one quarter and many of his campmates began to argue that el demonios baby would certainly bring the troop good luck if it could keep her adoption of some sort was gravely discussed that evening around more than one campfire after breakfast on the following morning the baby was bathed this was an event and it had been advertised as such an interested and admiring group of swarthy cigarettesmokers looked on while branch officiated norines offer to perform the service less publicly having been refused leslie was just drying off the chubby form when he was unexpectedly interrupted jacket had made his round trip in safety but instead of bringing a squad of the enemys soldiers with him he had brought the childs parents which was a much more sensible thing to do the storekeeper and his wife arrived unheralded they gave no warning of their coming and they exchanged no amenities with the ravagers of their home hearing the shrill petulant voice of their beloved they made directly for it as eagles swoop from the sky at threat to their nest branch looked up at the sound of some swift approach he beheld an entirely strange woman bearing down upon him her face was white frantic terrible her arms were outstretched she gave utterance to a peculiar distressing cry snatching the baby from his lap without so much as by your leave she clutched it to a billowing brown bosom leslie rose protesting just in time to receive the full onslaught of the childs distracted father he went down in a swirl of arms and legs he felt himself kicked pounded trampled beaten scratched until his friends came to the rescue and dragged him to his feet he rose to behold a small fat disheveled spaniard who had turned from assaulting him and now appeared to be engaged in biting mouthfuls from such portions of the babys anatomy as were not hidden in its mothers embrace a clamor of voices breaking the sabbath calm of the morning brought norine evans running from her tent one look and its cause was plain fifty men were talking loudly fifty pairs of arms were waving in consequence of the torrent of words that beat upon their ears it was some time before the merchant and his wife could be made to fully understand the peculiar circumstances of the kidnapping and that no harm had been intended to their darling slowly bit by bit they learned the truth but even then the mother could not look upon leslie branch without a menacing dilation of the eyes and a peculiar expression of restrained ferocity the father was more reasonable however once he was assured of his daughters safety his thankfulness sought outlet he began by embracing every one within his reach he kissed norine he kissed oreilly he kissed judson he made a rush at leslie himself but the latter suspicious of his intent fled unmindful of the fact that these were the men who had relieved him of a considerable stock of goods and profaned his holy of holies he recklessly distributed among them what money he had upon his person and then gave away the remaining contents of his pockets he swore his undying love for them all smiting his breast excitedly he urged them as a personal favor and a mark of his overflowing gratitude to return to san antonio de los banos make themselves masters of all his worldly possessions and then burn his store while this was going on jacket was proudly advertising his share of the enterprise not failing to give himself full credit by i made a big hit with that comandante he told his american friends those people in san antonio say im the bravest boy they ever seen and they give me moren a thousand cigars when i rode away i saluted the comandante then i yelled vive cuba libre and everybody laughed like hell i guess those people never seen nobody like me before that afternoon when it came time for the merchant and his little family to set out for home a crowd of regretful insurrectos assembled to bid them farewell and to look for the last time upon the baby by now the mothers apprehensions had given way to pride and she could bring herself to smile at the compliments showered upon her offspring and to answer in kind those which were aimed at herself she even permitted el demonio to kiss the child goodby her husband since his arrival in camp had heard much about the eccentric american and now after apologizing abjectly for his unwarranted attack he invited branch to visit his store when this hideous war was over and cuba was free finally in spite of leslies frantic struggles he embraced him and planted a moist kiss upon either cheek amid loud and repeated good wishes and a cheer for the baby the visitors rode away lopez linked his arm within oreillys as they turned back into the palmgrove with a smile he said well i hope this has taught your friend to steal no more babies im afraid hell steal the very next one he sees he fell in love with that one and wanted to keep it oh he wasnt alone in that its queer how sentimental soldiers become ive often noticed it when i was in the rubi hills some of my fellows adopted a goat we had to eat it finally but those men wouldnt touch a piece of the flesh and they were starving by the way how is varona doing about the same lopez frowned i shall have to send him to cubitas tomorrow for we must be under way if he has to be moved let me do it id like to be with him when he comes out of his fever and learn what he knows about his sister oreillys appeal was earnest the colonel readily yielded go by all means report to general gomez and he no doubt will let you stay until the boy can talk he may have news from matanzas by that time oreilly pressed his colonels hand gratefully youre mighty good said he theres one thing more will you look out for branch while im gone and hold him down lopez laughed lightly oh hell soon get over his recklessness this life agrees with him why hes a different man already when he gets well and has something to live for he will want to live youll see xxi treasure it was a balmy languid morning about two weeks after oreillys return to the city among the leaves the cubitas mountains were green and sparkling from a recent shower wood fires smoldered in front of the bark huts sending up their wavering streamers of blue a packtrain from the lower country was unloading fresh vegetables in the main street and a group of ragged men were disputing over them some children were playing baseball near by in a hammock swung between two trees esteban varona lay listening to the admonitions of his nurse johnnie oreilly had just bade them both a hearty good morning and now norine was saying one hour no more you had a temperature again last night and it came from talking too much oh im better this morning esteban declared im getting so that i want to talk i was too tired at first but now now you will do exactly as you are told remember it takes me just one hour to make my rounds and if you are not through with your tales of blood and battle when i get back youll have to finish them tomorrow with a nod and a smile she left as esteban looked after her his white teeth gleamed and his hollow face lit up she brings me new life he told oreilly she is so strong so healthy so full of life herself she is wonderful when i first saw her bending over me i thought i was dreaming sometimes even yet i think she cannot be real but she is eh she is quite substantial oreilly smiled i can tell when she is anywhere near for my illness leaves me its a fact and her hands well she lays them on my head and it no longer hurts the fever disappears there is some cool delicious magic in her touch it makes a fellow want to live you have perhaps noticed it nno you see she never lays her hands on my head however i dare say youre right all the sick fellows talk as you do esteban looked up quickly his face darkened she er nurses others eh im not the only one well hardly there was a brief pause then esteban shifted his position and his tone changed tell me have you heard any news not yet but we will hear some before long im sure your faith does as much for me as this ladys care but when you go away when im alone when i begin to think dont think too much dont permit yourself to doubt oreilly said quickly take my word for it rosa is alive and well find her somewhere somehow you heard that she had fallen into cobos hands when he sacked the yumuri but now we know that she and the negroes were living in the pan de matanzas long after that in the same way lopez assured me positively that you were dead well look at you it shows how little faith we can put in any story no rosa is safe and general gomez will soon have word of her thats what ive been waiting for that and what you might have to tell me you know all that i know now and everything that has happened to me i dont know how you came to be in a cell in san antonio de los banos two hundred miles from the place you were killed that is still a mystery it is very simple amigo let me see i had finished telling you about the fight at la joya i was telling you how i fainted exactly norine bound and gagged you at that point in the story some good people found me a few hours after i lost consciousness they supposed i had been attacked by guerrillas and left for dead finding that i still had life in me they took me home with them they were old friends from matanzas by the name of valdes cultured people who had fled the city and were hiding in the manigua like the rest of us not valdes the notary the very same alberto valdes and his four daughters heaven guided them to me alberto was an old man he had hard work to provide food for his girls nevertheless he refused to abandon me the girls had become brown and ragged and as shy as deer they nursed me for weeks for my wounds became infected god it seems to me that i lay there sick and helpless for years when my brain would clear i would think of rosa and then the fever would rise again and i would go out of my head oh they were faithful patient people you see i had walked east instead of west and now i was miles away from home and the country between was swarming with spaniards who were burning destroying killing you wouldnt know matanzas oreilly it is a desert i finally became able to drag myself around the hut but i had no means of sending word to rosa and the uncertainty nearly made me crazy my clothes had rotted from me my bones were just under the skin i must have been a shocking sight then one day there came a fellow traveling east with messages for gomez he was one of lopezs men and he told me that lopez had gone to the rubi hills with maceo and that there were none of our men left in the province he told me other things too it was from him that i learned estban varonas thin hands clutched the edges of his hammock and he rolled his head weakly from side to side it was he who told me about rosa he said that cobo had ravaged the yumuri and that my sister was gone christ there there we know better now oreilly said soothingly it was a hideous story a story of rape murder i wonder that i didnt go mad it never occurred to me to doubt and as a matter of fact the fellow was honest enough he really believed what he told me well i was sorry i hadnt died that night in the sunken road all the hope all the desire to live went out of me you see i had been more than half expecting something of the kind every time i had left rosa it had been with the sickening fear that i might never see here again after the man had finished i felt the desire to get away from all i had known and loved to leave matanzas for new fields and give what was left of me to the cause i presume alberto and the girls were relieved to get rid of me for it meant more food for them anyhow between us we prevailed upon the messenger to take me along i was free to enlist since i couldnt reach lopez and i came to join our forces in the orient that is how you found me in this province lopezs man never delivered those despatches for we were taken crossing the trochaat least i was taken for pablo was killed theyd have made an end of me too i dare say only i was so weak it seems a century since that night my memory doesnt serve me very well from that point for they jailed me and i grew worse i was out of my head a good deal i seem to remember a stockade somewhere and other prisoners some of whom nursed me you say you found me in a cell in san antonio de los banos well i dont know how i got there and i never heard of the place it will probably all come back to you in time said oreilly no doubt the two men fell silent for a while esteban lay with closed eyes exhausted oreilly gave himself up to frowning thought his thoughts were not pleasant he could not for the life of him believe in rosas safety so implicitly as he had led esteban to suppose his efforts to cheer the other had sapped his own supply of hope leaving him a prey to black misgivings he was glad when norine evanss return put an end to his speculations esteban was right the girl did have an unusual ability to banish shadows a splendid power to rout devils both of the spirit and of the flesh she was a sort of antibody destroying every noxious or unhealthy thing mental or physical with which she came in contact this blessed capability was quite distinct from her skill with medicines it was a gift and as much a part of her as the healing magic which dwells in the sunshine certainly her knack of lending health and strength from her own abundant store had never been better shown than in estebans case for with almost no medical assistance she had brought him back from the very voids it was quite natural therefore that she should take a pride in her work and regard him with a certain jealous proprietary interest it was equally natural that he should claim the greater share of her attention have you harrowed this poor mans feelings sufficiently for once she inquired of oreilly i have ill agree to talk about nothing unpleasant hereafter esteban turned to his nurse inquiring abruptly do you think rosa is alive why of course i do arent you alive and almost well now as an argument there was no particular force in this suggestion nevertheless both men felt reassured esteban heaved a grateful sigh after a moment he said there is something i want to tell you both wait until tomorrow norine advised but he persisted no i must tell it now first however did either of you discover an old coin in any of my pockets an old spanish doubloon that doubloon again norine lifted her hands protestingly and cast a meaning look at oreilly you talked about nothing else for a whole week let me feel your pulse esteban surrendered his hand with suspicious readiness you were flat broke when we got you oreilly declared probably i seem to remember that somebody stole it doubloons pieces of eight golden guineas exclaimed norine why those are pirate coins they remind me of treasure island of long john silver and his wooden leg of ben gunn and all the rest with a voice made hoarse doubtless to imitate the old nutbrown seaman with the saberscar and the tarry pigtail who sat sipping his rum and water in the admiral benbow inn she began to chant fifteen men on the dead mans chest yohoho and a bottle of rum drink and the devil had done for the rest yohoho and a bottle of rum esteban smiled uncomprehendingly yes well this has to do with treasure that doubloon was a part of the lost treasure of the varonas lost treasure norines gray eyes widened what are you talking about there is a mysterious fortune in our family my father buried it he was very rich you know and he was afraid of the spaniards oreilly knows the story johnnie assented with a grunt sure i know all about it esteban raised himself to his elbow you think its a myth a joke well its not i know where it is i found it norine gasped johnnie spoke soothingly dont get excited old man youve talked too much today ha esteban fell back upon his pillow i havent any fever im as sane as ever i was that treasure exists and that doubloon gave me the clue to its whereabouts pancho cueto knew my father and he believed the story he believed in it so strongly that well thats why he denounced my sister and me as traitors he dug up our entire premises but he didnt find it esteban chuckled don esteban my father was cunning he could hide things better than a magpie it remained for me to discover his trick norine evans spoke breathlessly oh glory treasure real treasure how perfectly exciting tell me how you found it quick johnnie you remember he raved about a doubloon he is raving now oreilly declared with a sharp stare at his friend the girl turned loyally to her patient ill believe you mr varona i always believe everything about buried treasure the bigger the treasure the more implicitly i believe in it i simply adore pirates and such things if i were a man id be one do you know ive always been tempted to bury my money and then go look for it youre making fun of me what esteban eyed the pair doubtfully no no norine was indignant johnnie doesnt believe in pirates or treasure or anything he doesnt even believe in fairies and hes irish too but i do i revel in such things if you dont go on ill blow up there is no doubt that my father had a great deal of money at one time esteban began he was the richest man in the richest city of cuba and oreilly shook his head dubiously and braced his back against a treetrunk there was a look of mild disapprobation on his face as he listened to the familiar story of don esteban and the slave sebastian young esteban told the tale well his own faith in it lent a certain convincingness to his words and norine evans hung upon them entranced she was horrified at the account of don estebans death her eyes grew dark as esteban told of his and rosas childhood with their avaricious stepmother that part of the narrative which had to do with the death of dona isabel and the finding of the gold coin was new to oreilly and he found himself considerably impressed by it when esteban had finished norine drew a deep breath oh that lays over any story i ever heard to think that the deeds and the jewels and everything are in the well at this minute how could you go away and leave them i didnt think it out at the time i didnt evolve my theory until after i had fled naturally i wasnt able to get back but suppose somebody finds it norine was aghast at the thought not much chance of that the treasure has lain there for a generation and the story itself is almost forgotten esteban turned triumphantly to oreilly saying now then do you think im so crazy oreilly didnt have it in his heart to say exactly what he really thought the circumstances of the discovery of the coin were odd enough certainly but it seemed to him that they were capable of several explanations if indeed there had ever been a doubloon and if esteban had found it in the dead hand of his stepmother that in oreillys opinion by no means proved the existence of the mythical varona hoard nor did it solve the secret of its whereabouts what he more than half suspected was that some favored fancy had formed lodgment in estebans brain its an interesting theory he admitted anyhow there is no danger of the treasure being uncovered very soon cueto had a good look and made himself ridiculous youll have ample chance to do likewise when the war is over you must help me find it said esteban we shall all share the fortune equally you two rosa and i we why should we share in it norine asked i owe it to you didnt oreilly rescue me from a dungeon havent you nursed me back to health dont i owe my life to you both nonsense i for one shant take a dollar of it the girl declared all i want to do is help dig if youll just promise to let me do that i promise and you shall have onefourth of everything no no oh but you must i insist nursing is a poorly paid profession wouldnt you like to be rich profession poorly paid norine sputtered angrily as if id take pay as if i would accept a great service and forget it like some miserable beggar esteban replied stiffly oreilly laughed out dont lets quarrel over the spoil until we get it said he thats the way with all treasurehunters they invariably fall out and go to fighting to avoid bloodshed ill agree to sell my interest cheap for cash come what will you bid start it low do i hear a dollar bid a dollar a dollar a dollar my share of the famous varona fortune going for a dollar there he doesnt believe a word of it esteban said norine gave an impatient shrug some people wouldnt believe they were alive unless they saw their breath on a lookingglass goodness how i hate a sneering skeptic a wet blanket oreilly rose with one arm shielding his face in the interest of friendship i withdraw a curse on these buried treasures anyhow we shall yet come to blows as he walked away he heard norine say dont pay any attention to him well go and dig it up ourselves and we wont wait until the war is over an hour later esteban and his nurse still had their heads together they were still talking of golden ingots and pearls from the caribbean the size of plums when they looked up to see oreilly running toward them he was visibly excited he waved and shouted at them he was panting when he arrived news from matanzas he cried gomezs man has arrived esteban struggled to rise but norine restrained him rosa what does he say quick good news she left the pan de matanzas with the two negroes she went into the city before cobos raid esteban collapsed limply he closed his eyes his face was very white he crossed himself weakly the letter is definite it seems they were starving they obeyed weylers bando theyre in matanzas now do you hear esteban norine shook her patient by the shoulder shes alive oh cant you see that it always pays to believe the best alive safe esteban whispered his eyes when he opened them were swimming he clutched norines hand tightly his other hand he extended to oreilly the latter was choking his cheeks too were wet a reconcentrado in matanzas well thats good we have friends there theyll not let her starve this makes a new man of me see im strong again ill go to her youll go quickly cried miss evans youll go youre not strong enough it would be suicide you with a price upon your head everybody knows you there matanzas is virtually a walled city theres sickness too yellow fever typhus exactly and hunger also suppose no one has taken rosa in those concentration camps arent nice places for a girl but wait i have friends in washington theyre influential they will cable the american consul to look after her anyhow you mustnt think of returning to matanzas norine faltered her voice caught unexpectedly and she turned her face away oreilly nodded shortly youre a sick man he agreed theres no need for both of us to go esteban looked up then you i leave at once the old man has given me a commission to general betancourt and ill be on my way in an hour the moon is young i must cross the trocha before that trocha esteban was up on his elbow again be careful there oreilly they keep a sharp lookout and its guarded with barbed wire be sure you cut every strand yes and muffle your horses hoofs too in crossing the railroad track thats how we were detected pablos horse struck a rail and they fired at the sound he fell at the first volley riddled oh i know that trocha damn the trocha oreilly exclaimed at last ive got a chance to do something god how long ive waited esteban drew oreillys tense form down and embraced his friend after the fashion of his people she has been waiting too he said huskily we varonas are good waiters oreilly rosa will never cease waiting until you come tell her for me norine withdrew softly out of earshot there were a lump in her throat and a pain in her breast she had acquired a peculiar and affectionate interest in this unhappy girl whom she had never seen and she had learned to respect oreillys love the yearning that had pulsed in his voice a moment before had stirred her deeply it awoke a throb in her own bosom for oreilly was dear to her she wanted him to go yet she knew the hazards that lay in his way if indeed the girl were in matanzas how norine asked herself was it possible for him to reach her that oreilly had some mad design was evident that he would utterly disregard his own safety she felt sure but that he would meet with failure perhaps worse seemed equally certain matanzas was a beleagured city and strangers could not enter or leave it at will if rosa had not put herself behind prison walls if she were still in hiding somewhere on the island it would be a simple matter to seek her out but matanzas of all places then too the pacificos according to all reports were dying like flies in the prison camps norine wondered if there might not be a terrible heartache at the end of oreillys quest her face was grave and worried when hearing him speak to her she turned to take his outstretched hand you will be careful wont you she implored and youll be stout of heart no matter what occurs he nodded its a long way back here to cubitas you may not see or hear from me again i understand she choked miserably you mean you may not come back oh johnnie tut tut we oreillys have more lives than a litter of cats i mean i may not see you until the war is over and we meet in new york well weve been good pals and im glad you came to cuba his grasp upon her two hands was painful you must go i know and i wouldnt try to keep you but norine faltered then impulsively she drew him down and kissed him full upon the lips for rosa she whispered her eyes were shining as she watched him pass swiftly out of sight xxii the trocha of all the military measures employed by the spaniards in their wars against cuban independence perhaps the most unique was the trocha trench or traverse martinez campos during the ten years war built the first trocha just west of the cubitas mountains where the waist of the island is narrowest it was camposs hope by means of this artificial barrier to confine the operations of the insurgents to the eastern end of cuba but in that he failed as likewise he failed in the results gained by his efforts to concentrate the rural population in the cities not until weylers time were these two methods of pacification the trocha and the concentration camp developed to their fullest extent under the rule of the butcher several trochas were constructed at selected points and he carried to its logical conclusion the policy of concentration with results sufficiently frightful to shock the world and to satisfy even weylers monstrous appetite for cruelty although his trochas hindered the free movement of cuban troops and his prison camps decimated the peaceful population of several provinces the spanish cause gained little both trenches and prison camps became spanish graveyards weylers intrenchments cost millions and were elaborately constructed belted with barbed wire bristling with blockhouses and forts in both the digging and the manning however they cost uncounted lives spanish spades turned up fevers with the soil and so long as raw spanish troops were compelled to toil in the steaming morasses or to lie inactive under the sun and the rain those traitor generals june july and august continued to pile up the bodies in rotting heaps and to timber the trenches with their bones so long as the cities were overcrowded with pacificos and their streets were putrid with disease so long did the spanish garrisons sicken and die as flies perish upon poisoned carrion out on the cool clean hills and the windy savannas where the insurrectos dwelt there was health poorly armed ragged gaunt these insurrectos were kept moving by hunger always moving like cattle on a barren range but they were healthy for disease which is softfooted and tenderbellied could not keep up at the time johnnie oreilly set out for matanzas the war a war without battle without victory without defeat had settled into a grim contest of endurance in the east where the insurrectos were practically supreme there was food of a sort but beyond the jucaromoron trocha the old one of camposs building the country was sick immediately west of it in that district which the cubans called las villas the land lay dying while the entire provinces of matanzas habana and pinar del rio were practically dead these three were skeletons picked bare of flesh by weylers beak the jucaromoron trocha had been greatly strengthened since camposs day it followed the line of the transinsular railway dotted at every quarter of a mile along the grade were little forts connected by telephone and telegraph lines between these fortinas were sentry stations of logs or railroad ties the jungle on either side of the rightofway had been cleared and from the remaining stumps and posts and fallen treetrunks hung a maze of barbed wire through which a man could scarcely crawl even in daylight eyes were keen rifles were ready challenges were sharp and countersigns were quickly given on the jucaromoron trocha in oreillys party there were three men besides himself the everfaithful jacket a wrinkled old camagueyan who knew the bridle trails of his province as a fox knows the tracks to its lair and a silent guajiro from farther west detailed to accompany the expedition because of his wide acquaintance with the devastated districts both guides having crossed the trocha more than once affected to scorn its terrors and their easy confidence reassured oreilly in spite of estebans parting admonition the american had not dreamed of taking jacket along but when he came to announce his departure the boy had flatly refused to be left behind jacket in fact had taken the matter entirely into his own hands and had appealed directly to general gomez to his general the boy had explained tearfully that patriotism was a rare and an admirable quality but that his love of country was not half so strong or so sacred as his affection for johnnie oreilly having attached himself to the american for better or for worse no human power could serve to detach him so he asserted he threatened moreover that if he were compelled to suffer his benefactor to go alone into the west he would lay down his arms and permit general gomez to free cuba as best he could cuba could go to hades so far as jacket was concerned he would not lift a finger to save it strangely enough jackets threat of defection had not appalled general gomez in fact with a dyspeptic gruffness characteristic of him gomez had ordered the boy off under penalty of a sound spanking but jacket had a will of his own likewise a temper he greeted this unfeeling refusal with a noisy outburst of mingled rage grief and defiance stamping his bare feet sobbing and screaming the boy finally flung himself upon the ground and smote it with his fists while tears streamed from his eyes nor could he be silenced he maintained such a hideous and surprising uproar answering gomezs stern commands to be silent with such maniacal howls that the old soldier was finally glad to yield his consent incidentally consigning the rebellious youth to that perdition with which he had threatened cuba having won his point jacket regained his composure with suspicious suddenness and raced away to triumph over his beloved oreilly fifty miles of hard riding brought the party to the trocha they neared it on the second morning after leaving cubitas and sought a secluded campingspot later in the day hilario the old camagueyan slipped away to reconnoiter he returned at twilight but volunteered no report of what he had discovered after an insistent crossexamination oreilly wrung from him the reluctant admission that everything seemed favorable for a crossing some time that night and that he had selected a promising point beyond that the old man would say nothing johnnie asked himself uneasily if this reticence was not really due to apprehension rather than to sullenness whatever the cause it was not particularly reassuring and as evening came on johnnie found himself growing decidedly nervous supper a simple meal was quickly disposed of then followed a long dispiriting wait for a gibbous moon rode high in the sky and the guides refused to stir so long as it remained there it was a still night in the jungle no air was stirring and darkness brought forth a torment of mosquitoes as day died the woods awoke to sounds of bird and insect life strange raucous calls pealed forth some familiar others strange and unaccustomed there were thin whistlings hoarse grunts and harsh cacklings highpitched elfin laughter moving bodies disturbed the leaves overhead from all sides came the rustle and stir of unseen creatures sudden disputations were followed by startled silences sitting there in the dark bedeviled by a pest of insects mocked at by these mysterious voices and looking forward to a hazardous enterprise oreilly began to curse his vivid imagination and to envy the impassiveness of his companions even jacket he noted endured the strain better the boy was cheerful philosophical quite unimpressed by his surroundings when the mosquitoes became unbearable he put on his trousers with some reluctance and much ceremony it seemed to oreilly that the moon floated motionless in the sky and more than once he was upon the point of ordering a start but he reflected that its radiance out in the open must be far greater than it seemed here under the dense tropical foliage after a time he began to wonder if his guides were as loyal as they should be if hilarios strange reticence was caused by sullenness by apprehension or by something altogether different both of the men were strangers to him of their fidelity he had no guarantee now that his mind had become engaged with thoughts of treachery a determined effort was necessary to keep himself in hand and oreilly fell back finally upon his elemental trust in the cuban character scant consolation under the circumstances midnight brought a moist warm breeze and a few formless clouds which served at times to dimly obscure the moon watching the clouds oreilly hoped that they might prove to be the heralds of a storm none came when the moon had finally crept down into the treetops old hilario stepped upon his cigarette then began silently to saddle up the others followed with alacrity and fell in behind him as he led the way into the forest they no longer ventured to speak aloud nothing but the occasional sound of a hoof striking upon root or stone the creak of leather or the rustle of branches against passing bodies gave evidence that mounted men were en route when they had covered a couple of miles hilario reined in and the others crowded close ahead dimly discernible against the night sky there appeared to be a thinning of the woods after listening for a moment or two hilario dismounted and slipped away the three riders sat their saddles with ears strained once more the myriad voices of the night became audible the chirping of crickets the strident call of treetoads the whining undertone of the mosquitoes hilario returned with word that all was well and each man dismounted to muffle the feet of his horse with rags and strips of gunnysack provided for the purpose then one by one they moved forward to the edge of the clearing the trocha lay before them after the cavernous obscurity of the jungle the night seemed suddenly to lighten and oreilly found himself looking out over a level waste of stumps and treetrunks perhaps a quarter of a mile wide extending right and left as far as he could see against the luminous western horizon opposite the inky forest stood like a wall midway of the clearing there was a railroad grade with a telephonepole or two limned against the sky the clearing was silent and to all appearances deserted nothing stirred no sign of life appeared anywhere and yet as the american studied the place he had a queer uncomfortable sensation that it was thickly peopled and that eyes were peering out at him from the gloom blurred forms took shape phantom figures moved along the embankment stumps stirred oreilly felt a pair of reins thrust into his hand and found hilario examining a large pair of tinners shears do you wish me to go with you he inquired of the guide the latter shook his head antonio will go he will keep watch while i clear a path if you hear or see anything jacket interrupted with a sibilant psst look yonder a lanternlike illumination had leaped out of the blackness and now approached swiftly down the railroad grade oreilly laid a heavy hand upon the old camagueyan and inquired in sharp suspicion what does that mean an alarm there was a breathless moment during which the four men followed the erratic course of the spark then antonio chuckled alabaos a lightbug said he dont you know a cucullo when you see one he cautiously tested the ejector of his carbine and tightened the cord that served as his belt oreilly drew a deep breath of relief he had never become wholly accustomed to the giant lightbeetles of the tropics although he had carried one often on sentry duty to see the face of his watch and not infrequently had seen cuban women wearing them in their hair as ornaments jove he muttered it gave me a fright hilario resumed his instructions if anything goes wrong wait here dont ride away until we have time never fear i wont desert you the american reassured him the two whiteclad figures slipped away became indistinct and then disappeared the night was hot the mosquitoes hummed dismally and settled in clouds upon the waiting pair maddening them with their poison after a time a horse snorted and jacket cursed nervously id like to see where we are the boy muttered do you know these men oreilly asked him no god deliver me from such unpleasant fellows i hope theyre honest humph i trust nobody there was a pause never mind jacket assured his companion i will make short work of them if they prove to be traitors a halfhour passed then the two ghostly figures materialized once more dios grumbled hilario there are many strings to this spanish guitar what a row when they discover that i have played a cuban danzon upon it the old man seemed less surly than before and oreilly felt ashamed of his recent suspicions is the way clear he inquired as far as the railroad yes we heard voices there and came back we will have to cut our way forward after we cross the track now then follow me without a sound leading his horse by the bit ring hilario moved out into the clearing followed once more by his three companions concealment was out of the question now for their only covering was the darkness oreilly had the uncomfortable feeling that the cavalcade bulked monstrous big and must be visible at a great distance he experienced much the sensations of a man crossing a sheet of thin ice with nerves painfully strained awaiting the first menacing crack in spite of all precautions the animals made a tremendous racket or so it seemed and despite hilarios twistings and turnings it was impossible to avoid an occasional loop of barbed wire therefore flesh and clothing suffered grievously but at length the party brought up under the railroad embankment and paused out of the voids to their right came a faint murmur of voices as carefully as might be the four men ascended the slope crossed the rails and descended into the ditch on the other side another moment and they encountered a taut strand of barbed wire the metallic snip of hilarios shears sounded like a pistolshot to oreilly into the maze of strands they penetrated yard by yard clipping and carefully laying back the wire as they went progress was slow they had to feel their way the sharp barbs brought blood and muttered profanity at every step none of the four ever knew what gave the alarm their first intimation of discovery came with a startling quien vive hurled at them from somewhere at their backs an instant and the challenge was followed by a mauser shot other reports rang out as the sentry emptied his rifle in their direction so they are shootingbats hilario grunted antonio swung about and cocked his remington but the other spoke sharply fool if you shoot they will see the fire and riddle us a curse on the spider that spun this web it was a test of courage to crouch among the charred stumps enmeshed in that cruel tangle of wire while the night was stabbed by daggers of fire and while the trocha awoke to the wild alarm from somewhere in the distance came a shouted command and the sound of running feet suddenly putting an end to further inaction antonio began to hack viciously with his machete in an effort to aid hilarios labors the sound of his sturdy blows betrayed the partys whereabouts so clearly that finally the older man could restrain himself no longer give it to them compadres it is a game that we can play oreilly had been gripping his rifle tensely his heart in his throat his pulses pounding as near a panic as he had ever been he found oddly enough that the mere act of throwing his weapon to his shoulder and firing it calmed him the kick of the gun subdued his excitement and cleared his brain he surprised himself by directing jacket in a cool authoritative voice to shoot low when he had emptied the magazine he led two of the horses forward then grasping his own machete he joined in clearing a pathway it seemed an interminable time ere they extricated themselves from the trap but finally they succeeded and gained the welcome shelter of the woods pausing inside its shelter to cut the muffles from their horses feet by this time the defenders of the trocha were pouring volley after volley at random into the night hilario sucked the cuts in his horny palms and spat forth the blood if gomez had the ammunition these fools are wasting he would free cuba in no time now that the skirmish was over jacket began to boast of his part in it ha perhaps theyll know better than to show themselves the next time i come this way said he you saw me didnt you well i made a few spanish widows tonight not many im afraid oreilly laughed oh believe me im an old hand at this sort of thing i shoot just as well at night as i do in the daytime this was literally true and when no one disputed his assertion jacket proceeded further in praise of himself only to break off with a wordless cry of dismay whats the matter johnnie inquired look behold me wailed the hero i have left the half of my beautiful trousers on that barbed wire antonio swung a leg over his saddle saying come along amigos we have fifty leagues ahead of us the war will be over while we stand here gossiping xxiii into the city of death oreillys adventures on his swift ride through las villas have no part in this story it is only necessary to say that they were numerous and varied that oreilly experienced excitement aplenty and that upon more than one occasion he was forced to think and to act quickly in order to avoid a clash with some roving guerrilla band he had found it imperative at all times to avoid the larger towns for they and in fact most of the hamlets were unsafe hence the little party was forced to follow back roads and obscure bridle trails but the two guides were never at a loss they were resourceful courageous and at no time did the american have reason to doubt their faithfulness evidences of the war increased as the journey lengthened the potreros were lush with grass but no herds grazed upon them villages were deserted and guano huts were falling into decay charred fields growing up to weeds and the ruins of vast centrales showing where the insurrectos had been at work this was the sugar country the heart of cuba whence spain had long drawn her life blood and from the first it had been the policy of the rebel leaders to destroy the large estates leaving undamaged only the holdings of those little farmers whose loyalty to the cause of freedom was unquestioned food became a problem immediately after the travelers had crossed the trocha such apprehensive families as still lurked in the woods were liberal enough antonio by the way knew all of them but they had little to give and in consequence oreillys party learned the taste of wild fruits berries and palmetto hearts once they managed to kill a small pig the sole survivor of some obscure country tragedy but the rest of the time their meat when there was any consisted of iguanas those big repulsive lizardsand jutias the cuban fieldrats neither the lizards nor the rats were quite as bad as they looked or sounded the meat of the former was tender and white while the latter although strong was not unpalatable to hungry men both were muy sabrosa as jacket put it this was not the boys first experience with such a diet having campaigned before in the west he was accustomed to the taste of juita and he told oreilly how his troop had once lived so long upon these rats that it became impossible to surprise a spanish enemy except by approaching up the wind as a hunter stalks his game jacket gravely assured his friend that the spaniards could smell him and his brother patriots from a distance of five kilometers a statement by the way which the american by this time was ready to believe fortunately there was no shortage of food for the horses and so despite the necessity of numerous detours the party made good time they crossed into matanzas pushed on over rolling hills through sweeping savannas past empty clearings and deserted villages to their journeys end a fortunate encounter with a rebel partida from general betancourts army enabled them to reach headquarters without loss of time and one afternoon worn ragged and hungry they dismounted in front of that gallant officers hut general betancourt read the letter which oreilly handed him then looked up with a smile so you are one of gomezs americans eh well i would never have known it to look at you the sun and the wind have made you into a very good cuban and your clothes one might almost mistake you for a cuban cabinet officer oreilly joined in the laughter evoked by this remark he was quite as tattered as the poorest of betancourts common soldiers his shoes were broken and disreputable his cotton trousers snagged by barbed wire and brambles and soiled by days in the saddle and nights in the grass were in desperate need of attention his beard had grown too and his skin where it was exposed was burnt to a mahogany brown certainly there was nothing about his appearance to bespeak his nationality the general continued i am directed in this letter to help you in some enterprise command me sir as briefly as possible johnnie made known the object of his journey the officer nodded his comprehension but as he did so a puzzled expression crossed his face yes i reported that miss varona had gone into the city i took some pains to find out do you have reason to doubt not the least sir then why have you come all this way i came to find her and to fetch her to her brother but you dont understand she is actually inside the lines in matanzas a prisoner exactly i intend to go into matanzas and bring her out general betancourt drew back astonished my dear man he exclaimed are you mad oreilly smiled faintly quite probably all lovers are mildly mad i believe ah lovers i begin to see but how do you mean to go about this this impossible undertaking you told me just now that i could pass for a cuban well i am going to put it to the test if i once get into the city i shall manage somehow to get out again and bring her with me umm the general appraised oreilly speculatively no doubt you can get in it is not so difficult to enter i believe and especially to one who speaks the language like a native but the return i fear you will find that another matter matanzas is a place of pestilence hunger despair no one goes there from choice any more and no one ever comes out so i should imagine the speakers careless tone added to general betancourts astonishment bless me he exclaimed what an extraordinary young man is it possible that you do not comprehend the terrible conditions a sudden thought struck him and he inquired quickly tell me you are not by any chance that hero they call el demonio i have heard that he is indeed a demon no very well you say you wish to visit matanzas and i am instructed to help you how can i do so oreilly hesitated an instant for one thing i need money i i havent a single peseta you are welcome to the few dollars i possess johnnie expressed his gratitude for this ready assistance one thing more said he will you give my boy jacket a new pair of trousers and send him back to the orient at the first opportunity of course it is done the general laid a friendly hand upon oreillys shoulder saying gravely it would relieve me intensely to send you back with him for i have fears for the success of your venture matanzas is a hell it has swallowed up thousands of our good countrymen thousands have died there im afraid you do not realize what risks you are taking oreilly did not allow this wellmeant warning to influence him nor did he listen to the admonitions of those other cubans who tried to argue him out of his purpose once it became generally known on the contrary he proceeded with his preparations and spent that afternoon in satisfying himself that rosa had indeed left the pan de matanzas before cobos raid among betancourts troops was a man who had been living in the hills at the time asensio and his family had abandoned their struggle for existence and to him oreilly went this fellow it seemed had remained with his family in the mountains some time after asensios departure it was from him that oreilly heard his first authentic report of the atrocities perpetrated by cobos volunteers this man had lost his wife his little son and all the scanty belongings he possessed with shaking hands upstretched to heaven the fellow cursed the author of his misfortunes i live for one thing he cried shrilly to meet that monster and to butcher him as he butchers women and children oreilly purposely left his most unpleasant task to the last when his arrangements had been completed and he had acquainted himself as far as possible with the hazards he was likely to encounter he took jacket aside and broke the news to him that on the following morning they must part as he had expected the boy refused to listen to him oreilly remained firm and jacket adopted those tactics which had proved so potent with general gomez he began to weep copiously he worked himself up to a hysterical crescendo which threatened to arouse the entire encampment but oreilly was unmoved be quiet he told the boy i wont let you go with me and that ends it you dassent leave me sobbed the youngster i got no friend but you it will be hard enough for one man to slip through two would be sure to fail those spaniards will skill you jacket wailed so much the more reason for you to stay here at this the boy uttered a louder cry he stamped his bare feet in a frenzy of disappointment you dassent leave me you dassent listen people are starving in matanzas they are sick they are dying in the streets i dont eat much when johnnie shook his head stubbornly jacket launched himself into a torrent of profanity the violence of which dried his tears his vocabulary was surprising he reviled the spaniards oreilly himself everybody and everything he leveled anathemas at that woman who had come between him and his beloved benefactor the latter listened goodnaturedly youre a tough kid he laughed when jackets first rage had worn itself out i like you and id take you if i could but this isnt an enterprise for a boy and it wont get you anything to keep up this racket jacket next tried the power of argument he attempted to prove that in a hazardous undertaking of this sort his assistance would be invaluable he was so he declared the one person in all cuba in every respect qualified to share oreillys perils to begin with he was not afraid of spaniards or anything else for that matter he dismissed the subject of personal courage with a contemptuous shrug as for cunning sagacity prudence resource allaround worth he was without doubt unequaled in any country he was a veritable spartan too when it came to hardship privation and suffering were almost to his liking he was discreet discretion was something he had inherited he was a diplomat diplomacy being one of his most unique accomplishments as for this talk about hunger oreilly need not concern himself in the least on that score for jacket was a small eater and could grow fat on a diet of dead leaves disease bah it made him laugh his experience with sickness was wider than most fisicos and he was a better nurse than miss evans would ever be jacket did not wish to appear in the least boastful on the contrary he was actually too modest as his friends could attest but truth compelled him to admit that he was just the man for oreilly he found it impossible to recommend himself too highly to save his soul he could think of no qualification in which he was lacking and could see no reason why his benefactor would not greatly profit by the free use of his amazing talents the enterprise was difficult it would certainly fail without him johnnie remained carefully attentive during this adjuration he felt no desire even to smile for the boys earnestness was touching and it caused the elder mans throat to tighten uncomfortably johnnie had not realized before how fond he had become of this quaint youngster and so when the little fellow paused hopefully oreilly put an arm around him im sure you are everything you say you are jacket and more too but you cant go with that jacket flung off the embrace and stalking away seated himself he took a halfsmoked cigar from the pocket of his shirt and lit it scowling the while at his friend more than once during the evening oreilly detected his sullen angry eyes upon him general betancourt and several members of his staff were up early the following morning to bid their visitor goodby in spite of their efforts to make the parting cheerful it was plain that they had little hope of ever again seeing this foolhardy american johnnies spirits were not in the least affected by this illconcealed pessimism for as he told himself he had money in his pockets and matanzas was not many miles away but when he came to part from jacket he experienced a genuine disappointment the boy strangely enough was almost indifferent to his leaving he merely extended a limp and dirty hand and replied to oreillys parting words with a careless adios in hurt surprise the former inquired dont we part good friends sure jacket shrugged then turned away jacket was a likable youngster his devotion was thoroughly unselfish it had not been easy to wound him with keener regrets than he cared to acknowledge oreilly set out upon his journey following the guide whom general betancourt had provided it was a lovely morning sufficiently warm to promise a hot midday the air was moist and fresh from a recent shower this being the rainy season the trails were soft and where the rich red cuban soil was exposed the travelers sank into it as into wet putty crossing a rocky ridge oreilly and his guide at last emerged upon an open slope kneehigh in grass and grown up to bottlepalms those queer distorted trees whose trunks are swollen into the likeness of earthen waterjars scattered here and there over the meadows were the dead or fallen trunks of another variety the cabbagepalm the green heart of which had long formed a staple article of diet for the insurrectos spanish axes had been at work here and not a single tree remained alive the green floor of the valley farther down was dotted with the other the royal kind that monarch of tropic vegetation which lends to the cuban landscape its peculiar and distinctive beauty yonder is the camino said the countryman pointing into the valley it will lead you to the main road and there he turned to the northward is matanzas go with god and dont drink the well water which is polluted from the rains with a smile and a wave of the hand the man turned back and plunged into the jungle as oreilly descended the slope he realized keenly that he was alone and in hostile territory the hills and the woods from pinar del rio to oriente were cuban or at most they were disputed ground but here in the plains and valleys near the cities spain was supreme from this moment on oreilly knew he must rely entirely upon himself the success of his enterprise his very life hinged upon his caution his powers of dissimulation his ability to pass as a harmless helpless pacifico it gave him an unaccustomed thrill by no means pleasant the road when he came to it proved to be a deep gutter winding between redclay banks cut by the high wheels of clumsy canecarts inasmuch as no crops whatever had been moved over the road during the past season it was now little more than an oozy sticky rut not a roof not a chimney was in sight the valley was deserted here was a fertile farming country and yet no living thing no sound of bells no voices no crowing cocks no lowing cattle it was depressing to oreilly and more for there was something menacing and threatening about it all toward noon the breeze lessened and it became insufferably hot a bank of clouds in the east promised a cooling shower so johnnie sought the nearest shade to wait for it and took advantage of the delay to eat his slender lunch he was meditatively munching a sweetpotato when a sound at his back caused him to leap to his feet in alarm he whirled then uttered an exclamation of amazement seated not fifty feet away was a barelegged boy similarly engaged in eating a sweetpotato it was jacket his brown cheeks were distended his bright inquisitive eyes were fixed upon oreilly from beneath a defiant scowl jacket cried the man what the devil are you doing here you goin to let me come along challenged the intruder so you followed me after i said i didnt want you oreilly spoke reproachfully but reproaches had no effect upon the lad with a mild expletive jacket signified his contempt for such a weak form of persuasion see here now oreilly stepped closer lets be sensible about this but jacket scrambled to his feet and retreated warily stuffing the uneaten portion of the sweetpotato into his mouth it was plain that he had no confidence in oreillys intentions muttering something in a muffled voice he armed himself with a stout stick come here commanded the american jacket shook his head he made a painful attempt to swallow and when his utterance became more distinct he consigned his idol to a warmer place than cuba im a tough kid he declared dont get gay on me the two parleyed briefly then when satisfied that no violence was intended him the boy sat down to listen but as before neither argument nor appeal had the slightest effect upon him he denied that he had followed his benefactor he declared that he was a free agent and at liberty to go where he willed if it so chanced that his fancy took him to the city of matanzas at the same time oreilly happened to be traveling thither the circumstance might be put down to the long arm of coincidence if his company were distasteful to the elder man oreilly was free to wait and follow later it was a matter of complete indifference to jacket he had business in matanzas and he proposed to attend to it the boy lied gravely unblushingly nevertheless he kept a watchful eye upon his hearer very well oreilly told him finally i give in jackets face instantly lit up he radiated good humor he hitched his body closer by i get my own way dont i he laughed indeed you do oreilly laid a hand fondly upon his loyal follower and i dont mind telling you that im more than half glad of it i i was getting lonesome i didnt know how much i could miss you but now we must make some plans we must have an understanding and decide who we are let me see your real name is narciso narciso villar well then i shall be juan villar your brother henceforth we shall speak nothing but spanish tell me now what was our fathers name where was our home and what are we doing together during the breathless interval before the shower the two sat with their heads together talking earnestly as the wind came and the cooling rain began to rattle on the leaves overhead they took up their bundles and set out the big drops drenched them quickly their thin garments clung to them and water streamed down their bodies overhead the sky was black and rent by vivid streaks of fire but they plodded onward cheerfully jacket was himself again he bent his weight against the tempest and lengthened his short strides to oreillys he tried to whistle but his teeth chattered and the wind interfered so he hummed a song to drive the chill out of his bones and to hearten his benefactor now that he was at last accepted as a full partner in this enterprise it became his duty not only to share its perils but to lessen its hardships and to yield diversion the rain was cold the briers beside the overgrown path were sharp and they scratched the boys bare legs cruelly his stomach clamored for a companion to that solitary sweetpotato too but in his breast glowed ardor and pride jacket considered himself a fortunate person a very fortunate person indeed had he not found a brother and did not that brother love him there was no doubt about the latter for oreillys eyes when he looked down were kind and smiling his voice was friendly and intimate here was a man to die for the downpour lasted but a short time then the sun came out and dried the mens clothes on the whole it had been refreshing when evening came the villar brothers sought refuge in an old sugarmill or rather in a part of it still standing they were on the main calzada now the paved road which links the two main cities of the island and by the following noon their destination was in sight oreilly felt a sudden excitement when matanzas came into view from this distance the city looked quite as it did when he had left it except that the blue harbor was almost empty of shipping while the familiar range of hills that hid the yumuri that valley of delight so closely linked in his thoughts with rosa varona seemed to smile at him like an old friend for the thousandth time he asked himself if he had come in time to find her or if fates maddening delays had proved his own and the girls undoing oreilly knew that although matanzas was a prison and a pesthole a girl like rosa would suffer therein perils infinitely worse than imprisonment or disease it was a thought he could not bear to dwell upon signs of life began to appear now the travelers passed small gardenpatches and occasional cultivated fields they encountered loaded carts bound into the city and once they hid themselves while a column of mounted troops went by oreilly stopped to pass the time of day with a wrinkled cartman whose dejected oxen were resting going into the city are you the fellow inquired starved out i suppose well its as pleasant to starve in one place as another jacket helped himself to a stalk of cane from the load and began to strip it with his teeth will the soldiers allow us to enter johnnie inquired of course why not the old man laughed mirthlessly then his voice changed go back he said go back and die in the fields matanzas stinks of rotting corpses go back where the air is clean he swung his long lash over the oxen they leaned against the load and the cart creaked dismally on its way it is never difficult to enter a trap and matanzas was precisely that there were soldiers everywhere but beyond an indifferent challenge at the outer blockhouse a perfunctory question or two narciso and juan villar experienced no trouble whatever in passing the lines discipline never strict at best was extremely lax at the brick fortinas along the roads and since these two refugees were too poor to warrant search they were waved onward by the sentries they obeyed silently in aimless bewilderment they shuffled along toward the heart of the city almost before they realized it they had run the gauntlet and had joined that army of misery fifteen thousand strong the hand of spain had closed over them xxiv rosa look jacket clutched at oreilly and pointed a shaking finger more beggars cristo and those little children the boy tried to laugh but his voice cracked nervously are they children or gourds with legs under them oreilly looked then turned his eyes away he and jacket had reached the heart of matanzas and were facing the public square the plaza de la libertad it was called oreilly knew the place well every building that flanked it was familiar to him from the vast rambling governors palace to the ornate casino espanol and the grand hotel and time was when he had been a welcome visitor at all of them but things were different now gone were the customary crowds of welldressed wellfed citizens gone the rows of carriages which at this hour of the day were wont to circle the plaza laden with the aristocracy of the city gone was that air of cheerfulness and substance which had lent distinction to the place matanzas appeared poor and squalid depressingly wretched its streets were foul and the plaza de la libertad grim mockery of a name was crowded with a throng such as it had never held in oreillys time a throng of people who were without exception gaunt listless ragged there was no afternoon parade of finery no laughter no noise the benches were full but their occupants were silent too sick or too weak to move nor were there any romping children there were to be sure vast numbers of undersized figures in the square but one needed to look twice to realize that they were not pygmies or wizened little old folks it was not strange that jacket had compared them to gourds with legs for all were naked and most of them had bodies swollen into the likeness of pods or calabashes they looked peculiarly grotesque with their spidery legs and thin faces oreilly passed a damp hand across his eyes god he breathed she shes one of these he had not penetrated even thus far into the city without receiving a hint of what conditions must be for in the outlying streets he had seen sights and smelled odors that had sickened him but now that he was face to face with the worst now that he breathed the very breath of misery he could scarcely credit what he saw a stench indescribably nauseating assailed him and jacket as they mingled with the crowd for as yet their nostrils were unused to poverty and filth it was the rancid odor that arises from unwashed unhealthy bodies and it testified eloquently to the livingconditions of the prisoners hollow eyes and hopeless faces followed the two newcomers as they picked their way slowly along the reconcentrados overran matanzas in an unclean swarm streets and plazas were congested with them for no attempt was made to confine them to their quarters morning brought them streaming down from the suburban slopes where they lived evening sent them winding back their days were spent in an aimless search for food they snatched at crumbs and combed the gutters for crusts how they managed to exist whence came the food that kept life in their miserable bodies was a mystery even to the citizens of the city no organized effort had been made to care for them and there was insufficient surplus food for half their number yet somehow they lived and lingered on of course the city was not entirely peopled by the starving as a matter of fact they formed scarcely onefifth of the normal civil population and the life of the city was going on a good deal as usual stores were open at least there was a daily train from habana and the barracks were full of spanish troops it was from off the wastage of this normal population that these fifteen thousand prisoners were forced to live even this wastage was woefully inadequate merely serving to prolong suffering by making starvation slower at the time of oreillys arrival the sight presented by these innocent victims of war was appalling it roused in him a dull red rage at the power which had wrought this crime and at the men who permitted it to continue spain was a christian nation he reflected she had set up more crosses than any other and yet beneath them she had butchered more people than all the nations of the earth combined this monstrous coldly calculating effort to destroy the entire cuban people seemed to him the blackest infamy of all and he wondered if it would be allowed to succeed fortunately for the two friends general betancourts generosity served to relieve them from any immediate danger of starvation after making a few purchases and eating with the utmost frugality they began their search later they stretched themselves out to sleep on the stones beneath the portales of the railroad station they spent a horrid harrowing night for now the general distress was brought home to them more poignantly than ever at dawn they learned that these people were actually dying of neglect the faint light betrayed the presence of new corpses lying upon the station flagstones from those still living groans sighs sick mutterings rose until oreilly finally dragged his youthful companion out of the place i cant stand that he confessed i cant sleep when people are starving to death alongside of me this money burns my pocket i i jacket read his purpose and laid a detaining hand upon his arm it will save our lives too he said simply bah we are men there are women and children yonder but jackets sensibilities were calloused it seemed of what use would your few pesetas be among so many he inquired god has willed this and he knows what he is doing besides your pretty one is probably as hungry as are these people no doubt we shall find that she too is starving oreilly slowly withdrew his hand from his pocket yes its rosas money but come i cant endure this he led the way back to the plaza of liberty and there on an iron bench they waited for the full day they were very tired but further sleep was impossible for the deathwagons rumbled by on their way to collect the bodies of those who had died during the night neither the man nor the boy ever wholly lost the nightmare memory of the next few days for their search took them into every part of the reconcentrado districts what they beheld aged them day after day from dawn till dark they wandered peering into huts staring into faces asking questions until they were faint from fatigue and sick with disappointment as time passed and they failed to find rosa varona a terrible apprehension began to weigh oreilly down his face grew old and drawn his shoulders sagged his limbs began to drag it was all that jacket could do to keep him going the boy now that there was actual need of him proved a perfect jewel his optimism never failed his faith never faltered and oreilly began to feel a dumb gratitude at having the youngster by his side jacket too became thin and gray about the lips but he complained not at all and he laughed a great deal to him the morrow was always another day of brilliant promise toward which he looked with neverfailing eagerness and not for a single moment did he question the ultimate success of their endeavor such an example did much for the older man together they practised the strictest harshest economy living on a few cents a day while they methodically searched the city from limit to limit at first oreilly concerned himself more than a little with the problem of escape but as time wore on he thought less and less about that nor did he have occasion to waste further concern regarding his disguise that it was perfect he proved when several of his former acquaintances passed him by and when upon one occasion he came face to face with old don mario de castano don mario had changed he was older his flesh had softened and it hung loosely upon his form he appeared worried harassed and oreilly recalled rumors that the war had ruined him the mans air of dejection seemed to bear out the story they had been enemies nevertheless oreilly felt a sudden impulse to make himself known to the spaniard and to appeal directly for news of rosas fate but don mario he remembered in time had a reputation for vindictiveness so he smothered the desire one other encounter oreilly had reason to remember it so chanced that one day he and jacket found themselves in the miserable rabble which assembled at the railroad station to implore alms from the incoming passengers of the habana train few people were traveling these days and they were for the most part spanish officers to whom the sight of starving country people was no novelty now and then however there did arrive visitors from whom the spectacle of so much wretchedness wrung a contribution hence there was always an expectant throng at the depot on this occasion oreilly was surprised to hear the piteous whines for charity in the name of god turn suddenly into a subdued but vicious mutter of rage hisses were intermingled with vituperations then the crowd fell strangely silent parting to allow the passage of a great thickset man in the uniform of a colonel of volunteers the fellow was unusually swarthy and he wore a black scowl upon his face while a long puckering scar the full length of one cheek lifted his mouth into a crooked sneer and left exposed a glimpse of wolfish teeth oreilly was at a loss to fathom this sudden alteration of attitude the whistle of indrawn breaths and the whispered curses until he heard some one mutter the name cobo then indeed he started and stiffened in his tracks he fixed a fascinated stare upon the fellow colonel cobo seemed no little pleased by the reception he created with his chest arched and his black eyes gleaming malevolently he swaggered through the press clicking his heels noisily upon the stone flags when he had gone jacket voiced a vicious oath so that is the butcher of babies exclaimed the boy well now i should enjoy cutting his heart out oreillys emotions were not entirely unlike those of his small companion his lips became dry and white as he tried to speak what a brute that face ugh he found himself shaking weakly and discovered that a new and wholly unaccountable feeling of discouragement had settled upon him he tried manfully to shake it off but somehow failed for the sight of rosas archenemy and the mans overbearing personality had affected him queerly cobos air of confidence and authority seemed to emphasize oreillys impotence and bring it forcibly home to him to think of his lustful persecution of rosa varona moreover terrified him the next day he resumed his huttohut search but with a listlessness that came from a firm conviction that once again he was too late that afternoon found the two friends among the miserable hovels which encircled the foot of la cumbre about the only quarter they had not explored below lay san severino the executionplace above was the site of the old verona home more than once on his way about the city oreilly had lifted his eyes in the direction of the latter feeling a great hunger to revisit the scene of his last farewell to rosa but through fear of the melancholy effect it would have upon him he had thus far resisted the impulse today however he could no longer fight the morbid desire and so in spite of jackets protest at the useless expenditure of effort he set out to climb the hill of course the boy would not let him go alone little was said during the ascent the la cumbre road seemed very long and very steep how different the last time oreilly had swung up it the climb had never before tired him as it did now and he reasoned that hunger must have weakened him even more than he realized jacket felt the exertion too he was short of breath and he rested frequently oreilly saw that the boys bare brown legs had grown bony since he had last noticed them and he felt a sudden pang at having brought the little fellow into such a plight as this well hombre he said when they paused to rest im afraid we came too late im afraid were licked jacket nodded listlessly his optimism too was gone they must all be dead or we would have found them before this said he when oreilly made no answer he continued it is time we thought of getting away from here eh johnnie was sitting with his face in his hands without lifting his head he inquired how are we going to get away it is easy enough to get into matanzas but he shrugged hopelessly from where the two sat they could see on the opposite hillside a section of the ditch and the high barbedwire fence which girdled the city and made of it a huge corral spaced at regular intervals along the intrenchments were slowmoving diminutive figures sentries on their wellworn paths jacket brightened at the thought of escape ho ill bet we can find a hole somewhere said he were not like these others they havent the spirit to try there was a moment of silence and then caramba you remember those jutias we ate they were strong but i would enjoy the smell of one now eh another week of this and we shall be living on garbage like the rest of these poor people leaving jacket to take his time johnnie completed the climb alone meditating upon the boys words the spirit to try where had his spirit gone he wondered perhaps it had been crushed beneath the weight of misery he had beheld surely he had seen enough hourly contact with sickness and misfortune on such a gigantic scale was enough to chill any ones hopes and although his sensibilities had been dulled his apprehensions had been quickened hour by hour now that he looked the matter squarely in the face it seemed absurd to believe that a tender girl like rosa varona could long have withstood the hardships of this hideous place stronger people than she had succumbed by the hundreds even now the hospitals were full the sick lay untended in their hovels no one so far as oreilly knew had undertaken to estimate how fast they were dying or the number of dead which had already ridden out of matanzas in those rumbling wagons but there were many what chance was there that rosa had not been among the latter better by far had she remained among the empty fields and the barren slopes of the pan de matanzas for there at least the soil held roots and the trees bore fruits or berries while here was nothing but gaunt famine and grinning disease as he breasted the summit of la cumbre oreilly beheld at some distance a bent figure of want it was a negro woman grubbing in the earth with a sharpened stick after a suspicious scrutiny of him she resumed her digging nothing but a heap of stones and plaster remained of the varona home the grounds once beautiful even when neglected as in dona isabels time were now a scene of total desolation a few orangetrees to be sure remained standing and although they were cool and green to look at they carried no fruit and the odor of their blooms was a trial and a mockery to the hungry visitor the evidences of cuetos vandalism affected oreilly deeply they brought him memories more painful than he had anticipated although the place was wellnigh unrecognizable nevertheless it cried aloud of rosa and the unhappy lover could barely control the emotions it awakened it was indeed a morbid impulse which had brought him thither but now that he was here he could not leave unconsciously his feet turned toward the ancient quarry which had formed the sunken garden his and rosas trystingplace oreilly desired above all things to be alone at this moment and so he was annoyed to discover that another person was before him a woman evidently some miserable pacifico like himself she too appeared to be looking for roots and he almost stumbled over her as he brushed through the guavabushes fringing the depression his sudden appearance alarmed the creature and she struggled panicstricken out of his path her rags could not conceal the fact that she was deformed that her back was crooked so he muttered a reassuring word to her this place was more as he had left it there was the stone bench where he had said goodby to rosa yonder was the well senor johnnie heard himself addressed by the hunchbacked woman her voice was thin tremulous eager but his thoughts were busy and he paid no heed senor do you look for something some one nno yes he answered abstractedly yes i am looking for something some one something you have lost something i have lost the question came to him faintly but it was so in tune with his unhappy mood that it affected him strangely he found that his eyes were blurring and that an aching lump had risen into his throat this was the breakingpoint oreillys hearing too was going wrong for he imagined that some one whispered his name god this place was not dead it was alive terribly alive with memories voices a presence unseen yet real he laid hold of the nearest bush to steady himself he closed his eyes only to hear his name spoken louder orailye johnnie brushed the tears from his lashes he turned he listened but there was no one to be seen no one that is except the dusky cripple who had straightened herself and was facing him poised uncertainly he looked at her a second time then the world began to spin dizzily and he groped his way toward her he peered again closer for everything before his eyes was swimming the woman was thin little more than a skeleton and so frail that the wind appeared to sway her but her face uplifted to the sun was glorified oreilly stood rooted staring at her until she opened her eyes then he voiced a great cry rosa what more he said he never knew he took the misshapen figure into his arms he rained kisses upon the pinched discolored face but rosa did not respond her puny strength had flown and she lay inert in his embrace scarcely breathing tears stole down her cheeks and very faintly her fingers fluttered over his bearded cheeks dazed doubting astounded it was some time before johnnie could convince himself of the reality of this moment and even then words did not come to him for his mind was in turmoil joy thanksgiving compassion a thousand emotions mingled in a sort of delirium too wild for coherent thought or speech fear finally brought him to his senses for he became aware that rosa had collapsed and that his endearments left her unthrilled quickly he bore her to the bench and laid her upon it after a time she smiled up into his eyes and her words were scarcely more than a murmur god heard my prayers and sent you to me rosa you are ill you are weak her eyelids fluttered i am dying orailye i only waited to see you no no in agony he gathered her once more into his arms oh yes her bloodless fingers touched his face again then his thin worn rags you too have suffered how came you to be so poor and hungry orailye im not poor im rich see he jingled the coins in his pocket thats money money for you sweetheart it will buy you food and medicine it will make you well and strong again rosa dear i have looked for you so long so long his voice broke wretchedly and he bowed his head i i was afraid i waited as long as i had strength to wait she told him it is too bad you came so late once again she lapsed into the lethargy of utter weakness whereupon he fell to stroking her hands calling upon her to come back to him he was beside himself now a terrible feeling of impotence and despair overcame him hearing some one speak he raised his eyes and discovered at his side that figure of want which he had seen digging on the slope below it was evangelina the negress was little more than skin and bones her eyes were bleared and yellow and sunken her face had grown apelike but he recognized her and she him you are the american she declared you are rosas man yes but what is wrong with her look she is ill she is often like that it is the hunger we have nothing to eat senor i too am ill dying and asensio oh you dont know how they have made us suffer we must get rosa home where do you live evangelina turned her deaths head toward the city down yonder but whats the use there is no food in our house and rosa is afraid of those wagons you know the ones with the corpses she made me bring her here to die the girl was not wholly unconscious it seemed for she stirred and murmured faintly those wagons dont let them put me in there with the other dead they pile the bodies high a weak shudder convulsed her oreilly bent lower and in a strong determined voice cried you are not going to die i have money for food rouse yourself rosa rouse yourself she prayed for you every night the negress volunteered such faith such trust she never doubted that you would come and find her sometimes she cried but that was because of her brother esteban you know is dead yes dead like all the rest esteban is not dead oreilly asserted he is alive rosa do you hear that esteban is alive and well i left him with gomez in the orient i have come to take you to him esteban alive ha you are fooling us evangelina wagged her head wisely we know better than that i tell you he is alive oreilly insisted he heard jacket calling to him at that moment so he hallooed to the boy then when the latter had arrived he explained briefly without allowing jacket time in which to express his amazement our search is over we have found them but they wont believe that esteban is alive tell them the truth yes he is alive we found him rotting in a prison and we rescued him jacket corroborated he stared curiously at the recumbent figure on the bench then at oreilly he puckered his lips and gave vent to a low whistle of amazement so this is your pretty one eh i she well i dont think much of her but then you are not so handsome yourself are you evangelina seemed to be stupid a trifle touched perhaps from suffering for she laid a skinny claw upon oreillys shoulder and warned him earnestly look out for cobo you have heard about him eh well he is the cause of all our misery he hunted us from place to place and it was for him that i put that hump on her back understand me she is straight straight and pretty enough for any american her skin is like milk too and her hairshe used to put flowers in it for you and then we would play games but you never came you will make allowances for her looks will you not poor rosa you two poor creatures oreilly choked he hid his face upon his sweethearts breast rosa responded her fingers caressed him and she sighed contentedly oreillys ascent of the hill had been slow but his descent was infinitely slower for rosa was so feeble that she could help herself but little and he lacked the strength to carry her far at a time finally however they reached the wretched hovel where asensio lay then leaving her there johnnie sped on alone into the city he returned soon with several small bundles concealed about his person and with evangelinas help he set about preparing food neither rosa nor the two negroes had any appetite their hunger had long since passed the point at which they were conscious of it and oreilly was compelled to force them to eat when he had given them all that he dared he offered what food was left to jacket the boy moistened his lips and his fingers twitched but he shook his head oh im not so hungry he declared indifferently i have a friend in the marketplace i will go down there and steal a fish from him oreilly patted him on the shoulder saying you are a good kid and you understand dont you these sick people will need more food than we can buy for them so we will have to draw our belts tight of course eating is a habit anyhow and we men know how to get along without it i will manage to find something for you and me for im a prodigious thief i can steal the hair from a mans head when i try with a nod he set off to find his benefactors supper jacket whistled heroically until he was out of oreillys hearing then his bearing changed his mouth drew down and moisture came into his eyes he rubbed a grimy hand over his stomach murmuring faintly cristo it is hard to be a man when you smell things cooking xxv the haunted garden rosa varona did not die on the contrary under her lovers care she made so amazingly swift a recovery that improvement was visible from hour to hour she rallied like a wilted flower under a refreshing rain it was oreillys presence as much as the nourishing diet provided by his money which effected this marvel although the certainty that esteban was alive and safe put added force into her determination to live rosa found hope springing up in her breast and one day she caught herself laughing the marvel of it was unbelievable oreilly was sitting beside her bed of leaves at the time impulsively she pressed his hand to her lips repeating a question she had asked him many times do you love me for answer he bent and kissed her what he said was of no consequence rosa held his hand against her cheek at a loss for words with which to voice her gladness such happiness as mine belongs in heaven she managed to tell him sometimes it frightens me with you by my side this prison is a paradise and i want for nothing war suffering distress i cant imagine they longer exist nevertheless they do and matanzas is anything but a paradise said he it is hell and we must set about quickly to get out of it escape do you mean but that is impossible asensio can tell you all about that the spaniards used to issue passes for the men to go outside the lines in search of food it was just a trick they never came back all of them were killed every one knows better than to try now nevertheless we cant stay here much longer in answer to the girls puzzled inquiry he explained my money is gone all but a few cents this is the last of our food and there is no chance of getting more jacket has some mysterious source of supply and he manages to bring in something every now and then but there are five of us to feed and he cant furnish more than enough for himself no we must make a move at once while we have the strength rosa had not asked the source whence came the blessed food which was bringing the life blood back into her body and although that food was not much a little meal a plantain an occasional scrap of meat or fish it had never occurred to her that the supply might be limited she met the problem bravely however i have been close to death so long that it means little to me she confessed i have you and well with you at my side i can face the worst oh we wont give up until we have to he assured her if i had money it would be a simple proposition to bribe some guard to pass us through the lines but i have spent all that general betancourt gave me he smoothed back rosas dark hair and smiled reassuringly at her well ill manage somehow so dont worry your pretty head ill find the price if i have to waylay old don mario and rob him dont you think i look like a bandit the very sight of me would terrify that fat rascal to me you are beautiful breathed the girl then she lowered her eyes la la how i spoil you i have quite forgotten how to be ladylike isabel was right when she called me a bold and forward hussy now then please turn your face aside for i wish to think and so long as you look at me i cannot i make love to you brazenly see now then that is much better i shall hold your hand so when i kiss it you may look at me again for a moment drawing herself closer to oreilly rosa began thoughtfully before you came i more than once was on the point of appealing to some of my former friends but they are all spaniards and we are no longer simpatico you understand rosa paused for his answer perfectly im in the same fix of all the people i used to know there isnt one but would denounce me if i made myself known now that ive been fighting with the insurrectos i darent even go to the american consul for help if there is an american consul rosa nodded then continued hesitatingly i had a vivid dream last night perhaps it was a portent who knows it was about that stepmother of mine you remember how she met her death i wrote you yes and esteban also told me it was he who recovered her body from the well one day while we were in hiding away up yonder in the yumuri he showed me an old coin i know oreilly said quickly he told me the whole story he thinks that doubloon is a clue to your fathers fortune but i cant put much faith in it in fact i didnt believe until this moment that there was a doubloon at all oh indeed there was i saw it then it wasnt merely a sick fancy of your brothers indeed no it rosa broke off to exclaim oreilly you are looking at me but you gave me the signal to look he protested nothing of the sort you placed your fingers upon my lips there was a moment of silence during which the lovers were oblivious to all but each other then rosa murmured how strange sometimes your eyes are blue and sometimes gray does that mean that your love too can change certainly not but come what about esteban and that doubloon with an effort the girl brought herself back to earth well it occurred to me in the light of that dream last night that esteban may have been right of course nobody outside of our family credits the old story and yet my father was considered a very rich man at one time pancho cueto believed in the existence of the treasure and he was in a position to know true perhaps after all oreilly frowned meditatively rosa lifted herself upon her elbow her eyes sparkling wouldnt it be wonderful if it were true just think oreilly cases of spanish gold silver coins in casks packages of gems oh ive heard isabel talk about it often enough dont forget those pearls from the caribbean as large as plums johnny smiled i could never quite swallow that a pearl the size of a currant would buy our freedom right now after a moment he went on more seriously ive a notion to look into that old well this very afternoon i i dare say im foolish but somehow the story doesnt sound so improbable as it did perhaps it is worth investigating he made up his mind swiftly i im off this very instant when oreilly emerged from the hut he found jacket industriously at work over a fragment of grindstone which he had somewhere unearthed the boy looked up at his friends approach and held out for inspection a long thin file which he was slowly shaping into a knifeblade what do you think of that he queried proudly it may come in handy when we are ready to clear out of this pesthole where did you get it oh i stole it i steal everything i can lay my hands on nowadays one can never tell when he may have a throat to cut and a file has good steel in it since you are such an accomplished thief do you think you could steal something for me oreilly inquired a piece of rope rope jacket was puzzled rope is only good for hanging spaniards my friend in the fishmarket has a volandra and perhaps i can rob him of a halyard laying aside his task jacket arose and made off in the direction of the waterfront he was back within an hour and under his shirt he carried a coil of worn but serviceable rope without waiting to explain his need for this unusual article oreilly linked arms with the boy and set out to climb la cumbre when at last they stood in the unused quarry and johnnie made known his intention to explore the old well jacket regarded him with undisguised amazement what do you expect to find down there the latter inquired to tell you the truth i dont really expect to find anything the man confessed now that im here im beginning to feel silly nevertheless im going to have a look for the hidden treasure of the varonas hidden treasure from jackets expression it was plain that he feared his friend was mildly mad even after oreilly had told him something about old don estebans missing riches he scouted the story he peeped inquisitively into the dark opening of the well then he shook his head caramba what an idea was this old man crazy to throw his money away he he had more than he knew what to do with and he wished to save it from the spaniards oreilly explained lamely humph nobody ever had more money than he wanted the boys disgust at such credulity was plain this well looks just like any other only deeper youd better look out that you dont break your neck like that foolish old woman that dona whatshername oreilly did indeed feel that he was making himself ridiculous nevertheless he made the rope fast and swung himself down out of the sunlight leaving jacket to stand guard over him perhaps fifteen minutes later he reappeared panting from his exertions he was wet slimy his clothes were streaked and stained with mud jacket began to laugh shrilly at his appearance ha what a big lizard is this your beautiful garments are spoiled and the treasure where is it the lad was delighted he bent double with mirth he slapped his bare legs and stamped his feet in glee oreilly grinned goodnaturedly and replaced the planks which had covered the orifice then hid the rope in some nearby bushes on their way back he endured his young friends banter absentmindedly but as they neared asensios house he startled jacket by saying can you manage to find a pickax or a crowbar jackets eyes opened he stopped in the middle of the dusty road what did you see down there compadre tell me nothing much just enough to make me want to see more do you think you can steal some sort of a tool for me i can try please do and remember say nothing before asensio or his wife rosa met oreilly just inside the door and at sight of her he uttered an exclamation of surprise for during his absence she had removed the stain from her face and discarded that disfigurement which evangelina had fitted to her back prior to their departure from the pan de matanzas she stood before him now straight and slim and graceful the rosa of his dreams only very thin very fragile her poor tatters only enhanced her prettiness so he thought rosa dear do you think this is quite safe he ventured doubtfully evangelina who was bending over her husband straightened herself and came forward with a smile upon her black face she is beautiful eh too beautiful to look at what did i tell you rosa was in delightful confusion at oreillys evident surprise and admiration then im not so altogether changed she asked why you havent changed at all except to grow more beautiful evangelina is right you are too beautiful to look at but wait he drew her aside and whispered ive been down in the well some tremor in his voice some glint in his eyes caused the girl to seize him eagerly fiercely i may be wrong he said hurriedly there may be nothing in it and yet i saw something what wooden beams timbers of some sort behind the stone curbing it was plain rosa did not comprehend so he hurried on at first i noticed nothing unusual except that the bottom of the well is nearly dry filled up you know with debris and stuff that has fallen in from the curbing above then i saw that although the well is dug through rock nevertheless it is entirely curbed up with stones laid in mortar that struck me as queer yes i noticed too in one place that there was wood behind as if timbers had been placed there to cover the entrance to a cave you know this cuban rock is full of caverns rosa clasped her hands she began to tremble you have found it oreilly you have she whispered no no ive found nothing yet but ive sent jacket for a pick or a bar and tonight im going to pull down those stones and see what is behind them tonight you must let me go too i want to help very well but meanwhile you mustnt let your hopes rise too high for there is every chance that you will be disappointed and dont mention it to evangelina now then ive a few pennies left and im going to buy some candles rosa embraced her lover impulsively something tells me it is true something tells me you are going to save us all evangelina in the far corner of the hut muttered to her husband such lovebirds they are like parrakeets forever kissing and cooing jacket returned at dusk and with him he brought a rusty threefoot iron bar evidently part of a window grating the boy was tired disgusted and in a vile temper a pickax a crowbar he cursed eloquently one might as well try to steal a cannon out of san severino im ready to do anything within reason but why this will do nicely it is just what i want oreilly told him humph im glad to hear it for that rod was nearly the death of me i broke my back wrenching at it and the villain who owned the house may a bad lightning split him he ran after me until i nearly expired if my new knife had been sharp i would have turned and sent him home with it between his ribs tomorrow i shall put an edge on it believe me i ran until my lungs burst little food remained in the hut barely enough for asensio and the women and inasmuch as oreilly had spent his last centavo for candles he and jacket were forced to go hungry again late that evening after the wretched prison quarters had grown quiet the three treasurehunters stole out of their hovel and wound up the hill in spite of their excitement they went slowly for none of them had the strength to hurry fortunately there were few prowlers within the lines hunger having robbed the reconcentrados of the spirit to venture forth and in consequence spanish vigilance had relaxed it was now confined to the farflung girdle of intrenchments which encircled the city the trio encountered no one leaving jacket on guard at the crest of the hill oreilly stationed rosa at the mouth of the well then lowered himself once more into it lighting his candle he made a careful examination of the place with the result that estebans theory of the missing riches seemed even less improbable than it had earlier in the day the masonrywork he discovered had been done with a painstaking thoroughness which spoke of the abundance of slave labor and time had barely begun to affect it here and there a piece of the mortar had loosened and come away but for the most part it stood as solid as the stones between which it was laid shoulderhigh to oreilly there appeared to be a section of the curbing less smoothly fitted than the rest and through an interstice in this he detected what seemed to be a damp wooden beam at this point he brought his iron bar into play it was not long before he discovered that his work was cut out for him the cement was like flint and his blunt makeshift implement was almost useless against it ankledeep in the muddy water he patiently pecked and pounded and chipped endeavoring to enlarge the crevice so as to use his bar as a lever the sweat streamed from him and he became dismayed at his own weakness he was forced to rest frequently rosa hung over the orifice above encouraging him inquiring eagerly as to his progress during his frequent breathingspells he could discern her white face dimly illumined by the candlelight from below after he had worked for an hour or two he made a report it begins to look as if there really was a bulkhead or a door in there the girl clapped her hands and laughed with delight do hurry dear im dying of suspense oreilly groaned that fellow sebastian knew his business this cement is like steel and im afraid of breaking my crowbar rosa found a leaf folded a kiss into it and dropped it to him that will give you strength she declared oreilly lost all count of time after a while and he was incredulous when jacket came to warn him that daylight was less than an hour away why i havent started he protested he discovered much to his surprise that he was ready to drop from fatigue and that his hands were torn and blistered when he had climbed the rope to the upper air he fell exhausted in the deep grass i im not myself at all he apologized nothing to eat you know but the work will go faster now for ive made a beginning do you still think rosa hesitated to voice the question which trembled on her lips ill know for sure tonight he directed jacket to replace the planks over the well then the three of them stole away oreilly spent most of that day in a profound stupor of exhaustion while rosa watched anxiously over him jacket it seemed had peacefully slumbered on picket duty so he occupied himself by grinding away at his knife the last scraps of food disappeared that evening when night fell and it came time to return to the top of la cumbre oreilly asked himself if his strength would prove sufficient for the task in hand he was spiritless sore weak he ached in every bone and muscle and it required all his determination to propel himself up the hill he wondered if he were wise thus to sacrifice his waning energies on a hope so forlorn as this but by now he had begun to more than half believe in the existence of the varona treasure and he felt an almost irresistible curiosity to learn what secret if any was concealed behind those watersoaked timbers at the bottom of the well he realized of course that every hour he remained here now that food and money were gone lessened the chances of escape but on the other hand he reasoned with equal force that if he had indeed stumbled upon the missing hoard salvation for all of them was assured the stake it seemed to him was worth the hazard given tempered tools to work with it would have been no great undertaking to tear down that cemented wall of stones but armed with nothing except his bare hands and that soft iron bar oreilly spent nearly the whole night at his task long before the last rock had yielded however he beheld that which caused him to turn a strained face upward to rosa theres a little door as sure as you live he told her the girl was beside herself with excitement yes what else what more do you see nothing it appears to be made of solid timbers and has two huge handwrought locks locks then we have found it rosa closed her eyes she swayed momentarily esteban was right locks indeed that means something to hide oh if i could only help you god if i only had something anything to work with muttered the american as he fell to with redoubled energy he no longer tried to conserve his strength for the treasureseekers lust beset him rosa looked on wringing her hands and urging him to greater haste but the low thick door was built of some hard native wood it was wet and tough and slippery oreillys blows made no impression upon it nor upon the heavy hasps and staples with which it was secured in place the latter were deeply rusted to be sure but they withstood his efforts and he was finally forced to rest baffled enraged half hysterical from weakness and fatigue daylight was at hand once more but he refused to give up and worked on stubbornly furiously until rosa in an agony besought him to desist johnnie again collapsed on the grass and lay panting while the other two replaced the planks another hour and id have been into it he declared huskily you will skill yourself jacket told him rosa bent over him with shining eyes and parted lips yes said she be patient we will come back oreilly and tonight we shall be rich colonel cobo lit a black cigarette leaned back in his chair and exhaled two fierce jets of smoke through his nostrils for a full moment he scowled forbiddingly at the sergeant who had asked to see him whats this you are telling me he inquired finally the sergeant a meanfaced lowbrowed man stirred uneasily it is gods truth there are spirits on la cumbre and i wish to see the priest about it spirits what kind of spirits the fellow shrugged evil spirits spirits from hell the men are buying charms bah i took you to be a sensible person you dont believe me well i didnt believe them when they told me about it but i saw with my own eyes cobo leaned forward mildly astonished of all his villainous troop this man was the last one he had credited with imagination of this sort what did you see a ghost my colonel nothing else la cumbre is no place for an honest christian the colonel burst into a mocking laugh an honest christian you of all my vile ruffians you are the vilest why youre a thief a liar and an assassin you are lying to me now come the truth for once before i give you the componte as god is my judge im telling you the truth protested the soldier flog me if you will rather the componte than another night in those trenches you know that old quinta where pancho cueto made a goat of himself perfectly do you mean to say that you saw old esteban varona walking with his head in his hands no but i saw that shedevil who fell in the well and broke her neck eh when did you behold this this marvel two nights ago she was there beside the well and her face shone through the night like a lantern christ there was fire upon it she came and went like a moth in the lamplight i tell you i repented of my sins some of the men laughed at me when i told them as they had laughed at the others but last night two of the doubters went up there exactly and they saw nothing your pardon my colonel they came back in a cold sweat and they spent the night on their knees the woman was there again you have seen the salt sea at night well her face was aglow like that so they said they heard the clanking of chains too and the sound of hammers coming from the very bowels of the earth it is all plain enough when you know the story but it is terrifying this is indeed amazing cobo acknowledged but of course there is some simple explanation spirits if indeed there are such things are made of nothing they are like thin air how then could they rattle chains you probably saw some wretched pacificos in search of food and imagined the rest indeed then what did i hear with these very ears whispers murmurs groans and the clinketyclink of old sebastians chisel for his sins that old slave is chained in some cavern of the mountain soundless im no baby i know when im asleep and i know when im awake that place is accursed and i want no more of it cobo fell into frowning meditation allowing his cigarette to smolder down until it burned his thick fingers he was not a superstitious man and he put no faith in the supernatural nevertheless he was convinced that his sergeant was not lying and reference to pancho cueto had set his mind to working along strange channels he had known cueto well and the latters stubborn belief in the existence of that varona treasure had more than once impressed him he wondered now if others shared that faith or if by chance they had discovered a clue to the whereabouts of the money and were conducting a secret search it was a fantastic idea nevertheless cobo told himself that if people were prying about those deserted premises it was with some object and their actions would warrant observation the presence of the woman a woman with the glow of phosphorus upon her face was puzzling but the whole affair was puzzling he determined to investigate after a time he murmured i should like to see this spirit the sergeant shrugged it was plain from his expression that he could not account for such a desire another night is coming said he good i shall visit the place and if i see anything unusual i well i shall believe what you have told me meanwhile go see your priest by all means it will do you no harm xxvi how cobo stood on his head all that day or during most of it at least rosa and oreilly sat hand in hand oblivious of hunger and fatigue impatient for the coming of night keyed to the highest tension now they would rejoice hysterically assuring each other of their good fortune again they would grow sick with the fear of disappointment time after time they stepped out of the hut and stared apprehensively up the slopes of la cumbre to assure themselves that this was not all a part of some fantastic illusion over and over in minutest detail johnnie described what he had seen at the bottom of the well he tried more than once during the afternoon to sleep but he could not for the moment he closed his eyes he found himself back there in that pit upon the ridges crest straining at those stubborn rocks and slippery timbers this inaction was maddening his fatigue rendered him feverish and irritable jacket too felt the strain and after several fruitless attempts to sleep he rose and went out into the sunshine where he fell to whetting his knife he finished putting a double edge upon the blade fitted a handle to it and then a cord with which to suspend it round his neck he showed it to oreilly and after receiving a word of praise he crept outdoors again and tried to forget how sick he was black spots were dancing before jackets eyes he experienced spells of dizziness and nausea during which he dared not attempt to walk he knew this must be the result of starvation and yet strangely enough the thought of food was distasteful to him he devoutly wished it were not necessary to climb that hill again for he feared he would not have the strength to descend it luckily for the sake of the secret evangelina spent most of the day searching for food while asensio lay babbling upon his bed too ill to notice the peculiar actions of his companions it was with a strange nightmare feeling of unreality that the trio dragged themselves upward to the ruined quinta when darkness finally came they no longer talked for conversation was a drain upon their powers and the reaction from the days excitement had set in oreilly lurched as he walked his limbs were heavy and his liveliest sensation was one of dread at the hard work in store for him the forcing of that door assumed the proportions of a herculean task but once he was at the bottom of the well and beheld the handiwork of sebastian the slave just as he had left it his sense of reality returned and with it a certain measure of determination inasmuch as he had made no visible impression upon the bulkhead by his direct attack he changed his tactics now and undertook to loosen one of the jambs where it was wedged into the rock at top and bottom after a desperate struggle he succeeded in loosening the entire structure so that he could pry it out far enough to squeeze his body through i have it he cried to rosa seizing the candle he thrust it into the opening he beheld what he had expected to find a small cavern or grotto which had evidently been pierced during the digging of the well he could appreciate now how simple had been the task of sealing it up so as to baffle discovery rosa poised above him scarcely breathed until he straightened himself and turned his face upward once more he tried to speak but voiced nothing more than a hoarse croak the candle in his hand described erratic figures what do you see the girl cried in an agony of suspense i its here bboxes chests casks everything god be praised my fathers fortune at last rosa forgot her surroundings she beat her hands together calling upon oreilly to make haste and determine beyond all question that the missing hoard was indeed theirs she drew perilously close to the well and knelt over it like some priestess at her devotions her eyes were brimming with tears and there was a roaring in her ears it was not strange that she failed to see or to hear the approach of a great blurred figure which materialized out of the night and took station scarcely an armslength behind her he intended it for his children she sobbed and providence saved it from our wicked enemies it was the hand of god that led us here oreilly tell me what do you see now johnnie had wormed his way into the damp chamber and a slim rectangle of light was projected against the opposite side of the well rosa could hear him talking and moving about don esteban varonas subterranean hidingplace was large enough to store a treasure far greater than his it was perhaps ten feet in length with a roof high enough to accommodate a tall man at the farther end were ranged several small wooden chests bound with iron and fitted with hasps and staples along one side was a row of diminutive casks the sort used to contain choice wines or liquors over all was a thick covering of slime and mold the iron was deeply rusted and the place itself smelled abominably stale oreilly surveyed this aladdins cave in a daze he set his candle down for his fingers were numb and unsteady cautiously as if fearful of breaking some spell he stooped and tried to move one of the casks but found that it resisted him as if cemented to the rock he noted that its head was bulged upward as if by the dampness so he took his iron bar and aimed a sharp blow at the chine a hoop gave way another blow enabled him to pry out the head of the cask he stood blinking at the sight exposed for the little barrel was full of coins yellow coins large and small oreilly seized a handful and held them close to the candleflame among the number he noted a spanish doubloon such as young esteban had found he tested the weight of the other casks and found them equally heavy knowing little about gold he did not attempt to estimate the value of their contents but he judged they must represent a fortune with throbbing pulses he next lifted the lid of the nearest chest within he discovered several compartments each stored with neatly wrapped and labeled packages of varying shapes and sizes the writing upon the tags was almost illegible but the first article which oreilly unwrapped proved to be a goblet of most beautiful workmanship time had long since blackened it to the appearance of pewter or some base metal but he saw that it was of solid silver evidently he had uncovered a store of old spanish plate in one corner of the chest he saw a metal box of the sort in which valuable papers are kept and after some effort he managed to break it open turning back the lid he found first a bundle of documents bearing imposing scrolls and heavy seals despite the dampness they were in fairly good condition and there was enough left of the writing to identify them beyond all question as the missing deeds of patent to the varona lands those crown grants for which dona isabel had searched so fruitlessly but this was not all that the smaller box contained beneath the papers there were numerous leather bags these had rotted they came apart easily in oreillys fingers displaying a miscellaneous assortment of unset gems some of them at first sight looked like drops of blood others like drops of purest water they were the rubies and the diamonds which had brought isabel to her death oreilly waited to see no more candle in hand he crept out into the well to apprise rosa of the truth weve got it theres gold by the barrel and the deeds to your land yes and the jewels too a quart of them i guess i i cant believe my eyes he showed her a handful of coins look at that doubloons eagles there appear to be thousands of them why youre the richest girl in cuba rubies diamonds yes and pearls too i dare say he choked and began to laugh weakly hysterically ive heard about those pearls rosa cried shrilly pearls from the caribbean as large as plums isabel used to babble about them in her sleep i found those deeds the first thing the plantations are yours now beyond any question rosa drew back from her precarious position for she had grown limp from weakness and her head was whirling as she rose to her feet she brushed something somebody some fleshandblood form which was standing almost over her involuntarily she recoiled toppling upon the very brink of the pit whereupon a heavy hand reached forth and seized her she found herself staring upward into a face she had grown to know in her nightmares a face the mere memory of which was enough to freeze her blood it was a hideous visage thicklipped fiatfeatured black it was disfigured by a scar from lip to temple and out of it gleamed a pair of eyes distended and ringed with white like the eyes of a man insane for an instant rosa made no sound and no effort to escape the apparition robbed her of breath it paralyzed her in both mind and body her first thought was that she had gone stark mad but she had felt cobos hands upon her once before and after her first frozen moment of amazement she realized that she was in her fullest senses a shriek sprang to her lips she tried to fight the man off but her weak struggle was like the fluttering of a bird cobo crushed her down strangling the halfuttered cry terror may be so intense so appalling as to be unendurable in rosas case a merciful oblivion overtook her she felt the world grow black fall away felt herself swing dizzily through space oreilly looked upward inquiring sharply whats the matter he heard a scuffling of feet above him but received no answer rosa what frightened you rosa there was a moment of sickening suspense then he put his shoulder to the timbers he had displaced and with a violent shove succeeded in swinging them back into place laying hold of the rope he began to hoist himself upward he had gone but a little way however when without warning his support gave way and he fell backward the rope came pouring down upon him rosa he called again in a voice thick from fright followed an instant of silence then he flattened himself against the side of the well and the breath stuck in his throat into the dim circle of radiance above a head was thrust a head a pair of wide shoulders and then two arms the figure bent closer and oreilly recognized the swarthy features of that man he had seen at the matanzas railroad station there could be no doubt of it it was cobo the men stared at each other silently and of the two cobo appeared to be the more intensely agitated after a moment his gaze fixed itself upon the opening into the treasurechamber and remained there as if to make entirely sure of what he had overheard he stretched his body farther supporting it by his outflung arms then moved his head from side to side for a better view he seemed to rock over the mouth of the well like a huge fat black spider he was the first to speak am i dreaming or have you really discovered that treasure he queried oreillys upturned face was ghastly he wet his lips he managed to whisper rosas name the riches of the varonas christ what a find cobos teeth shone white in the grin of avarice yes i see now a cavern in the rock well well and you are the spirit of sebastian chained in the bowels of la cumbre ha these are the ghosts he began to chuckle but the sound of his malevolent merriment was like the hiccoughing of a drunken man rosa what have you done cobo ran on unheeding it must be a great treasure indeed from all accounts the ransom of a dozen kings thats what cueto said the ransom of a dozen kings those were his very words the fellow continued to sway himself back and forth peering as if his eyes were about to leave his head for a long moment or two he utterly disregarded oreilly but finally as he gained more selfcontrol his gaze shifted and his expression altered he changed his weight to his left arm and with his right hand he drew his revolver what are you doing oreilly cried hoarsely the colonel seemed vaguely surprised at this question fool do you expect me to share it with you he inquired wait theres enough for all of us oreilly feebly protested then as he heard the click of the cocked weapon let me out ill pay you well make you rich in desperation he raised his shaking hand to dash out the candle but even as he did so the colonel spoke at the same time carefully lowering the revolver hammer you are right what am i thinking about there must be no noise caramba a pretty business that would be wouldnt it with my men running up here to see what it was all about no no no gunshots no disturbance of any kind you understand what i mean eh his face twisted into a grin as he tossed the revolver aside then undertook to detach a stone from the crumbling curb no noise he chuckled no noise whatever oreilly stupefied by the sudden appearance of this monstrous creature stunned by the certainty of a catastrophe to rosa awoke to the fact that this man intended to brain him where he stood in a panic he cast his eyes about him thinking to take shelter in the treasurecave but that retreat was closed to him for he had wedged the wooden timbers together at the first alarm he was like a rat in a pit utterly at the mercy of this maniac and cobo was a maniac at the moment he had so far lost control of himself as to allow the stone to slip out of his grasp it fell with a thud at oreillys feet causing the assassin to laugh once more ho ho he hiccoughed my fingers are clumsy eh but there is no need for haste he stretched out his arm again laid hold of another missile and strained to loosen it from its bed jewels pearls the size of plums and i a poor man i cant believe it yet he could not detach the stone so he fumbled farther along the curbing pearls indeed i would send a dozen men to hell for one oreilly had been standing petrified his body forced tightly against the rough surface behind him following with strained fascination the deliberate movements of the man above him now he saw cobo without the least apparent reason twist and shudder saw him stiffen rigidly as if seized with a sudden cramp saw his eyes dilate and heard him heave a deep whistling sigh oreilly could not imagine what ailed the fellow for an eternity so it seemed cobo remained leaning upon his outspread arms fixed in that same attitude of paralysis it looked almost as if he had been startled by some sound close by but manifestly that was not the cause of his hesitation for his face became convulsed and an expression of blank and utter astonishment was stamped upon it the men stared fixedly at each other oreilly with his head thrown back cobo with his body propped rigidly upon wooden arms and that peculiar shocked inquiry in his glaring eyes but slowly this expression changed the colonel bent as if beneath a great weight his head rose and turned back upon his neck he filled his lungs with another wheezing sigh christ o christ he whispered his teeth ground together his head began to wag upon his shoulders it dropped lower and lower one hand slipped from its hold and he lurched forward an instant he hung suspended from the waist then he appeared to let go limply as all resistance went out of his big body there came a warning rattle of dirt and mortar and pebbles the next instant he slipped into the well and plunged headlong down upon oreilly an avalanche of lifeless flesh johnnie shielded himself with his upflung arms but he was driven to his knees and when he scrambled to his feet half stunned it was to find himself in utter darkness there was a heavy weight against his legs with a strength born of horror and revulsion he freed himself then hearing no sound and feeling no movement he fumbled for the candle and with clumsy fingers managed to relight it even after the flame had leaped out and he saw what shared the pit with him he could barely credit his senses the nature of his deliverance was uncanny supernatural it left him dazed he had beheld death stamped upon cobos writhing face even while the fellow braced himself to keep from falling but what force had effected the phenomenon what unseen hand had stricken him johnnie was at a loss to comprehend it seemed a miracle indeed until he looked closer then he understood cobo lay in a formless boneless heap he seemed to be all arms and legs his face was hidden but between his shoulders there protruded the crude wooden handle of a homemade knife to which a loop of cord was tied oreilly stared stupidly at the weapon then he raised his eyes peering down at him out of the night was another face an impertinent beardless youthful face he uttered jackets name and the boy answered with a smile bring my knife with you when you come the latter directed you the americans voice was weak and shaky i thought he set the candle down and covered his eyes momentarily thats a good knife all right and sharp too the fellow died in a hurry eh who does he happen to be dont you know it its cobo cobo coby the babykiller jacket breathed an oath oh that blessed knife the boy craned his small body forward until he was in danger of following his victim now this is good luck indeed and to think that he died just like any other man rosa where is she oreilly inquired in a new agony of apprehension oh she is here jacket assured him carelessly i think she has fainted caramba isnt that like a woman to miss all the fun but compadre that was a blow for cuba libre what people will talk about me when im as dead as that pig narciso villar the slayer of cobo thats what theyll call me jacket giggled hysterically i i thought he would jump up and run after me so i fled but he tried to bury himself didnt he his flesh was like butter oreilly help me out quick here catch this rope johnnie managed to fling the coil within reach of his little friend and a moment later he had hoisted himself from that pit of tragedy xxvii morin the fisherman when rosa varona regained consciousness sufficiently to understand what had happened she proved herself a person of no little selfcontrol she went to pieces for a moment as was only natural but oreilly soon succeeded in calming her nor did he have to remind her twice that this was no time for weakness or hysteria it was she in fact who first voiced the fear that cobo dead was scarcely less of a menace than cobo alive what are we going to do with him she inquired jacket too appreciated the dangers of the situation we must get rid of him quickly said he for his men are close by he will be missed and there will be a search i dont intend to make him a present of that treasure oreilly said grimly it is our only salvation but how are we going to hide him jacket inquired one might as well try to conceal a church oxen couldnt hoist him out of that hole precisely he has made our work easy for us we cant take more than a small part of the money with us anyhow the rest will have to lie here until the war is over well we shall leave cobo on guard over what remains jacket was immensely pleased with this idea once he had grasped it what could be better he cried the mans spirit is evil enough to frighten people away and we will drop stones upon him so that he can learn the taste of his own medicine it suits me exactly to think of colonel cobo standing on his head in a hole in the ground for the rest of eternity oreilly was by this time suffering the full reaction from the events of the past halfhour and he was nearer exhaustion than he dreamed but conquering his repugnance for his unescapable task he lowered himself once more into the well his arms were weak however and his fingers numb so he fell rather than slid the length of the rope he managed to open the door of the treasurechamber then entered and loaded his pockets with gold he sent up the jewelbox at the end of the rope dragged the body of cobo into the cave then wedged the barricade back into place it required the combined strength of rosa and jacket to help him the last few feet of his climb now fetch stones rubbish anything and throw it in there he gasped the boy and the girl fell to with a will and after a time johnnie joined them slowly laboriously the three of them carried debris from the edge of the quarry and bricks from the ruined house they scraped up armfuls of leaves and trash anything in fact which would serve to raise the bottom of the shaft and conceal the entrance to their enemys restingplace it was slavish work but oreilly kept them at it until they were ready to drop daylight overtook them at their task they were weak sick deadly tired they could barely shuffle a few yards at a time when they finally reached asensios hut nevertheless there was hope in their hearts for oreillys ragged clothes sagged with the weight of gold pieces and the little metal box he carried was heavy nor were they greatly concerned about the safety of the treasure they had left behind for the entrance to the cavern lay deeply buried and cobo the guerrilla stood guard over the chests of plate and the casks of coin evangelina vastly bewildered at the sight of the coin which was forced into her palm went for food and spent most of the day in cooking it the treasurehunters alternately slept and ate it was not until well along toward evening that rosa and oreilly felt any desire to take stock of the contents of that jewelbox but finally with heads together and with backs to the door of the bohio they made a furtive examination it was a task that held them spellbound for there were loose gems of many varieties some well some badly cut there were pieces of antique spanish jewelry valuable mainly by virtue of their antiquity clumsy settings of silver and gold containing dead uninteresting stones others of the finest and most delicate workmanship some of the pieces were like glittering cobwebs enmeshing sparks of fire and drops of blood they found emeralds and sapphires the value of which they did not attempt to estimate and besides these a miscellaneous assortment of semiprecious stones there was a fine collection of opals of every size and color among which were a number of huge flat black ones indescribably gorgeous with their everchanging peacock hues but finest of all the lot were the pearls where old don esteban had secured these latter was a mystery for he had not been a widely traveled man they were splendid unrivaled in size and luster some had the iridescence of soapbubbles others ranged from pink to deepest chocolate in color to touch them was like sacrilege oreilly realized vaguely that he held in his lap a fortune greater than his wildest dreams had ever compassed these were the jewels of a rajah it seemed incredible that this ragged girl beside him was a regal heiress the possessor of a treasure such as kings might envy after a time he realized that the mere possession of these gems constituted a new and overwhelming menace all that evening he and rosa cowered in the darkness whispering furtively their nerves on edge their senses strained it seemed to them that new and unsuspected perils stalked abroad through the night morning found all hands more nearly rational and feeling the first gnawings of a healthy hunger even asensio confessed to a quite miraculous improvement while evangelina prepared breakfast the lovers agreed upon a story to explain the origin of that mysterious gold piece and later johnnie warned jacket for a second time to keep his tongue between his teeth we will have to be doubly careful now he told the boy an unguarded word or an incautious move would be the end of us jacket nodded his complete comprehension sure all spaniards are robbers and theyd kill us for a peso yes and the pacificos are no better i tell you we need to get out of this place i intend to arrange it at once but the sight of those jewels has frightened me if we are searched if we are even suspected oh rosa wouldnt have any more use for her pretty trinkets shed be in heaven before you could scratch your nose oreilly frowned she isnt at all strong yet im wondering if she can endure the hardships well encounter when or if we get away exactly what i was thinking ive been considering another plan indeed oreilly scanned the face of his young friend with interest he was beginning to have a high regard for jackets capabilities and the boys exploit of the night before certainly entitled him to be heard upon any subject i told you about my friend at the market the latter continued well he is a miserable spaniard but he has a son in the manigua one of us johnnie was surprised yes the old fellow owns a volandra in which he brings charcoal from the eastward twice a month there was a moment of silence then oreilly said slowly as if hesitating even to voice such a suggestion you mean he might take us out of here on his schooner who knows hes not a bad old fellow and he likes me but there would be no place for women how well does he like you oh we are like two thieves after another period of thought oreilly said take me to him and remember im your brother juan the matanzas market did not present a scene of great activity when the two friends slunk into it it was midday and what food had earlier been offered for sale had for the most part long since disappeared all but a few of the stalls were empty and a number of emaciated reconcentrados were searching listlessly among them for neglected scraps or imploring aid from such marketmen as still lingered about like most spanish markets the building was far from clean and housed odors unpleasant even to starving people in the smelliest section at one of the fishstalls jacket accosted a villainous old brigand in a rough gallego cap baggy blouse and trousers and straw sandals good day my captain he cried cheerily the spaniard raised his head scowled ferociously then waved a long thinbladed knife in menacing fashion aha so there you are robber be off now before i slit your greedy little belly he spoke in an angry husky voice when jacket stood his ground he reached for him with a hand upon which blood and fishscales had dried didnt i promise to give you to the soldiers if you came back to bother me jacket was unabashed by this hostile reception he grinned broadly and with an impudent eye he scanned the empty premises where is my little fish he demanded as i live i believe you have sold it god what a miser for the sake of another centavo you would see me starve theres a heart for you your little fish roared the brigand clashing his blade on the filthy counter no shark ever stole so many fish as you come i shall make an end of you and have some peace starve you bah your body is like a gourd yes and quite as hollow i starve because you possess a heart of stone one little fish no longer than your finger just one not so much as a fin cried the man can i feed all the rebels in matanzas one little fish jacket wheedled for the sake of miguelito who is bravely fighting in the manigua to the shame of his miserly old father fattening on the groans of good patriots like me must i remind you again that miguelito was my brother that i have robbed my own belly in order to give him food liar it is true you never saw him miguel morin with a scar on his neck the bravest boy in all the orient ask him about narciso villar come give me my fish or must i lie down and die before your very eyes to prove my hunger what a nuisance grumbled the marketman he reached into a basket and flung a mackerel upon the table there i saved it for you and sent the good women of matanzas away emptyhanded but it is the very last annoy me again and i shall open you with my knife and put salt on you ah you are my good captain jacket cried in triumph possessing himself of the prize where would i have been but for you turning to oreilly who had looked on from a distance at this artificial quarrel he said captain morin this is that brother juan of whom i have told you morin smiled at johnnie and extended his dirty palm the little fellow can speak the truth when he wishes it seems i began to doubt that he had a brother what a boy eh leaning closer he whispered hoarsely it is cheaper to give him a fish than to have him steal a whole basketful but he is a great liar even yet im not sure that he knows my miguelito you have a son with the insurrectos yes the fisherman cast a furtive glance over his shoulder he is a traitor of the worst sort and i dont approve of him but hes a brave boy and he loves fighting sometimes i get hungry to see him why dont you go and fight by his side jacket demanded god forbid morin flung up his hands im a loyal subject well we are going back to fight we are going to escape and join gomez once more jacket made the announcement calmly ssh what talk morin was in a nervous panic lest they be overheard as if anybody could escape from matanzas what made you come here if you are so eager to fight ill tell you oreilly assumed direction of the conversation there are three of us brothers we two and esteban a pretty little fellow he was captured by cobos men and driven in and we came to find him you came here here to matanzas old morin was incredulous he muttered an oath that was a very nice thing to do and did you find him oh yes that was easy enough for the lad is deformed tse tse what a pity but he is sick dying of course theyre all dying the poor people it is terrible we oreilly faltered slightly so much hung upon the manner in which morin would take what he was about to say we want to get him out of here we must do so or well lose him sensing some hidden significance some obscure purpose behind this confession the spaniard looked sharply at the speaker his leathery countenance darkened why are you telling me this he inquired what makes you think i wont betray you something tells me you wont you have a good heart and you have kept narciso from starving for the sake of your own boy well will you help us i in heavens name how by taking us away in your charcoalschooner youre mad morin cast another apprehensive look over his shoulder im a poor man all i have is my two boats the vivero which brings fish and the volandra which sails with charcoal do you think id forfeit them and my life for strangers there wouldnt be much risk indeed perhaps i know something about that oreilly leaned closer you say youre a poor man i will pay you well morin eyed the ragged speaker scornfully it was plain that he put no faith in such a promise and so oreilly took a piece of gold from his pocket at sight of which the fisherman started what kind of pacificos are you morin queried his mouth had fallen open his eyes protruded i too am a poor man but im willing to buy freedom for my little brothers and myself how many coins like that have you um m more than one enough to pay you for several cargoes of coal and i have given you fish to eat morin rolled his eyes at jacket he pondered the marvel of what he had seen he muttered something to himself for the sake of miguelito jacket urged caramba what a hardhearted father begot that boy hush the fisherman was scowling to oreilly he said you do wrong to tempt a poor man my brother esteban is sick he is a frail little lad with a crooked back god will reward you perhaps but how much will you pay ten spanish sovereigns like this all that i have no it is not enough oreilly took jackets hand and turned away im sorry said he i wish i might offer you more he had taken several steps before morin hailed him come back tomorrow the fisherman cried crossly we will try to talk like sensible people the brothers villar were back at morins fishstand on the following afternoon and they returned daily thereafter until they at last prevailed over the spaniards fears and won his promise of assistance that much accomplished they made several cautious purchases a coat here a shirt there a pair of trousers in another place until they had assembled a complete boys outfit of clothing at first rosa refused absolutely to desert her two faithful negro friends and oreilly won her consent to consider his plan of escape only after he had put the matter squarely up to asensio and his wife and after both had refused to enter into it asensio declared that he was too sick to be moved and asserted that he would infinitely prefer to remain where he was provided he was supplied with sufficient money to cover his needs evangelina agreed with him then and not until then did rosa begin her preparations first she made evangelina cut her hair a sacrilege that wrung sighs and tears and loud lamentations from the black woman after which she altered the suit of boys clothing to fit her figure or rather to conceal it when at last she put it on for oreillys approval she was very shy very selfconscious and so altogether unboylike that he shook his head positively my dear youll never do he told her you are altogether too pretty but wait until i put that hideous hump upon my back and stain my face then you will see how ugly i can look perhaps he said doubtfully a moment then his frown lightened you give me a thought said he you shall wear the jewels wear them how on your back in that very hump it will be the safest possible way to conceal them rosa clapped her hands in delight why of course it is the very thing wait until i show you profiting by her first moment alone evangelina and her husband being still in ignorance of the contents of the treasurebox rosa made a bundle out of the jewels and trinkets and fastened it securely inside her coat after a few experiments she adjusted it to her liking then called oreilly once more this time he was better satisfied he was in truth surprised at the effect of the disfigurement and after putting rosa through several rehearsals in masculine deportment he pronounced the disguise as nearly perfect as could be hoped for an application of evangelinas stain to darken her face a few tatters and a liberal application of dirt to the suit and he declared that rosa would pass anywhere as a boy there came a night when the three of them bade goodby to their black companions and slipped away across the city to that section known as pueblo nuevo then followed the road along the waterfront until they found shelter within the shadows of a rickety structure which had once served as a bathhouse the building stood partially upon piles and under it they crept kneedeep in the lapping waves to their left was the illumination of matanzas to their right the lights of the penas alias fort ahead of them empty and dark save for the ridinglights of a few small coastingvessels lay the harbor the refugees waited a long time they were beginning to fear that old morins nerve had weakened at the eleventh hour when they beheld a skiff approaching the shore it glided closer entered the shade of the bathhouse then a voice cried pset you are there it was morin himself hastily the three piled aboard morin bent to his oars and the skiff shot out you were not observed he inquired no morin rowed in silence for a time then confessed this business is not to my liking there is too much risk think of me putting my neck in peril ho jacket chuckled it is just the sort of thing that i enjoy if miguelito was captain of his fathers boat wed been in cardenas by daybreak when do you sail oreilly asked at dawn god permitting you will have to remain hidden and you mustnt even breathe i have told my men that you are members of my wifes family good spaniards but i doubt if they will believe it then you are to be my uncle jacket inquired from his seat in the bow caramba thats more than i can stand to be considered a spaniard is bad enough but to be known as the nephew of an old miser who smells of fish it is too much badinage of this sort did not displease the fisherman it is not often they board us nowadays he said more hopefully but of course one never can tell perhaps we will sail out under their very noses he brought the skiff alongside a battered old schooner and his passengers clambered aboard there was a tiny cabin aft and on it sheltered from the night dew by a loose fold of the mainsail were two sleeping men the newcomers followed morin down into the evil little cabin where he warned them in a stertorous whisper not a sound mind you if any one comes aboard you must shift for yourselves creep into the hold and hide of course if we are searched he muttered something then groped his way out on deck and closed the hatch behind him it was inky dark in the cabin the occupants dared not move about for fear of waking the sailors overhead time passed slowly after a while jacket yawned and sighed and grumbled under his breath finally he stretched himself out upon a narrow board bench and fell asleep oreilly drew rosa to him and she snuggled comfortably into his embrace resting her head upon his shoulder it was their first real moment alone now that they had actually embarked upon this enterprise and the girl had given herself entirely into his hands now that an imminent peril encompassed them both johnnie felt that rosa belonged to him more absolutely more completely than at any time heretofore so he held her close he caressed her gently he voiced those tender intimate foolish thoughts which he had never dared express this velvet darkness this utter isolation seemed to unite them to feel the girls heart beating against his own and her breath warm upon his cheek was intensely thrilling an exquisite ardor inflamed him and rosa responded to it they resisted briefly prolonging the delights of this moment then her arms crept about him her lips met his in absolute surrender they began to whisper cautiously so as not to disturb the sleeping boy they became unconscious of the flight of time rosa lay relaxed against her lovers shoulder and in halting murmurs interrupted many times by caresses she told oreilly of her need for him and her utter happiness it was the fullest hour of their lives sometimes he thought she must be dozing but he was never sure for she answered to his lightest touch and awoke to the faintest pressure of his lips the night wore swiftly on and it was not long enough for either of them with daylight morin routed out his men there was a sleepy muttering the patter of bare feet upon the deck above then the creak of blocks as the sails were raised from forward came the sound of some one splitting wood to kindle the charcoal fire for breakfast other sailingcraft seemed to be getting under way and a fishingboat loaded with the nights catch came to anchor alongside the three brothers villar felt the schooner heel slightly and knew that she was stealing toward the spanish gunboat which was supposed to be on guard against precisely such undertakings as this a few moments then there came a hail which brought their hearts into their throats morin himself answered the call good morning countryman have you caught any of those accursed filibusters since i saw you last so cayo romano eh well they come in the night and they go in the night if i were the pilot of your ship id guarantee to put you where theyd fall into your arms for i know these waters what have i aboard morin laughed loudly you know very well cannon and shot for the rebels of course will you look no then a cup of coffee perhaps oreilly peeped through a dirtstained cabin window and saw that the volandra was slipping past the stern of the ironclad so he withdrew his head quickly in spite of his hospitable invitation captain morin made no move to come about but instead held his schooner on its course meanwhile exchanging shouts with the unseen speaker it seemed incredible that spanish discipline could be so lax that the schooner would be allowed to depart even for a coastwise run without some formalities of clearance but so it seemed evidently the spaniards had tired of examining these small craft it was typical of their carelessness of course this was but one danger past and there were many more ahead for morins schooner was liable to be stopped by any of the numerous patrolboats on duty to the eastward nevertheless when an anxious hour had gone by and she was well out toward the harbor mouth the refugees told one another they were safe morin shoved back the companionway hatch and thrust a grinning face into view ho there my lazy little cousins he cried wake up for i smell panchos coffee boiling xxviii three travelers come home esteban varona made slow progress toward recovery in the weeks following oreillys departure from cubitas his gain was steady but beyond a certain point he seemed unable to go then he began to lose strength norine was the first to realize the truth but it was some time before she would acknowledge it even to herself at last however she had to face the fact that estebans months of prison fare the abuse the neglect he had suffered in spanish hands had left him little more than a living corpse it seemed as if fever had burned him out or else some dregs of disease still lingered in his system and had all but quenched that elusive spark which for want of a better name we call vitality esteban too awoke to the fact that he was losing ground and his dismay was keen for a wonderful thing had come into his life and he spent much of his time in delicious contemplative day dreams concerning it waiting for the hour when he would dare translate those dreams into realities it seemed to him that he had always loved norine certainly she had enshrined herself in his heart long before his mind had regained its clarity for he had come out of his delirious wanderings with his love full grown there had been no conscious beginning to it he had emerged from darkness into dazzling glory all in an instant not until he found himself slipping backward did he attempt to set a guard upon himself for up to that hour he had never questioned his right to love he found his new task heavy almost too much for him to bear that he attempted it spoke well for the fellows strength of character the time came finally when he could no longer permit the girl to deceive herself or him with her brave assumption of cheerfulness norine had just told him that he was doing famously but he smiled and shook his weary head lets be honest he said you know and i know that i cant get well norine was engaged in straightening up the interior of the bark hut in which her patient was installed she ceased her labors to inquire with lifted brows tut tut pray what do you mean by that theres something desperately wrong with me and i realized it long ago so did you but your good heart wouldnt let you norine crossed quickly to the hammock and laid her cool hand upon the sick mans forehead you mustnt be discouraged she told him earnestly remember this is a trying climate and we have nothing to do with even the food is wretched estebans smile became wistful that isnt why my fever lasts if there were any life any health left in me you would rekindle it no theres something desperately wrong and were wasting time you simply mustnt talk like this she cried then at the look in his eyes she faltered for the briefest instant youll undo all that weve done oh if i had you where i could take proper care of you if we were anywhere but here youd see i believe you but unfortunately we are not elsewhere im going to take you away she exclaimed forcefully esteban stroked her hand softly you cant do that miss evans you have been wonderful to me and i cant begin to express my gratitude norine stirred but he retained his grasp of her fingers gaining courage from the contact to proceed i have been trying for a long time to tell you something will you listen norine possessed a dominant personality she had a knack of tactfully controlling and directing situations but of a sudden she experienced a panicstricken nutter and she lost her air of easy confidence not now she exclaimed with a visible lessening of color dont bother to tell me now ive waited too long i must speak norine was amazed at her own confusion which was nothing less than girlish she had actually gone to pieces at threat of something she had long expected to hear i know how tired of this work you have become the man was saying i know youre eager to get back to your own work and your own life well you have stayed on here just to nurse me isnt that true she nodded somewhat doubtfully now then you must stop thinking about me and make your arrangements to go home norine eyed the speaker queerly is that what you have been trying so long to tell me she inquired yes is that all there was a moment of silence yes you see i know how tired you are of this misery this poverty this hopeless struggle youre not a cuban and our cause isnt yours expeditions come from the united states every now and then and the government will see that you are put safely aboard the first ship that returns ill manage to get well somehow norines color had returned she stood over the hammock looking down mistily dont you need me want me any more she inquired esteban turned his tired eyes away fearing to betray in them his utter wretchedness you have done all there is to do i want you to go back into your own world and forget a sudden impulse seized the girl she stopped and gathered the sick man into her young strong arms dont be silly she cried my world is your world esteban dear ill never never leave you miss evans norine varona tried feebly to free himself you mustnt norine was laughing through her tears if you wont speak i suppose i must but it is very embarrassing dont you suppose i know exactly how much you love me why youve told me a thousand times please please he cried in a shaking voice this is wrong i wont let you you a girl with everything hush she drew him closer youre going to tell me that you have nothing can offer me nothing youre going to do the generous noble thing well i hate generous people im selfish utterly selfish and spoiled and i dont propose to be robbed of anything i want least of all my happiness you do love me dont you estebans cry was eloquent he clasped his arms about her and she held him fiercely to her breast well then why dont you tell me so i i cant keep on proposing it isnt ladylike were quite mad quite insane he told her after a while this only makes it harder to give you up youre not going to give me up and youre not going to die i shant let you think what you have to live for i did wrong to surrender it was i who surrendered come must i say it all arent you going to ask me what why to marry you of course esteban gasped he looked deeply into norines eyes then he closed his own he shook his head not that he whispered oh not that were going to be married and im going to take you out of this miserable place what happiness he murmured if i were well but i wont let you marry a dying man norine rose her face aglow with new strength new determination she dried her eyes and readjusted her hair with deft unconscious touch smiling down meanwhile at the man i brought you back when you were all but gone i saved you after the others had given you up and now you are mine to do with as i please you belong to me and i shant consult you she turned for a figure had darkened the door it was one of her englishspeaking convalescents who was acting as a sort of orderly senorita the man said with a flash of white teeth we have another sick man and youd never guess who it is that american el demonio mr branch si the very same he has just come from the front is he sick or wounded esteban inquired shot by a spanish bullet he asked at once for our senorita of course ill come in an instant when the messenger had gone norine bent and pressed her lips to estebans remember youre mine to do with as i please she said then she fled down the grassy street branch was waiting at norines quarters a soiled figure of dejection his left arm lay in a sling across his breast he looked up at her approach but she scarcely recognized him so greatly changed was he leslie had filled out there was a healthy color beneath his deep tan his flesh was firm his eyes clear and bright hello norine he cried well they got me norine paused in astonishment way leslie i was so frightened but you cant be badly hurt bad enough so that lopez sent me in a fellow gets flyblown if he stays in the field so i beat it has your arm been dressed no i wouldnt let these roughandtumble doctors touch it theyd amputate at the shoulder for a hangnail i dont trust em then ill look at it but leslie shrugged oh its feeling fine right now id rather leave it alone i just wanted to see you you mustnt neglect it theres danger of gee youre looking great he interrupted its better than a banquet just to look at you and you norine scanned the invalid appraisingly why youre another man sure listen to this he thumped his chest best pair of bellows in cuba the open air did it what a pity you were hurt just at such a time but you would take insane risks now then lets have a look at your wound she pushed him protesting into her cabin it doesnt hurt really he declared its only a scratch of course youd say so sit down please dont bother if you dont mind but i do mind if you wont trust me ill run for a doctor i tell you i cant stand em theyll probe around and give a fellow gangrene then behave yourself norine forced the patient into a chair and withdrew his arm from the sling then despite his weak resistance she deftly removed the bandage from his expression she felt sure that she must be hurting him but when the injury was exposed she looked up in wonderment leslie she exclaimed what in the world well you insisted on seeing it he grumbled i told you it wasnt much he tried to meet her eyes but failed there was a moments pause then norine inquired curiously what is the trouble youd better fess up branch struggled with himself he swallowed hard then said imgoing to you can see now why i didnt go to a doctor i did it shot myself you wont give me away why i dont understand oh im in trouble i simply had to get away and this was all i could think of i wanted to blow a real hole through myself and i tried three times but i missed myself missed yourself how why branch wiped the sweat from his face i flinched shut my eyes and pulled the trigger norine seated herself weakly she stared in bewilderment at the unhappy speaker afraid you el demonio why you arent afraid of anything say you dont believe all that stuff do you im afraid of my shadow and always have been im not brave and never was they told me i was going to die and it scared me so that i tried to end things quickly i couldnt bear to die slowly to know that i was dying by inches but lord it scared me even worse to go into battle i was blind with fright all the time and i never got over it why the sight of a gun gives me a chill and i jump every time one goes off god how ive suffered i went crazy at our first engagement crazy with fear i didnt know where i was or what happened or anything afterward when they hailed me as a hero i thought they were kidding that everybody must know how frightened i was after a time i saw that id fooled them and that shamed me then i had to keep it up or become ridiculous but it nearly killed me if youre speaking the truth im not sure youre such a coward as you make out norine said oh yes i am wait before i knew it i had a reputation then i had to live up to it the speaker groaned it wasnt so bad as long as i felt sure i was going to die anyhow but when i discovered i was getting well branch raised a pair of tragic eyes his tone changed ill tell you what cured me i scared myself well those bugs in my lungs died from suffocation for i never breathed as long as there was a spaniard in the same county with me one day i found that i couldnt cough if i tried i got strong i slept well and eat huh i gobbled my share of food and whined for more i stole what belonged to the others i began to enjoy myself to have fun life opened up nice and rosy i fell in love with my new self and the joy of living then i didnt want to die never had you understand except to cheat the bugs it gave me the horrors to think of the chances id taken to be strong to be healthy and free from pain to tear my food like a wild animal and to enjoy hard work was all new and strange and wonderful i was drunk with it to think of being cut down crippled reduced to the useless miserable thing i had been was intolerable i was twice as scared then as id ever been for i had more to lose you understand i forced myself to do the insane things expected of me when people were looking natural pride i suppose but when they werent looking oh how i dogged it i crawled on my belly and hid in holes like a snake how funny norine exclaimed youve got a blamed queer idea of humor branch flashed with a show of his former irritability and so you shot yourself yep i tried to select a good spot where it wouldnt hurt or prove too inconvenient but there isnt a place to spare on a fellows whole body he needs every inch of himself every minute i was going to shoot myself in the foot but my feet are full of bones and i saw myself on crutches the rest of my life why didnt you resign from the service you didnt regularly enlist and youve surely earned your discharge branch nodded i thought of that but ive gained a reputation that i dont deserve and strangely enough im madly jealous of it i thought if i were really shot by a regular bullet id be mourned as a hero and have a chance to walk out with colors flying i want to tell my children if i ever have any what a glorious man i was and how i helped to free cuba oh id lie like a thief to my own children now you see why i dont want a doctor theres only one thing i want and thats home leslie heaved a deep sigh gee im homesick so am i norine feelingly declared i think i understand how you feel and i cant blame you for wanting to live now that youve learned what a splendid thing life is if oreilly had been with me i think i could have managed somehow for he would have understood too i ill never go back to the front alone they can shoot me if they want to have you heard anything from him not a word cuba swallowed him up oh leslie it is a cruel country it is taking the best and the youngest i want to go away he smiled mirthlessly im fed up on it too i want to be where i can shave when i need to and wear something besides canvas pajamas im cured of war i want a policeman to stop the traffic and help me across the street i want to put my feet under a breakfasttable rustle a morning paper and slap an egg in the face thats all the excitement i hunger for norine filled a basin with clean water and taking a fresh bandage wrapped up the selfinflicted hurt branch watching her anxiously now and again he flinched like a child when she touched his wound at last he inquired apprehensively is it infected no lord im glad wouldnt it be just my luck to get blood poisoning norine surprised her patient by inquiring irrelevantly leslie is there anybody here who can marry people eh why of course then suddenly his somber face lightened and he cried norine do you mean it not you i wouldnt marry you why not im perfectly well please answer me leslie settled back in his chair i dare say some of the cuban cabinet officers could put up a good bluff at a marriage ceremony a bluff wouldnt do whos going to be married i am branch started to his feet once more his mouth fell open you nonsense when she nodded his face darkened who is he some cuban ill bet one of these greasers it is poor esteban poor esteban damn it theyre all poor thats the very reason he asked you hes after your money he didnt ask me i asked him hes dying leslie there was a pause im going to marry him and take him home where he can get well what will oreilly say im afraid well never see oreilly again cuba frightens me it has taken him it will take esteban and that would break my heart do you love him as much as that norine raised her eyes and in their depths branch read her answer well that ends the rest of us he sighed theres a minister of justice here i believe he sounds as if he could perform most any kind of a ceremony well find out for sure it so happened that the president and wellnigh the entire provisional cabinet were in cubitas leslie and norine went directly to the former the supreme official was eager to oblige in every way the guest of his government and her daredevil countryman el demonio he promptly sent for the minister of justice who in turn gallantly put himself at norines disposal he declared that although he had never performed the marriage ceremony he would gladly try his hand at it in no time the news had spread and there was subdued excitement throughout the camp when norine left headquarters she was the target of smiles and friendly greetings women nodded and chattered at her ragged soldiers swept her salutes with their jipijapa hats children clung to her and capered by her side it was vastly embarrassing this shameless publicity but it was touching too for there was genuine affection and goodwill behind every smile norine was between tears and laughter when she ran panting into estebans cabin leaving branch to wait outside at sight of her esteban uttered a low cry of happiness dearest ive been lying in a stupor of delight the world has become bright i hear people laughing what a change and how is el demonio hes all right hes waiting to see you but first ive arranged everything the president and his cabinet are coming to witness the ceremony esteban poised petrified upon his elbow his face was a study what have you arranged he managed to inquire sh h norine laid a finger upon his lips the guest of the republic is to be married today dignitaries magistrates nabobs are turning out in her honor they are shaving and borrowing clean shirts for the occasion the minister of justice has a brandnew pair of tan shoes and he has promised to wear them come rain or shine norine oh my dear quavered the sick man i cant let you do this mad thing think im ready for the grave this will make you well were going away when the very next expedition arrives but still varona protested no no who am i i have nothing to offer nothing to give im poorer than a peon thank goodness i can do all the giving ive never told you esteban but im quite rich holding the man away she smiled into his eyes yes richer than i have any right to be i had no need to come to cuba it was just the whim of an irresponsible spoiled young woman i gave a huge amount of money to the new york junta and thats why i was allowed to come youre not a a trained nurse oh dear no except when it amuses me to pretend how strange the invalid was dazed but after a moment he shook his head it is hard to say this but i dont know whether you really love me or whether your great heart has been touched you have learned my feelings and perhaps think in this way to make me well is that it no no im thoroughly selfish and must have what i want i want you so dont lets argue about it norine tenderly enfolded the weak figure in her arms you must you shall get well or i shall die too i havent the strength to refuse esteban murmured and yet how can i leave cuba what right have i to accept happiness and leave rosa this was a subject which norine dreaded a question to which she knew no answer she was not in a mood to discuss it and made no attempt to do so instead she laid the invalid upon his pillow saying leslie is waiting to wish you joy and a quick recovery may i ask him in she stepped to the door only to behold her late companion making off down the village street in great haste and evident excitement surprised offended she checked her impulse to call him back a moment then she stepped out into the full sunlight and stared after him for she saw that which explained his desertion approaching between the drunken rows of grass huts was a little knot of people even as norine watched it grew into a considerable crowd for men and women and children came hurrying from their tasks there were three figures in the lead a man and two boys and they walked slowly ploddingly as if weary from a long march norine decided that they were not villagers but ragged pacificos upon the verge of exhaustion she saw branch break into a swifter run and heard him shout something then through eyes suddenly dimmed she watched him fall upon the tallest of the three strangers and embrace him the crowd grew thicker it surrounded them esteban norine cried in a voice she scarcely recognized she retreated into the doorway with one hand upon her leaping heart esteban look some one has just arrived leslie has gone she cleared her vision with a shake of her head and her tongue grew thick with excitement theyre coming here yes its its oreilly young varona struggled from his hammock rosa he called loudly rosa norine ran and caught him or he would have fallen prone he pawed and fumbled in a weak attempt to free himself from her restraining arms a wildness was upon him he shook as if with palsy did he bring her with him is she here why dont you answer me rosa he began to mutter unintelligibly his vitality flared up and it was with difficulty that norine could hold him down his gaze fixed upon the square of sunlight framed by the low doorway was blazing with excitement to norine it seemed as if his spirit in the uncertainty of this moment was straining to leap forth in an effort to learn his sisters fate the crowd was near at hand now there came the scuffling of feet and murmur of many voices esteban fell silent he closed his hot bony hands upon norines wrists in a painful grip he bent forward his soul centered in his tortured eyes there came a shadow then in the doorway the figure of a man a tattered scarecrow of a man whose feet were bare and whose brown calves were exposed through flapping rags his breast was naked where thorns had tried to stay him his beard even his hair were matted and unkempt and the mud of many trails lay caked upon his garments it was oreilly he peered blinking into the obscurity then he turned and drew forward a frail hunchbacked boy whose face was almost a mulatto hue hand in hand they stepped into the hut and once again esteban varonas soul found outlet in his sisters name he held out his shaking hungry arms and the misshapen lad ran into them dumb with amazement blind with tears norine found herself staring upward into oreillys face and heard him saying i told you i would bring her home the next instant she lay upon his breast and sobs of joy were tearing at her xxix what happened at sundown the story of rosas rescue came slowly and in fragments for the news of oreillys return caused a sensation his recital was interrupted many times so numerous and so noisy did these diversions become that norine fearing for the welfare of her patient banished oreillys visitors and bore him and branch off to her own cabin leaving the brother and sister alone in the privacy of norines quarters oreilly finished telling her the more important details of his adventures he was wellnigh worn out but his two friends would not respect his weariness they were half hysterical with joy at his safety treating him like one returned from the dead so he rambled disjointedly through his tale he told them of his hazardous trip westward of his and jackets entrance into matanzas and of the distressing scenes they witnessed there when he had finished the account of his dramatic meeting with rosa his hearers eyes were wet the recital of the escape held them breathless as a matter of fact our getaway was ridiculously easy he said for we had luck at every turn regular irish luck im sure captain morin suspected that rosa wasnt a boy but he was perfectly foolish about jacket and tolerated us on his account we owe everything to that kid hes wonderful i made morin independent for life but it wasnt the money it was jacket who induced him to bring us clear to turiguano he landed us one night this side of the moron trocha since then weve waded swamps to our armpits weve fought the jungle and chewed bark but were here johnnie heaved a deep sigh of relief where did you get the money to hire schooners and corrupt captains branch inquired you were broke when i knew you oreilly hesitated he lowered his voice to a whisper we found the varona treasure norine uttered a cry not don estebans treasure exactly it was in the well where young esteban told us it was oh johnnie you mean thing exclaimed the girl you promised youll have a chance to dig he laughed we couldnt begin to bring all of it we merely took the jewels and the deeds and what money our clothes would hold the rest wait wait branch wailed clapping his hand to his head merely the jewels and the deeds and what money our clothes would hold bullets why one suit of clothes will hold all the money in the world am i dreaming money i havent seen a bonafide dollar since i put on long pants what does money look like is it round or johnnie produced from his pocket a handful of coins branchs eyes bulged he touched a gold piece respectfully weighed it carefully then pressed it to his lips he rubbed it against his cheeks and in his hair he placed it between his teeth and bit it its real he cried now let me look at the jewels rosa has them shes wearing them on her back hunched backs are lucky you know hers is worth a fortune why this beats the arabian nights norine gasped it beats branch paused then wagged his head warningly at the girl i dont believe a word of it and you mustnt johnnie read this story on his yachtingtrip it couldnt happen in the first place there isnt any more money in the world mints have quit coining it why if i wrote such a yarn it is almost unbelievable johnnie acknowledged i found aladdins cave but his face paled and he stirred uneasily it was nearly the death of all of us ill have to tell you the whole story now ive only told you the half while his hearers listened petrified with amazement and doubting their ears he recited the incidents of that unforgettable night on la cumbre how cobo came and of the trap he sprung how jacket stole upon the assassin while he knelt and of the blow he struck when johnnie had finished there was a long moment of silence then norine quavered tremulously that boy that blessed boy branch murmured feebly dash water in my face or youll lose me i you he found no words to express his feelings and finally voiced his favorite expletive its all too weirdly improbable oreilly smiled but ask rosa or jacket the boy is bursting to tell some one he nearly died because he couldnt brag about it to captain morin and there wont be any holding him now im afraid hell tip off the news about that treasure in spite of all my warnings those jewels are a temptation i wont rest easy until theyre safely locked up in some good vault now then ive told you everything but im dying for news tell me about yourselves about esteban i expected to find him well what ails him oh johnnie norine began hes very ill he isnt getting well something in her tone caused oreilly to glance at her sharply branch nodded and winked significantly and the girl confessed with a blush yes you told me id surrender to some poor broken fellow im very happy and im very sad hunh hes far from poor and broken leslie corrected with a halfinterest in a humpful of diamonds and a goldplated well according to baron munchausen here this is the cuban leapyear johnnie norine proposed to him and he was too far gone to refuse you came just in time to interrupt a drumhead marriage is it true when norine acquiesced oreilly pressed her two hands in his im glad so glad tears started to the girls eyes her voice broke wretchedly help me johnnie help me to get him home he patted her reassuringly and she took comfort from his hearty promise of course i will well take him and rosa away where they can forget cuba and all the misery it has caused them well make him well dont worry meanwhile at this moment rosa needs food and clothing and so do i as the three friends walked up the street they discovered jacket holding the center of an interested crowd of his countrymen it was the boys moment and he was making the most of it swollen with selfimportance he was puffing with relish at a gigantic gift cigar i exaggerate nothing he was saying loudly oreilly will tell you that i killed cobo alone and unassisted the man is gone he has disappeared and all matanzas is mystified this is the hand that did it yonder is the weapon with that butchers blood still on it that knife will be preserved in the museum at habana along with my statue jacket spied his chief witness and called to him tell these good people who killed cobo was it narciso villar it was oreilly smiled the fellow is dead there was renewed murmuring the crowd pressed jacket closer they passed the knife from hand to hand doubters fell silent the boy swelled visibly bantamlike he strutted before their admiring glances and when his benefactor had passed safely out of hearing he went on god what a fight we had it was like those combats of the gladiators you hear about the man was brave enough theres no denying his courage which was like that of ten men like that of a fierce bull but i i was superb magnificent the man bellowed he roared he grunted he charged me flinging the earth high with his heels but i was banderillero picador and matador in one i was here i was there i was everywhere so swiftly did i move that no eye could follow me jacket illustrated his imaginary movements with agile leaps and bounds the terror of his name frightened me ill admit but it lent me a desperate courage too i thought of the brave men the good women the innocent children he had slain and i fell upon him from this side from that side from the front from the rear i pricked him shouting that for the people of las villas this for the women of the san juan and once again for the babies you have killed jacket carried out his pantomime by prodding with a rigid finger first one then another of his listeners oh he went mad like a bull indeed but i was another rafael guerra he shed rivers of blood the ground grew slippery and the grass became red he stood rocking in his tracks finally his breath was like a hurricane he was exhausted he was covered with foam his limbs were made of lead it was my moment for all your sins i cried and with that i drove yonder blade through his heart and out between his shoulders thus my brothers his flesh was rotten and the steel clove it as if it were butter jacket was more than gratified at the effect of his recital for children screamed women shuddered and men turned shocked eyes upon one another he realized that with a little further practice and a more diligent attention to detail he could horrify the stoutesthearted listener nay cause hysterical women to swoon he concluded his account in a studiously careless tone oreilly came too late but he helped me to bury the offal we flung it head first into an old well and dumped rocks upon it there it will lie until cuba is free that my friends was the end of cobo exactly as it happened oreilly saw little of his sweetheart that day for norine promptly bore the girl off to her own quarters and there attended to her needs the most pressing of which was clothing norines wardrobe offered little to choose from but between them they reduced a nurses uniform to fit the smaller figure meanwhile with a rapidity and a thoroughness delightful to both of them the two girls came to know each other while oreilly was similarly engaged in making himself presentable he and branch talked earnestly with the result that they repaired later to general gomez the general welcomed them he listened with interest to oreillys story of the rescue and to the account of conditions in matanzas oreilly concluded by saying ive done what i came to do sir but miss varona is badly shaken by all she has been through shes very nervous and far from well esteban too isnt recovering general gomez nodded miss evans declares he must have a change and we have arranged to send him out of the country his sister poor child should go too when can they leave who knows not for some time certainly expeditions are irregular they should go at once oreilly said positively thats why we came to see you let us branch and me take all three of them to the united states you too el demonio inquired the general yes sir if you please but how how can you take two women and a sick man well manage somehow oreilly declared it isnt far across to the bahama banks true thats the route of our underground our undersea railroad as you probably know there is a venturesome countryman of yours who carries our despatches by that way he devised the scheme to keep us in touch with our friends in new york and he has done us great service he comes and goes in a small boat but how or when nobody knows the spanish patrols are on the lookout for him and theres a price on his head so you wont find it easy or safe to cross beware that you are not mistaken for him do you mean that we may go branch eagerly inquired the general hesitated whereupon oreilly spoke up for my part ill agree to come back if you so desire gomez shook his white head no you came to find and to save your fiancee and you volunteered to serve with us while you were doing so we have no desire to keep any man against his will some one must escort miss evans who is our guest why not you two she has every confidence in you and if she chooses to risk this enterprise rather than wait until we can guarantee her an easier trip we shall not restrain her i shall see that you reach the coast safe and sound beyond that you must trust in god branch was immensely relieved he joined volubly in oreillys thanks and became careless of his arm which no longer appeared to pain him peace with honor it seemed was all that he desired i was looking forward to an interesting ceremony this afternoon gomez went on has your arrival changed the plans oh no sir oreilly said quickly id like to make it doubly interesting if miss varona will consent to such short notice bravo you have a way of doing the unexpected twin births a double wedding why not the sight of a little happiness will be good for all of us were apt to forget that life and the big world are going on as usual i dont think miss varona will have it in her heart to refuse you anything the old soldier was right rosa did not gainsay her lover and toward sundown the city among the leaves witnessed an unaccustomed scene the women of the camp delighted at an opportunity of serving norine had transformed estebans poor quarters into a tiny bower of wild blossoms and green leaves they likewise gathered flowers for the two bridestobe then joined with nimble fingers in adorning their costumes when the girls came down the street hand in hand they received an ovation from men and women alike norine was pleased she smiled and blushed and ran the gantlet bravely enough but rosa sadly overwrought by the days excitement was upon the verge of a collapse nevertheless she was happy her eyes were shining her face was transfigured her hand when she took oreillys was cold and tremulous but it warmed and grew steady under his grasp many people all cubitas in fact had assembled to witness the romantic double wedding but few actually succeeded for estebans hut was too small to accommodate more than the highest officials of the provisional government so the others were forced to wait outside in the gathering dusk and those ministers those secretaries of departments those generals and colonels what a motley crowd they formed there was scarcely a whole garment among them they were sunburnt windbrowned earnest men the old ones grayed and grizzled from worry the younger ones wasted from hardships in the field but out of their rags and poverty shone a stately courtesy and consideration they were gentlemen men of culture and refinement the best and oldest blood of cuba both norine and johnnie had learned their gratitude and the story of the varona twins was typical of the island nowadays so they unbent and there were warm congratulaitons wellturned latin pleasantries elaborate compliments upon the beauty of the brides then afterward there was a surprise a genuine surprise in the form of a banquet at the big mess shelter with an orchestra concealed behind a screen of freshcut palmleaves stuck into the soft earth this was the mens part of the celebration the official compliment to cubas guest it was a poorly furnished banquet with a service of tin and granite ware and chipped china and there was little to eat but the true spirit of festivity was present the lone star emblem of the new republic was draped with the stars and stripes and there were many speeches norines protests at leaving esteban went unheeded and leslie branch escorted her in place of the bridegroom who lay blissfully dreaming in his hammock her amazement passed all bounds when from the hidden recess behind the palmleaves came not the music of mandolins and guitars but the strains of a balanced orchestra under the leadership of cubas most eminent bandmaster whence the players had come where they had found their instruments was a mystery but they played well divinely so it seemed to the musichungry diners such a banquet as that was some one had contributed a demijohn of wine and there was coffee too at the last made from the berries of some jungle plant the chef once famous at the inglaterra was forced to appear and take homage for this final triumph rosa very dainty in her borrowed nurses uniform was roundeyed timid she evoked much admiration but when she was addressed as senora oreilly she blushed to the roots of her hair and shrank close to her husbands side to feel herself secure to see on all sides friendly faces to know that these fine men and women there were numerous good cuban matrons present were her own people and meant her well was almost unbelievable she had so long been hidden she had so long feared every strangers glance it was not strange that she felt ill at ease and that the banquet was a grave ordeal for her branch proved to be a happy choice as estebans proxy for he relieved norines anxiety and smothered her apprehensions when called upon to speak he made a hit by honestly expressing his relief at escaping the further hazards of this war prompted by some freakish perversity and perhaps unduly stimulated by the wine he had drunk he made open confession of his amazing cowardice oreilly interpreted for him and wellnigh every sentence evoked laughter el demonios heroic reputation had preceded him therefore his unsmiling effort to ridicule himself struck the audience as a new and excruciatingly funny phase of his eccentricity encountering this blank wall of disbelief branch waxed more earnest more convincing in melancholy detail he described his arrant timidity his cringing fear of pain his abhorrence of blood and steel his elongated face was genuinely solemn his voice trembled his brow grew damp with unpleasant memories he seemed bent upon clearing his conscience once for all but he succeeded only in convulsing his hearers women giggled men wiped tears from their eyes and declared he was a consummate actor and the rarest the most fantastic humorist they had ever listened to they swore that cuba had lost in him a peerless champion when he had finished they cheered him loudly and the orchestra broke into a rousing military march leslie turned to voice his irritation and surprise to norine but she had slipped away so he glared at oreilly wondering how the latter had so artfully managed to mistranslate his remarks when rosa and oreilly returned to estebans cabin they found norine ahead of them she was kneeling beside the sick mans hammock and through the doorway came the low intimate murmur of their voices rosa drew her husband away whispering happily he will get well god and that wonderful girl wont let him die xxx the owl and the pussycat the journey to the coast was made by easy stages and esteban stood it fairly well the excitement wore upon him to be sure and the jolting of his litter was trying but norine was always at his side where he could see her and rosa joined in the tender care of him guides horses and a tent for the sick man had been supplied and over these oreilly exercised a jealous watchfulness ably seconded by branch for once at least the latter lent himself to useful ends and shirked no duties his wounded arm recovered miraculously and he exercised it freely he skirmished industriously for food and he enlivened the journey by a rare display of good spirits jacket of course went along upon the announcement of oreillys intended departure for the states he had promptly abandoned cuba to her fate he foreswore her utterly and declared himself a loyal american citizen he made it plain once more and for the last time that where oreilly went there went he for they were one and indivisible it dismayed him not at all to turn his feet to new pathways his face toward new adventures relying upon the best information obtainable at cubitas oreilly had counted upon securing a sailboat from a certain fisherman whose sympathies were known to be loyal but in this he was disappointed the party arrived at its destination a tiny clearing on an unfrequented part of the north shore only to find it deserted and already grown to weeds the house was empty the boats were gone all but one old hulk too rotten to warrant moving which lay high up on the sand its planks wormeaten its seams wide spread by the sun having established esteban in the hut oreilly took counsel with his cubans but gained little satisfaction from them they knew of no other fisherman in this vicinity the nearest towns were in spanish hands they advised a return to cubitas at once this oreilly would not listen to sending them in one direction he took leslie and jacket and rode away in the other the trio followed the beach for several miles until they came to a vast mangrove swamp which turned them inland this they skirted until the jungle became impassable and they were in danger of losing themselves they returned at dusk having encountered no human being and having discovered neither roads nor houses the other expedition reported slightly better successes it had located a small plantation some distance to the east the owner of which had warned them against exploring farther inasmuch as a strong spanish patrol on the lookout for that american despatchbearer from nassau was operating in his neighborhood it was these very troops he announced who had driven the fisherman from his home he was sure there were no boats anywhere within reach oreilly was in a quandary he gravely doubted estebans ability to stand the rough return journey and when he spoke to norine of turning back she was panicstricken at the suggestion no no she cried anxiously we must get him away oh johnnie every day we lose by waiting lessens his chances his heart is set on going through and it would kill him to go back then i guess well have to go through he smiled for the first time in their acquaintance norine lost control of herself we simply must find a boat all he needs is proper care proper food and medical attention here we can get nothing why the disappointment alone her voice failed her tears started to her eyes and she began to tremble wretchedly if he if i lose him ill die too she sobbed oreilly tried to comfort her and she bowed her head upon his shoulder promise that you wont go back she implored him very well if youll consent to risk this miserable tub we found on the beach ill risk anything a raft even it is large enough to carry us if we can manage to make it hold water but it wont be safe the weather is good at this season and it shouldnt take us long to run across to andros if we have luck if we dont have luck norine dried her eyes what would you do if you were alone would you dare try it he hesitated then confessed i think i would but is there an even chance of our getting across perhaps it all depends upon the weather cant we build a boat he shook his head even if we had lumber and tools it would take too long ten miles to the east there are spaniards we must do one thing or the other quickly before they learn were here then lets go on im sure rosa will agree rosa did agree when her husband put the question fairly to her she showed by the pallor of her cheeks and by the rekindling light of terror in her eyes how desperately she feared remaining longer in this land of hate and persecution dont turn back she cried im not the girl i was ive endured so much here that im always in fear anything would be better than going back when morning came oreilly made a closer examination of the abandoned boat the result was not encouraging and when he told leslie of his intention to make use of it the latter stared at him in open amazement why well all be drowned branch declared you can return to cubitas if you wish yes and fight some more no thank you ive got a hunch that ill be killed by the very next gun i see then youd better risk the sharks jacket who was conducting an independent examination of the craft made an encouraging report ho id go round the world in this boat said he shes rotten and you can stick your finger through her but fish have no fingers when the water comes in well dip it out do you want to go with us johnnie eyed the newspaper man curiously i y yes branch gasped ill go but its a shame to lose all of rosas diamonds oreilly and one of the guides rode away to the farmhouse discovered on the previous afternoon and returned in a few hours with all the tools they could find together with a bucket of tar and a coil of galvanized wire then work began the wire cut into short pieces served as nails and staples with which to draw together the gaping seams old rags from the house and parts of the mens clothing supplied calking upon which the tar was smeared while one man shaped mast and oars another cut estebans shelter tent into a sail and fitted it a stiff sundried cowhide was wet then stretched and nailed to the gunwales at the bow forming a sort of forward deck to shelter the sick man from the sun and rain jacket climbed the nearby cocoapalms and threw down a plentiful supply of nuts for food and water on the voyage with so many hands the work went fast and late that evening the crazy craft was launched it was necessary to handle her gingerly and when she took the water she leaked abominably but during the night she swelled and in the morning it was possible to bail her out oreilly had to acknowledge himself but poorly pleased with the boat branch called her a coffin and declared it was suicide to venture to sea in her an opinion shared by the cubans but the girls were enchanted to them this fragile bark looked stout and worthy they were in a fever to be gone on the second afternoon the tradewind died to a gentle zephyr so the cocoanuts and other food were quickly put aboard a bed of bows was rigged beneath the rawhide forecastle and esteban was laid upon it then adieux were said and a start was made from the point of leaving it was perhaps five miles across the sound to the fringe of keys which in this neighborhood bordered the old bahama channel with its unplumbed depths of blue water here it was calm so the run was soon made the boat handled well enough all things considered nevertheless to oreilly her navigator it was an anxious hour not only was he forced to keep a sharp lookout for blockading gunboats but he feared he was doing wrong in committing his precious freight to the uncertainties of the atlantic even had he been alone with a crew of able sailors under him this voyage would have daunted him for it was without doubt the wildest adventure in which he had ever participated when he hinted at these fears and put the matter before his companions for a final test branch refused to speak but esteban and the girls were earnestly in favor of pushing on jacket of course loudly seconded them at sunset they entered a pass and ran between low mangrove banks the tide was ebbing and it hurried them through and out into the open sea where they felt the lift of the mighty ocean swell over these slow undulations the sailboat plowed heading toward the empty northern horizon with the kindling pole star as a beacon the sky was clear the sea was gently roughened by the night breeze the constellations grew bright and appeared to hang low when the coastline of cuba had become a blur astern rosa crept back and seated herself beside her husband i breathe freely for the first time since that day when don mario came to offer me marriage she told him the past is beginning to seem like a bad bad dream and i feel a great hope a great gladness i am reborn orailye a few hours more and we can all breathe easy he smiled down at her she laid her small palm over his fingers which grasped the steeringoar whereupon he cried with pretended sternness avast there dont distract the attention of the skipper or hell sail his boat in circles look out or hell send you below rosa persisted mutinously so he punished her with a kiss planted fairly upon her pouting lips whereupon she nestled closer to him how much i love you she whispered but i never can tell you for we are never alone was there ever such a courtship such a marriage and such a wedding journey as ours were the owl and the pussycat who went to sea in a beautiful peagreen boat with plenty of honey and lots of money wrapped up in a tenpound note some day when weve settled down in our harlem flat and im working hard well look back on this and consider it romantic thrilling maybe well long for excitement not i rosa shivered to be safe to have you all to myself where i can spoil you that will be excitement enough well rent that little apartment i looked at or one just like it but orailye were rich i id forgotten that then lets pretend to be poor think how our neighbors would talk about that pretty mrs oreilly on the fourth floor and her magnificent jewels theyd swear i was a smuggler as the evening lengthened and the boat forged steadily ahead the two sat murmuring happily forward another bride and groom were similarly engaged branch and jacket took turns bailing it proved to be a long long night for the boat though roomy was uncomfortable oreilly steered as straight a course as he could without compass but toward morning he saw that the sky was growing overcast and his apprehensions stirred anew daylight brought an increased breeze which heeled the boat further she made better speed but she likewise took more water through her seams and it became necessary to lend leslie and jacket a hand with the bailing the deep channel was far behind now and they were on the shallow bahama banks beneath them they could glimpse beds of sponges patches of coral white bottom with occasional forests of brillianthued sea fans the horizon still remained vacant and the tip of andros lay far to the north fortunately the haze was not thick enough to wholly obscure the sun and so oreilly was enabled to hold his course but he did not like the look of things by ten oclock the sea was tumbling and the wormeaten hulk was laboring it became necessary to shorten sail soon the bottom of the boat was awash and esteban lay in a pool of brine even when the girls helped to dip it out they could not lower its level the wind freshened steadily all hands worked desperately wet to the skin in time there came a spiteful drizzle which completely hid the sun and left no indication of the course except the direction whence drove the rain no one spoke now even esteban lay silent shivering miserably upon his sodden bed in obedience to oreillys command jacket flung overboard all but a halfdozen of the remaining cocoanuts rosa finally straightened her aching back and smiled at her husband are we going down she asked oh no this is merely a squall he told her with an assumption of confidence he was far from feeling johnnie tried to reason himself into a more hopeful frame of mind he assured himself that he and his companions had survived too many perils to become the prey of an idle breeze like this he argued that no fate could be so cruel as to cheat them when they were so close to safety but this manful effort brought him little comfort in the face of the chilling rain and with the whitecaps curling higher deliverance came suddenly and from the leastexpected quarter out of the mist to starboard there materialized a shape a schooner driving ahead of the wind the refugees descried her simultaneously and stood ankle deep in the wash waving their hats and their calabashes and shouting crazily until she saw them and fetched up intense thanksgiving a melting relief robbed oreilly of half his strength his hands were shaking his muscles weak he could barely bring his craft alongside he saw black faces staring down he heard cries of amazement and surprised inquiries then a heavingline came aboard and the leaky tub was drawn close there was a babble of voices shouted questions hysterical answers rosa was weeping softly norine had lifted esteban and now clutched him tight while her tears fell upon his face the schooner was a sponger bound for nassau its blackbird crew spoke english and they willingly helped the strangers overside laughing and shouting in a childlike display of excitement how firm how grateful was the feel of that stout deck how safe the schooners measured roll oreillys knees gave way he clutched with strained and aching fingers at the rigging to support himself leaving branch and jacket to tell the surprising story of their presence here soon there was hot food and coffee dry beds and blankets for those who needed them johnnie tucked his bride snugly into one of the hard berths then stooped and kissed her rosas teeth were chattering but she smiled happily gods hand directed us she said one only needs to pray long enough and strong enough and he will hear it was a month later quaint old nassau lay dozing under an afternoon sun its wide shell streets its low houses the beach against which it crowded were dazzling white as if the town had been washed clean then spread out to bleach upon the horizon jay tumbled foamy cloud masses like froth blown thither from the scene of the cleansing a breeze caused the surface of the harbor to dance and dimple merrily the sound of laughter came from the waterfront where barefoot spongers and fishermen were busy with their boats and gear robust negresses with deep bosoms and rolling hips balanced baskets and trays upon their heads and stood gossiping with one another or exchanging shouts with their men across the water there was noise here but the town as a whole was somnolent peaceful it sprawled beside the sea like a lazy man lost in day dreams and lulled by the lapping surf and the hum of insects up from the beach came oreilly and his youthful alter ego jacket they were clad in clean white clothes a month of rest had done them good jacket was no longer wizened he was plump and sleek and as full of mischief as a colt while oreillys leanness had disappeared and he filled his garments as a man should they had spent the day fishing on the reefs and now bore home the choicest part of their catch they turned in through a picket gate and up a walk flanked by flowerbeds and outlined between rows of inverted glass bottles set side by side the bahama idea of neatness and beauty at the end of the walk stood a cottage with wide porches hidden beneath jasmine and honeysuckle and morningglory vines oreillys eyes were shining with anticipation he yodeled loudly but there was no need for him to advertise his return for at the first click of the gatelatch a figure had started from the fragrant bower and now came flying to meet him look rosa jacket lifted the heavy string of fish we had stupendous luck but rosa was in her husbands arms and neither she nor oreilly had eyes for anything but each other you were gone for ages pouted the bride you missed me eh see i caught the biggest ones as usual jacket boasted im a skilful fisherman and i talk to my hook but oreilly sits dreaming about somebody while the little crabs eat all his bait when this evoked no notice the boy shrugged in disgust and went on around the house muttering caramba youd think theyd get sick of so much billing and cooing but no i have to steal him away and take him swimming or fishing if i want a word alone with him and the others are just as bad another pair of pigeons its like living in a dovecote rosa too had vastly changed she was clad in a charming little muslin dress there were dimples in her cheeks she wore a heavy mardchal neil bud at her breast oreilly held her off and devoured her with his eyes sweetheart you grow fresher and more beautiful every hour said he rosa danced upon her toes and tugged at him but come quickly and see the surprise we have ive been wild for your return so hurry she led him swiftly up the steps and there standing beside a chair was esteban varona he dressed himself and walked out here alone hes well esteban really the brother nodded decisively its true i rebelled at last tomorrow ill walk to the gate and the next day well go fishing jove how splendid why im as firm on my feet as a rock norine emerged through one of the french windows and explained he took advantage of me while i was gone for the mail and now hes quite out of control heres a letter from leslie by the way hes home and has a position and hopes well follow soon theres one bit of news he says the talk of intervention increases and he may have to return to cuba as a war correspondent fancy hes deathly frightened at the prospect intervention that would be fine esteban cried oreilly nodded oh its bound to come and when uncle sam takes hold cuba will be free norine agreed im sure of it and then well all go back to our rainbows end and dig for that pot of gold esteban turned adoring eyes upon the speaker he took her hand in his ive found my rainbows end said he and ive found mine oreilly asserted ive gained your fathers treasure and more ive found the prize of all the indies with his arm about rosa he drew her into the house esteban lowered himself into his chair and norine rested herself upon its arm he lay back with eyes closed from the regions at the rear came the voice of jacket the boy was in a declamatory mood he had gathered an audience as was his daily custom and was addressing them in english i skilled moren a dozen spaniards at pino bravo it was my day by rights i should have been made a general but the end
