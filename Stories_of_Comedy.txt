samuel ferguson johnny darbyshire william howitt the gridiron samuel lover the box tunnel charles reade barny oreirdon the navigator by samuel lover i outward bound barny oreirdon was a fisherman of kinsale and a heartier fellow never hauled a net nor cast a line into deep water indeed barny independently of being a merry boy among his companions a lover of good fun and good whiskey was looked up to rather by his brother fishermen as an intelligent fellow and few boats brought more fish to market than barny oreirdons his opinion on certain points in the craft was considered law and in short in his own little community barny was what is commonly called a leading man now your leading man is always jealous in an inverse ratio to the sphere of his influence and the leader of a nation is less incensed at a rivals triumph than the great man of a village if we pursue this descending scale what a desperately jealous person the oracle of oysterdredges and cocklewomen must be such was barny oreirdon seated one night at a public house the common resort of barny and other marine curiosities our hero got entangled in debate with what he called a strange sail that is to say a man he had never met before and whom he was inclined to treat rather magisterially upon nautical subjects at the same time the stranger was equally inclined to assume the high hand over him till at last the newcomer made a regular outbreak by exclaiming ah tareandouns lave aff your balderdash mr oreirdon by the powdhers o war its enough so it is to make a dog bate his father to hear you goin an as if you war curlumberus or sir crustyphiz wran when ivery one knows the divil a farther you iver war nor ketchin crabs or drudgen oysters who towld you that my watherford wondher rejoined barny what the dickens do you know about sayfarin farther nor fishin for sprats in a bowl wid your grandmother o baithershin says the stranger and who made you so bowld with my name demanded oreirdon no matther for that said the stranger but if youd like for to know shure its your own cousin molly mullins knows me well and maybe i dont know you and yours as well as the mother that bore you aye in throth and sure i know the very thoughts o you as well as if i was inside o you barny oreirdon by my sowl thin you know betther thoughts than your own mr whippersnapper if thats the name you go by no its not the name i go by ive as good a name as your own mr oreirdon for want of a betther and thats osullivan throth theres more than theres good o them said barny good or bad im a cousin o your own twice removed by the mothers side and is it the widda osullivans boy youd be that left this come candlemas four years the same throth thin you might know better manners to your eldhers though im glad to see you anyhow agin but a little thravellin puts us beyant ourselves sometimes said barny rather contemptuously throth i nivir bragged out o myself yit and its what i say that a man thats only fishin aff the land all his life has no business to compare in the regard o thracthericks wid a man that has sailed to fingal this silenced any further argument on barnys part where fingal lay was all greek to him but unwilling to admit his ignorance he covered his retreat with the usual address of his countrymen and turned the bitterness of debate into the cordial flow of congratulation at seeing his cousin again the liquor was frequently circulated and the conversation began to take a different turn in order to lead from that which had very nearly ended in a quarrel between oreirdon and his relation the state of the crops county cess road jobs etc became topics and various strictures as to the utility of the latter were indulged in while the merits of the neighboring farmers were canvassed why thin said one that field o whate o michael coghlan is the finest field o whate mortial eyes was ever set upon divil the likes iv it myself ever seen far or near throth thin sure enough said another it promises to be a fine crap anyhow and myself cant help thinkin it quare that mikee coghlan thats a plainspoken quite quiet man and simple like should have finer craps than pether kelly o the big farm beyant that knows all about the great saycrets o the airth and is knowledgeable to a degree and has all the hard words that iver was coined at his fingers ends faith he has a power o blasthogue about him sure enough said the former speaker if that could do him any good but he isnt fit to hould a candle to michael coghlan in the regard o farmin why blur and agers rejoined the upholder of science sure he met the scotch steward that the lord beyant has one day that i hear is a wondherful edicated man and was brought over here to show us all a patthern well pether kelly met him one day and by gor he discoorsed him to a degree that the scotch chap hadnt a word left in his jaw well and what was he the betther o having more prate than a scotchman asked the other why answered kellys friend i think it stands to rayson that the man that done out the scotch steward ought to know somethin more about farmin than mikee coghlan augh dont talk to me about knowing said the other rather contemptuously sure i gev in to you that he has a power o prate and the gift o the gab and all to that i own to you that he has theory and chemisthery but he hasnt the craps now the man that has the craps is the man for my money youre right my boy said oreirdon with an approving thump of his brawny fist upon the table its a little talk goes far doin is the thing ah yiz may run down larnin if yiz like said the undismayed stickler for theory versus practice but larnin is a fine thing and sure where would the world be at all only for it sure where would the staymers steamboats be only for larnin well said oreirdon and the divil may care if we never seen them id rather depind an wind and canvas any day than the likes o them what are they good for but to turn good sailors into kitchenmaids bilin a big pot o wather and oilin their fireirons and throwin coals an the fire augh thim staymers is a disgrace to the say theyre for all the world like old fogies smokin from mornin till night and doin no good do you call it doin no good to go fasther nor ships iver wint before pooh sure solomon queen o sheba said there was time enough for all things thrue for you said osullivan fair and aisy goes far in a day is a good ould sayin well maybe youll own to the improvement theyre makin in the harbor o howth beyant in dublin is some good well see whether itll be an improvement first said the obdurate oreirdon why man alive sure youll own its the greatest o good it is takin up the big rocks out o the bottom o the harbor well an wheres the wondher o that sure we done the same here o yis but it was whin the tide was out and the rocks was bare but up at howth they cut away the big rocks from undher the say intirely o be aisy why how could they do that aye theres the matther thats what larnin can do and wondherful it is intirely and the way it is is this as i hear it for i never seen it but heerd it described by the lord to some gintlemin and ladies one day in his garden where i was helpin the gardener to land some salary celery you see the ingineer goes down undher the wather intirely and can stay there as long as he plazes whoo and what o that sure i heered the long sailor say that come from the aystern injees that the ingineers there can amost live under wather and goes down looking for diamonds and has a sledgehammer in their hand brakin the diamonds when theyre too big to take them up whole all as one as men brakin stones an the road well i dont want to go beyant that but the way the lords ingineer goes down is he has a little bell wid him and while he has that little bell to ring hurt nor harm cant come to him arrah be aisy divil a lie in it maybe its a blissed bell said oreirdon crossing himself no it is not a blissed bell why thin now do you think me sich a born nathral as to give in to that as if the ringin iv the bell barrin it was a blissed bell could do the like i tell you its unpossible ah nothin s unpossible to god sure i wasnt denyin that but i say the bell is unpossible why said osullivan you see hes not altogether complete in the demonstheration o the mashine it is not by the ringin o the bell it is done but but what broke in oreirdon impatiently do you mane for to say there is a bell in it at all at all yis i do said osullivan i towld you so said the promulgator of the story aye said osullivan but it is not by the ringin iv the bell it is done well how is it done then said the other with a halfoffended halfsupercilious air it is done said osullivan as he returned the look with interest it is done entirely by jommethry oh i understan it now said oreirdon with an inimitable affectation of comprehension in the oh but to talk of the ringin iv a bell doin the like is beyant the beyants intirely barrin as i said before it was a blissed bell glory be to god and so you tell me sir it is jommethry said the twicediscomfited man of science yis sir said osullivan with an air of triumph which rose in proportion as he carried the listeners along with him jommethry well have it your own way theres them that wont hear rayson sometimes nor have belief in larnin and you may say its jommethry if you plaze but i heerd them that knows betther than iver you knew say whisht whisht and bad cess to you both said oreirdon what the dickens are yiz goin to fight about now and sich good liquor before yiz hillo there mrs quigley bring uz another quart i you plaze aye thats the chat another quart augh yiz may talk till yore black in the face about your invintions and your staymers and bell ringin and gash and railroads but heres long life and success to the man that invinted the impairil imperial quart that was the rail beautiful invintion and he took a long pull at the replenished vessel which strongly indicated that the increase of its dimensions was a very agreeable measure to such as barny after the introduction of this and other quarts it would not be an easy matter to pursue the conversation that followed let us therefore transfer our story to the succeeding morning when barny oreirdon strolled forth from his cottage rather later than usual with his eyes bearing eye witness to the carouse of the preceding night he had not a headache however whether it was that barny was too experienced a campaigner under the banners of bacchus or that mrs quigleys boast was a just one namely that of all the drink in her house there wasnt a headache in a hogshead of it is hard to determine but i rather incline to the strength of barnys head barny sauntered about in the sun at which he often looked up under the shelter of compressed bushy brows and longlashed eyelids and a shadowing hand across his forehead to see what o day it was and from the frequency of this action it was evident the day was hanging heavily with barny he retired at last to a sunny nook in a neighboring field and stretching himself at full length basked in the sun and began to chew the cud of sweet and bitter thought he first reflected on his own undoubted weight in his little community but still he could not get over the annoyance of the preceding night arising from his being silenced by osullivan a chap as he said himself that lift the place four years agon a brat iv a boy and to think iv his comin back and outdoin his elders that saw him runnin about the place a gassoon that one could tache a few months before twas too bad barny saw his reputation was in a ticklish position and began to consider how his disgrace could be retrieved the very name of fingal was hateful to him it was a plaguespot on his peace that festered there incurably he first thought of leaving kinsale altogether but flight implied so much of defeat that he did not long indulge in that notion no he would stay in spite of all the osullivans kith and kin breed seed and generation but at the same time he knew he should never hear the end of that hateful place fingal and if barny had had the power he would have enacted a penal statute making it death to name the accursed spot wherever it was but not being gifted with such legislative authority he felt kinsale was no place for him if he would not submit to be flouted every hour out of the fourandtwenty by man woman and child that wished to annoy him what was to be done he was in the perplexing situation to use his own words of the cat in the thripe shop he didnt know which way to choose at last after turning himself over in the sun several times a new idea struck him couldnt he go to fingal himself and then hed be equal to that upstart osullivan no sooner was the thought engendered than barny sprang to his feet a new man his eye brightened his step became once more elastic he walked erect and felt himself to be all over barny oreirdon once more richard was himself again but where was fingal there was the rub that was a profound mystery to barny which until discovered must hold him in the vile bondage of inferiority the plaindealing reader would say couldnt he ask no no that would never do for barny that would be an open admission of ignorance his soul was above and consequently barny set his brains to work to devise measures of coming at the hidden knowledge by some circuitous route that would not betray the end he was working for to this purpose fifty stratagems were raised and demolished in half as many minutes in the fertile brain of barny as he strided along the shore and as he was working hard at the fiftyfirst it was knocked all to pieces by his jostling against some one whom he never perceived he was approaching so immersed was he in his speculations and on looking up who should it prove to be but his friend the long sailor from the aystern injees this was quite a godsend to barny and much beyond what he could have hoped for of all men under the sun the long sailor was the man in a million for barnys net at that minute and accordingly he made a haul of him and thought it the greatest catch he ever made in his life barny and the long sailor were in close companionship for the remainder of the day which was closed as the preceding one in a carouse but on this occasion there was only a duet performance in honor of the jolly god and the treat was at barnys expense what the nature of their conversation during the period was i will not dilate on but keep it as profound a secret as barny himself did and content myself with saying that barny looked a much happier man the next day instead of wearing his hat slouched and casting his eyes on the ground he walked about with his usual unconcern and gave his nod and the passing word of civilitude to every friend he met he rolled his quid of tobacco about in his jaw with an air of superior enjoyment and if disturbed in his narcotic amusement by a question he took his own time to eject the leperous distilment before he answered the querist a happy composure that bespoke a man quite at ease with himself it was in this agreeable spirit that barny bent his course to the house of peter kelly the owner of the big farm beyant before alluded to in order to put in practice a plan he had formed for the fulfilment of his determination of rivalling osullivan he thought it probable that peter kelly being one of the snuggest men in the neighborhood would be a likely person to join him in a spec as he called it a favorite abbreviation of his for the word speculation and accordingly when he reached the bigfarm house he accosted the owner with his usual god save you god save you kindly barny returned peter kelly an what is it brings you here barny asked peter this fine day instead o being out in the boat o ill be out in the boat soon enough and its far enough too ill be in her an indeed its partly that same is bringin me here to yourself why do you want me to go along wid you barny troth an i dont mr kelly youre a knowledgeable man an land but im afeared its a bad bargain youd be at say and what wor you talking about me and your boat for why you see sir it was in the regard of a little bit o business an if youd come wid me and take a turn in the pratyfield ill be behouldin to you and maybe youll hear somethin that wont be displazin to you an welkim barny said peter kelly when barny and peter were in the pratyfield barny opened the trenches i dont mean the potato trenches but in military parlance he opened the trenches and laid siege to peter kelly setting forth the extensive profits that had been realized at various specs that had been made by his neighbors in exporting potatoes and sure said barny why shouldnt you do the same and they are ready to your hand as much as to say why dont you profit by me peter kelly and the boat is below there in the harbor and ill say this much the divil a betther boat is betune this and herself indeed i blieve so barny said peter for considhering where we stand at this present theres no boat at all at all betune us and peter laughed with infinite pleasure at his own hit o well you know what i mane anyhow an as i said before the boat is a darlint boat and as for him that commands her i blieve i need say nothin about that and barny gave a toss of his head and a sweep of his open hand more than doubling the laudatory nature of his comment on himself but as the irish saying is to make a long story short barny prevailed on peter kelly to make an export but in the nature of the venture they did not agree barny had proposed potatoes peter said there were enough of them already where he was going and barny rejoined that praties were so good in themselves there never could be too much o thim anywhere but peter being a knowledgeable man and up to all the saycrets o the airth and understanding the theory and the chemisthery overruled barnys proposition and determined upon a cargo of scalpeens which name they gave to pickled mackerel as a preferable merchandise quite forgetting that dublin bay herrings were a much better and as cheap a commodity at the command of the fingalians but in many similar mistakes the ingenious mr kelly has been paralleled by other speculators but that is neither here nor there and it was all one to barny whether his boat was freighted with potatoes or scalpeens so long as he had the honor and glory of becoming a navigator and being as good as osullivan accordingly the boat was laden and all got in readiness for putting to sea and nothing was now wanting but barnys orders to haul up the gaff and shake out the jib of his hooker but this order barny refrained to give and for the first time in his life exhibited a disinclination to leave the shore one of his fellowboatmen at last said to him why thin barny oreirdon what the divil is come over you at all at all whats the maynin of your loitherin about here and the boat ready and a lovely fine breeze aff o the land o never you mind i blieve i know my own business anyhow an its hard so it is if a man cant ordher his own boat to sail when he plazes o i was only thinking it quare and a pity more betoken as i said before to lose the beautiful breeze and well just keep your thoughts to yourself i you plaze and stay in the boat as i bid you and dont be out of her on your apperl by no manner o manes for one minit for you see i dont know when it may be plazin to me to go aboord an set sail well all i can say is i never seen you afeared to go to say before who says im afeared said oreirdon youd betther not say that agin or in troth ill give you a leatherin that wont be for the good o your health troth for three straws this minit id lave you that your own mother wouldnt know you with the lickin id give you but i scorn your dirty insinuation no man ever seen barny oreirdon afeard yet anyhow howld your prate i tell you and look up to your betthers what do you know iv navigation maybe you think its as aisy for to sail on a voyage as to go start a fishin and barny turned on his heel and left the shore the next day passed without the hooker sailing and barny gave a most sufficient reason for the delay by declaring that he had a warnin givin him in a dhrame glory be to god and that it was given to him to understand under heaven that it wouldnt be lucky that day well the next day was friday and barny of course would not sail any more than any other sailor who could help it on this unpropitious day on saturday however he came running in a great hurry down to the shore and jumping aboard he gave orders to make all sail and taking the helm of the hooker he turned her head to the sea and soon the boat was cleaving the blue waters with a velocity seldom witnessed in so small a craft and scarcely conceivable to those who have not seen the speed of a kinsale hooker why thin you tuk the notion mighty suddint barny said the fisherman next in authority to oreirdon as soon as the bustle of getting the boat under way had subsided well i hope its plazin to you at last said barny troth one ud think you were never at say before you wor in such a hurry to be off as newfangled amost as the child with a play toy well said the other of barnys companions for there were but two with him in the boat i was thinkin myself as well as jemmy that we lost two fine days for nothin and wed be there amost maybe now if we saild three days agon dont blieve it said barny emphatically now dont you know yourself that there is some days that the fish wont come near the lines at all and that we might as well be castin our nets on the dhry land as in the say for all well catch if we start on an unlooky day and sure i towld you i was waitin only till i had it given to me to undherstan that it was looky to sail and i go bail well be there sooner than if we started three days agon for if you dont start with good look before you faix maybe its never at all to the end o your trip youll come well theres no use in talkin aboot it now anyhow but when do you expec to be there why you see we must wait antil i can tell how the wind is like to hould on before i can make up my mind to that but youre sure now barny that youre up to the coorse you have to run see now lave me alone and dont be cross crassquestionin me tareanouns do you think me sich a bladdherang as for to go to shuperinscribe a thing i wasnt aiquil to no i was only goin to ax you what coorse you wor goin to steer youll find out soon enough when we get there and so i bid you agin lay me alone just keep your toe in your pump shure im here at the helm and a weight on my mind and its fitther for you jim to mind your own business and lay me to mind mine away wid you there and be handy haul taut that foresheet there we must run close on the wind be handy boys make everything dhraw these orders were obeyed and the hooker soon passed to windward of a ship that left the harbor before her but could not hold on a wind with the same tenacity as the hooker whose qualities in this particular render it peculiarly suitable for the purposes to which it is applied namely pilot and fishing boats we have said a ship left the harbor before the hooker had set sail and it is now fitting to inform the reader that barny had contrived in the course of his last meeting with the long sailor to ascertain that this ship then lying in the harbor was going to the very place barny wanted to reach barnys plan of action was decided upon in a moment he had now nothing to do but to watch the sailing of the ship and follow in her course here was at once a new mode of navigation discovered the stars twinkling in mysterious brightness through the silent gloom of night were the first encouraging because visible guides to the adventurous mariners of antiquity since then the sailor encouraged by a bolder science relies on the unseen agency of nature depending on the fidelity of an atom of iron to the mystic law that claims its homage in the north this is one refinement of science upon another but the beautiful simplicity of barny oreirdons philosophy cannot be too much admired to follow the ship that is going to the same place is not this navigation made easy but barny like many a great man before him seemed not to be aware of how much credit he was entitled to for his invention for he did not divulge to his companions the originality of his proceeding he wished them to believe he was only proceeding in the commonplace manner and had no ambition to be distinguished as the happy projector of so simple a practice for this purpose he went to windward of the ship and then fell off again allowing her to pass him as he did not wish even those on board the ship to suppose he was following in their wake for barny like all people that are quite full of one scheme and fancy everybody is watching them dreaded lest any one should fathom his motives all that day barny held on the same course as his leader keeping at a respectful distance however for fear twould look like dodging her as he said to himself but as night closed in so closed in barny with the ship and kept a sharp lookout that she should not give him the slip the next morning dawned and found the hooker and ship companions still and thus matters proceeded for four days during which entire time they had not seen land since their first losing sight of it although the weather was clear by my sowl thought barny the channel must be mighty wide in these parts and for the last day or so weve been goin purty free with a flowing sheet and i wondher we arent closin in wid the shore by this time or maybe its farther off than i thought it was his companions too began to question barny on the subject but to their queries he presented an impenetrable front of composure and said it was always the best plan to keep a good bowld offin in two days more however the weather began to be sensibly warmer and barny and his companions remarked that it was goin to be the finest sayson god bless it that ever kem out o the skies for many a long year and maybe its the whate would not be beautiful and a great dale of it it was at the end of a week that the ship which barny had hitherto kept ahead of him showed symptoms of bearing down upon him as he thought and sure enough she did and barny began to conjecture what the deuce the ship could want with him and commenced inventing answers to the questions he thought it possible might be put to him in case the ship spoke him he was soon put out of suspense by being hailed and ordered to run under her lee and the captain looking over the quarter asked barny where he was going faith then im goin an my business said barny but where said the captain why sure an its no matther where a poor man like me id be goin said barny only im curious to know what the deuce youve been following my ship for the last week follyin your ship why thin bluranagers do you think its follyin yiz i am its very like it said the captain why did two people niver thravel the same road before i dont say they didnt but theres a great difference between a ship of seven hundred tons and a hooker o as for that matther said barny the same highroad sarves a coach and four and a lowback car the thravellin tinker an a lord a horseback thats very true said the captain but the cases are not the same paddy and i cant conceive what the devil brings you here and who axd you to consayve anything about it asked barny somewhat sturdily d n me if i can imagine what youre about my fine fellow said the captain and my own notion is that you dont know where the d l youre going yourself o baithershin said barny with a laugh of derision why then do you object to tell said the captain arrah sure captain an dont you know that sometimes vessels is bound to sail under saycret ordhers said barny endeavoring to foil the question by badinage there was a universal laugh from the deck of the ship at the idea of a fishingboat sailing under secret orders for by this time the whole broadside of the vessel was crowded with grinning mouths and wondering eyes at barny and his boat o its a thrifle makes fools laugh said barny take care my fine fellow that you dont be laughing at the wrong side of your mouth before long for ive a notion that youre cursedly in the wrong box as cunning a fellow as you think yourself d n your stupid head cant you tell what brings you here why thin by gor one id think the whole say belonged to you youre so mighty bowld in axin questions an it why tareanouns sure ive as much right to be here as you though i havent as big a ship nor as fine a coat but maybe i can take as good a sailin out o the one and has as bowld a heart under th other very well said the captain i see theres no use in talking to you so go to the d l your own way and away bore the ship leaving barny in indignation and his companions in wonder an why wouldnt you tell him said they to barny why dont you see said barny whose object was now to blind them dont you see how do i know but maybe he might be goin to the same place himself and maybe he has a cargo of scalpeens as well as uz and wants to get before us there true for you barny said they by dad youre right and their inquiries being satisfied the day passed as former ones had done in pursuing the course of the ship in four days more however the provisions in the hooker began to fail and they were obliged to have recourse to the scalpeens for sustenance and barny then got seriously uneasy at the length of the voyage and the likely greater length for anything he could see to the contrary and urged at last by his own alarms and those of his companions he was enabled as the wind was light to gain on the ship and when he found himself alongside he demanded a parley with the captain the captain on hearing that the hardy hooker as she got christened was under his lee came on deck and as soon as he appeared barny cried out why thin bluranagers captain dear do you expec to be there soon where said the captain o you know yourself said barny its well for me i do said the captain thrue for you indeed your honor said barny in his most insinuating tone but whin will you be at the ind o your voyage captain jewel i daresay in about three months said the captain o holy mother ejaculated barny three months arrah its jokin you are captain dear and only want to freken me how should i frighten you asked the captain why thin your honor to tell gods thruth i heard you were goin there an as i wanted to go there too i thought i couldnt do better nor to folly a knowledgeable gintleman like yourself and save myself the throuble iv findin it out and where do you think i am going said the captain why thin said barny isnt it to fingal no said the captain its to bengal o gogs blakey said barny whatll i do now at all at all ii homeward bound the captain ordered barny on deck as he wished to have some conversation with him on what he very naturally considered a most extraordinary adventure heaven help the captain he knew little of irishmen or he would not have been so astonished barny made his appearance puzzling question and more puzzling answer followed in quick succession between the commander and barny who in the midst of his dilemma stamped about thumped his head squeezed his caubeen into all manner of shapes and vented his despair anathematically o my heavy hathred to you you tarnal thief iv a long sailor its a purty scrape yiv led me into by gor i thought it was fingal he said and now i hear it is bingal o the divil sweep you for navigation why did i meddle or make wid you at all at all and my curse light on you terry osullivan why did i iver come across you you onlooky vagabone to put sich thoughts in my head and so its bingal and not fingal youre goin to captain yes indeed paddy an might i be so bowld to ax captain is bingal much farther nor fingal a trifle or so paddy och thin millia murther weirasthru howll i iver get there at all at all roared out poor barny by turning about and getting back the road youve come as fast as you can is it back o queen iv heaven an how will i iver get back said the bewildered barny then you dont know your course it appears o faix i knew it iligant as long as your honor was before me but you dont know your course back why indeed not to say rightly all out your honor cant you steer said the captain the divil a betther hand at the tiller in all kinsale said barny with his usual brag well so far so good said the captain and you know the points of the compass you have a compass i suppose a compass by my sowl an its not let alone a compass but a pair a compasses i have that my brother the carpinthir left me for a keepsake whin he wint abroad but indeed as for the points o thim i cant say much for the childer spylt thim intirely rootin holes in the flure what the plague are you talking about asked the captain wasnt your honor discoorsin me about the points o the compasses confound your thick head said the captain why what an ignoramus you must be not to know what a compass is and you at sea all your life do you even know the cardinal points the cardinals faix an its a great respect i have for them your honor sure arnt they belongin to the pope confound you you blockhead roared the captain in a rage twould take the patience of the pope and the cardinals and the cardinal virtues into the bargain to keep ones temper with you do you know the four points of the wind by my sowl i do and more well never mind more but let us stick to four youre sure you know the four points of the wind by dad it would be a quare thing if a seyfarin man didnt know somethin about the wind anyhow why captain dear you must take me for a nathral intirely to suspect me o the like o not knowin all about the wind by gor i know as much o the wind amost as a pig indeed i believe so laughed out the captain o you may laugh if you plaze and i see by the same that you dont know about the pig with all your edication captain well what about the pig why sir did you never hear a pig can see the wind i cant say that i did o thin he does and for that rayson who has a right to know more about it you dont for one i dare say paddy and maybe you have a pig aboard to give you information sorra taste your honor not as much as a rasher o bacon but its maybe your honor never seen a pig tossing up his snout consaited like and running like mad afore a storm well what if i have well sir that is when they see the wind acomin maybe so paddy but all this knowledge in piggery wont find you your way home and if you take my advice you will give up all thoughts of endeavoring to find your way back and come on board you and your messmates i dare say will be useful hands with some teaching but at all events i cannot leave you here on the open sea with every chance of being lost why thin indeed and im behowlden to your honor and its the hoighth o kindness so it is you offer and its nothin else but a gintleman you are every inch o you but i hope its not so bad wid us yet as to do the likes o that i think its bad enough said the captain when you are without a compass and knowing nothing of your course and nearly a hundred and eighty leagues from land an how many miles would that be captain three times as many i never larned the rule o three captain and maybe your honor id tell me yourself that is rather more than five hundred miles five hundred miles shouted barny o the lord look down upon us howll we ever get back thats what i say said the captain and therefore i recommend you to come aboard with me and where ud the hooker be all the time said barny let her go adrift was the answer is it the darlint boat o by dad ill never hear o that at all well then stay in her and be lost decide upon the matter at once either come on board or cast off and the captain was turning away as he spoke when barny called after him arrah thin your honor dont go jist for one minit antil i ax you one word more if i wint wid you whin would i be home again in about seven months o thin that puts the wig an it at wanst i darnt go at all why seven months are not long passing thrue for you in throth said barny with a shrug of his shoulders faix its myself knows to my sorrow the half year comes round mighty suddint and the lords agint comes for the thrifle o rent then whats your objection as to the time asked the captain arrah sure sir what would the woman that owns me do while i was away and maybe its break her heart the craythur would thinking i was lost intirely and whod be at home to take care o the childher and airn thim the bit and the sup whin id be away and who knows but its all dead theyd be afore i got back och hone sure the heart id fairly break in my body if hurt or harm kem to them through me so say no more captain dear only give me a thrifle o directions how im to make an offer at gettin home and its myself that will pray for you night noon and mornin for that same well paddy said the captain as you are determined to go back in spite of all i can say you must attend to me well while i give you as simple instructions as i can you say you know the four points of the wind north south east and west yes sir how do you know them for i must see that you are not likely to make a mistake how do you know the points why you see sir the sun god bless it rises in the aist and sets in the west which stands to raison and whin you stand bechuxt the aist and the west the north is forninst you and when the north is fornenst you as you say is the east on your right or your left hand on the right hand your honor well i see you know that much however now said the captain the moment you leave the ship you must steer a northeast course and you will make some land near home in about a week if the wind holds as it is now and it is likely to do so but mind me if you turn out of your course in the smallest degree you are a lost man many thanks to your honor and how are you off for provisions why thin indeed in the regard o that same we are in the hoighth o distress for exceptin the scalpeens sorra taste passed our lips for these four days o you poor devils said the commander in a tone of sincere commiseration ill order you some provisions on board before you start long life to your honor and id like to drink the health of so noble a gintleman i understand you paddy you shall have grog too musha the heavens shower blessins an you i pray the virgin mary and the twelve apostles matthew mark luke and

heart and a half and sure your honor god is good an will mind dessolute craythurs like uz on the wild oceant as well as ashore while some of the ships crew were putting the captains benevolent intentions to barny and his companions into practice by transferring some provisions to the hooker the commander entertained himself by further conversation with barny who was the greatest original he had ever met in the course of their colloquy barny drove many hard queries at the captain respecting the wonders of the nautical profession and at last put the question to him plump oh thin captain dear and how is it at all at all that you make your way over the wide says intirely to them furrin parts you would not understand paddy if i attempted to explain to you sure enough indeed your honor and i ask your pardon only i was curious to know and sure no wondher it requires various branches of knowledge to make a navigator branches said barny by gar i think it id take the whole tree o knowledge to make it out and that place you are going to sir that bingal oh bad luck to it for a bingal its the sore bingal to me is it so far off as you say yes paddy half round the world is it round in airnest captain dear round about aye indeed o thin arnt you afeard that whin you come to the top and that youre obleedged to go down that youd go slidderhin away intirely and never be able to stop maybe its bad enough so it is going down hill by land but it must be the dickens all out by wather but there is no hill paddy dont you know that water is always level by dad its very flat anyhow and by the same token its seldom i throuble it but sure your honor if the wather is level how do you make out that it is round you go that is a part of the knowledge i was speaking to you about said the captain musha bad luck to you knowledge but youre a quare thing and where is it bingal bad cess to it would be at all at all in the east indies o that is where they make the tay isnt it sir no where the tea grows is further still further why that must be the ind of the world intirely and they dont make it thin sir but it grows you tell me yes paddy is it like hay your honor not exactly paddy what puts hay in your head oh only bekase i hear them call it bohay a most logical deduction paddy and is it a great deal farther your honor the tay country is yes paddy china it is called thats i suppose what we call chaynee sir exactly paddy by dad i never could come at it rightly before why it was nathral to drink tay out o chaynee i ax your honors pardon for bein troublesome but i hard tell from

to us god betune us and harm i hope i would not be too near them said barny why whats your objection arrah sure sir theyre hardly mortials at all but has the mark o the bastes an thim how do you make out that paddy why sure sir and didnt natur make thim wid wool on their heads plainly makin it undherstood to chrishthans that they were little more nor cattle i think your head is a woolgathering now paddy said the captain laughing faix maybe so indeed answered barny goodhumoredly but its seldom i ever went out to look for wool and kem home shorn anyhow said he with a look of triumph well you wont have that to say for the future paddy said the captain laughing again my names not paddy your honor said barny returning the laugh but seizing the opportunity to turn the joke aside that was going against him my name isnt paddy sir but barny o if it was solomon youll be bare enough when you go home this time you have not gathered much this trip barny sure ive been gathering knowledge anyhow your honor said barny with a significant look at the captain and a complimentary tip of his hand to his caubeen and god bless you for being so good to me and whats your name besides barny asked the captain oreirdon your honor barny oreirdons my name well barny oreirdon i wont forget your name nor yourself in a hurry for you are certainly the most original navigator i ever had the honor of being acquainted with well said barny with a triumphant toss of his head i have done terry osullivan at any rate the devil a half so far he ever was and thats a comfort i have muzzled his clack for the rest iv his life and he wont be comin over us wid the pride iv his fingal while im to the fore that was amost at bingal terry osullivan who is he pray said the captain o hes a scut iv a chap thats not worth your axin for hes not worth your honors notice a braggin poor craythur o wait till i get home and the devil a more braggin theyll hear out of his jaw indeed then barny the sooner you turn your face toward home the better said the captain since you will go there is no need of your losing more time thrue for you your honor and sure its well for me i had the luck to meet with the likes o your honor that explained the ins and the outs iv it to me and laid it all down as plain as prent are you sure you remember my directions said the captain troth an ill niver forget them to the day o my death and is bound to pray more betoken for you and yours dont mind praying for me till you get home barny but answer me how are you to steer when you shall leave me the noraist coorse your honor thats the coorse agin the world remember that never alter that course till you see land let nothing make you turn out of a northeast course throth an that would be the dirty turn seein that it was yourself that ordhered it o no ill depend my life an the noraist coorse and god help any that comes betune me an it id run him down if he was my father well good by barny good by and god bless you your honor and send you safe thats a wish you want for yourself barny never fear for me but mind yourself well o sure im as good as at home wanst i know the way barrin the wind is conthrary sure the noraist coorsell do the business complate good by your honor and long life to you and more power to your elbow and a light heart and a heavy purse to you evermore i pray the blessed virgin and all the saints amin and so saying barny descended the ships side and once more assumed the helm of the hardy hooker the two vessels now separated on their opposite courses what a contrast their relative situations afforded proudly the ship bore away under her lofty and spreading canvas cleaving the billows before her manned by an able crew and under the guidance of experienced officers the finger of science to point the course of her progress the faithful chart to warn of the hidden rock and the shoal the long line and the quadrant to measure her march and prove her position the poor little hooker cleft not the billows each wave lifted her on its crest like a seabird but the three inexperienced fishermen to manage her no certain means to guide them over the vast ocean they had to traverse and the holding of the fickle wind the only chance of their escape from perishing in the wilderness of waters by the one the feeling excited is supremely that of mans power by the other of his utter helplessness to the one the expanse of ocean could scarcely be considered trackless to the other it was a waste indeed yet the cheer that burst from the ship at parting was answered as gayly from the hooker as though the odds had not been so fearfully against her and no blither heart beat on board the ship than that of barny oreirdon happy lightheartedness of my countrymen how kindly have they been fortified by nature against the assaults of adversity and if they blindly rush into dangers they cannot be denied the possession of gallant hearts to fight their way out of them but each hurrah became less audible by degrees the cheers dwindled into faintness and finally were lost in the eddies of the breeze the first feeling of loneliness that poor barny experienced was when he could no longer hear the exhilarating sound the plash of the surge as it broke on the bows of his little boat was uninterrupted by the kindred sound of human voice and as it fell upon his ear it smote upon his heart but he replied waved his hat and the silent signal was answered from those on board the ship well barny said jemmy what was the captain sayin to you at the time you wor wid him lay me alone said barny ill talk to you when i see her out o sight but not a word till thin ill look afther him the rale gintleman that he is while theres a topsail of his ship to be seen and then ill send my blessin afther him and pray for his good fortune wherever he goes for hes the right sort and nothin else and barny kept his word and when his straining eye could no longer trace a line of the ship the captain certainly had the benefit of a poor mans blessing the sense of utter loneliness and desolation had not come upon barny until now but he put his trust in the goodness of providence and in a fervent mental outpouring of prayer resigned himself to the care of his creator with an admirable fortitude too he assumed a composure to his companions that was a stranger to his heart and we all know how the burden of anxiety is increased when we have none with whom to sympathize and this was not all he had to affect ease and confidence for barny not only had no dependence on the firmness of his companions to go through the undertaking before them but dreaded to betray to them how he had imposed on them in the affair barny was equal to all this he had a stout heart and was an admirable actor yet for the first hour after the ship was out of sight he could not quite recover himself and every now and then unconsciously he would look back with a wishful eye to the point where last he saw her poor barny had lost his leader the night fell and barny stuck to the helm as long as nature could sustain want of rest and then left it in charge of one of his companions with particular directions how to steer and ordered if any change in the wind occurred that they should instantly awake him he could not sleep long however the fever of anxiety was upon him and the morning had not long dawned when he awoke he had not well rubbed his eyes and looked about him when he thought he saw a ship in the distance approaching them as the haze cleared away she showed distinctly bearing down toward the hooker on board the ship the hooker in such a sea caused surprise as before and in about an hour she was so close as to hail and order the hooker to run under her lee the devil a taste said barny ill not quit my noraist coorse for the king of ingland nor bonyparty into the bargain bad cess to you do you think ive nothin to do but plaze you again he was hailed oh bad luck to the toe ill go to you another hail spake loudher youd betther said barny jeeringly still holding on his course a gun was fired ahead of him by my sowl you spoke loudher that time sure enough said barny take care barny cried jemmy and peter together bluranagers man well be kilt if you dont go to them well and well be lost if we turn out iv our noraist coorse and thats as broad as its long let them hit iz if they like sure it ud be a pleasanter death nor starvin at say i tell you agin ill turn out o my noraist coorse for no man a shotted gun was fired the shot hopped on the water as it passed before the hooker phew you missed it like your mammys blessin said barny o murther said jemmy didnt you see the ball hop aff the wather forninst you o murther what ud we ha done if we wor there at all at all why wed have taken the ball at the hop said barny laughing accordin to the ould sayin another shot was ineffectually fired im thinking thats a connaughtman thats shootin said barny with a sneera the allusion was so relished by jemmy and peter that it excited a smile in the midst of their fears from the cannonade a this is an allusion of barnys to a prevalent saying in ireland addressed to a sportsman who returns home unsuccessful so youve killed what the connaughtman shot at again the report of the gun was followed by no damage augh never heed them said barny contemptuously its a barkin dog that never bites as the owld sayin says and the hooker was soon out of reach of further annoyance now what a pity it was to be sure said barny that i wouldnt go aboord to plaze them now whos right ah lave me alone always jimmy did you iver know me wrong yet o you may hillow now that you are out o the wood said jemmy but accordin to my idays it was runnin a grate risk to be conthrary wid them at all and they shootin balls afther us well what matther said barny since they wor only blind gunners an i knew it besides as i said afore i wont turn out o my noraist coorse for no man thats a new turn you tuk lately said peter whats the raison youre runnin a noraist coorse now an we never heard iv it afore at all till afther you quitted the big ship why thin are you sich an ignoramus all out said barny as not for to know that in navigation you must lie an a great many different tacks before you can make the port you steer for only i think said jemmy that its back intirely were goin now and i cant make out the rights o that at all why said barny who saw the necessity of mystifying his companions a little you see the captain towld me that i kum around an rekimminded me to go th other way faix its the first time i ever heard o goin round by say said jemmy arrah sure thats part o the saycrets o navigation and the varrious branches o knowledge that is requizit for a navigator and thats what the captain god bless him and myself was discoorsin an aboord and like a rale gintleman as he is barny says he sir says i youve come the round says he i know that says i bekase i like to keep a good bowld offin says i in contrairy places spoke like a good sayman says he thats my principles says i theyre the right sort says he but says he no offence i think you wor wrong says he to pass the short turn in the ladieshoes b says he i know says i you mane beside the threespike headlan thats the spot says he i see you know it as well as i know my father says i b some offer barny is making at latitudes why barny said jemmy interrupting him we seen no headlan at all whisht whisht said barny bad cess to you dont thwart me we passed it in the night and you couldnt see it well as i was saying i knew it as well as i know my father says i but i gev the preference to go the round says i youre a good sayman for that same says he an it would be right at any other time than this present says he but its onpossible now teetotally on account o the war says he tare alive says i what war an didnt you hear o the war says he divil a word says i why says he the naygers has made war on the king o chaynee says he bekase he refused them any more tay an with that what did they do says he but they put a lumbargo on all the vessels that sails the round an thats the rayson says he i carry guns as you may see and i rekimmind you says he to go back for youre not able for thim and thats jist the way iv it an now wasnt it looky that i kem acrass him at all or maybe we might be cotch by the naygers and ate up alive o thin indeed and thats thrue said jemmy and peter and whin will we come to the short turn o never mind said barny youll see it when you get there but wait till i tell you more about the captain and the big ship he said you know that he carried guns afeard o the naygers and in troth its the hoight o care he takes o them same guns and small blame to him sure they might be the salvation of him pon my conscience theyre taken betther care of than any poor mans child i heerd him cautionin the sailors about them and givin them ordhers about their clothes their clothes said his two companions at once in much surprise is it clothes upon cannons its thruth im tellin you said barny bad luck to the lie in it he was talkin about their aprons and their breeches o think o that said jemmy and peter in surprise an t was all iv a piece said barny that an the rest o the ship all out she was as nate as a new pin throth i was amost ashamed to put my fut on the deck it was so clane and she painted every color in the rainbow and all sorts o curiosities about her and instead iv a tiller to steer her like this darlin craythur iv ours she goes wid a wheel like a coach all as one and theres the quarest thing you iver seen to show the way as the captain gev me to understan a little round rowlypowly thing in a bowl that goes waddlin about as if it didnt know its own way much more nor show anybody theirs throth myself thought that if thats the way theyre obliged to go that its with a great deal of fear and thrimblin they find it out thus it was that barny continued most marvellous accounts of the ship and the captain to his companions and by keeping their attention so engaged prevented their being too inquisitive as to their own immediate concerns and for two days more barny and the hooker held on their respective courses undeviatingly the third day barnys fears for the continuity of his noraist coorse were excited as a large brig hove in sight and the nearer she approached the more directly she appeared to be coming athwart barnys course may the divil sweep you said barny and will nothin else sarve you than comin forninst me that away brigahoy there shouted barny giving the tiller to one of his messmates and standing at the bow of his boat brigahoy there bad luck to you go long out o my noraist coorse the brig instead of obeying him hove to and lay right ahead of the hooker o look at this shouted barny and he stamped on the deck with rage look at the blackguards where theyre stayin just apurpose to ruin an unfortunate man like me my heavy hathred to you quit this minit or ill run down an yes and if we go to the bottom well haunt you forevermore go long out o that i tell you the curse o crummil on you you stupid vagabones that wont go out iv a mans noraist coorse from cursing barny went to praying as he came closer for the tendher marcy o heaven an lave my way may the lord reward you and get out o my noraist coorse may angels make your bed in heavin and dont ruinate me this a way the brig was immovable and barny finished with a duet volley of prayers and curses together apostrophizing the hard case of a man being done out o his noraist coorse ahoy there shouted a voice from the brig put down your helm or youll be aboard of us i say let go your jib and foresheet what are you about you lubbers twas true that the brig lay so fair in barnys course that he would have been aboard but that instantly the manoeuvre above alluded to was put in practice on board the hooker as she swept to destruction toward the heavy hull of the brig he luffed up into the wind alongside her a very pale and somewhat emaciated face appeared at the side and addressed barny what brings you here was the question throth thin and i think i might betther ax what brings you here right in the way o my noraist coorse where do you come from from kinsale and you didnt come from a betther place i go bail where are you bound to to fingal fingal wheres fingal why then aint you ashamed o yourself an not to know where fingal is it is not in these seas o and thats all you know about it says barny youre a small craft to be so far at sea i suppose you have provisions on board to be sure we have throth if we hadnt this id be a bad place to go a beggin what have you eatable the finest o scalpeens what are scalpeens why youre mighty ignorant intirely said barny why scalpeens is pickled mackerel then you must give us some for we have been out of everything eatable these three days and even pickled fish is better than nothing it chanced that the brig was a west india trader which unfavorable winds had delayed much beyond the expected period of time on her voyage and though her water had not failed everything eatable had been consumed and the crew reduced almost to helplessness in such a strait the arrival of barny oreirdon and his scalpeens was a most providential succor to them and a lucky chance for barny for he got in exchange for his pickled fish a handsome return of rum and sugar much more than equivalent to their value barny lamented much however that the brig was not bound for ireland that he might practice his own peculiar system of navigation but as staying with the brig could do no good he got himself put into his noraist coorse once more and ploughed away toward home the disposal of his cargo was a great godsend to barny in more ways than one in the first place he found the most profitable market he could have had and secondly it enabled him to cover his retreat from the difficulty which still was before him of not getting to fingal after all his dangers and consequently being open to discovery and disgrace all these beneficial results were thrown away upon one of barnys readiness to avail himself of every point in his favor and accordingly when they left the brig barny said to his companions why thin boys pon my conscience but im as proud as a horse wid a wooden leg this minit that we met them poor unfortnate craythers this blessed day and was enabled to extind our charity to them sure an its lost theyd be only for our comin acrass them and we through the blessin o god enabled to do an act o marcy that is feedin the hungry and sure every good work we do here is before uz in heaven and thats a comfort anyhow to be sure now that the scalpeens is sowld theres no use in goin to fingal and we may as well jist go home faix im sorry myself said jemmy for terry osullivan said it was an iligant place intirely an i wanted to see it to the divil wid terry osullivan said barny how does he know whats an iligant place what knowledge has he of iligance ill go bail he never was half as far a navigatin as we he wint the short cut i go bail and never dard for to vinture the round as i did by dad we wor a great dale longer anyhow than he towld me he was to be sure we wor said barny he wint skulkin in by the short cut i tell you and was afeard to keep a bowld offin like me but come boys let uz take a dhrop o the bottle o sperts we got out o the brig by gor its well we got some bottles iv it for i wouldnt much like to meddle wid that darlint little kag iv it antil we get home the rum was put on its trial by barny and his companions and in their critical judgment was pronounced quite as good as the captain of the ship had bestowed upon them but that neither of those specimens of spirit was to be compared to whiskey by dad says barny they may rack their brains a long time before theyll make out a purtier invintion than potteen that rum may do very well for thim that has the misforthin not to know betther but the whiskey is a more nathral spert accordin to my idays in this as in most other of barnys opinions peter and jemmy coincided nothing particular occurred for the two succeeding days during which time barny most religiously pursued his noraist coorse but the third day produced a new and important event a sail was discovered on the horizon and in the direction barny was steering and a couple of hours made him tolerably certain that the vessel in sight was an american for though it is needless to say that he was not very conversant in such matters yet from the frequency of his seeing americans trading to ireland his eye had become sufficiently accustomed to their lofty and tapering spars and peculiar smartness of rig to satisfy him that the ship before him was of transatlantic build nor was he wrong in his conjecture barny now determined on a manoeuvre classing him among the first tacticians at securing a good retreat moreaus highest fame rests upon his celebrated retrograde movement through the black forest xenophons greatest glory is derived from the deliverance of his ten thousand greeks from impending ruin by his renowned retreat let the ancient and the modern hero repose under the shadow of their laurels as the french have it while barny oreirdons historian with a pardonable jealousy for the honor of his country cuts down a goodly bough of the classic tree beneath which our hibernian hero may enjoy his otium cum dignitate barny calculated the american was bound for ireland and as she lay almost as directly in the way of his noraist coorse as the westindian brig he bore up to and spoke her he was answered by a shrewd yankee captain faix an its glad i am to see your honor again said barny the yankee had never been to ireland and told barny so o throth i couldnt forget a gintleman so aisy as that said barny youre pretty considerably mistaken now i guess said the american divil a taste said barny with inimitable composure and pertinacity well if you know me so tarnation well tell me whats my name the yankee flattered himself he had nailed barny now your name is it said barny gaining time by repeating the question why what a fool you are not to know your own name the oddity of the answer posed the american and barny took advantage of the diversion in his favor and changed the conversation by dad ive been waitin here these four or five days expectin some of you would be wantin me some of us how do you mean sure an arnt you from amerikay yes and what then well i say i was waitin for some ship or other from amerikay that ud be wantin me its to ireland youre goin yes well i suppose youll be wantin a pilot said barny yes when we get in shore but not yet o i dont want to hurry you said barny what port are you a pilot of why indeed as for the matther o that said barny theyre all aiqual to me amost all said the american why i calculate you couldnt pilot a ship into all the ports of ireland not all at wanst said barny with a laugh in which the american could not help joining well i say what ports do you know best why thin indeed said barny it would be hard for me to tell but wherever you want to go im the man thatll do the job for you complate where is your honor goin i wont tell you that but do you tell me what ports you know best why theres watherford and theres youghal an fingal fingal wheres that so you dont know where fingal is o i see youre a sthranger sir an then theres cork you know cove then is it the cove o cork yes i was bred and born there and pilots as many ships into cove as any other two min out of it barny thus sheltered his falsehood under the idiom of his language but what brought you so far out to sea asked the captain we wor lyin out lookin for ships that wanted pilots and there kem an the terriblest gale o wind aff the land an blew us to say out intirely an thats the way iv it your honor i calculate we got a share of the same gale twas from the noreast o directly said barny faith youre right enough twas the noraist coorse we wor an sure enough but no matther now that weve met wid you sure well have a job home anyhow well get aboard then said the american i will in a minit your honor whin i jist spake a word to my comrades here why sure its not goin to turn pilot you are said jemmy in his simplicity of heart whisht you omadhaun said barny or ill cut the tongue out o you now mind me pether you dont undherstan navigashin and the varrious branches o knowledge an so all you have to do is to folly the ship when i get into her an ill show you the way home barny then got aboard the american vessel and begged of the captain that as he had been out at sea so long and had gone through a power o hardship intirely he would be permitted to go below and turn in to take a sleep for in throth its myself and sleep that is sthrayngers for some time said barny an if your honorll be plazed ill be thankful if you wont let them disturb me antil im wanted for sure till you see the land theres no use for me in life an throth i want a sleep sorely barnes request was granted and it will not be wondered at that after so much fatigue of mind and body he slept profoundly for fourandtwenty hours he then was called for land was in sight and when he came on deck the captain rallied him upon the potency of his somniferous qualities and calculated he had never met any one who could sleep fourandtwenty hours at a stretch before o sir said barny rubbing his eyes which were still a little hazy whiniver i go to sleep i pay attintion to it the land was soon neared and barny put in charge of the ship when he ascertained the first landmark he was acquainted with but as soon as the head of kinsale hove in sight barny gave a whoo and cut a caper that astonished the yankees and was quite inexplicable to them though i flatter myself it is not to those who do barny the favor of reading his adventures o there you are my darlint ould head an wheres the head like o you throth its little i thought id ever set eyes an your goodlooking faytures agin but gods good in such halfmuttered exclamations did barny apostrophize each wellknown point of his native shore and when opposite the harbor of kinsale he spoke the hooker that was somewhat astern and ordered jemmy and peter to put in there and tell molly immediately that he was come back and would be with her as soon as he could after piloting the ship into cove but an your apperl dont tell pether kelly o the big farm nor indeed dont mintion to man or mortial about the navigation we done antil i come home myself and make them sensible o it bekase jemmy and pether neither o yiz is aqual to it and doesnt undherstan the branches o knowledge requizit for discoorsin o navigation the hooker put into kinsale and barny sailed the ship into cove it was the first ship he ever had acted the pilot for and his old luck attended him no accident befell his charge and what was still more extraordinary he made the american believe he was absolutely the most skilful pilot on the station so barny pocketed his pilots fee swore the yankee was a gentleman for which the republican did not thank him wished him good by and then pushed his way home with what barny swore was the aisiestmade money he ever had in his life so barny got himself paid for piloting the ship that showed him the way home haddadbenahab the traveller by john galt haddadbenahab was a very wise man and he had several friends men of discernment and partakers of the wisdom of ages but they were not all so wise as haddadbenahab his sentences were short but his knowledge was long and what he predicted generally came to pass for he did not pretend to the gift of prophecy the utmost he ever said in that way was that he expected the sun to rise tomorrow and that old age was the shadow of youth besides being of a grave temperament haddadbenahab was inclined to obesity he was kindly and goodnatured to the whole human race he even carried his benevolence to the inferior creation and often patted his dogs on the head and gave them bones but cats he could not abide had he been a rat he could not have regarded them with more antipathy and yet haddadbenahab was an excellent man who smoked his chibouque with occasional cups of coffee and sherbet interspersed with profound aphorisms on the condition of man and conjectures on the delights of paradise with his friends he passed many sunbright hours and if much talk was not heard among them on these occasions be it remembered that silence is often wisdom the scene of their social resort was a little kiosk in front of one of the coffeehouses on the bank of the tigris no place in all bagdad is so pleasantly situated there the mighty river rolls in all the affluence of his waters pure as the unclouded sky and speckled with innumerable boats while the rippling waves tickled as it were by the summer breezes gambol and sparkle around the kiosk was raised two steps from the ground the interior was painted with all the most splendid colors the roof was covered with tiles that glittered like the skin of the arabian serpent and was surmounted with a green dragon which was painted of that imperial hue because haddadbenahab was descended from the sacred progeny of fatima of whom green is the everlasting badge as it is of nature time cannot change it nor can it be impaired by the decrees of tyranny or of justice one beautiful day haddadbenahab and his friends had met in this kiosk of dreams and were socially enjoying the fragrant smoke of their pipes and listening to the refreshing undulations of the river as the boats softly glided along for the waters lay in glassy stillness the winds were asleep even the sunbeams seemed to rest in a slumber on all things the smoke stood on the chimneytops as if a tall visionary tree grew out of each and the manycolored cloths in the yard of orooblis the armenian dyer hung unmolested by a breath orooblis himself was the only thing in that soft and bright noon which appeared on the land to be animated with any purpose orooblis was preparing a boat to descend the tigris and his servants were loading it with bales of apparel and baskets of provisions while he himself was in a great bustle going often between his dwellinghouse and the boat talking loud and giving orders and ever and anon wiping his forehead for he was a man that delighted in having an ado haddadbenahab seeing orooblis so active looked at him for some time and it so happened that all the friends at the same moment took their amberheaded pipes from their lips and said where can orooblis the armenian dyer be going such a simultaneous interjection naturally surprised them all and haddadbenahab added i should like to go with him and see strange things for i have never been out of the city of bagdad save once to pluck pomegranates in the garden of beysaddyboolk and he then rose and went to the boat which orooblis was loading and spoke to him and when it was ready they seated themselves on board and sailed down the tigris having much pleasant discourse concerning distant lands and hills whose tops pierced the clouds and were supposed to be the pillars that upheld the crystal dome of the heavens haddadbenahab rejoiced greatly as they sailed along and at last they came to a little town where orooblis having business in dyestuffs to transact went on shore leaving his friend but in what corner of the earth this little town stood haddadbenahab knew not for like other travellers he was not provided with much geographical knowledge but soon after the departure of orooblis he thought he would also land and inquire accordingly taking his pipe in his hand he stepped out of the boat and went about the town looking at many things till he came to a wharf where a large ship was taking merchandise on board and her sailors were men of a different complexion from that of the watermen who plied on the tigris at bagdad haddadbenahab looked at them and as he was standing near to where they were at work he thought that this ship afforded a better opportunity than he had enjoyed with orooblis to see foreign countries he accordingly went up to the captain and held out a handful of money and indicated that he was desirous to sail away with the ship when the captain saw the gold he was mightily civil and spoke to haddadbenahab with a loud voice perhaps thinking to make him hear was the way to make him understand but haddadbenahab only held up the forefinger of his right hand and shook it to and fro in the end however he was taken on board the ship and no sooner was he there than he sat down on a sofa and drawing his legs up under him kindled his pipe and began to smoke much at his ease making observations with his eyes as he did so the first observation haddadbenahab made was that the sofa on which he had taken his place was not at all like the sofas of bagdad and therefore when he returned he would show that he had not travelled without profit by having one made exactly similar for his best chamber with hens and ducks under it pleasantly feeding and joyously cackling and quacking and he also observed a remarkable sagacity in the ducks for when they saw he was a stranger they turned up the sides of their heads and eyed him in a most curious and inquisitive manner very different indeed from the ducks of bagdad when the ship had taken on board her cargo she spread her sails and haddadbenahab felt himself in a new situation for presently she began to lie over and to plunge and revel among the waves like a glad creature but haddadbenahab became very sick and the captain showed him the way down into the inside of the vessel where he went into a dark bed and was charitably tended by one of the sailors for many days after a season there was much shouting on the deck of the ship and haddadbenahab crawled out of his bed and went to the sofa and saw that the ship was near the end of her voyage when she had come to a bank where those on board could step out haddadbenahab did so and after he had seen all the strange things which were in the town where he thus landed he went into a bakers shop for they eat bread in that town as they do in bagdad and bought a loaf which having eaten he quenched his thirst at a fountain hard by in his ordinary manner of drinking at which he wondered exceedingly when he had solaced himself with all the wonders of that foreign city he went to a fakier who was holding two horses ready saddled beautiful they were and as the fakier signified by signs their hoofs were so fleet that they left the wind behind them haddadbenahab then showed the fakier his gold and mounted one of the horses pointing with the shaft of his pipe to the fakier to mount the other and then they both rode away into the country and they found that the wind blew in their faces at last they came to a caravansary where the fakier bought a cooked hen and two onions of which they both partook and stretching themselves before the fire which they had lighted in their chamber they fell asleep and slept until the dawn of day when they resumed their journey into remoter parts and nearer to the wall of the world which haddadbenahab conjectured they must soon reach they had not however journeyed many days in the usual manner when they came to the banks of a large river and the fakier would go no farther with his swift horses haddadbenahab was in consequence constrained to pay and part from him and to embark in a ferryboat to convey him over the stream where he found a strange vehicle with four horses standing ready to carry him on towards the wall of the world which surely said he to himself ought not to be now far off haddadbenahab showed his gold again and was permitted to take a seat in the vehicle which soon after drove away and he remarked in a most sagacious manner that nothing in that country was like the things in his own for the houses and trees and all things ran away as the vehicle came up to them and when it gave a jostle they gave a jump which he noted as one of the most extraordinary things he had seen since he left bagdad at last haddadbenahab came to the foot of a lofty green mountain with groves and jocund villages which studded it as it were with gems and shining ornaments and he said this must be the wall of the world for surely nothing can exist on the other side of these hills but i will ascend them and look over for i should like to tell my friends in bagdad what is to be seen on the outside of the earth accordingly he ascended the green mountain and he came to a thick forest of stubby trees this is surprising said haddadbenahab but higher i will yet go and he passed through that forest of trees and came to a steep moorland part of the hill where no living thing could be seen but a solitude without limit and the living world all glittering at the foot of the mountain this is a high place said haddadbenahab but i will yet go higher and he began to climb with his hands after an upward journey of great toil he came to a frozen region and the top of the wall of the world was still far above him he was however none daunted by the distance but boldly held on in the ascent and at last he reached the top of the wall but when he got there instead of a region of fog and chaos he only beheld another world much like our own and he was greatly amazed and exclaimed with a loud voice will my friends in bagdad believe this but it is true and i will so tell them so he hastened down the mountain and went with all the speed he could back to bagdad saying bagdad and giving gold to every man he met until he reached the kiosk of dreams where his friends were smoking and looking at the gambols of the tigris when the friends of haddadbenahab saw him approach they respectively took their pipes from their mouths and held them in their left hands while they pressed their bosoms with their right and received him with a solemn salaam for he had been long absent and all they in the mean time had heard concerning him was only what orooblis the armenian dyer on his return told them namely that he was gone to the wall of the world which limits the travels of man no wonder then that they rejoiced with an exceeding gladness to see him return and take his place in the kiosk among them as if he had never been a days journey away from bagdad they then questioned him about his adventures and he faithfully related to them all the wonders which have been set forth in our account of the journey upon which they declared he had made himself one of the sages of the earth afterward they each made a feast to which they invited all the philosophers in bagdad and haddadbenahab was placed in the seat of honor and being courteously solicited told them of his travels and every one cried aloud god is great and mahomet is his prophet when they had in this manner banqueted haddadbenahab fell sick and there was a great talk concerning the same some said he was very ill others shook their heads and spoke not but the world is full of envy and hardheartedness and those who were spiteful because of the renown which haddadbenahab as a traveller who had visited the top of the wall of the world with so much courage had acquired jeered at his malady saying he had been only feasted overmuch nevertheless haddadbenahab died and never was such a funeral seen in all bagdad save that of the caliph mahoud commonly called the magnificent such was the admiration in which the memory of the traveller was held the poets made dirges on the occasion and mournful songs were heard in the twilight from the windows of every harem nor did the generation of the time content itself with the ceremonies of lamentation they caused a fountain to be erected which they named the fountain of haddadbenahab the traveller and when the slaves go to fetch water they speak of the wonderful things he did and how he was on the top of the wall of the world and saw the outside of the earth so that his memory lives forever among them as one of the greatest the wisest and the bravest of men bluebeards ghost by william makepeace thackeray for some time after the fatal accident which deprived her of her husband mrs bluebeard was as may be imagined in a state of profound grief there was not a widow in all the country who went to such an expense for black bombazine she had her beautiful hair confined in crimped caps and her weepers came over her elbows of course she saw no company except her sister anne whose company was anything but pleasant to the widow as for her brothers their odious messtable manners had always been disagreeable to her what did she care for jokes about the major or scandal concerning the scotch surgeon of the regiment if they drank their wine out of black bottles or crystal what did it matter to her their stories of the stable the parade and the last run with the hounds were perfectly odious to her besides she could not bear their impertinent mustachios and filthy habit of smoking cigars they were always wild vulgar young men at the best but now now o their presence to her delicate soul was horror how could she bear to look on them after what had occurred she thought of the best of husbands ruthlessly cut down by their cruel heavy cavalry sabres the kind friend the generous landlord the spotless justice of peace in whose family differences these rude cornets of dragoons had dared to interfere whose venerable blue hairs they had dragged down with sorrow to the grave she put up a most splendid monument to her departed lord over the family vault of the bluebeards the rector dr sly who had been mr bluebeards tutor at college wrote an epitaph in the most pompous yet pathetic latin siste viator moerens conjux heu quanto minus est cum reliquis versari quam tui meminisse in a word everything that is usually said in epitaphs a bust of the departed saint with virtue mourning over it stood over the epitaph surrounded by medallions of his wives and one of these medallions had as yet no name in it nor the epitaph said could the widow ever be consoled until her own name was inscribed there for then i shall be with him in coelo quies she would say throwing up her fine eyes to heaven and quoting the enormous words of the hatchment which was put up in the church and over bluebeards hall where the butler the housekeeper the footman the housemaid and scullions were all in the profoundest mourning the keeper went out to shoot birds in a crape band nay the very scarecrows in the orchard and fruit garden were ordered to be dressed in black sister anne was the only person who refused to wear black mrs bluebeard would have parted with her but she had no other female relative her father it may be remembered by readers of the former part of her memoirs had married again and the motherinlaw and mrs bluebeard as usual hated each other furiously mrs shacabac had come to the hall on a visit of condolence but the widow was so rude to her on the second day of the visit that the stepmother quitted the house in a fury as for the bluebeards of course they hated the widow had not mr bluebeard settled every shilling upon her and having no children by his former marriage her property as i leave you to fancy was pretty handsome so sister anne was the only female relative whom mrs bluebeard would keep near her and as we all know a woman must have a female relative under any circumstances of pain or pleasure or profit when she is married or when she is widowed or when she is in a delicate situation but let us continue our story i will never wear mourning for that odious wretch sister anne would cry i will trouble you miss anne not to use such words in my presence regarding the best of husbands or to quit the room at once the widow would answer im sure its no great pleasure to sit in it i wonder you dont make use of the closet sister where the other mrs bluebeards are impertinence they were all embalmed by m gannal how dare you report the monstrous calumnies regarding the best of men take down the family bible and read what my blessed saint says of his wives read it written in his own hand friday june married my beloved wife anna maria scrogginsia saturday august a bereaved husband has scarcely strength to write down in this chronicle that the dearest of wives anna maria scrogginsia expired this day of sore throat there can anything be more convincing than that read again tuesday september this day i led to the hymeneal altar my souls blessing louisa matilda hopkinson may this angel supply the place of her i have lost wednesday october o heavens pity the distraction of a wretch who is obliged to record the ruin of his dearest hopes and affections this day my adored louisa matilda hopkinson gave up the ghost a complaint of the head and shoulders was the sudden cause of the event which has rendered the unhappy subscriber the most miserable of men bluebeard every one of the women are calendared in this delightful this pathetic this truly virtuous and tender way and can you suppose that a man who wrote such sentiments could be a murderer miss do you mean to say that he did not kill them then said anne gracious goodness anne kill them they died all as naturally as i hope you will my blessed husband was an angel of goodness and kindness to them was it his fault that the doctors could not cure their maladies no that it wasnt and when they died the inconsolable husband had their bodies embalmed in order that on this side of the grave he might never part from them and why did he take you up in the tower pray and why did you send me in such a hurry to the leads and why did he sharpen his long knife and roar out to you to come down merely to punish me for my curiosity the dear good kind excellent creature sobbed the widow overpowered with affectionate recollections of her lords attentions to her i wish said sister anne sulkily that i had not been in such a hurry in summoning my brothers ah screamed mrs bluebeard with a harrowing scream dont dont recall that horrid fatal day miss if you had not misled your brothers my poor dear darling bluebeard would still be in life still still the souls joy of his bereaved fatima whether it is that all wives adore husbands when the latter are no more or whether it is that fatimas version of the story is really the correct one and that the common impression against bluebeard is an odious prejudice and that he no more murdered his wives than you and i have remains yet to be proved and indeed does not much matter for the understanding of the rest of mrs bs adventures and though people will say that bluebeards settlement of his whole fortune on his wife in event of survivorship was a mere act of absurd mystification seeing that he was fully determined to cut her head off after the honeymoon yet the best test of his real intentions is the profound grief which the widow manifested for his death and the fact that he left her mighty well to do in the world if any one were to leave you or me a fortune my dear friend would we be too anxious to rake up the how and the why pooh pooh we would take it and make no bones about it and mrs bluebeard did likewise her husbands family it is true argued the point with her and said madam you must perceive that mr bluebeard never intended the fortune for you as it was his fixed intention to chop off your head it is clear that he meant to leave his money to his blood relations therefore you ought in equity to hand it over but she sent them all off with a flea in their ears as the saying is and said your argument may be a very good one but i will if you please keep the money and she ordered the mourning as we have before shown and indulged in grief and exalted everywhere the character of the deceased if any one would but leave me a fortune what a funeral and what a character i would give him bluebeard hall is situated as we all very well know in a remote country district and although a fine residence is remarkably gloomy and lonely to the widows susceptible mind after the death of her darling husband the place became intolerable the walk the lawn the fountain the green glades of park over which frisked the dappled deer all all recalled the memory of her beloved it was but yesterday that as they roamed through the park in the calm summer evening her bluebeard pointed out to the keeper the fat buck he was to kill ah said the widow with tears in her fine eyes the artless stag was shot down the haunch was cut and roasted the jelly had been prepared from the currantbushes in the garden that he loved but my bluebeard never ate of the venison look anne sweet pass we the old oak hall tis hung with trophies won by him in the chase with pictures of the noble race of bluebeard look by the fireplace there is the gigwhip his ridingwhip the spud with which you know he used to dig the weeds out of the terracewalk in that drawer are his spurs his whistle his visitingcards with his dear dear name engraven upon them there are the bits of string that he used to cut off the parcels and keep because string was always useful his buttonhook and there is the peg on which he used to hang his h h hat uncontrollable emotions bursts of passionate tears would follow these tender reminiscences of the widow and the long and short of the matter was that she was determined to give up bluebeard hall and live elsewhere her love for the memory of the deceased she said rendered the place too wretched of course an envious and sneering world said that she was tired of the country and wanted to marry again but she little heeded its taunts and anne who hated her stepmother and could not live at home was fain to accompany her sister to the town where the bluebeards have had for many years a very large genteel oldfashioned house so she went to the townhouse where they lived and quarrelled pretty much as usual and though anne often threatened to leave her and go to a boardinghouse of which there were plenty in the place yet after all to live with her sister and drive out in the carriage with the footman and coachman in mourning and the lozenge on the panels with the bluebeard and shacabac arms quartered on it was far more respectable and so the lovely sisters continued to dwell together for a lady under mrs bluebeards circumstances the townhouse has other and peculiar advantages besides being an exceedingly spacious and dismal brick building with a dismal iron railing in front and long dismal thin windows with little panes of glass it looked out into the churchyard where time out of mind between two yewtrees one of which is cut into the form of a peacock while the other represents a dumbwaiter it looked into the churchyard where the monument of the late bluebeard was placed over the family vault it was the first thing the widow saw from her bedroom window in the morning and twas sweet to watch at night from the parlor the pallid moonlight lighting up the bust of the departed and virtue throwing great black shadows athwart it polyanthuses rhododendra ranunculuses and other flowers with the largest names and of the most delightful odors were planted within the little iron railing that enclosed the last restingplace of the bluebeards and the beadle was instructed to half kill any little boys who might be caught plucking these sweet testimonials of a wifes affection over the sideboard in the diningroom hung a fulllength of mr bluebeard by ticklegill r a in a militia uniform frowning down upon the knives and forks and silver trays over the mantelpiece he was represented in a hunting costume on his favorite horse there was a stickingplaster silhouette of him in the widows bedroom and a miniature in the drawingroom where he was drawn in a gown of black and gold holding a goldtasselled trencher cap with one hand and with the other pointing to a diagram of pons asinorum this likeness was taken when he was a fellowcommoner at st johns college cambridge and before the growth of that blue beard which was the ornament of his manhood and a part of which now formed a beautiful blue neckchain for his bereaved wife sister anne said the townhouse was even more dismal than the countryhouse for there was pure air at the hall and it was pleasanter to look out on a park than on a churchyard however fine the monuments might be but the widow said she was a lightminded hussy and persisted as usual in her lamentations and mourning the only male whom she would admit within her doors was the parson of the parish who read sermons to her and as his reverence was at least seventy years old anne though she might be ever so much minded to fall in love had no opportunity to indulge her inclination and the townpeople scandalous as they might be could not find a word to say against the liaison of the venerable man and the heartstricken widow all other company she resolutely refused when the players were in the town the poor manager who came to beg her to bespeak a comedy was thrust out of the gates by the big butler though there were balls cardparties and assemblies widow bluebeard would never subscribe to one of them and even the officers those allconquering heroes who make such ravages in ladies hearts and to whom all ladies doors are commonly open could never get an entry into the widows house captain whiskerfield strutted for three weeks up and down before her house and had not the least effect upon her captain ogrady of an irish regiment attempted to bribe the servants and one night actually scaled the garden wall but all that he got was his foot in a mantrap not to mention being dreadfully scarified by the broken glass and so he never made love any more finally captain blackbeard whose whiskers vied in magnitude with those of the deceased bluebeard himself although he attended church regularly every week he who had not darkened the doors of a church for ten years before even captain blackbeard got nothing by his piety and the widow never once took her eyes off her book to look at him the barracks were in despair and captain whiskerfields tailor who had supplied him with new clothes in order to win the widows heart ended by clapping the captain into jail his reverence the parson highly applauded the widows conduct to the officers but being himself rather of a social turn and fond of a good dinner and a bottle he represented to the lovely mourner that she should endeavor to divert her grief by a little respectable society and recommended that she should from time to time entertain a few grave and sober persons whom he would present to her as dr sly had an unbounded influence over the fair mourner she acceded to his desires and accordingly he introduced to her house some of the most venerable and worthy of his acquaintance all married people however so that the widow should not take the least alarm it happened that the doctor had a nephew who was a lawyer in london and this gentleman came dutifully in the long vacation to pay a visit to his reverend uncle he is none of your roystering dashing young fellows said his reverence he is the delight of his mamma and sisters he never drinks anything stronger than tea he never missed church thrice a sunday for these twenty years and i hope my dear and amiable madam that you will not object to receive this pattern of young men for the sake of your most devoted friend his uncle the widow consented to receive mr sly he was not a handsome man certainly but what does that matter said the doctor he is good and virtue is better than all the beauty of all the dragoons in the queens service mr sly came there to dinner and he came to tea and he drove out with the widow in the carriage with the lozenge on it and at church he handed the psalmbook and in short he paid her every attention which could be expected from so polite a young gentleman at this the town began to talk as people in towns will the doctor kept all bachelors out of the widows house said they in order that that ugly nephew of his may have the field entirely to himself these speeches were of course heard by sister anne and the little minx was not a little glad to take advantage of them in order to induce her sister to see some more cheerful company the fact is the young hussy loved a dance or a game at cards much more than a humdrum conversation over a teatable and so she plied her sister day and night with hints as to the propriety of opening her house receiving the gentry of the county and spending her fortune to this point the widow at length though with many sighs and vast unwillingness acceded and she went so far as to order a very becoming halfmourning in which all the world declared she looked charming i carry said she my blessed bluebeard in my heart that is in the deepest mourning for him and when the heart grieves there is no need of outward show so she issued cards for a little quiet tea and supper and several of the best families in the town and neighborhood attended her entertainment it was followed by another and another and at last captain blackbeard was actually introduced though of course he came in plain clothes dr sly and his nephew never could abide the captain they had heard some queer stories they said about proceedings in barracks who was it that drank three bottles at a sitting who had a mare that ran for the plate and why was it that dolly coddlins left the town so suddenly mr sly turned up the whites of his eyes as his uncle asked these questions and sighed for the wickedness of the world but for all that he was delighted especially at the anger which the widow manifested when the dolly coddlins affair was hinted at she was furious and vowed she would never see the wretch again the lawyer and his uncle were charmed o shortsighted lawyer and parson do you think mrs bluebeard would have been so angry if she had not been jealous do you think she would have been jealous if she had not had not what she protested that she no more cared for the captain than she did for one of her footmen but the next time he called she would not condescend to say a word to him my dearest miss anne said the captain as he met her in sir roger de coverley she herself was dancing with ensign trippet what is the matter with your lovely sister dolly coddlins is the matter said miss anne mr sly has told all and she was down the middle in a twinkling the captain blushed so at this monstrous insinuation that any one could see how incorrect it was he made innumerable blunders in the dance and was all the time casting such ferocious glances at mr sly who did not dance but sat by the widow and ate ices that his partner thought he was mad and that mr sly became very uneasy when the dance was over he came to pay his respects to the widow and in so doing somehow trod so violently on mr slys foot that that gentleman screamed with pain and presently went home but though he was gone the widow was not a whit more gracious to captain blackbeard she requested mr trippet to order her carriage that night and went home without uttering one single word to captain blackbeard the next morning and with a face of preternatural longitude the rev dr sly paid a visit to the widow the wickedness and bloodthirstiness of the world said he increase every day o my dear madam what monsters do we meet in it what wretches what assassins are allowed to go abroad would you believe it that this morning as my nephew was taking his peaceful morningmeal one of the ruffians from the barracks presented himself with a challenge from captain blackbeard is he hurt screamed the widow no my dear friend my dear frederick is not hurt and o what a joy it will be to him to think you have that tender solicitude for his welfare you know i have always had the highest respect for him said the widow who when she screamed was in truth thinking of somebody else but the doctor did not choose to interpret her thoughts in that way and gave all the benefit of them to his nephew that anxiety dearest madam which you express for him emboldens me encourages me authorizes me to press a point upon you which i am sure must have entered your thoughts ere now the dear youth in whom you have shown such an interest lives but for you yes fair lady start not at hearing that his sole affections are yours and with what pride shall i carry to him back the news that he is not indifferent to you are they going to fight continued the lady in a breathless state of alarm for heavens sake dearest doctor prevent the horrid horrid meeting send for a magistrates warrant do anything but do not suffer those misguided young men to cut each others throats fairest lady i fly said the doctor and went back to lunch quite delighted with the evident partiality mrs bluebeard showed for his nephew and mrs bluebeard not content with exhorting him to prevent the duel rushed to mr pound the magistrate informed him of the facts got out warrants against both mr sly and the captain and would have put them into execution but it was discovered that the former gentleman had abruptly left town so that the constable could not lay hold of him it somehow however came to be generally known that the widow bluebeard had declared herself in favor of mr sly the lawyer that she had fainted when told her lover was about to fight a duel finally that she had accepted him and would marry him as soon as the quarrel between him and the captain was settled dr sly when applied to hummed and had and would give no direct answer but he denied nothing and looked so knowing that all the world was certain of the fact and the county paper next week stated we understand that the lovely and wealthy mrs bl b rd is about once more to enter the bands of wedlock with our distinguished townsman frederick s y esq of the middle temple london the learned gentleman left town in consequence of a dispute with a gallant son of mars which was likely to have led to warlike results had not a magistrates warrant intervened when the captain was bound over to keep the peace in fact as soon as the captain was so bound over mr sly came back stating that he had quitted the town not to avoid a duel far from it but to keep out of the way of the magistrates and give the captain every facility he had taken out no warrant he had been perfectly ready to meet the captain if others had been more prudent it was not his fault so he held up his head and cocked his hat with the most determined air and all the lawyers clerks in the place were quite proud of their hero as for captain blackbeard his rage and indignation may be imagined a wife robbed from him his honor put in question by an odious lanky squinting lawyer he fell ill of a fever incontinently and the surgeon was obliged to take a quantity of blood from him ten times the amount of which he swore he would have out of the veins of the atrocious sly the announcement in the mercury however filled the widow with almost equal indignation the widow of the gallant bluebeard she said marry an odious wretch who lives in dingy chambers in the middle temple send for dr sly the doctor came she rated him soundly asked him how he dared set abroad such calumnies concerning her ordered him to send his nephew back to london at once and as he valued her esteem as he valued the next presentation to a fat living which lay in her gift to contradict everywhere and in the fullest terms the wicked report concerning her my dearest madam said the doctor pulling his longest face you shall be obeyed the poor lad shall be acquainted with the fatal change in your sentiments change in my sentiments dr sly with the destruction of his hopes rather let me say and heaven grant that the dear boy have strength to bear up against the misfortune which comes so suddenly upon him the next day sister anne came with a face full of care to mrs bluebeard o that unhappy lover of yours said she is the captain unwell exclaimed the widow no it is the other answered sister anne poor poor mr sly he made a will leaving you all except five pounds a year to his laundress he made his will locked his door took heartrending leave of his uncle at night and this morning was found hanging at his bedpost when sambo the black servant took him up his water to shave let me be buried he said with the pincushion she gave me and the locket containing her hair did you give him a pincushion sister did you give him a locket with your hair it was only silvergilt sobbed the widow and now o heavens i have killed him the heartrending nature of her sobs may be imagined but they were abruptly interrupted by her sister killed him no such thing sambo cut him down when he was as black in the face as the honest negro himself he came down to breakfast and i leave you to fancy what a touching meeting took place between the nephew and the uncle so much love thought the widow what a pity he squints so if he would but get his eyes put straight i might perhaps she did not finish the sentence ladies often leave this sort of sentence in a sweet confusion but hearing some news regarding captain blackbeard whose illness and bloodletting were described to her most pathetically as well as accurately by the scotch surgeon of the regiment her feelings of compassion towards the lawyer cooled somewhat and when dr sly called to know if she would condescend to meet the unhappy youth she said in rather a distrait manner that she wished him every happiness that she had the highest regard and respect for him that she besought him not to think any more of committing the dreadful crime which would have made her unhappy forever but that she thought for the sake of both parties they had better not meet until mr slys feelings had grown somewhat more calm poor fellow poor fellow said the doctor may he be enabled to bear his frightful calamity i have taken away his razors from him and sambo my man never lets him out of his sight the next day mrs bluebeard thought of sending a friendly message to dr slys asking for news of the health of his nephew but as she was giving her orders on that subject to john thomas the footman it happened that the captain arrived and so thomas was sent down stairs again and the captain looked so delightfully interesting with his arm in a sling and his beautiful black whiskers curling round a face which was paler than usual that at the end of two hours the widow forgot the message altogether and indeed i believe asked the captain whether he would not stop and dine ensign trippet came too and the party was very pleasant and the military gentlemen laughed hugely at the idea of the lawyer having been cut off the bedpost by the black servant and were so witty on the subject that the widow ended by half believing that the bedpost and hanging scheme on the part of mr sly was only a feint a trick to win her heart though this to be sure was not agreed to by the lady without a pang for entre nous to hang ones self for a lady is no small compliment to her attractions and perhaps mrs bluebeard was rather disappointed at the notion that the hanging was not a bona fide strangulation however presently her nerves were excited again and she was consoled or horrified as the case may be the reader must settle the point according to his ideas and knowledge of womankind she was at any rate dreadfully excited by the receipt of a billet in the wellknown clerklike hand of mr sly it ran thus i saw you through your diningroom windows you were hobnobbing with captain blackbeard you looked rosy and well you smiled you drank off the champagne at a single draught i can bear it no more live on smile on and be happy my ghost shall repine perhaps at your happiness with another but in life i should go mad were i to witness it it is best that i should be gone when you receive this tell my uncle to drag the fishpond at the end of bachelors acre his black servant sambo accompanies me it is true but sambo shall perish with me should his obstinacy venture to restrain me from my purpose i know the poor fellows honesty well but i also know my own despair sambo will leave a wife and seven children be kind to those orphan mulattoes for the sake of frederick the widow gave a dreadful shriek and interrupted the two captains who were each just in the act of swallowing a bumper of claret fly fly save him she screamed save him monsters ere it is too late drowned frederick bachelors wa syncope took place and the rest of the sentence was interrupted deucedly disappointed at being obliged to give up their wine the two heroes seized their cocked hats and went towards the spot which the widow in her wild exclamations of despair had sufficiently designated trippet was for running to the fishpond at the rate of ten miles an hour take it easy my good fellow said captain blackbeard running is unwholesome after dinner and if that squinting scoundrel of a lawyer does drown himself i shant sleep any the worse so the two gentlemen walked very leisurely on towards the bachelors walk and indeed seeing on their way thither major macabaw looking out of the window at his quarters and smoking a cigar they went up stairs to consult the major as also a bottle of schiedam he had they come not said the widow when restored to herself o heavens grant that frederick is safe sister anne go up to the leads and look if anybody is coming and up accordingly to the garrets sister anne mounted do you see anybody coming sister anne i see dr drenchs little boy said sister anne he is leaving a pill and draught at miss molly grubs dearest sister anne dont you see any one coming shouted the widow once again i see a flock of dust no a cloud of sheep pshaw i see the london coach coming in there are three outsides and the guard has flung a parcel to mrs jenkinss maid distraction look once more sister anne i see a crowd a shutter a shutter with a man on it a beadle forty little boys gracious goodness what can it be and down stairs tumbled sister anne and was looking out of the parlorwindow by her sisters side when the crowd she had perceived from the garret passed close by them at the head walked the beadle slashing about at the little boys two scores of these followed and surrounded a shutter carried by four men on the shutter lay frederick he was ghastly pale his hair was draggled over his face his clothes stuck tight to him on account of the wet streams of water gurgled down the shuttersides but he was not dead he turned one eye round towards the window where mrs bluebeard sat and gave her a look which she never could forget sambo brought up the rear of the procession he was quite wet through and if anything would have put his hair out of curl his ducking would have done so but as he was not a gentleman he was allowed to walk home on foot and as he passed the widows window he gave her one dreadful glance with his goggling black eyes and moved on pointing with his hands to the shutter john thomas the footman was instantly despatched to dr slys to have news of the patient there was no shillyshallying now he came back in half an hour to say that mr frederick flung himself into bachelors acre fishpond with sambo had been dragged out with difficulty had been put to bed and had a pint of white wine whey and was pretty comfortable thank heaven said the widow and gave john thomas a sevenshilling piece and sat down with a lightened heart to tea what a heart said she to sister anne and o what a pity it is that he squints here the two captains arrived they had not been to the bachelors walk they had remained at major macabaws consulting the schiedam they had made up their minds what to say hang the fellow he will never have the pluck to drown himself said captain blackbeard let us argue on that as we may safely my sweet lady said he accordingly we have had the pond dragged no mr sly and the fisherman who keeps the punt assures us that he has not been there all day audacious falsehood said the widow her eyes flashing fire go heartless man who dares to trifle thus with the feelings of a respectable and unprotected woman go sir youre only fit for the love of a dolly coddlins she pronounced the coddlins with a withering sarcasm that struck the captain aghast and sailing out of the room she left her tea untasted and did not wish either of the military gentlemen good night but gentles an ye know the delicate fibre of womans heart ye will not in very sooth believe that such events as those we have described such tempests of passion fierce winds of woe blinding lightnings of tremendous joy and tremendous grief could pass over one frail flower and leave it all unscathed no grief kills as joy doth doth not the scorching sun nip the rosebud as well as the bitter wind as mrs sigourney sweetly sings ah the heart is a soft and a delicate thing ah the heart is a lute with a thrilling string a spirit that floats on a gossamers wing such was fatimas heart in a word the preceding events had a powerful effect upon her nervous system and she was ordered much quiet and salvolatile by her skilful medical attendant dr glauber to be so ardently passionately loved as she was to know that frederick had twice plunged into death from attachment to her was to awaken in her bosom a thrilling string indeed could she witness such attachment and not be touched by it she was touched by it she was influenced by the virtues by the passion by the misfortunes of frederick but then he was so abominably ugly that she could not she could not consent to become his bride she told dr sly so i respect and esteem your nephew said she but my resolve is made i will continue faithful to that blessed saint whose monument is ever before my eyes she pointed to the churchyard as she spoke leave this poor tortured heart in quiet it has already suffered more than most hearts could bear i will repose under the shadow of that tomb until i am called to rest within it to rest by the side of my bluebeard the ranunculuses rhododendra and polyanthuses which ornamented that mausoleum had somehow been suffered to run greatly to seed during the last few months and it was with no slight selfaccusation that she acknowledged this fact on visiting the garden of the grave as she called it and she scolded the beadle soundly for neglecting his duty towards it he promised obedience for the future dug out all the weeds that were creeping round the family vault and having charge of the key entered that awful place and swept and dusted the melancholy contents of the tomb next morning the widow came down to breakfast looking very pale she had passed a bad night she had had awful dreams she had heard a voice call her thrice at midnight pooh my dear its only nervousness said sceptical sister anne here john thomas the footman entered and said the beadle was in the hall looking in a very strange way he had been about the house since daybreak and insisted on seeing mrs bluebeard let him enter said that lady prepared for some great mystery the beadle came he was pale as death his hair was dishevelled and his cocked hat out of order what have you to say said the lady trembling before beginning he fell down on his knees yesterday said he according to your ladyships orders i dug up the flowerbeds of the family vault dusted the vault and the the coffins added he trembling inside me and john sexton did it together and polished up the plate quite beautiful for heavens sake dont allude to it cried the widow turning pale well my lady i locked the door came away and found in my hurry for i wanted to beat two little boys what was playing at marbles on alderman paunchs monyment i found my lady id forgot my cane i couldnt get john sexton to go back with me till this morning and i didnt like to go alone and so we went this morning and what do you think i found i found his honors coffin turned round and the cane broke in two heres the cane ah screamed the widow take it away take it away well what does this prove said sister anne but that somebody moved the coffin and broke the cane somebody whos somebody said the beadle staring round about him and all of a sudden he started back with a tremendous roar that made the ladies scream and all the glasses on the sideboard jingle and cried thats the man he pointed to the portrait of bluebeard which stood over the jingling glasses on the sideboard thats the man i saw last night walking round the vault as im a living sinner i saw him awalking round and round and when i went up to speak to him im blessed if he didnt go in at the iron gate which opened afore him like like winking and then in at the vault door which id doublelocked my lady and bolted inside ill take my oath on it perhaps you had given him the key suggested sister anne its never been out of my pocket here it is cried the beadle ill have no more to do with it and he flung down the ponderous key amidst another scream from widow bluebeard at what hour did you see him gasped she at twelve oclock of course it must have been at that very hour said she i heard the voice what voice said anne a voice that called fatima fatima fatima three times as plain as ever voice did it didnt speak to me said the beadle it only nodded its head and wagged its head and beard w w was it a bl ue beard said the widow powderblue maam as ive a soul to save dr drench was of course instantly sent for but what are the medicaments of the apothecary in a case where the grave gives up its dead dr sly arrived and he offered ghostly ah too ghostly consolation he said he believed in them his own grandmother had appeared to his grandfather several times before he married again he could not doubt that supernatural agencies were possible even frequent suppose he were to appear to me alone ejaculated the widow i should die of fright the doctor looked particularly arch the best way in these cases my dear madam said he the best way for unprotected ladies is to get a husband i never heard of a first husbands ghost appearing to a woman and her second husband in my life in all history there is no account of one ah why should i be afraid of seeing my bluebeard again said the widow and the doctor retired quite pleased for the lady was evidently thinking of a second husband the captain would be a better protector for me certainly than mr sly thought the lady with a sigh but mr sly will certainly kill himself and will the captain be a match for two ghosts sly will kill himself but ah the captain wont and the widow thought with pangs of bitter mortification of dolly coddlins how how should these distracting circumstances be brought to an end she retired to rest that night not without a tremor to bed but not to sleep at midnight a voice was heard in her room crying fatima fatima fatima in awful accents the doors banged to and fro the bells began to ring the maids went up and down stairs skurrying and screaming and gave warning in a body john thomas as pale as death declared that he found bluebeards yeomanry sword that hung in the hall drawn and on the ground and the stickingplaster miniature in mr bluebeards bedroom was found turned topsyturvy it is some trick said the obstinate and incredulous sister anne tonight i will come and sleep with you sister and the night came and the two sisters retired together twas a wild night the wind howling without went crashing through the old trees of the old rookery round about the old church the long bedroom windows went thump thumping the moon could be seen through them lighting up the graves with their ghastly shadows the yewtree cut into the shape of a bird looked particularly dreadful and bent and swayed as if it would peck something off that other yewtree which was of the shape of a dumbwaiter the bells at midnight began to ring as usual the doors clapped jingle jingle down came a suit of armor in the hall and a voice came and cried fatima fatima fatima look look look the tomb the tomb the tomb she looked the vault door was open and there in the moonlight stood bluebeard exactly as he was represented in the picture in his yeomanry dress his face frightfully pale and his great blue beard curling over his chest as awful as mr muntzs sister anne saw the vision as well as fatima we shall spare the account of their terrors and screams strange to say john thomas who slept in the attic above his mistresss bedroom declared he was on the watch all night and had seen nothing in the churchyard and heard no sort of voices in the house and now the question came what could the ghost want by appearing is there anything exclaimed the unhappy and perplexed fatima that he would have me do it is well to say now now now and to show himself but what is it that makes my blessed husband so uneasy in his grave and all parties consulted agreed that it was a very sensible question john thomas the footman whose excessive terror at the appearance of the ghost had procured him his mistresss confidence advised mr screw the butler who communicated with mrs baggs the housekeeper who condescended to impart her observations to mrs bustle the ladysmaid john thomas i say decidedly advised that my lady should consult a cunning man there was such a man in town he had prophesied who should marry his john thomass cousin he had cured farmer horns cattle which were evidently bewitched he could raise ghosts and make them speak and he therefore was the very person to be consulted in the present juncture what nonsense is this you have been talking to the maids john thomas about the conjurer who lives in in in hangmans lane maam where the gibbet used to stand replied john who was bringing in the muffins its no nonsense my lady every word as that man says comes true and he knows everything i desire you will not frighten the girls in the servants hall with any of those silly stories said the widow and the meaning of this speech may of course at once be guessed it was that the widow meant to consult the conjurer that very night sister anne said that she would never under such circumstances desert her dear fatima john thomas was summoned to attend the ladies with a dark lantern and forth they set on their perilous visit to the conjurer at his dreadful abode in hangmans lane what took place at that frightful interview has never been entirely known but there was no disturbance in the house on the night after the bells slept quite quietly the doors did not bang in the least twelve oclock struck and no ghost appeared in the churchyard and the whole family had a quiet night the widow attributed this to a sprig of rosemary which the wizard gave her and a horseshoe which she flung into the garden round the family vault and which would keep any ghost quiet it happened the next day that going to her milliners sister anne met a gentleman who has been before mentioned in this story ensign trippet by name and indeed if the truth must be known it somehow happened that she met the ensign somewhere every day of the week what news of the ghost my dearest miss shacabac said he you may guess on what terms the two young people were by the manner in which mr trippet addressed the lady has bluebeards ghost frightened your sister into any more fits or set the bells aringing sister anne with a very grave air told him that he must not joke on so awful a subject that the ghost had been laid for a while that a cunning man had told her sister things so wonderful that any man must believe in them that among other things he had shown to fatima her future husband had said the ensign he black whiskers and a red coat no answered anne with a sigh he had red whiskers and a black coat it cant be that rascal sly cried the ensign but anne only sighed more deeply and would not answer yes or no you may tell the poor captain she said there is no hope for him and all he has left is to hang himself he shall cut the throat of sly first though replied mr trippet fiercely but anne said things were not decided as yet fatima was exceedingly restive and unwilling to acquiesce in the idea of being married to mr sly she had asked for further authority the wizard said he could bring her own husband from the grave to point out her second bridegroom who shall be can be must be no other than frederick sly it is a trick said the ensign but anne was too much frightened by the preceding evenings occurrences to say so tonight she said the grave will tell all and she left ensign trippet in a very solemn and affecting way at midnight three figures were seen to issue from widow bluebeards house and pass through the churchyard turnstile and so away among the graves to call up a ghost is bad enough said the wizard to make him speak is awful i recommend you maam to beware for such curiosity has been fatal to many there was one arabian necromancer of my acquaintance who tried to make a ghost speak and was torn in pieces on the spot there was another person who did hear a ghost speak certainly but came away from the interview deaf and dumb there was another never mind says mrs bluebeard all her old curiosity aroused see him and hear him i will havent i seen him and heard him too already when hes audible and visible thens the time but when you heard him said the necromancer he was invisible and when you saw him he was inaudible so make up your mind what you will ask him for ghosts will stand no shillyshallying i knew a stuttering man who was flung down by a ghost and i have made up my mind said fatima interrupting him to ask him what husband you shall take whispered anne fatima only turned red and sister anne squeezed her hand they passed into the graveyard in silence there was no moon the night was pitch dark they threaded their way through the graves stumbling over them here and there an owl was toowhooing from the church tower a dog was howling somewhere a cock began to crow as they will sometimes at twelve oclock at night make haste said the wizard decide whether you will go on or not let us go back sister said anne i will go on said fatima i should die if i gave it up i feel i should heres the gate kneel down said the wizard the women knelt down will you see your first husband or your second husband i will see bluebeard first said the widow i shall know then whether this be a mockery or you have the power you pretend to at this the wizard uttered an incantation so frightful and of such incomprehensible words that it is impossible for any mortal man to repeat them and at the end of what seemed to be a versicle of his chant he called bluebeard there was no noise but the moaning of the wind in the trees and the toowhooing of the owl in the tower at the end of the second verse he paused again and called bluebeard the cock began to crow the dog began to howl a watchman in the town began to cry out the hour and there came from the vault within a hollow groan and a dreadful voice said who wants me kneeling in front of the tomb the necromancer began the third verse as he spoke the former phenomena were still to be remarked as he continued a number of ghosts rose from their graves and advanced round the kneeling figures in a circle as he concluded with a loud bang the door of the vault flew open and there in blue light stood bluebeard in his blue uniform waving his blue sword and flashing his blue eyes round about speak now or you are lost said the necromancer to fatima but for the first time in her life she had not a word to say sister anne too was dumb with terror and as the awful figure advanced towards them as they were kneeling the sister thought all was over with them and fatima once more had occasion to repent her fatal curiosity the figure advanced saying in dreadful accents fatima fatima fatima wherefore am i called from my grave when all of a sudden down dropped his sword down the ghost of bluebeard went on his knees and clasping his hands together roared out murder mercy as loud as man could roar six other ghosts stood round the kneeling group why do you call me from the tomb said the first who dares disturb my grave said the second seize him and away with him cried the third murder mercy still roared the ghost of bluebeard as the whiterobed spirits advanced and caught hold of him its only tom trippet said a voice at annes ear and your very humble servant said a voice well known to mrs bluebeard and they helped the ladies to rise while the other ghosts seized bluebeard the necromancer took to his heels and got off he was found to be no other than mr claptrap the manager of the theatre it was some time before the ghost of bluebeard could recover from the faintingfit into which he had been plunged when seized by the opposition ghosts in white and while they were ducking him at the pump his blue beard came off and he was discovered to be who do you think why mr sly to be sure and it appears that john thomas the footman had lent him the uniform and had clapped the doors and rung the bells and spoken down the chimney and it was mr claptrap who gave mr sly the blue fire and the theatre gong and he went to london next morning by the coach and as it was discovered that the story concerning miss coddlins was a shameful calumny why of course the widow married captain blackbeard dr sly married them and has always declared that he knew nothing of his nephews doings and wondered that he has not tried to commit suicide since his last disappointment mr and mrs trippet are likewise living happily together and this i am given to understand is the ultimate fate of a family in whom we were all very much interested in early life you will say that the story is not probable pshaw isnt it written in a book and is it a whit less probable than the first part of the tale the picnic party by horace smith to give a picnic party a fair chance of success it must be almost impromptu projected at twelve oclock at night at the earliest executed at twelve oclock on the following day at the latest and even then the odds are fearfully against it the climate of england is not remarkable for knowing its own mind nor is the weather so fixed in its resolve but that a bright august moon suspended in a clear sky may be ladyusher to a morn of fog sleet and drizzle then again but this being tender ground we will only hint at the possibility of such a change a lady of the intended party might quit the drawingroom at night in the sweetest humor imaginable and make her appearance at breakfast in a less amiable mood or perhaps prefer taking breakfast in her own room from which notice husbands sometimes infer that such a change has taken place mr claudius bagshaw a retired silk mercer in the vicinity of london determined notwithstanding all these arguments to have a picnic party on the th of august his weddingday on the d of july mr claudius bagshaw after eating his breakfast and reading the morning post looked out of his parlor window to watch the horticultural pursuits of his better part mr bagshaw had become a member of one of the marchofintellectsocieties and was confident that the picnic would turn out a very pleasant thing how fortunate we shall be dear said mr bagshaw how happy we shall be if the weather should be as fine on our weddingday as it is now true love replied mrs bagshaw but this is only the d of july and as the anniversary of our happy day is the th of august the weather may change this proposition mr bagshaw did not attempt to deny the bagshaws were the happiest couple in the world being blessed with the negative blessing of no offspring the stream of their affections was not diverted into little channels but ebbed and flowed in one uninterrupted tide reciprocally from bosom to bosom they never disputed they never quarrelled yes they did sometimes but then it was from a mutual overanxiety to please each was afraid to pronounce a choice or a preference lest it might be disagreeable to the other and hence there occasionally did arise little bickerings and tiffings and miffings which were quite as unpleasant in their effects and sometimes as difficult to settle as quarrels originating in less amiable causes but said mr bagshaw referring to the barometer the instrument for indicating the present state and probable changes of the weather still maintains its elevation and i tell you what dear if the weather should be preposterous on the th of august suppose instead of going into the north as we did last year we migrate into kent or surrey instead of dining at hampstead as we did last year shall we go to greenwich or to putney and eat little fishes whichever you like love was the ladys answer to the sointended question but i put it to your choice dear either or neither please yourself love and you are sure you will please me pshaw but it is for the gratification of your or more properly speaking for your gratification i submit to you an alternative for the purpose of election and you know jane i repudiate indifference even as concerning or applying to trifles you know claudius we have but one wish and that is to please each other so do you decide but mrs bagshaw i must promulgate a request that having as i have no desire but to please you you will how sir would you force me to choose when i am so obedient as to choose that you should have the choice entirely your own way this treatment of me is monstrous and here mrs bagshaw did what is usual and proper for ladies to do on such occasions she burst into tears why then madam to use a strong expression i must say that but a loud rap at the streetdoor prevented the utterance of an expression the force of which would doubtless have humbled mrs claudius bagshaw down to the very dust claudius said the lady hastily drying her eyes that is uncle johns knock well go to gre put greenwich love thats well dear and be assured love that nothing is so adverse to the constitution of what locke emphatically calls the human mind philosophically considered as to persevere in that state of indecision which that whereof but we will not go to either uncle john shall select the locality uncle john was a bachelor of fiftyfive possessing twelve thousand pounds a strong disinclination to part with any of them a good heart and a bad temper good morning t ye good folks as usual i perceive billing and cooing the bagshaws had by this time got together in a corner of the garden and were lovingly occupied in trimming the same pot of sweet peas quite the contrary uncle john said mrs bagshaw claudius and i have just had one of our most desperate quarrels and here the happy pair giggled and exchanged looks which were meant to imply that their most desperate quarrels were mere kittens play and that uncle john did so interpret them he made manifest by a knowing shake of his forefinger the fact is sir jane and i talk of commemorating the annual recurrence of the anniversary of our weddingday at some place a leetle farther in the country but our minds are in a perfect vacuum concerning the identity of the spot now sir will you reduce the place to a mathematical certainty and be one of the party why um no these things are expensive we come home at night with a guinea apiece less in our pockets and i dont see the good of that i have it cried bagshaw well make it a picnic that wont be expensive then im with you bagshaw with all my heart and it shall be al fresco there or anywhere else you please sir gravely replied the learned member of the universalknowledgewarehouse uncle john means in the open air claudius that will be delightful charming rejoined bagshaw it may be inquired why uncle john who objected to the disbursement of a guinea for a days pleasure should so readily have yielded at the suggestion of a picnic uncle john possessed a neat little morocco pocketcase containing a dozen silver spoons and silverhandled knives and forks and although we are told that these implements are of later invention than fingers there is nevertheless a very general bias in their favor for the purpose to which they are applied now uncle john being aware of the prevalence of their employment it was for this reason he never objected to make one of a picnic party for whilst others contributed chickens pigeonpies or wines it being the principle of such parties that each member should furnish something to the feast uncle john invariably contributed the use of his knives forks and spoons the whole morning was spent in debating on who should be invited to partake of this pleasantest thing that ever was and examining into their several pretensions and their powers of contributing to the amusements of the day when at length the honor of nomination was conferred upon the persons following and for the reasons assigned sir thomas and lady grouts because of their title which would give an air to the thing sir thomas formerly a cornchandler having been knighted for carrying up an address in the late reign miss euphemia grouts daughter no who would bring her guitar miss corinna grouts ditto no because she would sing mr and mrs snodgrass mr snodgrass being vicepresident of the grand junction marchofintellect society mr frederick snodgrass their son lately called to the chancery bar who would bring his flute messrs wrench and son eminent dentists the father to be invited because he was charming company and the son a dead bore because the father would be offended if he were not and lastly miss snubbleston a rich maiden lady of fortyfour for no other earthly qualification whatever than her carriage which to use bagshaws words would carry herself and us three and also transplant a large portion of the provender to the place of rendezvous bagshaw having made out a fair copy of this list somewhat in the shape of a bill of parcels this the first step towards the pleasantest thing that ever was was taken with entire satisfaction why bagshaw exclaimed uncle john who had cast up the numbers including our three selves we shall be thirteen the member of the institution perceived the cause of his alarm but having been lectured out of prejudices respecting matters of greater moment than this he prepared a look of ineffable contempt as his only reply however happening to think of uncle johns twelve thousand pounds he suppressed it and just contented himself with and what then sir why then sir that is a risk i wont run and unless we can manage to i have it the very man how came we to forget him the very man you know jack richards the last four words were delivered in a tone implying the utter impossibility of any human creature being unacquainted with jack richards not in the least sir i never heard of him what never heard of ja the thing is impossible everybody knows jack richards the very thing for us such a wit such a wag he is the life and soul of everything should he be unengaged for the th of august but he is so caught up i was invited to meet him at dinner last sunday at joness but he didnt come such a disappointment to us however i shall meet him on thursday at the timss if he should but keep his promise and then but uncle said mrs bagshaw hadnt you better send him an invitation at once ill do better still my dear ill call at his lodgings and if i find him hanging loose ill bring him to dine with you today then turning to bagshaw he added that a man like you shouldnt know jack richards is surprising as this was evidently pointed at mr claudius bagshaw in his capacity of member of a learned body bagshaw pursed up his mouth into a mockmodesty smile and slightly bowed off went uncle john in quest of jack richards and that the pleasantest thing in the world might not suffer by delay off went mr bagshaw to apprize the snodgrasses the groutses and the rest of the nominees and more important still off went the lady to the poulterers to inquire whether he was likely to have any nice pigeons for a pie about the twentythird of next month the dinnerhour arrived and so did uncle john but with a face of unspeakable woe i feared how it would be what cant he be with us on the th inquired both the bagshaws at the same instant he will if he can but he wont promise but today however it serves us right we were unwise to indulge a hope of his coming at so short a notice he has almost engaged himself to you for sunday fortnight though what a creature it is he has given me such a pain in my side something he said that almost killed you with laughing repeat it uncle repeat it why no he didnt say anything particular but he has a knack of poking one in the ribs in his comical way and sometimes he hurts you we intended to describe jack richards at length uncle johns accidental notice of this trait has most probably rendered that trouble unnecessary indeed we feel that we need scarcely add to it that he can sing a devilish good song and everybody knows what is meant by that and imitated the inimitable mathewss imitations of the actors not even excepting his imitation of tate wilkinsons imitation of garrick except the uncertainty of jack richards the result of the mornings occupation was satisfactory bagshaw still retaining his old businesslike habits of activity and industry had contrived to wait on every person named in the list all of whom had promised their attendance and mrs bagshaw had received from the poulterer a positive assurance that he would raise heaven and earth to supply her with pigeons on the d of the ensuing august committees were forthwith summoned first a committee to consider of the whereabout at this after an evening of polite squabbling which had nearly put an end to the project altogether twickenham meadows received the honor of selection nem con as bagshaw said next lest it should happen as it did once happen for want of such preconcert that a picnic party of ten found themselves at their place of meeting with ten fillets of veal and ten hams mr bagshaw called a committee of provender here it was settled that the snodgrasses should contribute four chickens and a tongue the bagshaws their pigeonpie wrench and son a ham sir thomas grouts a hamper of his own choice wine miss snubbleston a basket of fruit and pastry uncle john his silver spoons knives and forks and jack richards his charming company and lastly came the committee for general purposes at this important meeting it was agreed that the party proceed to twickenham by water that to save the trouble of loading and unloading miss snubblestons carriage convey the hampers etc direct to the place appointed the said carriage moreover serving to bring the ladies to town should the evening prove cold that for the watermusic the following programme be adopted on reaching vauxhall bridge the concert to commence with madame pastas grand scena in medea previous to the murder of the children by miss corinna grouts nicholsons grand flute concerto in five sharps by mr frederick snodgrass grand aria with variations guitar by miss euphemia grouts sweet bird accompaniment flute obligato miss c g and mr f s and the dettingen te deum arranged for three voices by mr f s by miss euphemia miss corinna and mr frederick snodgrass the interstices as mr bagshaw called them to be filled up by the amusing talents of the elder wrench and uncle johns friend and lastly that the company do assemble at mr bagshaws on the morning of the th of august at ten oclock precisely in order to have the advantage of the tide both ways three days prior to the important th mr bagshaw went to engage the boat but in a squabble with the boatman mr b got a black eye this was the first mishap restless and impatient though you be depend upon it there is not a day of the whole three hundred and sixtyfive will put itself in the slightest degree out of the way or appear one second before its appointed time for your gratification o that people would consider this and await events with patience certainly mr bagshaw did not the night of the d to him appeared an age his repeater was in his hand every ten minutes he thought the morning would never dawn but he was mistaken it did and as fine a morning as if it had been made on purpose to favor his excursion by six oclock he was dressed by eight the contributions from all the members had arrived and were ranged in the passage there was their own pigeonpie carefully packed in brown paper and straw sir thomass hamper of his own choice wine and the rest everything promised fairly the young ladies and mr frederick had had thirty rehearsals of their grand arias and concertos and were perfect to a demisemiquaver jack richards would certainly come and the only drawback upon mr bagshaws personal enjoyment but nothing in this world is perfect was the necessity he was under of wearing his green shade which would totally deprive him of the pleasure of contemplating the beauties of the thames scenery a thing he had set his heart upon nine ten no one here yet jane my love we shall infallibly lose the tide and for the next quarter of an hour the place of the poor repeater was no sinecure a knock mr and mrs snodgrass and mr frederick another the whole family of the groutses next came mr charles wrench bless us mr charles said bagshaw where is your father now mr wrench senior was an agreeable old dentist always gay generally humorous sometimes witty he could sketch characters as well as draw teeth and on occasions of this kind was invaluable the son was a mere donkey a silly simpering welldressed young gentleman the owner of no more than the eighth of an idea and of a very fine set of teeth which he constantly exhibited like a sign or advertisement of his shop appended to everything he uttered were a preface and postscript in the form of a sort of billygoat grin he he he he fayther regrets emezingly he caint come being called to attend the duchess of dilborough he he he he as we have already said that it was in pure compliment to the father that the son was invited and not at all for the sake of his own company his presence was a grievous aggravation of the disappointment the next knock announced miss snubbleston but where was her carriage why it had been newly varnished and they might scratch her panels with the hampers and then she was afraid of her springs so here was miss snubbleston without her carriage for the convenience of which alone she had been invited considered by the rest in exactly the same light as young mr wrench without old mr wrench id est a damper a new arrangement was the necessary consequence and the baskets under the superintendence of a servant were jolted down in a hackneycoach to be embarked at westminster but miss snubbleston brought with her a substitute which was by no means a compensation cupid her wretched little barking yelping dutch pug had eaten something that had disagreed with him and his fair mistress would not for worlds have left him at home while he was so indisposed well no one chose to be the first to object to the intruder so cupid was received but where can uncle john and his friend be we shall lose the tide thats certain was scarcely uttered by mr bagshaw when in came our uncle together with the longexpected jack richards the usual introductions over mr richards saluted everybody with the selfsufficient swagger of a vulgar lion the day smiles auspicious sir said bagshaw who thought it requisite he should throw off something fine to so celebrated a person smile a broad grin i call it sir and here was a general laugh o excellent capital uncle john proud of his friend whispered in bagshaws ear you see jacks beginning and now hats and gloves were in motion you have got your flute frederick yes mother was the reply lau ma cried miss corinna if i havent come without sweet bird and my scena from medea i declare as these were indispensable to the amusements of the day a servant was despatched for them he couldnt be gone longer than half an hour half an hour thought bagshaw tis eleven now and the tide but the servant was absent a few minutes beyond the halfhour and poor bagshaw suffered severely from that gnawing impatience amounting almost to pain which every mothers son of us has experienced upon occasions of greater or less importance than this they were again at the very point of starting when a message was brought to mrs snodgrass that little master charles had cut his thumb dreadfully what was to be done mrs snodgrass vowed she shouldnt be easy in her mind the whole day unless she knew the extent of the mischief and as they only lived in euston square and she could be there and back again in twenty minutes she would herself go see what really was the matter and away she went twenty minutes during all this time bagshaw but who would attempt to describe anguish indescribable at length he was relieved by the return of mrs snodgrass but to the horror and consternation of himself and of all present she introduced the aforesaid master charles an ugly illtempered blubbering little brat of seven years old with a bloated red face scrubby white hair and red eyes and with the interesting appendage of a thick slice of bread and butter in his hand im sure youll pardon this liberty said the affectionate mamma but poor charley has cut himself very much and he would not be pacified till i consented to take him with us he has promised to be very good there dont cry any more darling and accordingly the urchin roared with tenfold vigor there were no particular manifestations of joy at this arrival and it is just possible although nothing was uttered to that effect that there did exist a general and cordial wish that young master snodgrass were sprawling at the bottom of the deepest well in england uncle john indeed did utter something about the pug and the child two such nuisances people bringing their brats into grownup company at length the procession set out the bagshaws uncle john and jack richards bringing up the rear in a hackneycoach on reaching the corner of the street mrs bagshaw called out to the driver to stop what is the matter dear said bagshaw your eyelotion love well never mind that sweet claudius i shall be miserable if you go without it dr nooth desired you would use it every two hours i must insist now for my sake love such an eye as he has got mr richards so away went bagshaw to the lake of lausanne lodge for the lotion which as it always happens when folks are in a hurry it took him a quarter of an hour to find they were now fairly on the road what a smell of garlic exclaimed uncle john it is intolerable dear me said mr richards do you perceive it tis a fine italian sausage i bought at morels as my contribution we shall find it an excellent relish in the country and he exhibited his purchase enveloped in a brown paper pha shocking tis a perfect nuisance put it into your pocket again or throw it out at the window but mr richards preferred obeying the first command apropos of contributions uncle have you brought your spoons here they are replied uncle at the same time drawing from his pocket a parcel in size and form very closely resembling mr richardss offensive contribution on arriving at westminster bridge they found the rest of the party already seated in the barge and the first sound that saluted their ears was an intimation that owing to their being two hours behind time it was now past twelve they should hardly save the tide i knew it would be so said bagshaw with more of discontent than he had thought to experience considering the pains he had taken that everything should be well ordered as uncle john was stepping into the boat richards with great dexterity exchanged parcels with him putting the italian sausage into uncle johns pocket and the spoons into his own enhancing the wit of the manoeuvre by whispering to the bagshaws who with infinite delight had observed it hang me said richards but he shall have enough of the garlic the old gentleman was quite unconscious of the operation as richards adroitly diverted his attention from it by giving him one of his facetious pokes in the ribs which nearly bent him double and drew a roar of laughter from every one else just as they were pushing off their attention was attracted by a loud howling it proceeded from a large newfoundland dog which was standing at the waters edge confound it cried richards thats my carlo he has followed me unperceived all the way from home i would not lose him for fifty pounds i must take him back pray put me ashore this is very provoking though he is a very quiet dog there was no mistaking this hint already were there two nuisances on board master charles and the dutch pug but as they were to choose between jack richards with his dog or no jack richards or in other words no life and soul of the party it was presently decided that carlo should be invited to a seat on the hampers which were stowed at the head of the boat uncle john having first extracted from mr richards an assurance that their new guest would lie there as still as a mouse this complaisance was amply rewarded by a speedy display of mr richardss powers of entertainment as soon as they reached the middle of the river jack richards suddenly jumped up for the purpose of frightening miss snubbleston a jest at which everybody else would have laughed had not their own lives been endangered by it even his great admirer suggested to him that once of that was enough his next joke was one of a more intellectual character though he had never till this day seen sir thomas he had accidentally heard something about his former trade what is the difference between lord eldon and sir thomas grouts nobody could tell one is an exchancellor the other is an exchandler everybody laughed except the grouts family this was succeeded by another thrust in uncle johns side after which came a pun which we shall not record as the effect of it was to force the ladies to cough and look into the water the gentlemen to look at each other and mrs snodgrass to whisper to mrs bagshaw who is this mr richards indeed there would have been no end to his pleasantries had they not been interrupted by a request that miss corinna would open the concert as they were fast approaching vauxhall bridge mr bagshaw looking at the programme which he had drawn out on paper ruled with red and blue lines objected to this as it would disturb the previous arrangement according to which the concert was not to commence till they were through the bridge this objection was overruled and the fair corinna unrolled the music for which the servant had been despatched with so much haste miss corinna screamed what was the matter they had not sent the grand scena from medea after all but a wrong piece and the pains she had taken to be perfect in it could not miss corinna sing it from memory impossible how careless of you corinna then sing what they have sent why ma said corinna with tears in her eyes and holding up the unfortunate sheets why bless me ma i cant sing the overture to der freyschutz the difficulty of such a performance being readily admitted mr frederick snodgrass declared himself but too happy to comply with the calls for his concerto in five sharps which stood next on the list and with the air of one well satisfied that an abundance of admiration and applause would reward his efforts he drew forth his flute when lo one of the joints was missing this accident was nearly fatal to the musical entertainments of the day for not only was the concerto thereby rendered impracticable but sweet bird with the fluteaccompaniment obligato was put hors de combat disappointment having by this been carried to its uttermost bounds the announcement that two strings of the guitar had gone was received with an indifference almost stoical and every one was grateful to miss euphemia for so willingly undertaking the whispered menaces of lady grouts being heard by nobody but the young lady herself to do all that could be done under such untoward circumstances she would endeavor to accompany herself through a little ballad but she failed mr claudius bagshaw with all his literature science and philosophy now for the first time wondered how anything could fail so much trouble having been taken to insure success drawing forth his repeater he ahemd and just muttered unaccountable hem upon my word one oclock and no pleasure yet one oclock echoed his spouse then tis time for your eye dear and bagshaw was compelled not only to suffer his damaged optics to be dabbled by his tormentingly affectionate wife but to submit again to be hoodwinked in spite of his entreaties to the contrary and his pathetic assurances that he had not yet seen a bit of the prospect a thing he had set his heart upon now occurred a dead silence of some minutes a steamboat rushed by bagshaw seized this opportunity to make a display of his scientific acquirements and this he did with the greater avidity as he had long wished to astonish vicepresident snodgrass besides in the event of his offering to deliver a course of lectures at the institution the vicepresident might bear evidence to his capabilities for the purpose his acquaintance not only with the facts but with the terms of science whether those terms were always correctly applied we confess ourselves not sufficiently learned to pronounce how wondrous is the science of mechanism how variegated its progeny how simple yet how compound i am propelled to the consideration of this subject by having optically perceived that ingenious nautical instrument which has just now flown along like a mammoth that monster of the deep you ask me how are steamboats propagated in other words how is such an infinite and immovable body inveigled along its course i will explain it to you it is by the power of friction that is to say the two wheels or paddles turning diametrically or at the same moment on the axioms and repressing by the rotundity of their motion the action of the menstruum in which the machine floats water being in a philosophical sense a powerful nonconductor it is clear that in proportion as is the revulsion so is the progression and as is the centrifugal force so is the pooh cried uncle john impatiently let us have some music i have an apprehension bagshaw said the vicepresident that i should not presume to dispute with you that you are wrong in your theory of the centrifugal force of the axioms however we will discuss that point at the grandjunction but come frederick the dettingen te deum frederick and the young ladies having by many rehearsals perfected themselves in the performance of this piece instantly complied scarcely had they reached the fourth bar when jack richards who had not for a long time perpetrated a joke produced a harsh brassytoned german eolina and blew a blast so loud and shrill that the dutch pug began to bark carlo to howl and the other nuisance master charles to cry the german eolina was of itself bad enough but these congregated noises were intolerable uncle john aimed a desperate blow with a large apple which he was just about to bite at the head of carlo who in order to give his lungs fair play was standing on all fours on the hampers the apple missed the dog and went some distance beyond him into the water mr carlo attributing to uncle john a kinder feeling than that which actually prompted the proceeding looked upon it as a goodnatured expedient to afford him an opportunity of adding his mite to the amusements of the day by displaying a specimen of his training without waiting for a second hit he plunged into the river seized the apple and paddling up the side of the boat with the prize triumphantly exhibited in his jaws to the consternation of the whole party he scrambled in between uncle john and his master dropped the apple upon the floor distributed a copious supply of thames water amongst the affrighted beholders squeezed his way through them as best he could and with an air of infinite selfsatisfaction resumed his place on the hampers had mr jack richards the owner of the dog been at the bottom of the thames a week before this delightful th not one of the party mr richards himself excepted would have felt in the slightest degree concerned but since with a common regard to politeness they could not explicitly tell him so they contented themselves with bestowing upon mr carlo every term of opprobrium every form of execration which good manners will allow leaving it to the sagacity of the life and soul of the company to apply them to himself if so it might be agreeable to him poor fellow he felt the awkwardness of his situation and figuratively as well as literally speaking this exploit of his dog threw a damp upon him as it had done upon every one else for some time the picnickers pursued their way in solemn silence at length bagshaw perceiving that there would be very little pleasure if matters were allowed to go on in this way exclaimed an intelligent observer not imbued with the knowledge of our intentions would indicate us to be a combination of perturbed spirits rowed by charon across the river tiber in cases of this kind the essential is to break the ice conversation was now resumed ah ha said the vicepresident sionhouse the residuum of the northumberlands said claudius one of the most genealogical and antique families in england and here having put forth so much classical and historical lore almost in a breath he marked his own satisfaction by a short single cough the vicepresident said nothing but he thought to himself there is much more in this bagshaw than i suspected jack richards was up again come whats done cant be helped but upon my soul i am sorry at being the innocent cause of throwing cold water on the party cold water indeed look at me sir said miss snubbleston with tears in her eyes and exhibiting her cidevant shoulderofmutton sleeves which but half an hour before as stiff and stately as starch could make them were now hanging loose and flabby about her skinny arms too bad jack said uncle john to bring that cursed carlo of yours carlo perceiving that he was the subject of conversation was instantly on his legs his eye steadily fixed upon uncle john evidently expecting a signal for a second plunge the alarm was general and every tongue joined in the scream of lie down sir lie down uncle john who had been more than once offended by the odor from his friends garlic sausage and who had on each and every such occasion vented an exclamation of disgust to the great amusement of mr richards who chuckled with delight to think of the exchange he had secretly effected here in the very middle of the stream resolved to rid himself of the annoyance unperceived by any one he gently drew the parcel from richardss coatpocket and let it drop into the water like king richards pierced coffin once in it soon found the way to the bottom uncle john could scarcely restrain his inclination to laugh aloud however he contrived to assume an air of indifference and whistled part of a tune arrived at twickenham the boatmen were ordered to pull up to a beautiful meadow sloping down to the waters edge there was no time to lose they had had no pleasure yet so bagshaw entreated that every one would put his shoulder to the wheel and be on the qui rala in an instant a large heavy hamper was landed but as in compliance with bagshaws request every one did something to help a scene of confusion was the consequence and numerous pieces of crockery were invalided ere the cloth was properly spread and the dishes plates and glasses distributed but for the feast mr snodgrasss basket was opened and out of it were taken four remarkably fine chickens and a tongue uncooked there was but one mode of accounting for this trifling omission mr snodgrasss betty was a downright matteroffact person who obeyed orders to the very letter having been told the evening before to get four fine chickens for roasting together with a tongue and to pack them next morning in a basket she did so literally and strictly but as she had received no distinct orders to dress them to have done so she would have deemed an impertinent departure from her instructions well since people in a high state of civilization like mr claudius bagshaw and his friends cannot eat raw chickens they did the only thing they could under the circumstances they grumbled exceedingly and put them back again into the basket this was a serious deduction in the important point of quantity and uncle john felt a slight touch of remorse at having thrown as he thought his friends italian sausage into the thames however there was still provision in the garrison but the run of luck in events as at a game of whist may be against you and when it is so be assured that human prudence and foresight remarkable as even mrs bagshaws who bespoke her pigeons seven weeks before she wanted them avail but little when the packages were first stowed in the boat the pigeonpie was inadvertently placed at the bottom and everything else finishing with the large heavy hamper of crockery with carlo on that upon it so that when it was taken up it appeared a chaotic mass of piecrust broken china pigeons brown paper beefsteak eggs and straw now this is enough to provoke a saint said bagshaw and no one attempting to deny the position with this salvo for his own character of philosophic patience he indulged himself in the full expression of his vexation and sorrow after a minute examination he declared the pie to be a complete squash and that nobody could venture to eat it but at the imminent risk of being choked as he was about to throw it over the hedge miss snubbleston seized with an unusual fit of generosity called out to him what are you doing though it isnt fit for us to eat it will be quite a treat to the poor watermen i dare say poor souls they dont often get pigeonpie but the good genius of mr carlo prevailed and the truth of the adage tis an ill wind that blows nobody good was confirmed in his mind as he found himself busily employed in the ingenious operation of separating pigeon from porcelain it was doubtless extremely illbred in one dog not to invite another and cupid expressed his sense of the slight by a longcontinued yell which drew down upon him from the equally disappointed bipeds of the company sundry wishes the positive accomplishment of which would not have tended much to his personal happiness the next basket was opened things were not altogether in a desperate state mr wrenchs ham was in perfect order and that with miss snubblestons salad and some bread and could it be possible after so much preparation and mr bagshaws committee of provender to boot that no one should have thought of so obvious a requisite as bread there would not be time to send mr bagshaw to twickenham town to procure some for it was getting late and if they lost the tide they should be on the water till midnight and they did not like the appearance of the sky which was by no means so blue as it had hitherto been however the want of bread did not much signify they could make a shift with miss snubblestons biscuits and poundcakes but uncle john did not come out on an excursion of pleasure to make shift no more did bagshaw no more did any of the others there was nothing else to be done so where is miss snubblestons basket and where is master charles gracious dont be alarmed the precious rarity is in no danger he was soon discovered behind a tree whither he had dragged the fruit and cakes and was engaged with all his might and main in an endeavor with a piece of stick to force out an apple in this attempt as it was presently seen the interesting child had cracked a bottle the contents of which merely a preparation of oil vinegar and mustard for the salad were quietly dribbling through the poundcakes biscuits and fruit similar aspirations to those which had lately been so cordially expressed for the dutch pug were now most devoutly formed in behalf of master charles this comes of bringing their plaguy brats with them said uncle and bagshaw whilst this scene was going on jack richards perceiving that the service of the table was incomplete bethought him of uncle johns silverhandled knives and forks and spoons he felt first in one pocket and then in the other then he ran down to search the boat then he rummaged the baskets jack my boy hallooed uncle john dont trouble yourself youll never see that again what sir i could not bear the smell of it any longer so i slyly drew it out of your pocket and dexterously let it fall into the deepest part of the thames and here uncle john chuckled and looked about him for applause bless me sir dont say so why bless my heart you dont know before we got into the boat i put the sausage into your pocket and your case of cutlery into my own there was a general burst of laughter against uncle john he turned as pale as nay paler than anything that has ever yet been dragged into the comparison for an instant he stood stockstill then thrust his hand into his pocket drew forth the unfortunate substitute and at the same time exclaiming dtion dashed it violently to the ground he next buttoned his coat from the bottom to the top pulled down his cuffs whispered to his no longer admired jack richards you shall hear from me mr and saying aloud to bagshaw this comes of your confounded party of pleasure sir away he went and returned to town outside a twickenham coach resolving by the way to call out that mr richards and to eject the bagshaws from the snug corner they held in his last will and testament this explosion seemed to have banished pleasure for that day they were all more or less out of humor and instead of making the best of things as they had hitherto done they now made the worst of them sir thomass hamper of his choice wine which by the by he purchased at a cheap shop for the occasion was opened and slices of ham were cut with the only knife and fork jack richards tried to be facetious but it would not do he gave bagshaw a poke in the ribs which was received with a very formal sir i must beg to mr wrench junior he said you have not spoken much today but you have made amends for your silence d ye take your ham is good though your tongue is not worth much instead of laughing mr wrench simpered something about impertinent liberties and satisfaction on being invited by sir thomas to a second glass of his old east india he said that one was a dose had rather not double the cape and at the first glass of champagne he inquired whether there had been a plentiful supply of gooseberries that year in short whether it were that the company knew not how to appreciate his style of wit and pleasantry or that he was in reality a very disagreeable person the fact is that but hold let us say nothing ill of him he died last week at folkestone of a surfeit of goose in the fortyninth year of his age for the consolation of such as were amused by him and regret his loss be it remembered that there are still to be found many jack richards in this world as we have said they now resolved to make the worst of everything the grass was damp the gnats were troublesome carlos nose was in everybodys face cupids teeth at everybodys calves and master charles was ill of the many sour apples it was growing late and no good could come of sitting longer in the open air they reembarked by the time they reached putney it was pitch dark and the tide was setting against them they moved on in mute impatience for there was a slight sprinkling of rain it now fell in torrents master charles grew frightened and screamed cupid yelped and carlo howled accompanied the rest of the way by these pleasing sounds at one in the morning two hours and a half later than they intended they arrived at westminster stairs dull dreary drowsy discontented and drenched father tom and the pope as related by mr michael heffernan master of the national school at tallymactaggart in the county leitrim to a friend during his official visit to dublin for the purpose of studying political economy in the spring of by samuel ferguson i how father tom went to take potluck at the vatican when his rivrence was in room ov coorse the pope axed him to take potlook wid him more be token it was on a friday but for all that there was plenty of mate for the pope gev himself an absolution from the fast on account of the great company that was in it at laste so im tould howandiver theres no fast on the dhrink anyhow glory be to god and so as they wor sitting afther dinner taking their sup together says the pope says he thomaus for the pope you know spakes that away and all as one as ov uz thomaus a lanna says he im tould you welt them english heretics out ov the face you may say that says his rivrence to him again be my soul says he if i put your holiness undher the table you wont be the first pope i floored well his holiness laughed like to split for you know pope was the great prodesan that father tom put down upon purgathory and ov coorse they knew all the ins and outs of the conthravarsy at room faix thomaus says he smiling across the table at him mighty agreeable its no lie what they tell me that yourself is the pleasant man over the dhrop ov good liquor would you like to thry says his rivrence sure and amnt i thrying all i can says the pope sorra betther bottle ov wines betuxt this and salamanca nor theres fornenst you on the table its raal lachrymachrystal every spudh ov it its mortial could says father tom well man alive says the pope sure and heres the best ov good claret in the cut decanther not maining to make little ov the claret your holiness says his rivrence i would prefir some hot wather and sugar wid a glass ov spirits through it if convanient hand me over the bottle of brandy says the pope to his head butler and fetch up the materils says he ah then your holiness says his rivrence mighty eager maybe youd have a dhrop ov the native in your cellar sure its all one throuble says he and troth i dunna how it is but brandy always plays the puck wid my inthrails pon my conscience then says the pope its very sorry i am misther maguire says he that it isnt in my power to plase you for im sure and certaint that theres not as much whiskey in room this blessed minit as ud blind the eye ov a midge well in troth your holiness says father tom i knewn there was no use in axing only says he i didnt know how else to exqueeze the liberty i tuck says he of bringing a small taste says he of the real stuff says he hauling out an imperil quart bottle out ov his coatpocket that never seen the face ov a guager says he setting it down on the table fornenst the pope and if youll jist thry the full ov a thimble ov it and it doesnt rise the cockles ov your holinesss heart why then my name says he isnt tom maguire and with that he outs wid the cork well the pope at first was going to get vexed at father tom for fetching dhrink thataway in his pocket as if there wasnt lashins in the house so says he misther maguire says he id have you to comprehind the differ betuxt an inwitation to dinner from the succissor of saint pether and from a common nagur of a prodesan squirean that maybe hasnt liquor enough in his cupboard to wet more nor his own heretical whistle that may be the way wid them that you wisit in leithrim says he and in roscommon and id let you know the differ in the prisint case says he only that youre a champion ov the church and entitled to laniency so says he as the liquors come let it stay and in troth im curis myself says he getting mighty soft when he found the delightful smell ov the putteen in inwistigating the composition ov distilled liquors its a branch ov natural philosophy says he taking up the bottle and putting it to his blessed nose ah my dear the very first snuff he got ov it he cried out the dear man blessed vargin but it has the divine smell and crossed himself and the bottle half a dozen times running well sure enough its the blessed liquor now says his rivrence and so there can be no harm any way in mixing a dandy of punch and says he stirring up the materils wid his goolden meeddlar for everything at the popes table to the very shcrew for drawing the corks was ov vergin goold if i might make boold says he to spake on so deep a subjic afore your holiness i think it ud considherably whacilitate the inwestigation ov its chemisthry and phwarmaceutics if youd jist thry the laste sup in life ov it inwardly well then suppose i do make the same expiriment says the pope in a much more condescinding way nor youd have expected and wid that he mixes himself a real stiff facer now your holiness says father tom this bein the first time you ever dispinsed them chymicals says he ill jist make bould to lay doun one rule ov orthography says he for conwhounding them secundum mortem whats that says the pope put in the sperits first says his rivrence and then put in the sugar and remember every dhrop ov wather you put in after that spoils the punch glory be to god says the pope not minding a word father tom was saying glory be to god says he smacking his lips i never knewn what dhrink was afore says he it bates the lachymalchrystal out ov the face says he its necthar itself it is so it is says he wiping his epistolical mouth wid the cuff ov his coat pon my secret honor says his rivrence im raally glad to see your holiness set so much to your satiswhaction especially says he as for fear ov accidents i tuck the liberty of fetching the fellow ov that small vesshel says he in my other coatpocket so devil a fear of our running dhry till the butend of the evening anyhow says he dhraw your stool into the fire misther maguire says the pope for faix says he im bent on anilizing the metaphwysics ov this phinomenon come man alive clear off says he youre not dhrinking at all is it dhrink says his rivrence by gorra your holiness says he id dhrink wid you till the cows ud be coming home in the morning so wid that they tackled to to the second fugil apiece and fell into a larned discourse but its time for me now to be off to the lecthir at the boord o my sorra light upon you docther whately wid your plitical econimy and your hydherastatics what the divul use has a poor hedgemasther like me wid sich deep larning as is only fit for the likes ov them two i left over their second tumbler howandiver wishing i was like them in regard ov the sup ov dhrink anyhow i must brake off my norration for the prisint but when i see you again ill tell you how father tom made a hare ov the pope that evening both in theology and the cube root ii how father tom sacked his holiness in theology and logic well the lecthers over and im kilt out and out my bitther curse be upon the man that invinted the same boord i thought onct id fadomed the say ov throuble and that was when i got through fractions at ould mat kavanaghs school in firdramore god be good to poor mats sowl though he did deny the cause the day he suffered but its fluxions itself were set to bottom now sink or shwim may i never die if my head isnt as throughother as anything wid their ordinals and cardinals and begad its all nothing to the econimy lecthir that i have to go to at two oclock howandiver i mustnt forget that we left his rivrence and his holiness sitting fornenst one another in the parlor ov the vatican jist afther mixing their second tumbler when they had got well down into the same they fell as i was telling you into learned discourse for you see the pope was curious to find out whether father tom was the great theologinall that people said and says he mister maguire says he what answer do you make to the heretics when they quote them passidges agin thransubstantiation out ov the fathers says he why says his rivrence as there is no sich passidges i make myself mighty asy about them but if you want to know how i dispose ov them says he just repate one ov them and ill show you how to catapomphericate it in two shakes why then says the pope myself disremimbers the particlar passidges they allidge out ov them ould felleys says he though sure enough theyre more numerous nor edifying so well jist suppose that a heretic was to find sich a saying as this in austin every sensible man knows that thransubstantiation is a lie or this out of tertullian or plutarch the bishop ov rome is a common imposther now tell me could you answer him as easy as kiss says his rivrence in the first were to understand that the exprission every sinsible man signifies simply every man that judges by his nathral sinses and we all know that nobody follying them seven deludhers could ever find out the mysthery thats in it if somebody didnt come in to his assistance wid an eighth sinse which is the only sinse to be depended on being the sinse ov the church so that regarding the first quotation which your holiness has supposed it makes clane for us and teetotally agin the heretics thats the explanation sure enough says his holiness and now what div you say to my being a common imposther faix i think says his rivrence wid all submission to the better judgment ov the learned father that your holiness has quoted hed have been a thrifle nearer the thruth if he had said that the bishop ov rome is the grand imposther and topsawyer in that line over us all what do you mane says the pope getting quite red in the face what would i mane says his rivrence as composed as a docther ov physic but that your holiness is at the head ov all them troth i had amost forgot i wasnt a bishop myself says he the deludher was going to say as the head of all uz that has the gift ov laving on hands for sure says he imposther and imposithir is all one so youre only to undherstand manuum and the job is done auvuich says he if any heretic ud go for to cast up sich a passidge as that agin me id soon give him a plite art ov cutting a stick to welt his own back wid pon my apostolical word says the pope youve cleared up them two pints in a most satiswhactery manner you see says his rivrence by this time they wor mixing their third tumbler the writings of them fathers is to be thrated wid great veneration and it ud be the height ov presumption in any one to sit down to interpret them widout providing himself wid a genteel assortment ov the best figures of rhetoric sich as mettonymy hyperbol cattychraysis prolipsis mettylipsis superbaton pollysyndreton hustheronprotheron prosodypeia and the like in ordher that he may never be at a loss for shuitable sintiments when he comes to their highflown passidges for unless we thrate them fathers liberally to a handsome allowance ov thropes and figures theyd set up heresy at onct so they would its thru for you says the pope the figures ov spache is the pillars ov the church bedad says his rivrence i dunna what wed do widout them at all which one do you prefir says the pope that is says he which figure of spache do you find most usefullest when youre hard set metaphours very good says his rivrence and sos mettonymy and ive known prosodypeia stand to me at a pinch mighty well but for a constancy superbatons the figure for my money devil be in me says he but id prove black white as fast as a horse ud throt wid only a good stick ov superbaton faix says the pope wid a sly look youd need to have it backed i judge wid a small piece of assurance well now jist for that word says his rivrence ill prove it widout aither one or other black says he is one thing and white is another thing you dont conthravene that but everything is aither one thing or another thing i defy the apostle paul to get over that dilemma well if anything be one thing well and good but if it be another thing then its plain it isnt both things and so cant be two things nobody can deny that but what cant be two things must be one thing ergo whether its one thing or another thing its all one but black is one thing and white is another thing ergo black and white is all one quod erat demonsthrandum stop a bit says the pope i cant althegither give in to your second miner no your second major says he and he stopped faix then says he getting confused i dont rightly remimber where it was exactly that i thought i seen the flaw in your premises howsomdiver says he i dont deny that its a good conclusion and one that ud be ov materil service to the church if it was dhrawn wid a little more distinctiveness ill make it as plain as the nose on your holinesss face by superbaton says his rivrence my adversary says black is not another color that is white now thats jist a parallel passidge wid the one out ov tartulion that me and hayes smashed the heretics on in clarendon sthreet this is my body that is the figure ov my body thats a superbaton and we showed that it oughtnt to be read that way at all but this way this figure of my body is my body jist so wid my adversarys proposition it mustnt be undherstood the way it reads by no manner of manes but its to be taken this way black that is white is not another color green if you like or orange by dad for anything i care for my case is proved black that is white lave out the that by sinnalayphy and you have the orthodox conclusion black is white or by convarsion white is black its as clear as mud says the pope bedad says his rivrence im in great humor for disputin tonight i wisht your holiness was a heretic jist for two minutes says he till youd see the flaking id give you well then for the fun o the thing suppose me my namesake if you like says the pope laughing though by jayminy says he hes not one that i take much pride out ov very good devil a bitther joke ever i had says his rivrence come then misther pope says he hould up that purty face ov yours and answer me this question which ud be the biggest lie if i said i seen a turkeycock lying on the broad ov his back and picking the stars out ov the sky or if i was to say that i seen a gandher in the same intherrestin posture raycreating himself wid similar asthronomical experiments answer me that you ould swaddler says he how durst you call me a swaddler sir says the pope forgetting the dear man the part that he was acting dont think to bully me says his rivrence i always daar to spake the truth and its well known that youre nothing but a swaddling ould sent ov a saint says he never letting on to persave that his holiness had forgot what they were agreed on by all thats good says the pope i often hard ov the imperance ov you irish afore says he but i never expected to be called a saint in my own house either by irishman or hottentot ill till you what misther maguire says he if you cant keep a civil tongue in your head you had betther be walking off wid yourself for i beg lave to give you to undherstand that it wont be for the good ov your health if you call me by sich an outprobrious epithet again says he o indeed then things is come to a purty pass says his rivrence the dear funny soul that he ever was when the lik ov you compares one of the maguires ov tempo wid a wild ingine why man alive the maguires was kings ov fermanagh three thousand years afore your grandfather that was the first ov your breed that ever wore shoes and stockings im bound to say in justice to the poor prodesan that this was all spoken by his rivrence by way of a figure ov spache was sint his majestys arrand to cultivate the friendship of prince lee boo in botteney bay o bryan dear says he letting on to cry if you were alive to hear a boddagh sassenagh like this casting up his counthry to me ov the name ov maguire in the name ov god says the pope very solemniously what is the maning ov all this at all at all says he sure says his rivrence whispering to him across the table sure you know were acting a conthrawarsy and you tuck the part ov the prodesan champion you wouldnt be angry wid me im sure for sarving out the heretic to the best ov my ability o begad i had forgot says the pope the goodnatured ould crethur sure enough you were only taking your part as a good milesian catholic ought agin the heretic sassenagh well says he fire away now and ill put up wid as many conthroversial compliments as you plase to pay me well then answer me my question you santimonious ould dandy says his rivrence in troth then says the pope i dunna which ud be the biggest lie to my mind says he the one appears to be about as big a bounce as the other why then you poor simpleton says his rivrence dont you persave that forbye the advantage the gandher ud have in the length ov his neck it ud be next to empossible for the turkeycock lying thataway to see what he was about by rason ov his djollars and other accouthrements hanging back over his eyes the one about as big a bounce as the other o you misfortunate crethur if you had ever larned your a b c in theology youd have known that theres a differ betuxt them two lies so great that begad i wouldnt wondher if it ud make a balance ov five years in purgathory to the sowl that ud be in it ay and if it wasnt that the church is too liberal entirely so she is it ud cost his heirs and succissors betther nor ten pounds to have him out as soon as the other get along man and take half a year at dogmatical theology go and read your dens you poor dunce you raaly says the pope youre making the heretic shoes too hot to hould me i wundher how the prodesans can stand afore you at all dont think to delude me says his rivrence dont think to back out ov your challenge now says he but come to the scratch like a man if you are a man and answer me my question whats the rason now that julius csar and the vargin mary was born upon the one day answer me that if you wouldnt be hissed off the platform well my dear the pope couldnt answer it and he had to acknowledge himself sacked then he axed his rivrence to tell him the rason himself and father tom communicated it to him in latin but as that is a very deep question i never hard what the answer was except that im tould it was so mysterious it made the popes hair stand on end but theres two oclock and ill be late for the lecthir iii how father tom made a hare of his holiness in latin o docther whateley docther whateley im sure ill never die another death if i dont die aither ov consumption or production i ever and always thought that asthronomy was the hardest science that was till now and its no lie im telling you the same asthronomy is a tough enough morsel to brake a mans fast upon and geolidgy is middling and hard too and hydherastatics is no joke but ov all the books ov science that ever was opened and shut that book upon plitical econimy lifts the pins well well if they wait till they persuade me that taking a mans rints out ov the counthry and spinding them in forrain parts isnt doing us out ov the same theyll wait a long time in truth but youre waiting i see to hear how his rivrence and his holiness got on after finishing the disputation i was telling you of well you see my dear when the pope found he couldnt hould a candle to father tom in theology and logic he thought hed take the shine out ov him in latin anyhow so says he misther maguire says he i quite agree wid you that its not lucky for us to be spaking on them deep subjects in sich langidges as the evil spirits is acquainted wid and says he i think it ud be no harm for us to spake from this out in latin says he for fraid the devil ud undherstand what we are saying not a hair i care says father tom whether they undherstand what were saying or not as long as we keep off that last pint we wer discussing and one or two others listners never hear good ov themselves says he and if belzhebub takes anything amiss that aither you or me says in regard ov himself or his faction let him stand forrid like a man and never fear ill give him his answer howandiver if its for a taste ov classic conwersation you are jist to put us in mind ov ould cordarius says he heres at you and wid that he lets fly at his holiness wid his health in latin vesthr sanctitatis salutem volo says he vesthr revirinti salutritati bibo says the pope to him again haith its no joke i tell you to remimber sich a power ov larning heres to you wid the same says the pope in the raal ciceronian nunc poculum alterhum imple says he cum omni jucunditate in vita says his rivrence cum summ concupiscinti et animositate says he as much as to say wid all the veins ov my heart ill do that same and so wid that they mixd their fourth gun apiece aqua vit vesthra sane est liquor admirabilis says the pope verum est pro te its thrue for you says his rivrence forgetting the idyim ov the latin phwraseology in a manner prava est tua latinitas domine says the pope finding fault like wid his etymology parva culpa mihi small blame to me thats says his rivrence nam multum laboro in partibus interioribus says he the dear man that never was at a loss for an excuse quid tibi incommodi says the pope axing him what ailed him habesne id quod anglic vocamus a lookingglass says his rivrence immo habeo speculum splendidissimum subther operculum pyxidis hujus starnutatori says the pope pulling out a beautiful goold snuffbox wid a lookingglass in undher the lid subther operculum pyxidis hujus starnutatorii no starnutatori quam dono accepi ab archduce austhriaco siptuagisima prtherit says he as much as to say that he got the box in a prisint from the queen ov spain last lint if i rightly remimber well father tom laughed like to burst at last says he pather sancte says he sub errore jaces lookingglass apud nos habet significationem quamdam peculiarem ex tempore diei dependentem there was a sthring ov accusatives for yes nam mane speculum sonat says he post prandium vero mat mat mat sorra be in me but i disremimber the classic appellivation ov the same article howandiver his rivrence went on explaining himself in such a way as no scholar could mistake vesica mea says he ab illo ultimo eversore distenditur donec similis est rumpere verbis apertis says he vesthr sanctitatis prsentia salvata aquam facere valde desidhero ho ho ho says the pope grabbing up his box si inquinavisses meam pyxidem excimnicari debuisses hillo anthony says he to his head butler fetch misther maguire a you spoke first says his rivrence jumping off his sate you spoke first in the vernacular i take misther anthony to witness says he what else would you have me to do says the pope quite dogged like to see himself bate thataway at his own waypons sure says he anthony wouldnt undherstand a b from a bulls foot if i spoke to him any other way well then says his rivrence in considheration ov the needcessity says he ill let you off for this time but mind now afther i say prstho the first ov us that spakes a word ov english is the hare prstho neither ov them spoke for near a minit considering wid themselves how they were to begin sich a great thrial ov shkill at last says the pope the blessed man only think how cute it was ov him domine maguire says he valce desidhero certiorem fieri de significatione istius verbi eversor quo jam jam usus es well surely i am the boy for the latin eversor id est cyathus says his rivrence nam apud nos tumbleri seu eversores dicti sunt ab evertendo ceremoniam inter amicos non ut temperanti societatis frigidis fautoribus placet ab evertendis ipsis potatoribus its not every masther undher the boord i tell you could carry sich a carload ov the dead langidges in agro vero louthiano et midensi says he nomine gaudent quodam secundum linguam anglicanam significante bombardam seu tormentum quia ex eis tanquam ex telis jaculatoriis liquorem facibus immittere solent etiam inter hreticos illos melanostomos that was a touch ov greek presbyterianos septentrionales qui sunt terribiles potatores cyathi dicti sunt faceres et dimidium cyathi hfaglessus dimidium cyathi ver apud metropolitanos hibernicos dicitur dandy en verbum anglicanum says the pope clapping his hands leporem te fecisti as much as to say that he had made a hare of himself dandus dandus verbum erat says his rivrence o the dear man but its himself that was handy ever and always at getting out ov a hobble dandus verbum erat says he quod dicturus eram cum me intherpillavisti ast ego dico says the pope very sharp quod verbum erat dandy per tibicinem qui coram mose modulatus est says his rivrence id flagellat mundum dandus dixi et tu dicis dandy ergo tu es lepus non ego ah ha saccavi vesthram sanctitatem mendacium est says the pope quite forgetting himself he was so mad at being sacked before the sarvints well if it hadnt been that his holiness was in it father tom ud have given him the contints of his tumbler betuxt the two eyes for calling him a liar and in troth its very well it was in latin the offence was conveyed for if it had been in the vernacular theres no saying what ud ha been the consequence his rivrence was mighty angry anyhow tu senex lathro says he quomodo audes me mendacem prdicare et tu sacrilege nebulo says the pope quomodo audacitatem habeas me dei in terris vicarium lathronem conwiciari interroga circumcirca says his rivrence abi ex dibus meis says the pope abi tu in malam crucem says his rivrence excimnicabo te says the pope diabolus curat says his rivrence anathema sis says the pope oscula meum pod says his rivrence but my dear afore he could finish what he was going to say the pope broke out into the vernacular get out o my house you reprobate says he in sich a rage that he could contain himself widin the latin no longer ha ha ha ho ho ho says his rivrence whos the hare now your holiness o by this and by that ive sacked you clane clane and clever ive done it and no mistake you see what a bit of desate will do wid the wisest your holiness sure it was joking i was on purpose to aggravate you alls fair you know in love law and conthravarsy in troth if id thought youd have taken it so much to heart id have put my head into the fire afore id have said a word to offend you says he for he seen that the pope was very vexed sure god forbid that id say anything agin your holiness barring it was in fun for arent you the father ov the faithful and the thrue vicar ov god upon earth and arent i ready to go down on my two knees this blessed minit and beg your apostolical pardon for every word that i said to your displasement are you in arnest that it is in fun you wer says the pope may i never die if i arent says his rivrence it was all to provoke your holiness to commit a brache ov the latin that i tuck the small liberties i did says he id have you to take care says the pope how you take sich small liberties again or maybe youll provoke me to commit a brache ov the pace well and if i did says his rivrence i know a sartan preparation ov chymicals thats very good for curing a brache either in latinity or friendship whats that says the pope quite mollified and sitting down again at the table that he had ris from in the first pluff of his indignation whats that says he for pon my epistolical davy i think it udnt be asy to bate this miraculous mixthir that weve been thrying to anilize this two hours back says he taking a mighty scientifical swig out ov the bottom ov his tumbler its good for a beginning says his rivrence it lays a very nate foundation for more sarious operation but were now arrived at a pariod ov the evening when its time to proceed wid our shuperstructure by compass and square like free and excipted masons as we both are my times up for the present but ill tell you the rest in the evening at home iv how father tom and his holiness disputed at metaphysics and algebra god be wid the time when i went to the classical seminary ov firdramore when id bring my sod o turf undher my arm and sit down on my shnug boss o straw wid my back to the masther and my shins to the fire and score my sum in divess denominations ov the double rule o three or play fox and geese wid purty jane cruise that sat next me as plisantly as the day was long widout any one so much as saying mikey hefferman whats that youre about for ever since i was in the one lodge wid poor ould mat i had my own way in his school as free as ever i had in my mothers shebeen god be wid them days i say again for its althered times wid me i judge since i got undher carlisle and whateley sich sthrictness sich ordher sich dhrilling and lecthiring and tuthoring as they do get on wid i wisht to gracious the one half ov their rules and regilations was sunk in the say and theyre getting so sthrict too about having fair play for the heretic childer weve to have no more schools in the chapels nor masses in the schools o by this and by that itll never do at all the ould plan was twenty times betther and for my own part if it wasnt that the clargy supports them in a manner and the grants a thing not easily done widout these hard times id see if i couldnt get a sheltered spot nigh hand the chapel and set up again on the good ould principle and faix i think our metropolitan ud stand to me for i know that his graces motto was ever and always that ignorance is the thrue mother ov piety but im running away from my narrative entirely so i am youll plase to ordher up the housekeeper then says father tom to the pope wid a pint ov sweet milk in a skillet and the bulk ov her fist ov butther along wid a dust ov soft sugar in a saucer and ill show you the way of producing a decoction that ill be bound will hunt the thirst out ov every nook and corner in your holinesss blessed carcidge the pope ordhered up the ingredients and they were brought in by the head butler thatll not do at all says his rivrence the ingredients wont combine in due proportion unless ye do as i bid yes send up the housekeeper says he for a faymale hand is ondispinsably necessary to produce the adaption of the particles and the concurrence of the corpuscles widout which you might boil till morning and never fetch the cruds off ov it well the pope whispered to his head butler and by and by up there comes an ould faggot ov a cuillean that was enough to frighten a horse from his oats dont thry for to desave me says his rivrence for its no use i tell yes send up the housekeeper i bid yes i seen her presarving gooseberries in the panthry as i came up she has eyes as black as a sloe says he and cheeks like the rose in june and sorra taste ov this celestial mixthir shall crass the lips ov man or morteal this blessed night till she stirs the same up wid her own delicate little finger misther maguire says the pope its very unproper ov you to spake that way ov my housekeeper i wont allow it sir honor bright your holiness says his rivrence laying his hand on his heart o by this and by that misther maguire says the pope ill have none of your insinivations i dont care who sees my whole household says he i dont care if all the faymales undher my roof was paraded down the high street of room says he o its plain to be seen how little you care who sees them says his rivrence youre afeard now if i was to see your housekeeper that id say she was too handsome no im not says the pope i dont care who sees her says he anthony says he to the head butler bid eliza throw her apron over her head and come up here wasnt that stout in the blessed man well my dear up she came stepping like a threeyearold and blushing like the brake o day for though her apron was thrown over her head as she came forrid till you could barely see the tip ov her chin more be token there was a lovely dimple in it as ive been tould yet she let it shlip abit to one side by chance like jist as she got fornenst the fire and if she wouldnt have given his rivrence a shot if he hadnt been a priest its no matther now my dear says he you must take that skillet and hould it over the fire till the milk comes to a blood hate and the way youll know that will be by stirring it onct or twice wid the little finger ov your right hand afore you put in the butther not that i misdoubt says he but that the same fingers fairer nor the whitest milk that ever came from the tit none of your deludhering talk to the young woman sir says the pope mighty stern stir the posset as he bids you eliza and then be off wid yourself says he i beg your holinesss pardon ten thousand times says his rivrence im sure i meant nothing onproper i hope im uncapable ov any sich dirilection of my duty says he but marciful saver he cried out jumping up on a suddent look behind you your holiness im blest but the rooms on fire sure enough the candle fell down that minit and was near setting fire to the windycurtains and there was some bustle as you may suppose getting things put to rights and now i have to tell you ov a really onpleasant occurrence if i was a prodesan that was in it id say that while the popes back was turned father tom made free wid the two lips of miss eliza but upon my conscience i believe it was a mere mistake that his holiness fell into on account of his being an ould man and not having aither his eyesight or his hearing very parfect at any rate it cant be denied but that he had a sthrong imprission that sich was the case for he wheeled about as quick as thought jist as his rivrence was sitting down and charged him wid the offince plain and plump is it kissing my housekeeper before my face you are you villain says he go down out o this says he to miss eliza and do you be packing off wid you he says to father tom for its not safe so it isnt to have the likes ov you in a house where theres temptation in your way is it me says his rivrence why what would your holiness be at at all sure i wasnt doing no such thing would you have me doubt the evidence ov my sinses says the pope would you have me doubt the testimony of my eyes and ears says he indeed i would so says his rivrence if they pretend to have informed your holiness ov any sich foolishness why says the pope ive seen you afther kissing eliza as plain as i see the nose on your face i heard the smack you gave her as plain as ever i heard thundher and how do you know whether you see the nose on my face or not says his rivrence and how do you know whether what you thought was thundher was thundher at all them operations on the sinses says he comprises only particular corporal emotions connected wid sartain confused perciptions called sinsations and isnt to be depended upon at all if we were to follow them blind guides we might jist as well turn heretics at onct pon my secret word your holiness its neither charitable nor orthodox ov you to set up the testimony ov your eyes and ears agin the characther ov a clergyman and now see how aisy it is to explain all them phwenomena that perplexed you i ris and went over beside the young woman because the skillet was boiling over to help her to save the dhrop ov liquor that was in it and as for the noise you heard my dear man it was neither more nor less nor myself dhrawing the cork out ov this blissid bottle dont offer to thrape that upon me says the pope heres the cork in the bottle still as tight as a wedge i beg your pardon says his rivrence thats not the cork at all says he i dhrew the cork a good two minits ago and its very purtily spitted on the end ov this blessed corkshcrew at this prisint moment howandiver you cant see it because its only its real prisince thats in it but that appearance that you call a cork says he is nothing but the outward spacies and external qualities of the cortical nathur thems nothing but the accidents of the cork that youre looking at and handling but as i tould you afore the real corks dhrew and is here prisint on the end ov this nate little insthrument and it was the noise i made in dhrawing it and nothing else that you mistook for the sound ov the pogue you know there was no conthravening what he said and the pope couldnt openly deny it howandiver he thried to pick a hole in it this way granting says he that there is the differ you say betwixt the reality ov the cork and these cortical accidents and that its quite possible as you allidge that the thrue cork is really prisint on the end ov the shcrew while the accidents keep the mouth ov the bottle stopped still says he i cant undherstand though willing to acquit you how the dhrawing ov the real cork thats onpalpable and widout accidents could produce the accident of that sinsible explosion i heard jist now all i can say says his rivrence is that it was a rale accident anyhow ay says the pope the kiss you gev eliza you mane no says his rivrence but the report i made i dont doubt you says the pope no cork could be dhrew with less noise says his rivrence it would be hard for anything to be less nor nothing barring algebra says the pope i can prove to the conthrary says his rivrence this glass ov whiskey is less nor that tumbler ov punch and that tumbler ov punch is nothing to this jug ov scaltheen do you judge by superficial misure or by the liquid contents says the pope dont stop me betwixt my premises and my conclusion says his rivrence ergo this glass ov whiskey is less nor nothing and for that raison i see no harm in life in adding it to the contents ov the same jug just by way ov a frostnail adding whats less nor nothing says the pope is subtraction according to algebra so here goes to make the rule good says he filling his tumbler wid the blessed stuff and sitting down again at the table for the anger didnt stay two minits on him the goodhearted ould sowl two minuses make one plus says his rivrence as ready as you plase and thatll account for the increased daycrement i mane to take the liberty of producing in the same mixed quantity says he follying his holinesss epistolical example by all thats good says the pope thats the best stuff i ever tasted you call it a mixd quantity but i say its prime since its ov the first ordher then says his rivrence well have the less deffeequilty in reducing it to a simple equation youll have no fractions at my side anyhow says the pope faix im afeared says he its only too aisy ov solution our sum is like to be never fear for that says his rivrence ive a good stick ov surds here in the bottle for i tell you it will take us a long time to exthract the root ov it at the rate were going on what makes you call the blessed quart an irrational quantity says the pope because its too much for one and too little for two says his rivrence clear it ov its coefficient and well thry says the pope hand me over the exponent then says his rivrence whats that says the pope the shcrew to be sure says his rivrence what for says the pope to dhraw the cork says his rivrence sure the corks dhrew says the pope but the sperets cant get out on account ov the accidents thats stuck in the neck ov the bottle says his rivrence accident ought to be passable to sperit says the pope and that makes me suspect that the reality ov the corks in it afther all thats a baronymasia says his rivrence and im not bound to answer it but the fact is that its the accidents ov the sperits too thats in it and the realitys passed out through the cortical spacies as you say for you may have observed weve both been in real good sperits ever since the cork was dhrawn and where else would the real sperits come from if they wouldnt come out ov the bottle well then says the pope since weve got the reality theres no use throubling ourselves wid the accidents o begad says his rivrence the accidents is very essential too for a man may be in the best ov good sperits as far as his immaterial part goes and yet need the accidental qualities ov good liquor to hunt the sinsible thirst out ov him so he dhraws the cork in earnest and sets about brewing the other skillet ov scaltheen but faiz he had to get up the ingradients this time by the hands ov ould moley though devil a taste ov her little finger hed let widin a yard ov the same coction but my dear heres the freemans journal and well see whats the news afore we finish the residuary proceedings of their two holinesses v the reason why father tom was not made a cardinal hurroo my darlings didnt i tell you it ud never do success to bould john tuam and the ould siminary ov firdramore o more power to your grace every day you rise tis you that has broken their boord into shivers undher your feet sure and isnt it a proud day for ireland this blessed feast ov the chair ov saint pether isnt carlisle and whateley smashed to pieces and their whole college of swaddling teachers knocked into smidhereens john tuam your sowl has tuck his pasthoral staff in his hand and heathen them out o connaught as fast as ever pathric druve the sarpints into clew bay poor ould mat kevanagh if he was alive this day tis he would be the happy man my curse upon their gographies and bibles he used to say wheres the use ov perplexing the poor childre wid what we dont undherstand ourselves no use at all in troth and so i said from the first myself well thank god and his grace well have no more thrigonomethry nor scripther in connaught well hould our lodges every saturday night as we used to do wid our chairman behind the masthers desk and well hear our mass every sunday morning wid the blessed priest standing afore the same i wisht to goodness i hadnt parted wid my seven champions ov christendom and freney the robber theyre books thatll be in great requist in leithrim as soon as the pasthoral gets wind glory be to god ive done wid their lecthirs they may all go and be d d wid their consumption and production im off to tallymactaggart before daylight in the morning where ill thry whether a sod or two o turf cant consume a cartload ov heresy and whether a weekly meeting ov the lodge cant produce a new thayory ov rints but afore i take my lave ov you i may as well finish my story about poor father tom that i hear is coming up to slate the heretics in adam and eve during the lint the pope and indeed it ill became a good catholic to say anything agin him no more would i only that his rivrence was in it but you see the fact ov it is that the pope was as envious as ever he could be at seeing himself sacked right and left by father tom and bate out o the face the way he was on every science and subjec that was started so not to be outdone altogether he says to his rivrence youre a man thats fond of the brute crayation i hear misther maguire i dont deny it says his rivrence ive dogs that im willing to run agin any mans ay or to match them agin any other dogs in the world for genteel edication and polite manners says he ill hould you a pound says the pope that ive a quadhruped in my possession thats a wiser baste nor any dog in your kennel done says his rivrence and they staked the money what can this larned quadhruped o yours do says his rivrence its my mule says the pope and if you were to offer her goolden oats and clover off the meadows o paradise sorra taste ov aither shed let pass her teeth till the first mass is over every sunday or holiday in the year well and what ud you say if i showed you a baste ov mine says his rivrence that instead ov fasting till first mass is over only fasts out the whole fourandtwenty hours ov every wednesday and friday in the week as reglar as a christian o be asy masther maguire says the pope you dont blieve me dont you says his rivrence very well ill soon show you whether or no and he put his knuckles in his mouth and gev a whistle that made the pope stop his fingers in his ears the aycho my dear was hardly done playing wid the cobwebs in the cornish when the door flies open and in jumps spring the pope happened to be sitting next the door betuxt him and his rivrence and may i never die if he didnt clear him thriple crown and all at one spring gods presence be about us says the pope thinking it was an evil spirit come to fly away wid him for the lie that he had told in regard ov his mule for it was nothing more nor a thrick that consisted in grazing the brutes teeth but seeing it was only one ov the greatest beauties ov a greyhound that hed ever laid his epistolical eyes on he soon recovered ov his fright and began to pat him while father tom ris and went to the sideboord where he cut a slice ov pork a slice ov beef a slice ov mutton and a slice ov salmon and put them all on a plate thegither here spring my man says he setting the plate down afore him on the hearthstone heres your supper for you this blessed friday night not a word more he said nor what i tell you and you may believe it or not but its the blessed truth that the dog afther jist tasting the salmon and spitting it out again lifted his nose out o the plate and stood wid his jaws wathering and his tail wagging looking up in his rivrences face as much as to say give me your absolution till i hide them temptations out o my sight theres a dog that knows his duty says his rivrence theres a baste that knows how to conduct himself aither in the parlor or the field you think him a good dog looking at him here but i wisht you seen him on the side ov sleeveaneirin be my soul youd say the hill was running away from undher him o i wisht you had been wid me says he never letting on to see

wishing good night an plaisant dhrames to you and in troth not one of them axed him to lave them a lock ov his hair thats the story as i heard it tould but myself doesnt blieve over one half of it howandiver when alls done its a shame so it is that hes not a bishop this blessed day and hour for next to the goiant ov saint garlaths hes out and out the cleverest fellow ov the whole jingbang johnny darbyshire by william howitt john darbyshire or according to the regular custom of the country johnny darbyshire was a farmer living in one of the most obscure parts of the country on the borders of the peak of derbyshire his fathers before him had occupied the same farm for generations and as they had been quakers from the days of george fox who preached there and converted them johnny also was a quaker that is he was as many others were and no doubt are habitually a quaker he was a quaker in dress in language in attendance of their meetings and above all in the unmitigated contempt which he felt and expressed for everything like fashion for the practices of the world for the church and for music and amusements there never was a man from the first to the present day of the society who so thoroughly embodied and exhibited that quality attributed to the quaker in the rhyming nursery alphabet q was a quaker and would not bow down no johnny darbyshire would not have bowed down to any mortal power he would have marched into the presence of the king with his hat on and would have addressed him with just the same unembarrassed freedom as the old chap out of the west countrie is made to do in the song as to any of the more humble and conceding qualities usually attributed to the peaceful quaker johnny had not an atom of those about him never was there a more pigheaded arbitrary positive pugnacious fellow he would argue anybody out of their opinions by the hour he would threep them down as he called it that is point blank and with a loud voice insist on his own possession of the right and of the sound commonsense of the matter and if he could not convince them would at least confound them with his obstreperous din and violence of action that was what he called clearing the field and not leaving his antagonist a leg to stand on having thus fairly overwhelmed dumfoundered and tired out some one with his noise he would go off in triumph and say to the bystanders as he went there lads you see he hadnt a word to say for himself and truly a clever fellow must he have been who could have got a word in edgeways when johnny had once fairly got his steam up and was shrinking and storming like a catomountain yet had anybody told johnny that he was no quaker he would have threeped them down that they did not know what a quaker meant what were not his father and his grandfather and his greatgrandfather before him all quakers was not he born in the society brought up in it hadnt he attended firstday weekday preparative monthly quarterly and sometimes yearly meetings too all his life had not he regularly and handsomely subscribed to the monthly and the national and the ackworth school stocks had he not been on all sorts of appointments to visit new members new comers into the meeting to warn disorderly walkers nay had he not sate even on committees in london at yearly meetings had he not received and travelled with ministers when they came on religious visits into these parts had he not taken them in his taxcart to the next place and been once upset in a deep and dirty lane with a weighty ministering friend and dislocated his collarbone what he not a quaker was george fox one did they think or william penn or robert barclay indeed johnny darbyshire was a quaker he had the dress and address and all the outward testimonies and marks of a quaker nay he was more he was an overseer of the meeting and broke up the meetings yes and he would have them to know that he executed his office well ay well indeed without clock to look at or without pulling out his watch or being within hearing of any bell or any other thing that could guide him he would sit on the front seat of his meeting where not a word was spoken exactly for an hour and three quarters to a minute and then break it up by shaking hands with the friend who sate next to him was not that an evidence of a religious tact and practice and had not the friends once when he was away just like people in a ship which had lost both rudder and compass gone drifting in unconsciousness from ten in the morning till three in the afternoon and would not then have known that it was time to break up the meeting but that somebodys servant was sent to see what had happened and why they did not come home to dinner johnny could see a sleeper as soon as any were he ensconced in the remotest and obscurest corner of the meeting and let him hold up his head and sleep as cleverly as he might from long habit and did not he once give a most notable piece of advice to a rich friend who was a shocking sleeper was not this friend very ill and didnt johnny go to see him and didnt he when the friend complained that he could get no sleep and that not all the physic the strongest opium even of the doctors shop could make him didnt johnny darbyshire say right slapbang out which not another of the plainestspoken friends dare have done to a rich man like that stuff and nonsense and a fig for opium and doctors stuff send man send for the meetinghouse bench and lie thee down on that and ill be bound thoult sleep like one of the seven sleepers undoubtedly johnny was a quaker a right slapdash quaker of the old foxite school and had anybody come smiling to him in the hope of getting anything out of him he would have said to him as george fox said to colonel hackett beware of hypocrisy and a rotten heart true had you questioned him as to his particular religious doctrines or articles of faith he would not have been very clear or very ready to give you any explanation at all for the very best of reasons he was not so superstitious as to have a creed a creed that was a rag of the old woman of babylon no if you wanted to know all about doctrines and disputations why you might look into barclays apology there was a book big enough for you he should think for himself like most of his cloth he would confine himself to his feelings he would employ a variety of choice and unique phrases such as if a man want to know what religion is he must not go running after parsons and bishops and all that sort of manmade ministers blind leaders of the blind who can talk by the hour but about what neither man woman nor child for the life of them can tell except when they come for their tithes or their easter dues and then they speak plain enough with a vengeance one of these commonprayer priests said he once came to advise me about the lawfulness of paying churchrates and instead of walking into my parlor he walked through the next door and nearly broke his neck into the cellar a terrible stramash of a lumber and a plunging and a groaning we heard somewhere and rushing out lo and behold it was no other than diggory dyson the parish priest who had gone headlong to the bottom of the cellar steps and had he not cut his temples against the brass tap of a beerbarrel and bled freely he might have died on the spot and that was a man set up to guide the multitude had he been only led and guided by the spirit of god as a true minister should be he would never have gone neckforemost down my cellar steps thats your blind leader of the blind but if johnny darbyshire thought the commonprayer priests obscure they must have thought him sevenfold so instead of doctrines and such pagan things he talked solemnly of centring down being renewedly made sensible having his mind drawn to this and that thing feeling himself dipped into deep baptism feeling a sense of duty and of seeing or not seeing his way clear into this or that matter but his master phrase was living near to the truth and often when other people thought him particularly provoking and insulting it was only because he hated a lie and the father of lies johnny thought that he lived so near to the truth that you would have thought truth was his nextdoor neighbor or his lodger and not living down at the bottom of her well as she long has been truly was that religious world in which johnny darbyshire lived a most singular one in that part of the country george fox had been particularly zealous and well received a simple country people was just the people to be affected by his warm eloquence and strong manly sense he settled many meetings there which however william penn may be said to have unsettled by his planting of pennsylvania these friends flocked over thither with or after him and left a mere remnant behind them this remnant and it was like the remnant in a drapers shop a very oldfashioned one continued still to keep up their meetings and carry on their affairs as steadily and gravely as fox and his contemporaries did if not so extensively and successfully they had a meeting at codnor breach at monnyash in the peak at pentridge at toadhole furnace at chesterfield etc most of these places were thoroughly country places some of them standing nearly alone in the distant fields and the few members belonging to them might be seen on sundays mounted on strong horses a man and his wife often on one on saddle and pillion or in strong taxcarts and others generally the young proceeding on foot over fields and through woods to these meetings they were truly an oldworld race clad in very oldworld garments arrived at their meeting they sate generally an hour and three quarters in profound silence for none of them had a minister in them and then returned again in winter they generally had a good fire in a chamber and sate comfortably round it once a month they jogged off in similar style to one of these meetings in particular to what they called their monthly meeting where they paid in their subscriptions for the poor and other needs of the society and read over and made answers to a set of queries on the moral and religious state of their meetings one would have thought that this business must be so very small that it would be readily despatched but not so small enough heaven knows it was but then they made a religious duty of its transaction and went through it as solemnly and deliberately as if the very salvation of the kingdom depended on it o what a mighty balancing of straws was there in answering the query whether their meetings were pretty regularly kept up and attended though perhaps there was but half a dozen members to one meeting yet would it be weighed and weighed again whether the phrase should be that it was pretty well attended or indifferently attended or attended with some exceptions this stupendous business having however at length been got through then all the men adjourned to the room where the women had for the time been just as laboriously and gravely engaged and a table was soon spread by a person agreed with with a good substantial dinner of roastbeef and plumpudding and the good people grew right sociable chatty and even merry in their way while all the time in the adjoining stable or as in one case in the stable under them their steeds often rough wild creatures thrust perhaps twenty into a stable without dividing stalls were kicking squealing and rioting in a manner that obliged some of the good people occasionally to rise from their dinners and endeavor to diffuse a little of their own quietness among them or in summer their horses would be all loose in the graveyard before the meeting rearing kicking and screaming in a most furious manner which however only rarely seemed to disturb the meditations of their masters and mistresses and to these monthly meetings over what long and dreary roads on what dreadfully wet and wintry days through what mud and water did these simple and pious creatures wrapped in greatcoats and thick cloaks and defended with oilskin hoods travel all their lives long not a soul was more punctual in attendance than johnny darbyshire he was a little man wearing a quaker suit of drab his coat long his hat not cocked but slouched and his boots well worn and well greased peaceful as he sate in these meetings yet out of them as i have remarked he was a very tartar and he often set himself to execute what he deemed justice in a very dogged and original style we may as a specimen take this instance on his way to his regular meeting he had to pass through a tollbar and being on sundays exempt by law from paying at it it may be supposed that the barkeeper did not fling open the gate often with the best grace one sunday evening however johnny darbyshire had from some cause or other stayed late with his friends after afternoon meeting when he passed through the tollgate he gave his usual nod to the keeper and was passing on but the man called out to demand the toll declaring that it was no longer sunday night but monday morning being past twelve oclock nay friend thou art wrong said johnny pulling out his watch see it yet wants a quarter no i tell you replied the keeper gruffly it is past twelve look there is my clock ay friend but thy clock like thyself doesnt speak the truth like its master it is a little too hasty i assure thee my watch is right for i just now compared it by the steeplehouse clock in the town i tell you replied the keeper angrily ive nothing to do with your watch i go by my clock and there it is well i think thou art too exact with me my friend will you pay me or not roared the keeper you go through often enough in the devils name without paying gently gently my friend replied johnny there is the money and its really after twelve oclock thou says to be sure well very well then for the next twentyfour hours i can go through again without paying to be sure everybody knows that very well then i now bid thee farewell and with that johnny darbyshire jogged on the gatekeeper chuckling at having at last extorted a double toll from the shrewd quaker went to bed not on that quiet road expecting further disturbance till towards daylight but just as he was about to pop into bed he heard some one ride up and cry gate internally cursing the late traveller he threw on his things and descended to open the gate when he was astonished to see the quaker returned thou says it really is past twelve friend to be sure then open the gate i have occasion to ride back again the gate flew open johnny darbyshire trotted back towards the town and the man with double curses in his mind returned up stairs this time he was not so sure of exemption from interruption for he expected the quaker would in a while be coming back homewards again and he was quite right just as he was about to put out his candle there was a cry of gate he descended and behold the quaker once more presented himself it really is past twelve thou says umph grunted the fellow then of course i have nothing more to pay i would not however advise thee to go to bed tonight for it is so particularly fine that i propose to enjoy it by riding to and fro here a few hours the fellow who now saw johnny darbyshires full drift exclaimed here for gods sake sir take your money back and let me get a wink of sleep but johnny refused to receive the money observing if it was after twelve then the money is justly thine but i advise thee another time not to be too exact and with that he rode off such was his shrewd restless domineering character that his old friend the neighboring miller a shrewd fellow too thought there must be something in quakerism which contributed to this and was therefore anxious to attend their meetings and see what it was how great however was his astonishment on accompanying johnny to find about half a dozen people all sitting with their hats on for a couple of hours in profound silence except a few shufflings of feet and blowing of noses and then all start up shake hands and hurry off why master darbyshire said the dry old miller how is this do you sit without parson or clerk and expect to learn religion by looking at your shoetoes by leddy this warnt th way george fox went on he was a very talking man or he would na ha got such a heap of folks together as he did youve clearly gotten o th wrong side o th post johnny depend ont an i dunna wonder now that youve dwindled awee so but if johnny was as still as a fish at the quaker meetings he had enough to say at home and at the parish meetings he had such a spice of the tyrant in him that he could not even entertain the idea of marrying without it must be a sort of shift for the mastery he therefore not only cast his eye on one of the most highspirited women that he knew in his own society but actually one on the largest scale of physical dimensions if he had one hero of his admiration more than another it was a little dwarf at mansfield who used to wear a soldiers jacket and who had taken it into his head to marry a very tall woman whom he had reduced to such perfect subjection that he used from time to time to evince his mastery by mounting a round table and making the wife walk round it while he belabored her lustily with a strap johnny having taken his resolve made no circumbendibus in his addresses but one day as he was alone in the company of the lady by name lizzy lorimer lizzy said he ill tell thee what i have been thinking about i think thoud make me a very good wife well replied lizzy sure isnt that extraordinary i was just thinking the very same thing thats right well done my wench now thats what i call hitting the nail on the head like a right sensible woman cried johnny fetching her a slap on the shoulder and laughing heartily thats doing the thing now to some tune im for none of your dillydally ways i once knew a young fellow that was desperately smitten by a young woman and though he could pluck up courage enough to go and see her he couldnt summon courage enough to speak out his mind when he got there and so he and the damsel sate opposite one another before the fire she knew well enough all the while youre sharp enough you women what he was after and there they sate and sate and at last he picked up a cinder off the hearth and looking very foolish said ive a good mind to fling a cowk at thee at which the brave wench in great contempt cried ill soon fling one at thee if thou artnt off thats just as thoud ha done lizzy and as i shouldnt said johnny gayly and laughing more heartily than before that was the sum and substance of johnny darbyshires courtship all the world said the trouble would come afterwards but if it did come it was not to johnny never was chanticleer so crouse on his own dunghill as johnny darbyshire was in his own house he was lord and master there to a certainty in doors and out he shouted hurried ran to and fro and made men maids and lizzy herself fly at his approach as if he had got a whole cargo of mercurys wings and put them on their feet it was the same in parish affairs and the fame of johnnys eloquence at vestries is loud to this day on one occasion there was a most hot debate on the voting of a churchrate which should embrace a new pulpit johnny had hurt his foot with a stub of wood as he was hurrying on his men at work in thinning a plantation it had festered and inflamed his leg to a terrible size but spite of that he ordered out his cart with a bed laid in it and came up to the door of the vestryroom where he caused himself to be carried in on the bed and set on the vestryroom floor not very distant from the clergyman here he waited listening first to one speaker and then another till the debate had grown very loud when he gave a great hem and all were silent for every one knew that johnny was going to speak now ill tell you what lads said johnny youve made noise enough to frighten all the jackdaws out of the steeple and there they are flying all about with a pretty cawarring youve spun a yarn as long as all the posts and rails round my seven acres and i dunna see as youve yet hedged in so much as th owd wise men o gotham did and thats a cuckoo ive heard just one sensible word and that was to recommend a castiron pulpit in preference to a wooden un as to a churchrate to repair th owd steeplehouse why my advice is to pull th owd thing down stick and stone and mend your roads with it its a capital heap o stone in it that one must allow and your roads are pestilent bad down with the old dawhouse i say and mend th roads wi t and set th parson here up for a guidepost oh its a rare un hed make for hes always pointing th way to the folks but i never see that he moves one inch himself mr darbyshire exclaimed the clergyman in high resentment that is very uncivil in my presence to say the least of it civil or uncivil returned johnny its the truth lad and thou can take it just as thou likes i did not come here to bandy compliments so i may as well be hanged for an old sheep as for a lamb well not make two mouthfuls of a cherry my advice is then to have a castiron pulpit by all means and while you are about it a castiron parson too it will do just as well as our neighbor diggory dyson here and a plaguy deal cheaper for it will require neither tithes glebe easterdues nor churchrates having delivered himself of this remarkable oration to the great amusement of his fellowparishioners and the equal exasperation of the clergyman johnny ordered himself to be again hoisted into his cart and rode home in great glory boasting that he had knocked all the wind out of the parson and if he got enough again to preach his sermon on sunday it would be all it was only on such occasions as these that johnny darbyshire ever appeared under the church roof once on the occasion of the funeral of an old neighbor which for a wonder he attended he presented himself there but with as little satisfaction to the clergyman and less to himself he just marched into the church with his hat on which being removed by the clergymans orders johnny declared that he had a good mind to walk out of that well of a place and would do so only out of respect to his old neighbor with looks of great wrath he seated himself at a good distance from the clergyman and as this gentleman was proceeding in none of the clearest tones certainly to read the appropriate service johnny suddenly shouted out speak up man speak up what art mumbling at there man we canna hear what thou says here who is that demanded the clergyman solemnly and looking much as if he did not clearly perceive who it was who is that who interrupts the service i will not proceed till he be removed the beadle approached johnny and begged that he would withdraw oh said johnny aloud so as to be heard through all the church ill sit i th porch id much rather whats the use sitting here where one can hear nothing but a buzzing like a bee in a blossom johnny accordingly withdrew to the porch where some of his neighbors hurrying to him when the funeral was about to proceed from the church to the grave said mr darbyshire what have you done youll as surely be put into th spiritual court as youre a living man youd better ax the parsons pardon and as soon as you can accordingly as soon as the funeral was over and the clergyman was about to withdraw up marched johnny to him and said what i reckon ive affronted thee with bidding thee speak up but thou should speak up man thou should speak up or what art perched up aloft there for but however as you scollards are rayther testy i know in being taken up before folks i mun beg thy pardon for tarnoc c for what i know o mr darbyshire said the clergyman with much dignity that will not do i assure you i cannot pass over such conduct in such a manner i shall take another course with you o just as tha woot ive axed thy pardon havent i and if that wunna do why thou mun please thysen johnny actually appeared very likely to get a proper castigation this time but however it was he certainly escaped the parishioners advised the clergyman to take no notice of the offence everybody they said knew johnny and if he called him into the spiritual court he would be just as bold and saucy and might raise a good deal of public scandal the clergyman who unfortunately was but like too many country clergymen of the time addicted to a merry glass in the village publichouse thought perhaps that this was only too likely and so the matter dropped for twenty years did johnny darbyshire thus give free scope to tongue and hand in his parish he ruled paramount over wife children house servants parish and everybody he made work go on like the flying clouds of march and at fair and market at meeting and vestry he had his fling and his banter at the expense of his neighbors as if the world was all his own and would never come to an end but now came an event arising as so often is the case out of the merest trifle that more than all exhibited the indomitable stiffness and obstinacy of his character johnny darbyshire had some fine rich meadowland on the banks of the river derwent where he took in cattle and horses to graze during the summer hither a gentleman had sent a favorite and valuable blood mare to run a few months with her foal he had stipulated that the greatest care should be taken of both mare and foal and that no one on any pretence whatever should mount the former all this johnny darbyshire had most fully promised nay he was as fond of a good bit of horseflesh as any man alive and he would use mare and foal just as if they were his own this assurance which sounded very well indeed was kept by johnny as it proved much more to the letter than the gentleman intended to his great astonishment it was not long before he one day saw johnny darbyshire come riding on a little shaggy horse down the village where he lived leading the foal in a halter he hurried out to inquire the cause of this too well auguring some sad mischief when johnny shaking his head said ill luck my friend never comes alone its an old saying that it never rains but it pours and so its been with me t other day id a son drowned as fine a lad as ever walked in shoeleather and in hurrying to th doctor how should luck have it but down comes th mare with her foot in a hole breaks her leg and was obligated to be killed and heres th poor innocent foal its a bad job a very bad job but ive the worst ont and it canna be helped so prithee say as little as thou can about it heres the foal poor dumb thing at all events but what business cried the gentleman enraged and caring in his wrath not a button for johnny darbyshires drowned son in the exasperation of his own loss but what business had you riding to the doctor or the devil on my mare did not i enjoin you did you not solemnly promise me that nobody should cross the mares back johnny shook his head he had indeed promised to use her as his own and he had done it to some purpose but that was little likely to throw cold water on the gentlemans fire it was in vain that johnny tried the pathetic of the drowning boy it was lost on the man who had lost his favorite mare and who declared that he would rather have lost a thousand pounds a hundred was exactly her value and he vowed all sorts of vengeance and of law and he kept his word too johnny was deaf to paying for the mare he had lost his boy and his summers run of the mare and foal and that he thought enough for a poor man like him as he pleased to call himself an action was commenced against him of which he took not the slightest notice till it came into court these lawyers he said were dear chaps hed have nothing to do with them but the lawyers were determined to have to do with him for they imagined that the quaker had a deep purse and they longed to be poking their long jewelled fingers to the bottom of it the cause actually came into court at the assizes and the counsel for the plaintiff got up and stated the case offering to call his evidence but first submitted that he could not find that any one was retained on behalf of the defendant and that therefore he probably meant to suffer the cause to go by default the court inquired whether any counsel at the bar was instructed to appear for darbyshire in the case shiffnal v darbyshire but there was no reply and learned gentlemen looked at one another and all shook their learned wigs and the judge was about to declare that the cause was forfeited by the defendant john darbyshire by nonappearance at the place of trial when there was seen a bustle near the box of the clerk of the court there was a hasty plucking off of a large hat which somebody had apparently walked into court with on and the moment afterwards a short man in a quaker dress with his grizzled hair hanging in long locks on his shoulders and smoothed close down on the forehead stepped with a peculiar air of confidence and cunning up to the bar his tawny sunburnt features and small dark eyes twinkling with an expression of much country subtlety proclaimed him at once a character at once a score of voices murmured theres johnny darbyshire himself he glanced with a quick and peculiar look at the counsel sitting at their table with their papers before them who on their part did not fail to return his survey with a stare of mixed wonder and amazement you could see it as plainly as possible written on their faces who have we got here there is some fun brewing here to a certainty but johnny raised his eyes from them to the bench where sat the judge and sent them rapidly thence to the jurybox where they seemed to rest with a considerable satisfaction is this a witness inquired the judge if so what is he doing there or why does he appear at all till we know whether the cause is to be defended ay lord judge as they call thee i reckon i am a witness and the best witness too that can be had in the case for im the man himself im john darbyshire i didnt mean to have anything to do with these chaps i their wigs and gowns with their long dangling sleeves and i dunna yet mean to have anything to do wi em but i just heard one of em tell thee that this cause was not going to be defended and that put my monkey up and so thinks i ill een up and tell em that it will be defended though ay and i reckon it will too johnny darbyshire was never yet afraid of the face of any man or any set of men if you are what you say good man said the judge defendant in this case you had better appoint counsel to state it for you nay nay lord judge as they call thee hold a bit i know better than that catch johnny darbyshire at flinging his money into a lawyers bag no no i know them chaps wi wigs well enough theyve tongues as long as a besoms teal and fingers as long to poke after em nay nay i dont get my money so easily as to let them scrape it up by armfuls ive worked early and late in heat and cold for my bit o money and long enough too before these smart chaps had left their mothers apronstrings and let them catch a coin of it if they can no i know this case better than any other man can and for why because i was in it it was me that had the mare to summer it was me that rode her to the doctor i was in at th breaking of th leg and for that reason i can tell you exactly how it all happened and whats any of those counsellors sharp and fine and knowing as they look with their tails and their powder what are they to know about the matter except what somebodyd have to tell em first i tell you i saw it i did it and so there needs no twice telling of the story but are you going to produce evidence inquired the counsel for the other side evidence to be sure i am what does the chap mean evidence why im defender and evidence and all there was a good deal of merriment in the court and at the bar in which the judge himself joined there wants no evidence besides me for as i tell you i did it and im not going to deny it stop cried the judge this is singular if mr darbyshire means to plead his own cause and to include in it his evidence he must be sworn let the oath be administered to him nay i reckon thou need put none of thy oaths to me my father never brought me up to cursing and swearing and such like wickedness he left that to th ragamuffins and rapscallions i th street im no swearer nor liar neither thou may take my word safe enough let him take his affirmation if he be a member of the society of friends ay now thou speaks sense lord judge ay im a member i warrant me the clerk of the court here took his affirmation and then johnny proceeded well i dont feel myself any better or any honester now for making that affirmation i was just going to tell the plain truth before and i can only tell th same now and as i said im not going to deny what ive done no johnny darbyshires not the man that ever did a thing and then denied it can any of these chaps i th wigs say as much ay now i reckon added he shaking his head archly at the gentlemen of the bar now i reckon youd like a good many on you there to be denying this thing stoutly for me youd soon persuade a good many simple folks here that i never did ride the mare never broke her leg nay never saw her that day at all wouldnt you now wouldnt you here the laughter on all sides was loudly renewed but ill take precious good care ye dunna no no thats the very thing that ive stepped up here for its to keep your consciences clear of a few more additional lies o dear im quite grieved for you when i think what falsities and deceit youll one day have to answer for as it is the gentlemen thus complimented appeared to enjoy the satire of johnny darbyshire and still more was it relished in the body of the court but again remarked the judge mr darbyshire i advise you to leave the counsel for the plaintiff to prove his case against you ist niver oss exclaimed johnny with indignation ist niver oss repeated the judge what does he mean i dont understand him and he looked inquiringly at the bar he means my lord said a young counsel that he shall never offer never attempt to do so thats a darbyshire chap now said johnny turning confidentially towards the jurybox where he saw some of his county farmers he understands good english but good neighbors there added he addressing the jury for i reckon its you that i must talk to on this business im glad to see that you are a good many on you farmers like myself and so up to these things to make a short matter of it then i had the mare and foal to summer and the gentleman laid it down strong and fast that she shouldnt be ridden by anybody and i promised him that i would do my best that nobody should ride her i told him that i would use her just as if she was my own and i meant it i meant to do the handsome by her and her master too for i neednt tell you that im too fond of a bit of good blood to see it willingly come to any harm nay nay that never was the way of johnny darbyshire and there she was the pretty creature with her handsome foal cantering and capering round her in the meadow it was a pleasure to see it it was indeed and often have i stood and leaned over the gate and watched them till i felt amost as fond of them as of my own children and never would leg have crossed her while she was in my possession had that not happened that may happen to any man when he least expects it my wife had been ill very ill my poor lizzy i thought i should ha certainly lost her the doctors said she must be kept quiet in bed if she stirred for five days she was a lost woman well one afternoon as i was cutting a bit o grass at th bottom o th orchard for the osses again they came from ploughing the fallows i heard a shriek that went through me like a baggonet down i flings th scythe thats lizzy and no other i shouted to myself shes out of bed and goodness what can it be shes ten to one gone mad with a brain fever there seemed to have fallen ten thousand millstones on my heart i tried to run but i couldnt i was as cold as ice i was as fast rooted to the ground as a tree there was another shriek more piercing than before and i was off like an arrow from a bow i was loose then i was all on fire i ran like a madman till i came within sight of th house and there i saw lizzy in her nightgown with half her body out of the window shrieking and wringing her hands like any crazed body stop stop i cried lizzy lizzy back back for heavens sake there there screamed she pointing with staring eyes and ghastly face down into the darrant that runs under the windows o god i exclaimed shell drown herself shes crazed she means to fling herself in groaning as i ran and trying to keep crying to her but my voice was dead in my throat when i reached her chamber i found her fallen on the floor she was as white as a ghost and sure enough i thought she was one i lifted her upon the bed and screamed amain for the nurse for the maid but not a soul came i rubbed lizzys hands clapped them tried her smellingbottle at length she came to herself with a dreadful groan flashed open her eyes wide on me and cried didst see him didst save him where is he where is he merciful providence i exclaimed shes gone only too sure its all over with her where is he wheres my dear sam thou didnt let him drown drown sam what i cried what dost mean lizzy o john sammy he was drowning i th darrant oh she fainted away again and a dreadful truth flashed on my mind she had seen our little sammy drowning she had heard his screams and sprung out of bed forgetful of herself and looking out saw our precious boy in the water he was sinking he cried for help there was nobody near and there lizzy stood and saw him going going going down there was not a soul in the house the maid was gone to see her mother that was dying in the next village the nurse had been suddenly obliged to run off to the doctors for some physic lizzy had promised to lie still till i came in and in the mean time this happens when i understood her i flew down stairs and towards the part of the river she had pointed to i gazed here and there and at length caught sight of the poor boys coat floating and with a rake i caught hold of it and dragged him to land but it was too late frantic however as i was i flew down to the meadow with a bridle in my hand mounted the blood mare she was the fleetest in the field by half and away to the doctor we went like the wind i took a short cut for better speed but it was a hobbly road just as i came in sight of the doctors house there was a slough that had been mended with stones and fagots and anything that came to hand i pushed her over but her foot caught in a hole amongst the sticks and crack it was over in a moment neighbors neighbors think of my situation think of my feelings oh i was all one great groan my wife my boy the mare it seemed as if jobs devil was really sent out against me but there was no time to think i could only feel and i could do that running i sprang over the hedge i was across the fields and at the doctors ay long before i could find breath to tell him what was amiss but he thought it was my wife that was dreadfully worse i expected as much said he and that instant we were in the gig that stood at the door and we were going like fire back again but here johnny darbyshire paused the words stuck in his throat his lips trembled his face gradually grew pale and livid as if he were going to give up the ghost the court was extremely moved there was a deep silence and there were heard sobs from the throng behind the judge sate with his eyes fixed on his book of minutes and not a voice even said go on johnny darbyshire meantime overcome by his feelings had sate down at the bar a glass of water was handed to him he wiped his forehead with his handkerchief several times heaved a heavy convulsive sigh or two from his laboring chest and again arose judge then said he again addressing the jury what a taking i was in my boy but no i canna touch on that he was gone said he in a husky voice that seemed to require all his physical force to send it from the bottom of his chest my wife was for weeks worse than dead and never has been and never will be herself again when i inquired after the mare you can guess when was a broken leg of a horse successfully set again they had been obliged to kill her now neighbors i deny nothing i wunna but ill put it to any of you if you were in like case and a fleet mare stood ready at hand would you have weighed anything but her speed against a wife and a child no had she been my own i should have taken her and that was all i had promised but there neighbors you have the whole business and so do just as you like i leave it wi you johnny darbyshire stepped down from the bar and disappeared in the crowd there was a deep silence in the court and the very jury were seen dashing some drops from their eyes they appeared to look up to the judge as if they were ready to give in at once their verdict and nobody could doubt for which party but at this moment the counsel for the plaintiff arose and said gentlemen of the jury you know the old saying he that pleads his own cause has a fool for his client we cannot say that the proverb has held good in this case the defendant has proved himself no fool never in my life have i listened to the pleadings of an opponent with deeper anxiety nature and the awful chances of life have made the defendant in this case more than eloquent for a moment i actually trembled for the cause of my client but it was for a moment only i should have been something less than human if i had not like every person in this court been strangely affected by the singular appeal of the singular man who has just addressed you but i should have been something less than a good lawyer if i did not again revert confidently to those facts which were in the possession of my witnesses now waiting to be heard had this been the only instance in which the defendant had broken his engagement and mounted this mare i should in my own mind have flung off all hope of a verdict from you god and nature would have been too strong for me in your hearts but fortunately for my client it is not so i will show you on the most unquestionable evidence that it was not the first nor the second time that mr darbyshire had mounted this prohibited but tempting steed he had been seen as one of the witnesses expresses it frisking about on this beautiful animal and asking his neighbors what they thought of such a bit of blood as that he had on one occasion been as far as crich fair with her and had allowed her to be cheapened by several dealers as if she were his own and then proudly rode off saying nay nay it was not money that would purchase pretty nancy as he called her here the counsel called several respectable farmers who amply corroborated these statements and he then proceeded gentlemen there i rest my case you will forget the wife and the child and call to mind the frisking and crich fair but to put the matter beyond a doubt we will call the defendant again and put a few questions to him the court crier called but it was in vain johnny darbyshire was no longer there as he had said he had left it wi em and was gone the weight of evidence prevailed the jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff one hundred pounds the verdict was given but the money was not yet got when called on for payment johnny darbyshire took no further notice of the demand than he had done of the action an execution was issued against his goods but when it was served it was found that he had no goods a brother stepped in with a clear title to all on johnnys farm by a deed dated six years before on plea of moneys advanced and johnny stood only as manager the plaintiff was so enraged at this barefaced scheme to bar his just claim johnnys bail sureties being found equally unsubstantial that he resolved to arrest johnnys person the officers arrived at johnnys house to serve the writ and found him sitting at his luncheon alone it was a fine summers day everybody was out in the fields at the hay door and window stood open and johnny who had been out on some business was refreshing himself before going to the field too the officers entering declared him their prisoner well said johnny i know that very well dont i know a bumbaily when i see him but sit down and take something im hungry if you arna at all events the men gladly sate down to a fine piece of cold beef and johnny said come fill your glasses ill fetch another jug of ale i reckon youll not give me a glass of ale like this where we are going he took a candle descended the cellar one of the officers peeping after him to see that all was right and again sitting down to the beef and beer both of them found the beef splendid but beginning to find the ale rather long in making its appearance they descended the cellar and found johnny darbyshire had gone quietly off at a back door loud was the laughter of the country round at johnny darbyshires outwitting of the bailiffs and desperate was their quest after him it was many a day however before they again got sight of him when they did it was on his own hearth just as they had done at first not a soul was visible but himself the officers declared now that they would make sure of him and yet drink with him too with all my heart said johnny and draw it yourselves too if you will nay i will go down with you said one my comrade shall wait here above good said johnny lighting a candle now mind young man added he going hastily forwards towards the cellar steps mind i say some of these steps are bad its a dark road and nay here this way follow me exactly but the man was too eager not to let johnny go too far before him he did not observe that johnny went some distance round before he turned down the steps there was no handrail to this dark flight of steps and he walked straight over into the opening hold hold heavens the mans gone didnt i tell him a heavy plunge and a groan announced the mans descent into the cellar help help cried johnny darbyshire rushing wildly into the room above the man like a madman has walked over the landing into the cellar if he isnt killed its a mercy help snatching another candle but hold take heed take heed or thoult go over after him with good lighting and careful examination of the way the officer followed they found the other man lying on his back bleeding profusely from his head and insensible we must have help theres no time to lose cried johnny darbyshire springing up stairs stop cried the distracted officer left with his bleeding fellow and springing up the steps after johnny but he found a door already bolted in his face and cursing johnny for a treacherous and murderous scoundrel he began vainly denouncing his barbarity in leaving his comrade thus to perish and kicked and thundered lustily at the door but he did johnny darbyshire injustice johnny had no wish to hurt a hair of any mans head the officer had been eager and confident and occasioned his own fall and even now johnny had not deserted him he appeared on horseback at the barn where threshers were at work told them what had happened gave them the key of the cellar door bade them off and help all they could and said he was riding for the doctor the doctor indeed soon came and pronounced the mans life in no danger though he was greatly scratched and bruised johnny himself was again become invisible from this time for nine months the pursuit of johnny darbyshire was a perfect campaign full of stratagems busy marchings and expectations but of no surprises house barns fields and woods were successively ferreted through as report whispered that he was in one or the other but it was to no purpose not a glimpse of him was ever caught and fame now loudly declared that he had safely transferred himself to america unfortunately for the truth of this report which had become as well received as the soundest piece of history johnny darbyshire was one fine moonlight night encountered full face to face by some poachers crossing the fields near his house the search became again more active than ever and the ruins of wingfield manor which stood on a hill not far from his dwelling were speedily suspected to be haunted by him these were hunted over and over but no trace of johnny darbyshire or any sufficient hidingplace for him could be found till one fine summer evening the officers were lucky enough to hit on a set of steps which descended amongst bushes into the lower part of the ruins here going on they found themselves to their astonishment in an ample old kitchen with a fire of charcoal in the grate and johnny darbyshire with a friend or two sitting most cosily over their tea before they could recover from their surprise johnny however had vanished by some door or window they could not tell exactly where for there were sundry doorways issuing into dark places of which former experience bade them beware rushing up again therefore to the light they soon posted some of their number around the ruins and with other assistance sent for from the village they descended again and commenced a vigilant search this had been patiently waited for a good while by those posted without when suddenly as rats are seen to issue from a rick when the ferret is in it johnny darbyshire was seen ascending hurriedly a broken staircase that was partly exposed to the open day by the progress of dilapidation and terminated abruptly above here at this abrupt and dizzy termination for the space of half a minute stood johnny darbyshire looking round as if calmly surveying the landscape which lay with all its greenness and ascending smokes of cottage chimneys in the gleam of the setting sun another instant and an officer of the law was seen cautiously scrambling up the same ruinous path but when he had reached within about half a dozen yards or so of johnny he paused gazed upwards and downwards and then remained stationary johnny taking one serious look at him now waved his hand as bidding him adieu and disappeared in a mass of ivy the astonished officer on the ruined stair now hastily retreated downwards the watchers on the open place around ran to the side of the building where johnny darbyshire had thus disappeared but had scarcely reached the next corner when they heard a loud descent of stones and rubbish and springing forward saw these rushing to the ground at the foot of the old manor and some of them springing and bounding down the hill below what was most noticeable however was johnny darbyshire himself lying stretched apparently lifeless on the greensward at some little distance on examining afterwards the place they found that johnny had descended between a double wall a way no doubt well known to him and thence had endeavored to let himself down the wall by the ivy which grew enormously strong there but the decayed state of the stones had caused the hold of the ivy to give way and johnny had been precipitated probably from a considerable height he still held quantities of leaves and ivy twigs in his hands he was conveyed as speedily as possible on a door to his own house where it was ascertained by the surgeon that life was sound in him but that besides plenty of severe contusions he had broken a thigh when this news reached his persecutor though johnny was declared to have rendered himself by his resistance to the officers of the law liable to outlawry this gentleman declared that he was quite satisfied that johnny was punished enough especially as he had been visited with the very mischief he had occasioned to the mare he declined to proceed any further against him paid all charges and costs and the court itself thought fit to take no further cognizance of the matter johnny was indeed severely punished for nearly twelve months he was confined to the house and never did his indomitable and masterful spirit exhibit itself so strongly and characteristically as during this time he was a most troublesome subject in the house as he sate in his bed he ordered scolded and ruled with a rod of iron all the women including his wife and daughter so that they would have thought the leg and the confinement nothing to what they had to suffer he at length had himself conveyed to the sittingroom or the kitchen as he pleased in a great easychair but as he did not satisfy himself that he was sufficiently obeyed he one day sent the servantgirl to fetch him the longest scarletbean stick that she could find in the garden armed with this he now declared that he would have his own way he could reach them now and accordingly there he sate ordering and scolding and if not promptly obeyed in his most extravagant commands not sparing to inflict substantial knocks with his peaprick as he called it this succeeded so well that he would next have his chair carried to the door and survey the state of things without ay he knew they were going on prettily there was fine management he was sure when he was thus laid up he should be ruined that was certain o if he could but see the ploughing and the crops to see how they were going on would make the heart of a stone ache he expected his son was a steady young fellow and it must be known was all the while farming and carrying on the business much better than he himself had ever done but he would be with them one of these days and for the present he would see his stock at all events he accordingly ordered the whole of his stock his horses his cows his bullocks his sheep his calves his pigs and poultry to be all every head of them driven past as he sate at the door it was like another naming of the beasts by adam or another going up into the ark there he sate swaying his long stick now talking to this horse and now to that cow to the old bull he addressed a long speech and every now and then he broke off to rate the farmservants for their neglect of things what a bag of bones was this heifer what a skeleton was that horse why they must have been fairly starved on purpose nay they must have been in the pinfold all the time he had been laid up but he would teach the lazy rogues a different lesson as soon as he could get about and the next thing was to get about in his cart with his bed laid in it in this he rode over his farm and it would have made a fine scene for fielding or goldsmith to have seen all his proceedings and heard all his exclamations and remarks as he surveyed field after field what ploughing what sowing why they must have had a crooked plough and a set of bandylegged horses to plough such ploughing there was no more straightness in their furrows than in a dogs hind leg and then where had the man flung the seed to here was a bit come up and there never a bit it was his belief that they must go to jericho to find half of his corn that had been flung away what had they picked the windiest day of all the year to scatter his corn on the air in and then the drains were all stopped the land was drowning was starving to death and where were the hedges all gone to hedges he left but now he only saw gaps so he went round the farm and for many a day did it furnish him with a theme of scolding in the house such was johnny darbyshire and thus he lived for many years we sketch no imaginary character we relate no invented story perhaps a more perfect specimen of the shrewd and clever man converted into the local and domestic tyrant by having too much of his own humor never was beheld but the genus to which johnny darbyshire belonged is far from extinct in the nooks of england there are not a few of them yet to be found in all their froward glory and in the most busy cities though the great prominences of their eccentricities are rubbed off by daily concussion with men as hardheaded as themselves we see glimpses beneath the polished surface of what they would be in ruder and customfreer scenes the johnny darbyshires may be said to be instances of english independence run to seed the gridiron by samuel lover a certain old gentleman in the west of ireland whose love of the ridiculous quite equalled his taste for claret and foxhunting was wont upon festive occasions when opportunity offered to amuse his friends by drawing out one of his servants exceedingly fond of what he termed his thravels and in whom a good deal of whim some queer stories and perhaps more than all long and faithful services had established a right of loquacity he was one of those few trusty and privileged domestics who if his master unheedingly uttered a rash thing in a fit of passion would venture to set him right if the squire said ill turn that rascal off my friend pat would say troth you wont sir and pat was always right for if any altercation arose upon the subjectmatter in hand he was sure to throw in some good reason either from former services general good conduct or the delinquents wife and children that always turned the scale but i am digressing on such merry meetings as i have alluded to the master after making certain approaches as a military man would say as the preparatory steps in laying siege to some extravaganza of his servant might perchance assail pat thus by the by sir john addressing a distinguished guest pat has a very curious story which something you told me today reminds me of you remember pat turning to the man evidently pleased at the notice thus paid to himself you remember that queer adventure you had in france troth i do sir grins forth pat what exclaims sir john in feigned surprise was pat ever in france indeed he was cries mine host and pat adds ay and farther plaze your honor i assure you sir john continues my host pat told me a story once that surprised me very much respecting the ignorance of the french indeed rejoined the baronet really i always supposed the french to be a most accomplished people troth then theyre not sir interrupts pat o by no means adds mine host shaking his head emphatically i believe pat twas when you were crossing the atlantic says the master turning to pat with a seductive air and leading into the full and true account for pat had thought fit to visit north amerikay for a raison he had in the autumn of the year ninetyeight yes sir says pat the broad atlantic a favorite phrase of his which he gave with a brogue as broad almost as the atlantic itself it was the time i was lost in crassin the broad atlantic a comin home began pat decoyed into the recital whin the winds began to blow and the sae to rowl that youd think the colleen dhas that was her name would not have a mast left but what would rowl out of her well sure enough the masts went by the board at last and the pumps were choked divil choke

than no time and run the boat up in a little creek and a beautiful creek it was with a lovely white sthrand an illegant place for ladies to bathe in the summer and out i got and its stiff enough in the limbs i was afther bein cramped up in the boat and perished with the cowld and hunger but i conthrived to scramble on one way or t other towrds a little bit iv a wood that was close to the shore

that it was remarkable the box tunnel by charles reade the train glided from paddington may in the left compartment of a certain firstclass carriage were four passengers of these two were worth description the lady had a smooth white delicate brow strongly marked eyebrows long lashes eyes that seemed to change color and a goodsized delicious mouth with teeth as white as milk a man could not see her nose for her eyes and mouth her own sex could and would have told us some nonsense about it she wore an unpretending grayish dress buttoned to the throat with lozengeshaped buttons and a scottish shawl that agreeably evaded color she was like a duck so tight her plain feathers fitted her and there she sat smooth snug and delicious with a book in her hand and a soupon of her wrist just visible as she held it her opposite neighbor was what i call a good style of man the more to his credit since he belonged to a corporation that frequently turns out the worst imaginable style of young men he was a cavalry officer aged twentyfive he had a mustache but not a very repulsive one not one of those subnasal pigtails on which soup is suspended like dew on a shrub it was short thick and black as a coal his teeth had not yet been turned by tobacco smoke to the color of juice his clothes did not stick to nor hang to him he had an engaging smile and what i liked the dog for his vanity which was inordinate was in its proper place his heart not in his face jostling mine and other peoples who have none in a word he was what one oftener hears of than meets a young gentleman he was conversing in an animated whisper with a companion a fellowofficer they were talking about what it is far better not to women our friend clearly did not wish to be overheard for he cast ever and anon a furtive glance at his fair visvis and lowered his voice she seemed completely absorbed in her book and that reassured him at last the two soldiers came down to a whisper the truth must be told the one who got down at slough and was lost to posterity bet ten pounds to three that he who was going down with us to bath and immortality would not kiss either of the ladies opposite upon the road done done now i am sorry a man i have hitherto praised should have lent himself even in a whisper to such a speculation but nobody is wise at all hours not even when the clock is striking five and twenty and you are to consider his profession his good looks and the temptation ten to three after slough the party was reduced to three at twylford one lady dropped her handkerchief captain dolignan fell on it like a lamb two or three words were interchanged on this occasion at reading the marlborough of our tale made one of the safe investments of that day he bought a times and punch the latter full of steelpen thrusts and woodcuts valor and beauty deigned to laugh at some inflamed humbug or other punctured by punch now laughing together thaws our human ice long before swindon it was a talking match at swindon who so devoted as captain dolignan he handed them out he souped them he toughchickened them he brandied and cochinealed one and he brandied and burntsugared the other on their return to the carriage one lady passed into the inner compartment to inspect a certain gentlemans seat on that side of the line reader had it been you or i the beauty would have been the deserter the average one would have stayed with us till all was blue ourselves included not more surely does our slice of bread and butter when it escapes from our hand revolve it ever so often alight face downward on the carpet but this was a bit of a fop adonis dragoon so venus remained in ttette with him you have seen a dog meet an unknown female of his species how handsome how empress how expressive he becomes such was dolignan after swindon and to do the dog justice he got handsome and handsomer and you have seen a cat conscious of approaching cream such was miss haythorn she became demurer and demurer presently our captain looked out of the window and laughed this elicited an inquiring look from miss haythorn we are only a mile from the box tunnel do you always laugh a mile from the box tunnel said the lady invariably what for why hem it is a gentlemans joke captain dolignan then recounted to miss haythorn the following a lady and her husband sat together going through the box tunnel there was one gentleman opposite it was pitch dark after the tunnel the lady said george how absurd of you to salute me going through the tunnel i did no such thing you didnt no why because somehow i thought you did here captain dolignan laughed and endeavored to lead his companion to laugh but it was not to be done the train entered the tunnel miss haythorn ah dolignan what is the matter miss haythorn i am frightened dolignan moving to her side pray do not be alarmed i am near you miss haythorn you are near me very near me indeed captain dolignan dolignan you know my name miss haythorn i heard you mention it i wish we were out of this dark place dolignan i could be content to spend hours here reassuring you my dear lady miss haythorn nonsense dolignan pweep grave reader do not put your lips to the next pretty creature you meet or you will understand what this means miss haythorn ee ee friend what is the matter miss haythorn open the door open the door there was a sound of hurried whispers the door was shut and the blind pulled down with hostile sharpness if any critic falls on me for putting inarticulate sounds in a dialogue as above i answer with all the insolence i can command at present hit boys as big as yourself bigger perhaps such as sophocles euripides and aristophanes they began it and i learned it of them sore against my will miss haythorns scream lost most of its effect because the engine whistled forty thousand murders at the same moment and fictitious grief makes itself heard when real cannot between the tunnel and bath our young friend had time to ask himself whether his conduct had been marked by that delicate reserve which is supposed to distinguish the perfect gentleman with a long face real or feigned he held open the door his late friends attempted to escape on the other side impossible they must pass him she whom he had insulted latin for kissed deposited somewhere at his feet a look of gentle blushing reproach the other whom he had not insulted darted redhot daggers at him from her eyes and so they parted it was perhaps fortunate for dolignan that he had the grace to be a friend to major hoskyns of his regiment a veteran laughed at by the youngsters for the major was too apt to look coldly upon billiardballs and cigars he had seen cannonballs and linstocks he had also to tell the truth swallowed a good bit of the messroom poker which made it as impossible for major hoskyns to descend to an ungentlemanlike word or action as to brush his own trousers below the knee captain dolignan told this gentleman his story in gleeful accents but major hoskyns heard him coldly and as coldly answered that he had known a man to lose his life for the same thing that is nothing continued the major but unfortunately he deserved to lose it at this blood mounted to the younger mans temples and his senior added i mean to say he was thirtyfive you i presume are twentyone twentyfive that is much the same thing will you be advised by me if you will advise me speak to no one of this and send white the that he may think you have lost the bet that is hard when i won it do it for all that sir let the disbelievers in human perfectibility know that this dragoon capable of a blush did this virtuous action albeit with violent reluctance and this was his first damper a week after these events he was at a ball he was in that state of factitious discontent which belongs to us amiable english he was looking in vain for a lady equal in personal attraction to the idea he had formed of george dolignan as a man when suddenly there glided past him a most delightful vision a lady whose beauty and symmetry took him by the eyes another look it cant be yes it is miss haythorn not that he knew her name but what an apotheosis the duck had become a peahen radiant dazzling she looked twice as beautiful and almost twice as large as before he lost sight of her he found her again she was so lovely she made him ill and he alone must not dance with her speak to her if he had been content to begin her acquaintance the usual way it might have ended in kissing it must end in nothing as she danced sparks of beauty fell from her on all around but him she did not see him it was clear she never would see him one gentleman was particularly assiduous she smiled on his assiduity he was ugly but she smiled on him dolignan was surprised at his success his ill taste his ugliness his impertinence dolignan at last found himself injured who was this man and what right had he to go on so he never kissed her i suppose said dolle dolignan could not prove it but he felt that somehow the rights of property were invaded he went home and dreamed of miss haythorn and hated all the ugly successful he spent a fortnight trying to find out who his beauty was he never could encounter her again at last he heard of her in this way a lawyers clerk paid him a little visit and commenced a little action against him in the name of miss haythorn for insulting her in a railway train the young gentleman was shocked endeavored to soften the lawyers clerk that machine did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of the term the ladys name however was at last revealed by this untoward incident from her name to her address was but a short step and the same day our crestfallen hero lay in wait at her door and many a succeeding day without effect but one fine afternoon she issued forth quite naturally as if she did it every day and walked briskly on the parade dolignan did the same met and passed her many times on the parade and searched for pity in her eyes but found neither look nor recognition nor any other sentiment for all this she walked and walked till all the other promenaders were tired and gone then her culprit summoned resolution and taking off his hat with a voice for the first time tremulous besought permission to address her she stopped blushed and neither acknowledged nor disowned his acquaintance he blushed stammered out how ashamed he was how he deserved to be punished how he was punished how little she knew how unhappy he was and concluded by begging her not to let all the world know the disgrace of a man who was already mortified enough by the loss of her acquaintance she asked an explanation he told her of the action that had been commenced in her name she gently shrugged her shoulders and said how stupid they are emboldened by this he begged to know whether or not a life of distant unpretending devotion would after a lapse of years erase the memory of his madness his crime she did not know she must now bid him adieu as she had some preparations to make for a ball in the crescent where everybody was to be they parted and dolignan determined to be at the ball where everybody was to be he was there and after some time he obtained an introduction to miss haythorn and he danced with her her manner was gracious with the wonderful tact of her sex she seemed to have commenced the acquaintance that evening that night for the first time dolignan was in love i will spare the reader all a lovers arts by which he succeeded in dining where she dined in dancing where she danced in overtaking her by accident when she rode his devotion followed her to church where the dragoon was rewarded by learning there is a world where they neither polk nor smoke the two capital abominations of this one he made an acquaintance with her uncle who liked him and he saw at last with joy that her eye loved to dwell upon him when she thought he did not observe her it was three months after the box tunnel that captain dolignan called one day upon captain haythorn r n whom he had met twice in his life and slightly propitiated by violently listening to a cuttingout expedition he called and in the usual way asked permission to pay his addresses to his daughter the worthy captain straightway began doing quarterdeck when suddenly he was summoned from the apartment by a mysterious message on his return he announced with a total change of voice that it was all right and his visitor might run alongside as soon as he chose my reader has divined the truth this nautical commander terrible to the foe was in complete and happy subjugation to his daughter our heroine as he was taking leave dolignan saw his divinity glide into the drawingroom he followed her observed a sweet consciousness deepen into confusion she tried to laugh and cried instead and then she smiled again when he kissed her hand at the door it was george and marian instead of captain this and miss the other a reasonable time after this for my tale is merciful and skips formalities and torturing delays these two were very happy they were once more upon the railroad going to enjoy their honeymoon all by themselves marian dolignan was dressed just as before ducklike and delicious all bright except her clothes but george sat beside her this time instead of opposite and she drank him in gently from her long eyelashes marian said george married people should tell each other all will you ever forgive me if i own to you no yes yes well then you remember the box tunnel this was the first allusion he had ventured to it i am ashamed to say i had to with white i would kiss one of you two ladies and george pathetic externally chuckled within i know that george i overheard you was the demure reply oh you overheard me impossible and did you not hear me whisper to my companion i made a bet with her you made a bet how singular what was it only a pair of gloves george yes i know but what about it that if you did you should be my husband dearest oh but stay then you could not have been so very angry with me love why dearest then you brought that action against me mrs dolignan looked down i was afraid you were forgetting me george you will never forgive me sweet angel why here is the box tunnel now reader fie no no such thing you cant expect to be indulged in this way every time we come to a dark place besides it is not the thing consider two sensible married people no such phenomenon i assure you took place no scream in hopeless rivalry of the engine this time
