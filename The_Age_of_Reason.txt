wrath turned next upon the king of kings by whose grace every tyrant claimed to reign but eventualities had brought among them a great english and american heart thomas paine he had pleaded for louis caper kill the king but spare the man now he pleaded disbelieve in the king of kings but do not confuse with that idol the father of mankind in paines preface to the second part of the age of reason he describes himself as writing the first part near the close of the year i had not finished it more than six hours in the state it has since appeared before a guard came about three in the morning with an order signed by the two committees of public safety and surety general for putting me in arrestation this was on the morning of december but it is necessary to weigh the words just quoted in the state it has since appeared for on august francois lanthenas in an appeal for paines liberation wrote as follows i deliver to merlin de thionville a copy of the last work of t payne the age of reason formerly our colleague and in custody since the decree excluding foreigners from the national representation this book was written by the author in the beginning of the year old style i undertook its translation before the revolution against priests and it was published in french about the same time couthon to whom i sent it seemed offended with me for having translated this work under the frown of couthon one of the most atrocious colleagues of robespierre this early publication seems to have been so effectually suppressed that no copy bearing that date can be found in france or elsewhere in paines letter to samuel adams printed in the present volume he says that he had it translated into french to stay the progress of atheism and that he endangered his life by opposing atheism the time indicated by lanthenas as that in which he submitted the work to couthon would appear to be the latter part of march the fury against the priesthood having reached its climax in the decrees against them of march and if the moral deformity of couthon even greater than that of his body be remembered and the readiness with which death was inflicted for the most theoretical opinion not approved by the mountain it will appear probable that the offence given couthon by paines book involved danger to him and his translator on may when the girondins were accused the name of lanthenas was included and he barely escaped and on the same day danton persuaded paine not to appear in the convention as his life might be in danger whether this was because of the age of reason with its fling at the goddess nature or not the statements of author and translator are harmonized by the fact that paine prepared the manuscript with considerable additions and changes for publication in english as he has stated in the preface to part ii a comparison of the french and english versions sentence by sentence proved to me that the translation sent by lanthenas to merlin de thionville in is the same as that he sent to couthon in this discovery was the means of recovering several interesting sentences of the original work i have given as footnotes translations of such clauses and phrases of the french work as appeared to be important those familiar with the translations of lanthenas need not be reminded that he was too much of a literalist to depart from the manuscript before him and indeed he did not even venture to alter it in an instance presently considered where it was obviously needed nor would lanthenas have omitted any of the paragraphs lacking in his translation this original work was divided into seventeen chapters and these i have restored translating their headings into english the age of reason is thus for the first time given to the world with nearly its original completeness it should be remembered that paine could not have read the proof of his age of reason part i which went through the press while he was in prison to this must be ascribed the permanence of some sentences as abbreviated in the haste he has described a notable instance is the dropping out of his estimate of jesus the words rendered by lanthenas trop peu imite trop oublie trop meconnu the addition of these words to paines tribute makes it the more notable that almost the only recognition of the human character and life of jesus by any theological writer of that generation came from one long branded as an infidel to the inability of the prisoner to give his work any revision must be attributed the preservation in it of the singular error already alluded to as one that lanthenas but for his extreme fidelity would have corrected this is paines repeated mention of six planets and enumeration of them twelve years after the discovery of uranus paine was a devoted student of astronomy and it cannot for a moment be supposed that he had not participated in the universal welcome of herschels discovery the omission of any allusion to it convinces me that the astronomical episode was printed from a manuscript written before when uranus was discovered unfamiliar with french in paine might not have discovered the erratum in lanthenas translation and having no time for copying he would naturally use as much as possible of the same manuscript in preparing his work for english readers but he had no opportunity of revision and there remains an erratum which if my conjecture be correct casts a significant light on the paragraphs in which he alludes to the preparation of the work he states that soon after his publication of common sense he saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion and that man would return to the pure unmixed and unadulterated belief of one god and no more he tells samuel adams that it had long been his intention to publish his thoughts upon religion and he had made a similar remark to john adams in like the quakers among whom he was reared paine could then readily use the phrase word of god for anything in the bible which approved itself to his inner light and as he had drawn from the first book of samuel a divine condemnation of monarchy john adams a unitarian asked him if he believed in the inspiration of the old testament paine replied that he did not and at a later period meant to publish his views on the subject there is little doubt that he wrote from time to time on religious points during the american war without publishing his thoughts just as he worked on the problem of steam navigation in which he had invented a practicable method ten years before john fitch made his discovery without publishing it at any rate it appears to me certain that the part of the age of reason connected with paines favorite science astronomy was written before when uranus was discovered paines theism however invested with biblical and christian phraseology was a birthright it appears clear from several allusions in the age of reason to the quakers that in his early life or before the middle of the eighteenth century the people so called were substantially deists an interesting confirmation of paines statements concerning them appears as i write in an account sent by count leo tolstoi to the london times of the russian sect called dukhobortsy the times october this sect sprang up in the last century and the narrative says the first seeds of the teaching called afterwards dukhoborcheskaya were sown by a foreigner a quaker who came to russia the fundamental idea of his quaker teaching was that in the soul of man dwells god himself and that he himself guides man by his inner word god lives in nature physically and in mans soul spiritually to christ as to an historical personage the dukhobortsy do not ascribe great importance christ was gods son but only in the sense in which we call ourselves sons of god the purpose of christs sufferings was no other than to show us an example of suffering for truth the quakers who in visited the dukhobortsy could not agree with them upon these religious subjects and when they heard from them their opinion about jesus christ that he was a man exclaimed darkness from the old and new testaments they say we take only what is useful mostly the moral teaching the moral ideas of the dukhobortsy are the following all men are by nature equal external distinctions whatsoever they may be are worth nothing this idea of mens equality the dukhoborts have directed further against the state authority amongst themselves they hold subordination and much more a monarchical government to be contrary to their ideas here is an early hicksite quakerism carried to russia long before the birth of elias hicks who recovered it from paine to whom the american quakers refused burial among them although paine arraigned the union of church and state his ideal republic was religious it was based on a conception of equality based on the divine sonship of every man this faith underlay equally his burden against claims to divine partiality by a chosen people a priesthood a monarch by the grace of god or an aristocracy paines reason is only an expansion of the quakers inner light and the greater impression as compared with previous republican and deistic writings made by his rights of man and age of reason really volumes of one work is partly explained by the apostolic fervor which made him a spiritual successor of george fox paines mind was by no means skeptical it was eminently instructive that he should have waited until his fiftyseventh year before publishing his religious convictions was due to a desire to work out some positive and practicable system to take the place of that which he believed was crumbling the english engineer hall who assisted paine in making the model of his iron bridge wrote to his friends in england in my employer has common sense enough to disbelieve most of the common systematic theories of divinity but does not seem to establish any for himself but five years later paine was able to lay the cornerstone of his temple with respect to religion itself without regard to names and as directing itself from the universal family of mankind to the divine object of all adoration it is man bringing to his maker the fruits of his heart and though those fruits may differ from each other like the fruits of the earth the grateful tribute of every one is accepted rights of man see my edition of paines writings ii p here we have a reappearance of george fox confuting the doctor in america who denied the light and spirit of god to be in every one and affirmed that it was not in the indians whereupon i called an indian to us and asked him whether or not when he lied or did wrong to anyone there was not something in him that reproved him for it he said there was such a thing in him that did so reprove him and he was ashamed when he had done wrong or spoken wrong so we shamed the doctor before the governor and the people journal of george fox september paine who coined the phrase religion of humanity the crisis vii did but logically defend it in the age of reason by denying a special revelation to any particular tribe or divine authority in any particular creed of church and the centenary of this muchabused publication has been celebrated by a great conservative champion of church and state mr balfour who in his foundations of belief affirms that inspiration cannot be denied to the great oriental teachers unless grapes may be gathered from thorns the centenary of the complete publication of the age of reason october was also celebrated at the church congress norwich on october when professor bonney frs canon of manchester read a paper in which he said i cannot deny that the increase of scientific knowledge has deprived parts of the earlier books of the bible of the historical value which was generally attributed to them by our forefathers the story of creation in the book of genesis unless we play fast and loose either with words or with science cannot be brought into harmony with what we have learnt from geology its ethnological statements are imperfect if not sometimes inaccurate the stories of the fall of the flood and of the tower of babel are incredible in their present form some historical element may underlie many of the traditions in the first eleven chapters in that book but this we cannot hope to recover canon bonney proceeded to say of the new testament also that the gospels are not so far as we know strictly contemporaneous records so we must admit the possibility of variations and even inaccuracies in details being introduced by oral tradition the canon thinks the interval too short for these importations to be serious but that any question of this kind is left open proves the age of reason fully upon us reason alone can determine how many texts are as spurious as the three heavenly witnesses i john v and like it serious enough to have cost good men their lives and persecutors their charities when men interpolate it is because they believe their interpolation seriously needed it will be seen by a note in part ii of the work that paine calls attention to an interpolation introduced into the first american edition without indication of its being an editorial footnote this footnote was the book of luke was carried by a majority of one only vide moshelms ecc history dr priestley then in america answered paines work and in quoting less than a page from the age of reason he made three alterations one of which changed church mythologists into christian mythologists and also raised the editorial footnote into the text omitting the reference to mosheim having done this priestley writes as to the gospel of luke being carried by a majority of one only it is a legend if not of mr paines own invention of no better authority whatever and so on with further castigation of the author for what he never wrote and which he himself priestley was the unconscious means of introducing into the text within the year of paines publication if this could be done unintentionally by a conscientious and exact man and one not unfriendly to paine if such a writer as priestley could make four mistakes in citing half a page it will appear not very wonderful when i state that in a modern popular edition of the age of reason including both parts i have noted about five hundred deviations from the original these were mainly the accumulated efforts of friendly editors to improve paines grammar or spelling some were misprints or developed out of such and some resulted from the sale in london of a copy of part second surreptitiously made from the manuscript these facts add significance to paines footnote itself altered in some editions in which he says if this has happened within such a short space of time notwithstanding the aid of printing which prevents the alteration of copies individually what may not have happened in a much greater length of time when there was no printing and when any man who could write could make a written copy and call it an original by matthew mark luke or john nothing appears to me more striking as an illustration of the farreaching effects of traditional prejudice than the errors into which some of our ablest contemporary scholars have fallen by reason of their not having studied paine professor huxley for instance speaking of the freethinkers of the eighteenth century admires the acuteness common sense wit and the broad humanity of the best of them but says there is rarely much to be said for their work as an example of the adequate treatment of a grave and difficult investigation and that they shared with their adversaries to the full the fatal weakness of a priori philosophizing note science and christian tradition p lon ed professor huxley does not name paine evidently because he knows nothing about him yet paine represents the turningpoint of the historical freethinking movement he renounced the a priori method refused to pronounce anything impossible outside pure mathematics rested everything on evidence and really founded the huxleyan school he plagiarized by anticipation many things from the rationalistic leaders of our time from strauss and baur being the first to expatiate on christian mythology from renan being the first to attempt recovery of the human jesus and notably from huxley who has repeated paines arguments on the untrustworthiness of the biblical manuscripts and canon on the inconsistencies of the narratives of christs resurrection and various other points none can be more loyal to the memory of huxley than the present writer and it is even because of my sense of his grand leadership that he is here mentioned as a typical instance of the extent to which the very elect of freethought may be unconsciously victimized by the phantasm with which they are contending he says that butler overthrew freethinkers of the eighteenth century type but paine was of the nineteenth century type and it was precisely because of his critical method that he excited more animosity than his deistical predecessors he compelled the apologists to defend the biblical narratives in detail and thus implicitly acknowledge the tribunal of reason and knowledge to which they were summoned the ultimate answer by police was a confession of judgment a hundred years ago england was suppressing paines works and many an honest englishman has gone to prison for printing and circulating his age of reason the same views are now freely expressed they are heard in the seats of learning and even in the church congress but the suppression of paine begun by bigotry and ignorance is continued in the long indifference of the representatives of our age of reason to their pioneer and founder it is a grievous loss to them and to their cause it is impossible to understand the religious history of england and of america without studying the phases of their evolution represented in the writings of thomas paine in the controversies that grew out of them with such practical accompaniments as the foundation of the theophilanthropist church in paris and new york and of the great rationalist wing of quakerism in america whatever may be the case with scholars in our time those of paines time took the age of reason very seriously indeed beginning with the learned dr richard watson bishop of llandaff a large number of learned men replied to paines work and it became a signal for the commencement of those concessions on the part of theology which have continued to our time and indeed the socalled broad church is to some extent an outcome of the age of reason it would too much enlarge this introduction to cite here the replies made to paine thirtysix are catalogued in the british museum but it may be remarked that they were notably free as a rule from the personalities that raged in the pulpits i must venture to quote one passage from his very learned antagonist the rev gilbert wakefield ba late fellow of jesus college cambridge wakefield who had resided in london during all the paine panic and was well acquainted with the slanders uttered against the author of rights of man indirectly brands them in answering paines argument that the original and traditional unbelief of the jews among whom the alleged miracles were wrought is an important evidence against them the learned divine writes but the subject before us admits of further illustration from the example of mr paine himself in this country where his opposition to the corruptions of government has raised him so many adversaries and such a swarm of unprincipled hirelings have exerted themselves in blackening his character and in misrepresenting all the transactions and incidents of his life will it not be a most difficult nay an impossible task for posterity after a lapse of years if such a wreck of modern literature as that of the ancient should intervene to identify the real circumstances moral and civil of the man and will a true historian such as the evangelists be credited at that future period against such a predominant incredulity without large and mighty accessions of collateral attestation and how transcendently extraordinary i had almost said miraculous will it be estimated by candid and reasonable minds that a writer whose object was a melioration of condition to the common people and their deliverance from oppression poverty wretchedness to the numberless blessings of upright and equal government should be reviled persecuted and burned in effigy with every circumstance of insult and execration by these very objects of his benevolent intentions in every corner of the kingdom after the execution of louis xvi for whose life paine pleaded so earnestly while in england he was denounced as an accomplice in the deed he devoted himself to the preparation of a constitution and also to gathering up his religious compositions and adding to them this manuscript i suppose to have been prepared in what was variously known as whites hotel or philadelphia house in paris no passage des petits peres this compilation of early and fresh manuscripts if my theory be correct was labelled the age of reason and given for translation to francois lanthenas in march it is entered in qudrard la france literaire under the year but with the title lage de la raison instead of that which it bore in le siecle de la raison the latter printed au burcau de limprimerie rue du theatrefrancais no is said to be by thomas paine citoyen et cultivateur de iamerique septentrionale secretaire du congres du departement des affaires etrangeres pendant la guerre damerique et auteur des ouvrages intitules la sens commun et les droits de lhomme when the revolution was advancing to increasing terrors paine unwilling to participate in the decrees of a convention whose sole legal function was to frame a constitution retired to an old mansion and garden in the faubourg st denis no mr jg alger whose researches in personal details connected with the revolution are original and useful recently showed me in the national archives at paris some papers connected with the trial of georgeit paines landlord by which it appears that the present no is not as i had supposed the house in which paine resided mr alger accompanied me to the neighborhood but we were not able to identify the house the arrest of georgeit is mentioned by paine in his essay on forgetfulness writings iii when his trial came on one of the charges was that he had kept in his house paine and other englishmen paine being then in prison but he georgeit was acquitted of the paltry accusations brought against him by his section the faubourg du nord this section took in the whole east side of the faubourg st denis whereas the present no is on the west side after georgeit or georger had been arrested paine was left alone in the large mansion said by rickman to have been once the hotel of madame de pompadour and it would appear by his account that it was after the execution october of his friends the girondins and political comrades that he felt his end at hand and set about his last literary bequest to the world the age of reason in the state in which it has since appeared as he is careful to say there was every probability during the months in which he wrote november and december that he would be executed his religious testament was prepared with the blade of the guillotine suspended over him a fact which did not deter pious mythologists from portraying his deathbed remorse for having written the book in editing part i of the age of reason i follow closely the first edition which was printed by barrois in paris from the manuscript no doubt under the superintendence of joel barlow to whom paine on his way to the luxembourg had confided it barlow was an american exclergyman a speculator on whose career french archives cast an unfavorable light and one cannot be certain that no liberties were taken with paines proofs i may repeat here what i have stated in the outset of my editorial work on paine that my rule is to correct obvious misprints and also any punctuation which seems to render the sense less clear and to that i will now add that in following paines quotations from the bible i have adopted the plan now generally used in place of his occasionally too extended writing out of book chapter and verse paine was imprisoned in the luxembourg on december and released on november his liberation was secured by his old friend james monroe afterwards president who had succeeded his paines relentless enemy gouvemeur morris as american minister in paris he was found by monroe more dead than alive from semistarvation cold and an abscess contracted in prison and taken to the ministers own residence it was not supposed that he could survive and he owed his life to the tender care of mr and mrs monroe it was while thus a prisoner in his room with death still hovering over him that paine wrote part second of the age of reason the work was published in london by hd symonds on october and claimed to be from the authors manuscript it is marked as entered at stationers hall and prefaced by an apologetic note of the bookseller to the public whose commonplaces about avoiding both prejudice and partiality and considering both sides need not be quoted while his volume was going through the press in paris paine heard of the publication in london which drew from him the following hurried note to a london publisher no doubt daniel isaacs eaton sir i have seen advertised in the london papers the second edition part of the age of reason printed the advertisement says from the authors manuscript and entered at stationers hall i have never sent any manuscript to any person it is therefore a forgery to say it is printed from the authors manuscript and i suppose is done to give the publisher a pretence of copy right which he has no title to i send you a printed copy which is the only one i have sent to london i wish you to make a cheap edition of it i know not by what means any copy has got over to london if any person has made a manuscript copy i have no doubt but it is full of errors i wish you would talk to mr upon this subject as i wish to know by what means this trick has been played and from whom the publisher has got possession of any copy t paine paris december eatons cheap edition appeared january with the above letter on the reverse of the title the blank in the note was probably symonds in the original and possibly that publisher was imposed upon eaton already in trouble for printing one of paines political pamphlets fled to america and an edition of the age of reason was issued under a new title no publisher appears it is said to be printed for and sold by all the booksellers in great britain and ireland it is also said to be by thomas paine author of several remarkable performances i have never found any copy of this anonymous edition except the one in my possession it is evidently the edition which was suppressed by the prosecution of williams for selling a copy of it a comparison with paines revised edition reveals a good many clerical and verbal errors in symonds though few that affect the sense the worst are in the preface where instead of the misleading date is given as the year at whose close paine completed part first an error that spread far and wide and was fastened on by his calumnious american biographer cheetham to prove his inconsistency the editors have been fairly demoralized by and have altered in different ways the following sentence of the preface in symonds the intolerant spirit of religious persecution had transferred itself into politics the tribunals styled revolutionary supplied the place of the inquisition and the guillotine of the state outdid the fire and faggot of the church the rogue who copied this little knew the care with which paine weighed words and that he would never call persecution religious nor connect the guillotine with the state nor concede that with all its horrors it had outdone the history of fire and faggot what paine wrote was the intolerant spirit of church persecution had transferred itself into politics the tribunals styled revolutionary supplied the place of an inquisition and the guillotine of the stake an original letter of paine in the possession of joseph cowen exmp which that gentleman permits me to bring to light besides being one of general interest makes clear the circumstances of the original publication although the name of the correspondent does not appear on the letter it was certainly written to col john fellows of new york who copyrighted part i of the age of reason he published the pamphlets of joel barlow to whom paine confided his manuscript on his way to prison fellows was afterwards paines intimate friend in new york and it was chiefly due to him that some portions of the authors writings left in manuscript to madame bonneville while she was a freethinker were rescued from her devout destructiveness after her return to catholicism the letter which mr cowen sends me is dated at paris january sir your friend mr caritat being on the point of his departure for america i make it the opportunity of writing to you i received two letters from you with some pamphlets a considerable time past in which you inform me of your entering a copyright of the first part of the age of reason when i return to america we will settle for that matter as doctor franklin has been my intimate friend for thirty years past you will naturally see the reason of my continuing the connection with his grandson i printed here paris about fifteen thousand of the second part of the age of reason which i sent to mr franklin bache i gave him notice of it in september and the copyright by my own direction was entered by him the books did not arrive till april following but he had advertised it long before i sent to him in august last a manuscript letter of about pages from me to mr washington to be printed in a pamphlet mr barnes of philadelphia carried the letter from me over to london to be forwarded to america it went by the ship hope cap harley who since his return from america told me that he put it into the post office at new york for bache i have yet no certain account of its publication i mention this that the letter may be enquired after in case it has not been published or has not arrived to mr bache barnes wrote to me from london august informing me that he was offered three hundred pounds sterling for the manuscript the offer was refused because it was my intention it should not appear till it appeared in america as that and not england was the place for its operation you ask me by your letter to mr caritat for a list of my several works in order to publish a collection of them this is an undertaking i have always reserved for myself it not only belongs to me of right but nobody but myself can do it and as every author is accountable at least in reputation for his works he only is the person to do it if he neglects it in his lifetime the case is altered it is my intention to return to america in the course of the present year i shall then do it by subscription with historical notes as this work will employ many persons in different parts of the union i will confer with you upon the subject and such part of it as will suit you to undertake will be at your choice i have sustained so much loss by disinterestedness and inattention to money matters and by accidents that i am obliged to look closer to my affairs than i have done the printer an englishman whom i employed here to print the second part of the age of reason made a manuscript copy of the work while he was printing it which he sent to london and sold it was by this means that an edition of it came out in london we are waiting here for news from america of the state of the federal elections you will have heard long before this reaches you that the french government has refused to receive mr pinckney as minister while mr monroe was minister he had the opportunity of softening matters with this government for he was in good credit with them tho they were in high indignation at the infidelity of the washington administration it is time that mr washington retire for he has played off so much prudent hypocrisy between france and england that neither government believes anything he says your friend etc thomas paine it would appear that symonds stolen edition must have got ahead of that sent by paine to franklin bache for some of its errors continue in all modern american editions to the present day as well as in those of england for in england it was only the shilling edition that revised by paine which was suppressed symonds who ministered to the halfcrown folk and who was also publisher of replies to paine was left undisturbed about his pirated edition and the new society for the suppression of vice and immorality fastened on one thomas williams who sold pious tracts but was also convicted june of having sold one copy of the age of reason erskine who had defended paine at his trial for the rights of man conducted the prosecution of williams he gained the victory from a packed jury but was not much elated by it especially after a certain adventure on his way to lincolns inn he felt his coat clutched and beheld at his feet a woman bathed in tears she led him into the small bookshop of thomas williams not yet called up for judgment and there he beheld his victim stitching tracts in a wretched little room where there were three children two suffering with smallpox he saw that it would be ruin and even a sort of murder to take away to prison the husband who was not a freethinker and lamented his publication of the book and a meeting of the society which had retained him was summoned there was a full meeting the bishop of london porteus in the chair erskine reminded them that williams was yet to be brought up for sentence described the scene he had witnessed and williams penitence and as the book was now suppressed asked permission to move for a nominal sentence mercy he urged was a part of the christianity they were defending not one of the society took his side not even philanthropic wilberforce and erskine threw up his brief this action of erskine led the judge to give williams only a year in prison instead of the three he said had been intended while williams was in prison the orthodox colporteurs were circulating erskines speech on christianity but also an anonymous sermon on the existence and attributes of the deity all of which was from paines age of reason except a brief address to the deity appended this picturesque anomaly was repeated in the circulation of paines discourse to the theophilanthropists their and the authors names removed under the title of atheism refuted both of these pamphlets are now before me and beside them a london tract of one page just sent for my spiritual benefit this is headed a word of caution it begins by mentioning the pernicious doctrines of paine the first being that there is no god sic then proceeds to adduce evidences of divine existence taken from paines works it should be added that this one dingy page is the only survival of the ancient paine effigy in the tract form which i have been able to find in recent years and to this no society or publishers name is attached the imprisonment of williams was the beginning of a thirty years war for religious liberty in england in the course of which occurred many notable events such as eaton receiving homage in his pillory at choring cross and the whole carlile family imprisoned its head imprisoned more than nine years for publishing the age of reason this last victory of persecution was suicidal gentlemen of wealth not adherents of paine helped in setting carlile up in business in fleet street where freethinking publications have since been sold without interruption but though liberty triumphed in one sense the age of reason remained to some extent suppressed among those whose attention it especially merited its original prosecution by a society for the suppression of vice a device to relieve the crown amounted to a libel upon a morally clean book restricting its perusal in families and the fact that the shilling book sold by and among humble people was alone prosecuted diffused among the educated an equally false notion that the age of reason was vulgar and illiterate the theologians as we have seen estimated more justly the ability of their antagonist the collaborator of franklin rittenhouse and clymer on whom the university of pennsylvania had conferred the degree of master of arts but the gentry confused paine with the class described by burke as the swinish multitude skepticism or its free utterance was temporarily driven out of polite circles by its complication with the outlawed vindicator of the rights of man but that long combat has now passed away time has reduced the age of reason from a flag of popular radicalism to a comparatively conservative treatise so far as its negations are concerned an old friend tells me that in his youth he heard a sermon in which the preacher declared that tom paine was so wicked that he could not be buried his bones were thrown into a box which was bandied about the world till it came to a buttonmanufacturer and now paine is travelling round the world in the form of buttons this variant of the wandering jew myth may now be regarded as unconscious homage to the author whose metaphorical bones may be recognized in buttons now fashionable and some even found useful in holding clerical vestments together but the careful reader will find in paines age of reason something beyond negations and in conclusion i will especially call attention to the new departure in theism indicated in a passage corresponding to a famous aphorism of kant indicated by a note in part ii the discovery already mentioned that part i was written at least fourteen years before part ii led me to compare the two and it is plain that while the earlier work is an amplification of newtonian deism based on the phenomena of planetary motion the work of bases belief in god on the universal display of himself in the works of the creation and by that repugnance we feel in ourselves to bad actions and disposition to do good ones this exaltation of the moral nature of man to be the foundation of theistic religion though now familiar was a hundred years ago a new affirmation it has led on a conception of deity subversive of lastcentury deism it has steadily humanized religion and its ultimate philosophical and ethical results have not yet been reached chapter i the authors profession of faith it has been my intention for several years past to publish my thoughts upon religion i am well aware of the difficulties that attend the subject and from that consideration had reserved it to a more advanced period of life i intended it to be the last offering i should make to my fellowcitizens of all nations and that at a time when the purity of the motive that induced me to it could not admit of a question even by those who might disapprove the work the circumstance that has now taken place in france of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion and compulsive articles of faith has not only precipitated my intention but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary lest in the general wreck of superstition of false systems of government and false theology we lose sight of morality of humanity and of the theology that is true as several of my colleagues and others of my fellowcitizens of france have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual profession of faith i also will make mine and i do this with all that sincerity and frankness with which the mind of man communicates with itself i believe in one god and no more and i hope for happiness beyond this life i believe the equality of man and i believe that religious duties consist in doing justice loving mercy and endeavoring to make our fellowcreatures happy but lest it should be supposed that i believe many other things in addition to these i shall in the progress of this work declare the things i do not believe and my reasons for not believing them i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe it is impossible to calculate the moral mischief if i may so express it that mental lying has produced in society when a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime he takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain and in order to qualify himself for that trade he begins with a perjury can we conceive anything more destructive to morality than this soon after i had published the pamphlet common sense in america i saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion the adulterous connection of church and state wherever it had taken place whether jewish christian or turkish had so effectually prohibited by pains and penalties every discussion upon established creeds and upon first principles of religion that until the system of government should be changed those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world but that whenever this should be done a revolution in the system of religion would follow human inventions and priestcraft would be detected and man would return to the pure unmixed and unadulterated belief of one god and no more chapter ii of missions and revelations every national church or religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from god communicated to certain individuals the jews have their moses the christians their jesus christ their apostles and saints and the turks their mahomet as if the way to god was not open to every man alike each of those churches shows certain books which they call revelation or the word of god the jews say that their word of god was given by god to moses face to face the christians say that their word of god came by divine inspiration and the turks say that their word of god the koran was brought by an angel from heaven each of those churches accuses the other of unbelief and for my own part i disbelieve them all as it is necessary to affix right ideas to words i will before i proceed further into the subject offer some observations on the word revelation revelation when applied to religion means something communicated immediately from god to man no one will deny or dispute the power of the almighty to make such a communication if he pleases but admitting for the sake of a case that something has been revealed to a certain person and not revealed to any other person it is revelation to that person only when he tells it to a second person a second to a third a third to a fourth and so on it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons it is revelation to the first person only and hearsay to every other and consequently they are not obliged to believe it it is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call anything a revelation that comes to us at second hand either verbally or in writing revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication after this it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him and though he may find himself obliged to believe it it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner for it was not a revelation made to me and i have only his word for it that it was made to him when moses told the children of israel that he received the two tables of the commandments from the hand of god they were not obliged to believe him because they had no other authority for it than his telling them so and i have no other authority for it than some historian telling me so the commandments carrying no internal evidence of divinity with them they contain some good moral precepts such as any man qualified to be a lawgiver or a legislator could produce himself without having recourse to supernatural intervention note it is however necessary to except the declamation which says that god visits the sins of the fathers upon the children this is contrary to every principle of moral justice author when i am told that the koran was written in heaven and brought to mahomet by an angel the account comes to near the same kind of hearsay evidence and second hand authority as the former i did not see the angel myself and therefore i have a right not to believe it when also i am told that a woman called the virgin mary said or gave out that she was with child without any cohabitation with a man and that her betrothed husband joseph said that an angel told him so i have a right to believe them or not such a circumstance required a much stronger evidence than their bare word for it but we have not even this for neither joseph nor mary wrote any such matter themselves it is only reported by others that they said so it is hearsay upon hearsay and i do not chose to rest my belief upon such evidence it is however not difficult to account for the credit that was given to the story of jesus christ being the son of god he was born when the heathen mythology had still some fashion and repute in the world and that mythology had prepared the people for the belief of such a story almost all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen mythology were reputed to be the sons of some of their gods it was not a new thing at that time to believe a man to have been celestially begotten the intercourse of gods with women was then a matter of familiar opinion their jupiter according to their accounts had cohabited with hundreds the story therefore had nothing in it either new wonderful or obscene it was conformable to the opinions that then prevailed among the people called gentiles or mythologists and it was those people only that believed it the jews who had kept strictly to the belief of one god and no more and who had always rejected the heathen mythology never credited the story it is curious to observe how the theory of what is called the christian church sprung out of the tail of the heathen mythology a direct incorporation took place in the first instance by making the reputed founder to be celestially begotten the trinity of gods that then followed was no other than a reduction of the former plurality which was about twenty or thirty thousand the statue of mary succeeded the statue of diana of ephesus the deification of heroes changed into the canonization of saints the mythologists had gods for everything the christian mythologists had saints for everything the church became as crowded with the one as the pantheon had been with the other and rome was the place of both the christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient mythologists accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue and it yet remains to reason and philosophy to abolish the amphibious fraud chapter iii concerning the character of jesus christ and his history nothing that is here said can apply even with the most distant disrespect to the real character of jesus christ he was a virtuous and an amiable man the morality that he preached and practiced was of the most benevolent kind and though similar systems of morality had been preached by confucius and by some of the greek philosophers many years before by the quakers since and by many good men in all ages it has not been exceeded by any jesus christ wrote no account of himself of his birth parentage or anything else not a line of what is called the new testament is of his writing the history of him is altogether the work of other people and as to the account given of his resurrection and ascension it was the necessary counterpart to the story of his birth his historians having brought him into the world in a supernatural manner were obliged to take him out again in the same manner or the first part of the story must have fallen to the ground the wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told exceeds everything that went before it the first part that of the miraculous conception was not a thing that admitted of publicity and therefore the tellers of this part of the story had this advantage that though they might not be credited they could not be detected they could not be expected to prove it because it was not one of those things that admitted of proof and it was impossible that the person of whom it was told could prove it himself but the resurrection of a dead person from the grave and his ascension through the air is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits of to the invisible conception of a child in the womb the resurrection and ascension supposing them to have taken place admitted of public and ocular demonstration like that of the ascension of a balloon or the sun at noon day to all jerusalem at least a thing which everybody is required to believe requires that the proof and evidence of it should be equal to all and universal and as the public visibility of this last related act was the only evidence that could give sanction to the former part the whole of it falls to the ground because that evidence never was given instead of this a small number of persons not more than eight or nine are introduced as proxies for the whole world to say they saw it and all the rest of the world are called upon to believe it but it appears that thomas did not believe the resurrection and as they say would not believe without having ocular and manual demonstration himself so neither will i and the reason is equally as good for me and for every other person as for thomas it is in vain to attempt to palliate or disguise this matter the story so far as relates to the supernatural part has every mark of fraud and imposition stamped upon the face of it who were the authors of it is as impossible for us now to know as it is for us to be assured that the books in which the account is related were written by the persons whose names they bear the best surviving evidence we now have respecting this affair is the jews they are regularly descended from the people who lived in the time this resurrection and ascension is said to have happened and they say it is not true it has long appeared to me a strange inconsistency to cite the jews as a proof of the truth of the story it is just the same as if a man were to say i will prove the truth of what i have told you by producing the people who say it is false that such a person as jesus christ existed and that he was crucified which was the mode of execution at that day are historical relations strictly within the limits of probability he preached most excellent morality and the equality of man but he preached also against the corruptions and avarice of the jewish priests and this brought upon him the hatred and vengeance of the whole order of priesthood the accusation which those priests brought against him was that of sedition and conspiracy against the roman government to which the jews were then subject and tributary and it is not improbable that the roman government might have some secret apprehension of the effects of his doctrine as well as the jewish priests neither is it improbable that jesus christ had in contemplation the delivery of the jewish nation from the bondage of the romans between the two however this virtuous reformer and revolutionist lost his life note the french work has here however this may be for one or the other of these suppositions this virtuous reformer this revolutionist too little imitated too much forgotten too much misunderstood lost his life editor conway chapter iv of the bases of christianity it is upon this plain narrative of facts together with another case i am going to mention that the christian mythologists calling themselves the christian church have erected their fable which for absurdity and extravagance is not exceeded by anything that is to be found in the mythology of the ancients the ancient mythologists tell us that the race of giants made war against jupiter and that one of them threw a hundred rocks against him at one throw that jupiter defeated him with thunder and confined him afterwards under mount etna and that every time the giant turns himself mount etna belches fire it is here easy to see that the circumstance of the mountain that of its being a volcano suggested the idea of the fable and that the fable is made to fit and wind itself up with that circumstance the christian mythologists tell that their satan made war against the almighty who defeated him and confined him afterwards not under a mountain but in a pit it is here easy to see that the first fable suggested the idea of the second for the fable of jupiter and the giants was told many hundred years before that of satan thus far the ancient and the christian mythologists differ very little from each other but the latter have contrived to carry the matter much farther they have contrived to connect the fabulous part of the story of jesus christ with the fable originating from mount etna and in order to make all the parts of the story tie together they have taken to their aid the traditions of the jews for the christian mythology is made up partly from the ancient mythology and partly from the jewish traditions the christian mythologists after having confined satan in a pit were obliged to let him out again to bring on the sequel of the fable he is then introduced into the garden of eden in the shape of a snake or a serpent and in that shape he enters into familiar conversation with eve who is no ways surprised to hear a snake talk and the issue of this teteatate is that he persuades her to eat an apple and the eating of that apple damns all mankind after giving satan this triumph over the whole creation one would have supposed that the church mythologists would have been kind enough to send him back again to the pit or if they had not done this that they would have put a mountain upon him for they say that their faith can remove a mountain or have put him under a mountain as the former mythologists had done to prevent his getting again among the women and doing more mischief but instead of this they leave him at large without even obliging him to give his parole the secret of which is that they could not do without him and after being at the trouble of making him they bribed him to stay they promised him all the jews all the turks by anticipation ninetenths of the world beside and mahomet into the bargain after this who can doubt the bountifulness of the christian mythology having thus made an insurrection and a battle in heaven in which none of the combatants could be either killed or wounded put satan into the pit let him out again given him a triumph over the whole creation damned all mankind by the eating of an apple there christian mythologists bring the two ends of their fable together they represent this virtuous and amiable man jesus christ to be at once both god and man and also the son of god celestially begotten on purpose to be sacrificed because they say that eve in her longing note the french work has yielding to an unrestrained appetite editor had eaten an apple chapter v examination in detail of the preceding bases putting aside everything that might excite laughter by its absurdity or detestation by its profaneness and confining ourselves merely to an examination of the parts it is impossible to conceive a story more derogatory to the almighty more inconsistent with his wisdom more contradictory to his power than this story is in order to make for it a foundation to rise upon the inventors were under the necessity of giving to the being whom they call satan a power equally as great if not greater than they attribute to the almighty they have not only given him the power of liberating himself from the pit after what they call his fall but they have made that power increase afterwards to infinity before this fall they represent him only as an angel of limited existence as they represent the rest after his fall he becomes by their account omnipresent he exists everywhere and at the same time he occupies the whole immensity of space not content with this deification of satan they represent him as defeating by stratagem in the shape of an animal of the creation all the power and wisdom of the almighty they represent him as having compelled the almighty to the direct necessity either of surrendering the whole of the creation to the government and sovereignty of this satan or of capitulating for its redemption by coming down upon earth and exhibiting himself upon a cross in the shape of a man had the inventors of this story told it the contrary way that is had they represented the almighty as compelling satan to exhibit himself on a cross in the shape of a snake as a punishment for his new transgression the story would have been less absurd less contradictory but instead of this they make the transgressor triumph and the almighty fall that many good men have believed this strange fable and lived very good lives under that belief for credulity is not a crime is what i have no doubt of in the first place they were educated to believe it and they would have believed anything else in the same manner there are also many who have been so enthusiastically enraptured by what they conceived to be the infinite love of god to man in making a sacrifice of himself that the vehemence of the idea has forbidden and deterred them from examining into the absurdity and profaneness of the story the more unnatural anything is the more is it capable of becoming the object of dismal admiration note the french work has blind and preceding dismal editor chapter vi of the true theology but if objects for gratitude and admiration are our desire do they not present themselves every hour to our eyes do we not see a fair creation prepared to receive us the instant we are born a world furnished to our hands that cost us nothing is it we that light up the sun that pour down the rain and fill the earth with abundance whether we sleep or wake the vast machinery of the universe still goes on are these things and the blessings they indicate in future nothing to us can our gross feelings be excited by no other subjects than tragedy and suicide or is the gloomy pride of man become so intolerable that nothing can flatter it but a sacrifice of the creator i know that this bold investigation will alarm many but it would be paying too great a compliment to their credulity to forbear it on that account the times and the subject demand it to be done the suspicion that the theory of what is called the christian church is fabulous is becoming very extensive in all countries and it will be a consolation to men staggering under that suspicion and doubting what to believe and what to disbelieve to see the subject freely investigated i therefore pass on to an examination of the books called the old and the new testament chapter vii examination of the old testament these books beginning with genesis and ending with revelations which by the bye is a book of riddles that requires a revelation to explain it are we are told the word of god it is therefore proper for us to know who told us so that we may know what credit to give to the report the answer to this question is that nobody can tell except that we tell one another so the case however historically appears to be as follows when the church mythologists established their system they collected all the writings they could find and managed them as they pleased it is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us whether such of the writings as now appear under the name of the old and the new testament are in the same state in which those collectors say they found them or whether they added altered abridged or dressed them up be this as it may they decided by vote which of the books out of the collection they had made should be the word of god and which should not they rejected several they voted others to be doubtful such as the books called the apocrypha and those books which had a majority of votes were voted to be the word of god had they voted otherwise all the people since calling themselves christians had believed otherwise for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the other who the people were that did all this we know nothing of they call themselves by the general name of the church and this is all we know of the matter as we have no other external evidence or authority for believing these books to be the word of god than what i have mentioned which is no evidence or authority at all i come in the next place to examine the internal evidence contained in the books themselves in the former part of this essay i have spoken of revelation i now proceed further with that subject for the purpose of applying it to the books in question revelation is a communication of something which the person to whom that thing is revealed did not know before for if i have done a thing or seen it done it needs no revelation to tell me i have done it or seen it nor to enable me to tell it or to write it revelation therefore cannot be applied to anything done upon earth of which man is himself the actor or the witness and consequently all the historical and anecdotal part of the bible which is almost the whole of it is not within the meaning and compass of the word revelation and therefore is not the word of god when samson ran off with the gateposts of gaza if he ever did so and whether he did or not is nothing to us or when he visited his delilah or caught his foxes or did anything else what has revelation to do with these things if they were facts he could tell them himself or his secretary if he kept one could write them if they were worth either telling or writing and if they were fictions revelation could not make them true and whether true or not we are neither the better nor the wiser for knowing them when we contemplate the immensity of that being who directs and governs the incomprehensible whole of which the utmost ken of human sight can discover but a part we ought to feel shame at calling such paltry stories the word of god as to the account of the creation with which the book of genesis opens it has all the appearance of being a tradition which the israelites had among them before they came into egypt and after their departure from that country they put it at the head of their history without telling as it is most probable that they did not know how they came by it the manner in which the account opens shows it to be traditionary it begins abruptly it is nobody that speaks it is nobody that hears it is addressed to nobody it has neither first second nor third person it has every criterion of being a tradition it has no voucher moses does not take it upon himself by introducing it with the formality that he uses on other occasions such as that of saying the lords spake unto moses saying why it has been called the mosaic account of the creation i am at a loss to conceive moses i believe was too good a judge of such subjects to put his name to that account he had been educated among the egyptians who were a people as well skilled in science and particularly in astronomy as any people of their day and the silence and caution that moses observes in not authenticating the account is a good negative evidence that he neither told it nor believed it the case is that every nation of people has been worldmakers and the israelites had as much right to set up the trade of worldmaking as any of the rest and as moses was not an israelite he might not chose to contradict the tradition the account however is harmless and this is more than can be said for many other parts of the bible whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and torturous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible note it must be borne in mind that by the bible paine always means the old testament alone editor is filled it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of god it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind and for my own part i sincerely detest it as i detest everything that is cruel we scarcely meet with anything a few phrases excepted but what deserves either our abhorrence or our contempt till we come to the miscellaneous parts of the bible in the anonymous publications the psalms and the book of job more particularly in the latter we find a great deal of elevated sentiment reverentially expressed of the power and benignity of the almighty but they stand on no higher rank than many other compositions on similar subjects as well before that time as since the proverbs which are said to be solomons though most probably a collection because they discover a knowledge of life which his situation excluded him from knowing are an instructive table of ethics they are inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the spaniards and not more wise and oeconomical than those of the american franklin all the remaining parts of the bible generally known by the name of the prophets are the works of the jewish poets and itinerant preachers who mixed poetry anecdote and devotion together and those works still retain the air and style of poetry though in translation note as there are many readers who do not see that a composition is poetry unless it be in rhyme it is for their information that i add this note poetry consists principally in two things imagery and composition the composition of poetry differs from that of prose in the manner of mixing long and short syllables together take a long syllable out of a line of poetry and put a short one in the room of it or put a long syllable where a short one should be and that line will lose its poetical harmony it will have an effect upon the line like that of misplacing a note in a song the imagery in those books called the prophets appertains altogether to poetry it is fictitious and often extravagant and not admissible in any other kind of writing than poetry to show that these writings are composed in poetical numbers i will take ten syllables as they stand in the book and make a line of the same number of syllables heroic measure that shall rhyme with the last word it will then be seen that the composition of those books is poetical measure the instance i shall first produce is from isaiah hear o ye heavens and give ear o earth t is god himself that calls attention forth another instance i shall quote is from the mournful jeremiah to which i shall add two other lines for the purpose of carrying out the figure and showing the intention of the poet o that mine head were waters and mine eyes were fountains flowing like the liquid skies then would i give the mighty flood release and weep a deluge for the human race author there is not throughout the whole book called the bible any word that describes to us what we call a poet nor any word that describes what we call poetry the case is that the word prophet to hich a later times have affixed a new idea was the bible word for poet and the word propesytng meant the art of making poetry it also meant the art of playing poetry to a tune upon any instrument of music we read of prophesying with pipes tabrets and horns of prophesying with harps with psalteries with cymbals and with every other instrument of music then in fashion were we now to speak of prophesying with a fiddle or with a pipe and tabor the expression would have no meaning or would appear ridiculous and to some people contemptuous because we have changed the meaning of the word we are told of saul being among the prophets and also that he prophesied but we are not told what they prophesied nor what he prophesied the case is there was nothing to tell for these prophets were a company of musicians and poets and saul joined in the concert and this was called prophesying the account given of this affair in the book called samuel is that saul met a company of prophets a whole company of them coming down with a psaltery a tabret a pipe and a harp and that they prophesied and that he prophesied with them but it appears afterwards that saul prophesied badly that is he performed his part badly for it is said that an evil spirit from god note as thos men who call themselves divines and commentators are very fond of puzzling one another i leave them to contest the meaning of the first part of the phrase that of an evil sfiirit of god i keep to my text i keep to the meaning of the word prophesy author came upon saul and he prophesied now were there no other passage in the book called the bible than this to demonstrate to us that we have lost the original meaning of the word prophesy and substituted another meaning in its place this alone would be sufficient for it is impossible to use and apply the word prophesy in the place it is here used and applied if we give to it the sense which later times have affixed to it the manner in which it is here used strips it of all religious meaning and shews that a man might then be a prophet or he might prophesy as he may now be a poet or a musician without any regard to the morality or the immorality of his character the word was originally a term of science promiscuously applied to poetry and to music and not restricted to any subject upon which poetry and music might be exercised deborah and barak are called prophets not because they predicted anything but because they composed the poem or song that bears their name in celebration of an act already done david is ranked among the prophets for he was a musician and was also reputed to be though perhaps very erroneously the author of the psalms but abraham isaac and jacob are not called prophets it does not appear from any accounts we have that they could either sing play music or make poetry we are told of the greater and the lesser prophets they might as well tell us of the greater and the lesser god for there cannot be degrees in prophesying consistently with its modern sense but there are degrees in poetry and therefore the phrase is reconcilable to the case when we understand by it the greater and the lesser poets it is altogether unnecessary after this to offer any observations upon what those men styled propliets have written the axe goes at once to the root by showing that the original meaning of the word has been mistaken and consequently all the inferences that have been drawn from those books the devotional respect that has been paid to them and the laboured commentaries that have been written upon them under that mistaken meaning are not worth disputing about in many things however the writings of the jewish poets deserve a better fate than that of being bound up as they now are with the trash that accompanies them under the abused name of the word of god if we permit ourselves to conceive right ideas of things we must necessarily affix the idea not only of unchangeableness but of the utter impossibility of any change taking place by any means or accident whatever in that which we would honour with the name of the word of god and therefore the word of god cannot exist in any written or human language the continually progressive change to which the meaning of words is subject the want of an universal language which renders translation necessary the errors to which translations are again subject the mistakes of copyists and printers together with the possibility of wilful alteration are of themselves evidences that human language whether in speech or in print cannot be the vehicle of the word of god the word of god exists in something else did the book called the bible excel in purity of ideas and expression all the books now extant in the world i would not take it for my rule of faith as being the word of god because the possibility would nevertheless exist of my being imposed upon but when i see throughout the greatest part of this book scarcely anything but a history of the grossest vices and a collection of the most paltry and contemptible tales i cannot dishonour my creator by calling it by his name chapter viii of the new testament thus much for the bible i now go on to the book called the new testament the new testament that is the new will as if there could be two wills of the creator had it been the object or the intention of jesus christ to establish a new religion he would undoubtedly have written the system himself or procured it to be written in his life time but there is no publication extant authenticated with his name all the books called the new testament were written after his death he was a jew by birth and by profession and he was the son of god in like manner that every other person is for the creator is the father of all the first four books called matthew mark luke and john do not give a history of the life of jesus christ but only detached anecdotes of him it appears from these books that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months and it was only during this short time that those men became acquainted with him they make mention of him at the age of twelve years sitting they say among the jewish doctors asking and answering them questions as this was several years before their acquaintance with him began it is most probable they had this anecdote from his parents from this time there is no account of him for about sixteen years where he lived or how he employed himself during this interval is not known most probably he was working at his fathers trade which was that of a carpenter it does not appear that he had any school education and the probability is that he could not write for his parents were extremely poor as appears from their not being able to pay for a bed when he was born note one of the few errors traceable to paines not having a bible at hand while writing part i there is no indication that the family was poor but the reverse may in fact be inferred editor it is somewhat curious that the three persons whose names are the most universally recorded were of very obscure parentage moses was a foundling jesus christ was born in a stable and mahomet was a mule driver the first and the last of these men were founders of different systems of religion but jesus christ founded no new system he called men to the practice of moral virtues and the belief of one god the great trait in his character is philanthropy the manner in which he was apprehended shows that he was not much known at that time and it shows also that the meetings he then held with his followers were in secret and that he had given over or suspended preaching publicly judas could no otherways betray him than by giving information where he was and pointing him out to the officers that went to arrest him and the reason for employing and paying judas to do this could arise only from the causes already mentioned that of his not being much known and living concealed the idea of his concealment not only agrees very ill with his reputed divinity but associates with it something of pusillanimity and his being betrayed or in other words his being apprehended on the information of one of his followers shows that he did not intend to be apprehended and consequently that he did not intend to be crucified the christian mythologists tell us that christ died for the sins of the world and that he came on purpose to die would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox of old age or of anything else the declaratory sentence which they say was passed upon adam in case he ate of the apple was not that thou shalt surely be crucified but thou shale surely die the sentence was death and not the manner of dying crucifixion therefore or any other particular manner of dying made no part of the sentence that adam was to suffer and consequently even upon their own tactic it could make no part of the sentence that christ was to suffer in the room of adam a fever would have done as well as a cross if there was any occasion for either this sentence of death which they tell us was thus passed upon adam must either have meant dying naturally that is ceasing to live or have meant what these mythologists call damnation and consequently the act of dying on the part of jesus christ must according to their system apply as a prevention to one or other of these two things happening to adam and to us that it does not prevent our dying is evident because we all die and if their accounts of longevity be true men die faster since the crucifixion than before and with respect to the second explanation including with it the natural death of jesus christ as a substitute for the eternal death or damnation of all mankind it is impertinently representing the creator as coming off or revoking the sentence by a pun or a quibble upon the word death that manufacturer of quibbles st paul if he wrote the books that bear his name has helped this quibble on by making another quibble upon the word adam he makes there to be two adams the one who sins in fact and suffers by proxy the other who sins by proxy and suffers in fact a religion thus interlarded with quibble subterfuge and pun has a tendency to instruct its professors in the practice of these arts they acquire the habit without being aware of the cause if jesus christ was the being which those mythologists tell us he was and that he came into this world to suffer which is a word they sometimes use instead of to die the only real suffering he could have endured would have been to live his existence here was a state of exilement or transportation from heaven and the way back to his original country was to die in fine everything in this strange system is the reverse of what it pretends to be it is the reverse of truth and i become so tired of examining into its inconsistencies and absurdities that i hasten to the conclusion of it in order to proceed to something better how much or what parts of the books called the new testament were written by the persons whose names they bear is what we can know nothing of neither are we certain in what language they were originally written the matters they now contain may be classed under two heads anecdote and epistolary correspondence the four books already mentioned matthew mark luke and john are altogether anecdotal they relate events after they had taken place they tell what jesus christ did and said and what others did and said to him and in several instances they relate the same event differently revelation is necessarily out of the question with respect to those books not only because of the disagreement of the writers but because revelation cannot be applied to the relating of facts by the persons who saw them done nor to the relating or recording of any discourse or conversation by those who heard it the book called the acts of the apostles an anonymous work belongs also to the anecdotal part all the other parts of the new testament except the book of enigmas called the revelations are a collection of letters under the name of epistles and the forgery of letters has been such a common practice in the world that the probability is at least equal whether they are genuine or forged one thing however is much less equivocal which is that out of the matters contained in those books together with the assistance of some old stories the church has set up a system of religion very contradictory to the character of the person whose name it bears it has set up a religion of pomp and of revenue in pretended imitation of a person whose life was humility and poverty the invention of a purgatory and of the releasing of souls therefrom by prayers bought of the church with money the selling of pardons dispensations and indulgences are revenue laws without bearing that name or carrying that appearance but the case nevertheless is that those things derive their origin from the proxysm of the crucifixion and the theory deduced therefrom which was that one person could stand in the place of another and could perform meritorious services for him the probability therefore is that the whole theory or doctrine of what is called the redemption which is said to have been accomplished by the act of one person in the room of another was originally fabricated on purpose to bring forward and build all those secondary and pecuniary redemptions upon and that the passages in the books upon which the idea of theory of redemption is built have been manufactured and fabricated for that purpose why are we to give this church credit when she tells us that those books are genuine in every part any more than we give her credit for everything else she has told us or for the miracles she says she has performed that she could fabricate writings is certain because she could write and the composition of the writings in question is of that kind that anybody might do it and that she did fabricate them is not more inconsistent with probability than that she should tell us as she has done that she could and did work miracles since then no external evidence can at this long distance of time be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine called redemption or not for such evidence whether for or against would be subject to the same suspicion of being fabricated the case can only be referred to the internal evidence which the thing carries of itself and this affords a very strong presumption of its being a fabrication for the internal evidence is that the theory or doctrine of redemption has for its basis an idea of pecuniary justice and not that of moral justice if i owe a person money and cannot pay him and he threatens to put me in prison another person can take the debt upon himself and pay it for me but if i have committed a crime every circumstance of the case is changed moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty even if the innocent would offer itself to suppose justice to do this is to destroy the principle of its existence which is the thingitself it is then no longer justice it is indiscriminate revenge this single reflection will show that the doctrine of redemption is founded on a mere pecuniary idea corresponding to that of a debt which another person might pay and as this pecuniary idea corresponds again with the system of second redemptions obtained through the means of money given to the church for pardons the probability is that the same persons fabricated both the one and the other of those theories and that in truth there is no such thing as redemption that it is fabulous and that man stands in the same relative condition with his maker he ever did stand since man existed and that it is his greatest consolation to think so let him believe this and he will live more consistently and morally than by any other system it is by his being taught to contemplate himself as an outlaw as an outcast as a beggar as a mumper as one thrown as it were on a dunghill at an immense distance from his creator and who must make his approaches by creeping and cringing to intermediate beings that he conceives either a contemptuous disregard for everything under the name of religion or becomes indifferent or turns what he calls devout in the latter case he consumes his life in grief or the affectation of it his prayers are reproaches his humility is ingratitude he calls himself a worm and the fertile earth a dunghill and all the blessings of life by the thankless name of vanities he despises the choicest gift of god to man the gift of reason and having endeavoured to force upon himself the belief of a system against which reason revolts he ungratefully calls it human reason as if man could give reason to himself yet with all this strange appearance of humility and this contempt for human reason he ventures into the boldest presumptions he finds fault with everything his selfishness is never satisfied his ingratitude is never at an end he takes on himself to direct the almighty what to do even in the govemment of the universe he prays dictatorially when it is sunshine he prays for rain and when it is rain he prays for sunshine he follows the same idea in everything that he prays for for what is the amount of all his prayers but an attempt to make the almighty change his mind and act otherwise than he does it is as if he were to say thou knowest not so well as i chapter ix in what the true revelation consists but some perhaps will say are we to have no word of god no revelation i answer yes there is a word of god there is a revelation the word of god is the creation we behold and it is in this word which no human invention can counterfeit or alter that god speaketh universally to man human language is local and changeable and is therefore incapable of being used as the means of unchangeable and universal information the idea that god sent jesus christ to publish as they say the glad tidings to all nations from one end of the earth unto the other is consistent only with the ignorance of those who know nothing of the extent of the world and who believed as those worldsaviours believed and continued to believe for several centuries and that in contradiction to the discoveries of philosophers and the experience of navigators that the earth was flat like a trencher and that a man might walk to the end of it but how was jesus christ to make anything known to all nations he could speak but one language which was hebrew and there are in the world several hundred languages scarcely any two nations speak the same language or understand each other and as to translations every man who knows anything of languages knows that it is impossible to translate from one language into another not only without losing a great part of the original but frequently of mistaking the sense and besides all this the art of printing was wholly unknown at the time christ lived it is always necessary that the means that are to accomplish any end be equal to the accomplishment of that end or the end cannot be accomplished it is in this that the difference between finite and infinite power and wisdom discovers itself man frequently fails in accomplishing his end from a natural inability of the power to the purpose and frequently from the want of wisdom to apply power properly but it is impossible for infinite power and wisdom to fail as man faileth the means it useth are always equal to the end but human language more especially as there is not an universal language is incapable of being used as an universal means of unchangeable and uniform information and therefore it is not the means that god useth in manifesting himself universally to man it is only in the creation that all our ideas and conceptions of a word of god can unite the creation speaketh an universal language independently of human speech or human language multiplied and various as they be it is an ever existing original which every man can read it cannot be forged it cannot be counterfeited it cannot be lost it cannot be altered it cannot be suppressed it does not depend upon the will of man whether it shall be published or not it publishes itself from one end of the earth to the other it preaches to all nations and to all worlds and this word of god reveals to man all that is necessary for man to know of god do we want to contemplate his power we see it in the immensity of the creation do we want to contemplate his wisdom we see it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible whole is governed do we want to contemplate his munificence we see it in the abundance with which he fills the earth do we want to contemplate his mercy we see it in his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful in fine do we want to know what god is search not the book called the scripture which any human hand might make but the scripture called the creation chapter x concerning god and the lights cast on his existence and attributes by the bible the only idea man can affix to the name of god is that of a first cause the cause of all things and incomprehensibly difficult as it is for a man to conceive what a first cause is he arrives at the belief of it from the tenfold greater difficulty of disbelieving it it is difficult beyond description to conceive that space can have no end but it is more difficult to conceive an end it is difficult beyond the power of man to conceive an eternal duration of what we call time but it is more impossible to conceive a time when there shall be no time in like manner of reasoning everything we behold carries in itself the internal evidence that it did not make itself every man is an evidence to himself that he did not make himself neither could his father make himself nor his grandfather nor any of his race neither could any tree plant or animal make itself and it is the conviction arising from this evidence that carries us on as it were by necessity to the belief of a first cause eternally existing of a nature totally different to any material existence we know of and by the power of which all things exist and this first cause man calls god it is only by the exercise of reason that man can discover god take away that reason and he would be incapable of understanding anything and in this case it would be just as consistent to read even the book called the bible to a horse as to a man how then is it that those people pretend to reject reason almost the only parts in the book called the bible that convey to us any idea of god are some chapters in job and the th psalm i recollect no other those parts are true deistical compositions for they treat of the deity through his works they take the book of creation as the word of god they refer to no other book and all the inferences they make are drawn from that volume i insert in this place the th psalm as paraphrased into english verse by addison i recollect not the prose and where i write this i have not the opportunity of seeing it the spacious firmament on bigh with all the blue etherial sky and spangled heavens a shining frame their great original proclaim the unwearied sun from day to day does his creators power display and publishes to every land the work of an almighty hand soon as the evening shades prevail the moon takes up the wondrous tale and nightly to the listning earth repeats the story of her birth whilst all the stars that round her burn and all the planets in their turn confirm the tidings as they roll and spread the truth from pole to pole what though in solemn silence all move round this dark terrestrial ball what though no real voice nor sound amidst their radiant orbs be found in reasons ear they all rejoice and utter forth a glorious voice forever singing as they shine the hand that made us is divine what more does man want to know than that the hand or power that made these things is divine is omnipotent let him believe this with the force it is impossible to repel if he permits his reason to act and his rule of moral life will follow of course the allusions in job have all of them the same tendency with this psalm that of deducing or proving a truth that would be otherwise unknown from truths already known i recollect not enough of the passages in job to insert them correctly but there is one that occurs to me that is applicable to the subject i am speaking upon canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the almighty to perfection i know not how the printers have pointed this passage for i keep no bible but it contains two distinct questions that admit of distinct answers first canst thou by searching find out god yes because in the first place i know i did not make myself and yet i have existence and by searching into the nature of other things i find that no other thing could make itself and yet millions of other things exist therefore it is that i know by positive conclusion resulting from this search that there is a power superior to all those things and that power is god secondly canst thou find out the almighty to perfection no not only because the power and wisdom he has manifested in the structure of the creation that i behold is to me incomprehensible but because even this manifestation great as it is is probably but a small display of that immensity of power and wisdom by which millions of other worlds to me invisible by their distance were created and continue to exist it is evident that both of these questions were put to the reason of the person to whom they are supposed to have been addressed and it is only by admitting the first question to be answered affirmatively that the second could follow it would have been unnecessary and even absurd to have put a second question more difficult than the first if the first question had been answered negatively the two questions have different objects the first refers to the existence of god the second to his attributes reason can discover the one but it falls infinitely short in discovering the whole of the other i recollect not a single passage in all the writings ascribed to the men called apostles that conveys any idea of what god is those writings are chiefly controversial and the gloominess of the subject they dwell upon that of a man dying in agony on a cross is better suited to the gloomy genius of a monk in a cell by whom it is not impossible they were written than to any man breathing the open air of the creation the only passage that occurs to me that has any reference to the works of god by which only his power and wisdom can be known is related to have been spoken by jesus christ as a remedy against distrustful care behold the lilies of the field they toil not neither do they spin this however is far inferior to the allusions in job and in the th psalm but it is similar in idea and the modesty of the imagery is correspondent to the modesty of the man chapter xi of the theology of the christians and the true theology as to the christian system of faith it appears to me as a species of atheism a sort of religious denial of god it professes to believe in a man rather than in god it is a compound made up chiefly of manism with but little deism and is as near to atheism as twilight is to darkness it introduces between man and his maker an opaque body which it calls a redeemer as the moon introduces her opaque self between the earth and the sun and it produces by this means a religious or an irreligious eclipse of light it has put the whole orbit of reason into shade the effect of this obscurity has been that of turning everything upside down and representing it in reverse and among the revolutions it has thus magically produced it has made a revolution in theology that which is now called natural philosophy embracing the whole circle of science of which astronomy occupies the chief place is the study of the works of god and of the power and wisdom of god in his works and is the true theology as to the theology that is now studied in its place it is the study of human opinions and of human fancies concerning god it is not the study of god himself in the works that he has made but in the works or writings that man has made and it is not among the least of the mischiefs that the christian system has done to the world that it has abandoned the original and beautiful system of theology like a beautiful innocent to distress and reproach to make room for the hag of superstition the book of job and the th psalm which even the church admits to be more ancient than the chronological order in which they stand in the book called the bible are theological orations conformable to the original system of theology the internal evidence of those orations proves to a demonstration that the study and contemplation of the works of creation and of the power and wisdom of god revealed and manifested in those works made a great part of the religious devotion of the times in which they were written and it was this devotional study and contemplation that led to the discovery of the principles upon which what are now called sciences are established and it is to the discovery of these principles that almost all the arts that contribute to the convenience of human life owe their existence every principal art has some science for its parent though the person who mechanically performs the work does not always and but very seldom perceive the connection it is a fraud of the christian system to call the sciences human inventions it is only the application of them that is human every science has for its basis a system of principles as fixed and unalterable as those by which the unierse is regulated and governed man cannot make principles he can only discover them for example every person who looks at an almanack sees an account when an eclipse will take place and he sees also that it never fails to take place according to the account there given this shows that man is acquainted with the laws by which the heavenly bodies move but it would be something worse than ignorance were any church on earth to say that those laws are an human invention it would also be ignorance or something worse to say that the scientific principles by the aid of which man is enabled to calculate and foreknow when an eclipse will take place are an human invention man cannot invent any thing that is eternal and immutable and the scientific principles he employs for this purpose must and are of necessity as eternal and immutable as the laws by which the heavenly bodies move or they could not be used as they are to ascertain the time when and the manner how an eclipse will take place the scientific principles that man employs to obtain the foreknowledge of an eclipse or of any thing else relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies are contained chiefly in that part of science that is called trigonometry or the properties of a triangle which when applied to the study of the heavenly bodies is called astronomy when applied to direct the course of a ship on the ocean it is called navigation when applied to the construction of figures drawn by a rule and compass it is called geometry when applied to the construction of plans of edifices it is called architecture when applied to the measurement of any portion of the surface of the earth it is called landsurveying in fine it is the soul of science it is an eternal truth it contains the mathematical demonstration of which man speaks and the extent of its uses are unknown it may be said that man can make or draw a triangle and therefore a triangle is an human invention but the triangle when drawn is no other than the image of the principle it is a delineation to the eye and from thence to the mind of a principle that would otherwise be imperceptible the triangle does not make the principle any more than a candle taken into a room that was dark makes the chairs and tables that before were invisible all the properties of a triangle exist independently of the figure and existed before any triangle was drawn or thought of by man man had no more to do in the formation of those properties or principles than he had to do in making the laws by which the heavenly bodies move and therefore the one must have the same divine origin as the other in the same manner as it may be said that man can make a triangle so also may it be said he can make the mechanical instrument called a lever but the principle by which the lever acts is a thing distinct from the instrument and would exist if the instrument did not it attaches itself to the instrument after it is made the instrument therefore can act no otherwise than it does act neither can all the efforts of human invention make it act otherwise that which in all such cases man calls the effect is no other than the principle itself rendered perceptible to the senses since then man cannot make principles from whence did he gain a knowledge of them so as to be able to apply them not only to things on earth but to ascertain the motion of bodies so immensely distant from him as all the heavenly bodies are from whence i ask could he gain that knowledge but from the study of the true theology it is the structure of the universe that has taught this knowledge to man that structure is an everexisting exhibition of every principle upon which every part of mathematical science is founded the offspring of this science is mechanics for mechanics is no other than the principles of science applied practically the man who proportions the several parts of a mill uses the same scientific principles as if he had the power of constructing an universe but as he cannot give to matter that invisible agency by which all the component parts of the immense machine of the universe have influence upon each other and act in motional unison together without any apparent contact and to which man has given the name of attraction gravitation and repulsion he supplies the place of that agency by the humble imitation of teeth and cogs all the parts of mans microcosm must visibly touch but could he gain a knowledge of that agency so as to be able to apply it in practice we might then say that another canonical book of the word of god had been discovered if man could alter the properties of the lever so also could he alter the properties of the triangle for a lever taking that sort of lever which is called a steelyard for the sake of explanation forms when in motion a triangle the line it descends from one point of that line being in the fulcrum the line it descends to and the chord of the arc which the end of the lever describes in the air are the three sides of a triangle the other arm of the lever describes also a triangle and the corresponding sides of those two triangles calculated scientifically or measured geometrically and also the sines tangents and secants generated from the angles and geometrically measured have the same proportions to each other as the different weights have that will balance each other on the lever leaving the weight of the lever out of the case it may also be said that man can make a wheel and axis that he can put wheels of different magnitudes together and produce a mill still the case comes back to the same point which is that he did not make the principle that gives the wheels those powers this principle is as unalterable as in the former cases or rather it is the same principle under a different appearance to the eye the power that two wheels of different magnitudes have upon each other is in the same proportion as if the semidiameter of the two wheels were joined together and made into that kind of lever i have described suspended at the part where the semidiameters join for the two wheels scientifically considered are no other than the two circles generated by the motion of the compound lever it is from the study of the true theology that all our knowledge of science is derived and it is from that knowledge that all the arts have originated the almighty lecturer by displaying the principles of science in the structure of the universe has invited man to study and to imitation it is as if he had said to the inhabitants of this globe that we call ours i have made an earth for man to dwell upon and i have rendered the starry heavens visible to teach him science and the arts he can now provide for his own comfort and learn from my munificence to all to be kind to each other of what use is it unless it be to teach man something that his eye is endowed with the power of beholding to an incomprehensible distance an immensity of worlds revolving in the ocean of space or of what use is it that this immensity of worlds is visible to man what has man to do with the pleiades with orion with sirius with the star he calls the north star with the moving orbs he has named saturn jupiter mars venus and mercury if no uses are to follow from their being visible a less power of vision would have been sufficient for man if the immensity he now possesses were given only to waste itself as it were on an immense desert of space glittering with shows it is only by contemplating what he calls the starry heavens as the book and school of science that he discovers any use in their being visible to him or any advantage resulting from his immensity of vision but when be contemplates the subject in this light he sees an additional motive for saying that nothing was made in vain for in vain would be this power of vision if it taught man nothing chapter xii the effects of christianism on education proposed reforms as the christian system of faith has made a revolution in theology so also bas it made a revolution in the state of learning that which is now called learning was not learning originally learning does not consist as the schools now make it consist in the knowledge of languages but in the knowledge of things to which language gives names the greeks were a learned people but learning with them did not consist in speaking greek any more than in a romans speaking latin or a frenchmans speaking french or an englishmans speaking english from what we know of the greeks it does not appear that they knew or studied any language but their own and this was one cause of their becoming so learned it afforded them more time to apply themselves to better studies the schools of the greeks were schools of science and philosophy and not of languages and it is in the knowledge of the things that science and philosophy teach that learning consists almost all the scientific learning that now exists came to us from the greeks or the people who spoke the greek language it therefore became necessary to the people of other nations who spoke a different language that some among them should learn the greek language in order that the learning the greeks had might be made known in those nations by translating the greek books of science and philosophy into the mother tongue of each nation the study therefore of the greek language and in the same manner for the latin was no other than the drudgery business of a linguist and the language thus obtained was no other than the means or as it were the tools employed to obtain the learning the greeks had it made no part of the learning itself and was so distinct from it as to make it exceedingly probable that the persons who had studied greek sufficiently to translate those works such for instance as euclids elements did not understand any of the learning the works contained as there is now nothing new to be learned from the dead languages all the useful books being already translated the languages are become useless and the time expended in teaching and in learning them is wasted so far as the study of languages may contribute to the progress and communication of knowledge for it has nothing to do with the creation of knowledge it is only in the living languages that new knowledge is to be found and certain it is that in general a youth will learn more of a living language in one year than of a dead language in seven and it is but seldom that the teacher knows much of it himself the difficulty of learning the dead languages does not arise from any superior abstruseness in the languages themselves but in their being dead and the pronunciation entirely lost it would be the same thing with any other language when it becomes dead the best greek linguist that now exists does not understand greek so well as a grecian plowman did or a grecian milkmaid and the same for the latin compared with a plowman or a milkmaid of the romans and with respect to pronunciation and idiom not so well as the cows that she milked it would therefore be advantageous to the state of learning to abolish the study of the dead languages and to make learning consist as it originally did in scientific knowledge the apology that is sometimes made for continuing to teach the dead languages is that they are taught at a time when a child is not capable of exerting any other mental faculty than that of memory but this is altogether erroneous the human mind has a natural disposition to scientific knowledge and to the things connected with it the first and favourite amusement of a child even before it begins to play is that of imitating the works of man it builds bouses with cards or sticks it navigates the little ocean of a bowl of water with a paper boat or dams the stream of a gutter and contrives something which it calls a mill and it interests itself in the fate of its works with a care that resembles affection it afterwards goes to school where its genius is killed by the barren study of a dead language and the philosopher is lost in the linguist but the apology that is now made for continuing to teach the dead languages could not be the cause at first of cutting down learning to the narrow and humble sphere of linguistry the cause therefore must be sought for elsewhere in all researches of this kind the best evidence that can be produced is the internal evidence the thing carries with itself and the evidence of circumstances that unites with it both of which in this case are not difficult to be discovered putting then aside as matter of distinct consideration the outrage offered to the moral justice of god by supposing him to make the innocent suffer for the guilty and also the loose morality and low contrivance of supposing him to change himself into the shape of a man in order to make an excuse to himself for not executing his supposed sentence upon adam putting i say those things aside as matter of distinct consideration it is certain that what is called the christian system of faith including in it the whimsical account of the creation the strange story of eve the snake and the apple the amphibious idea of a mangod the corporeal idea of the death of a god the mythological idea of a family of gods and the christian system of arithmetic that three are one and one is three are all irreconcilable not only to the divine gift of reason that god has given to man but to the knowledge that man gains of the power and wisdom of god by the aid of the sciences and by studying the structure of the universe that god has made the setters up therefore and the advocates of the christian system of faith could not but foresee that the continually progressive knowledge that man would gain by the aid of science of the power and wisdom of god manifested in the structure of the universe and in all the works of creation would militate against and call into question the truth of their system of faith and therefore it became necessary to their purpose to cut learning down to a size less dangerous to their project and this they effected by restricting the idea of learning to the dead study of dead languages they not only rejected the study of science out of the christian schools but they persecuted it and it is only within about the last two centuries that the study has been revived so late as galileo a florentine discovered and introduced the use of telescopes and by applying them to observe the motions and appearances of the heavenly bodies afforded additional means for ascertaining the true structure of the universe instead of being esteemed for these discoveries he was sentenced to renounce them or the opinions resulting from them as a damnable heresy and prior to that time virgilius was condemned to be burned for asserting the antipodes or in other words that the earth was a globe and habitable in every part where there was land yet the truth of this is now too well known even to be told note i cannot discover the source of this statement concerning the ancient author whose irish name feirghill was latinized into virgilius the british museum possesses a copy of the work decalogiunt which was the pretext of the charge of heresy made by boniface archbishop of mayence against virgilius abbot bishop of salzburg these were leaders of the rival british and roman parties and the british champion made a countercharge against boniface of irreligious practices boniface had to express a regret but none the less pursued his rival the pope zachary ii decided that if his alleged doctrine against god and his soul that beneath the earth there is another world other men or sun and moon should be acknowledged by virgilius he should be excommunicated by a council and condemned with canonical sanctions whatever may have been the fate involved by condemnation with canonicis sanctionibus in the middle of the eighth century it did not fall on virgilius his accuser boniface was martyred and it is probable that virgilius harmonied his antipodes with orthodoxy the gravamen of the heresy seems to have been the suggestion that there were men not of the progeny of adam virgilius was made bishop of salzburg in he bore until his death the curious title geometer and solitary or lone wayfarer solivagus a suspicion of heresy clung to his memory until when he was raised by gregory ix to sainthood beside his accuser st boniface editor conway if the belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief it would make no part of the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them there was no moral ill in believing the earth was flat like a trencher any more than there was moral virtue in believing it was round like a globe neither was there any moral ill in believing that the creator made no other world than this any more than there was moral virtue in believing that he made millions and that the infinity of space is filled with worlds but when a system of religion is made to grow out of a supposed system of creation that is not true and to unite itself therewith in a manner almost inseparable therefrom the case assumes an entirely different ground it is then that errors not morally bad become fraught with the same mischiefs as if they were it is then that the truth though otherwise indifferent itself becomes an essential by becoming the criterion that either confirms by corresponding evidence or denies by contradictory evidence the reality of the religion itself in this view of the case it is the moral duty of man to obtain every possible evidence that the structure of the heavens or any other part of creation affords with respect to systems of religion but this the supporters or partizans of the christian system as if dreading the result incessantly opposed and not only rejected the sciences but persecuted the profersors had newton or descartes lived three or four hundred years ago and pursued their studies as they did it is most probable they would not have lived to finish them and had franklin drawn lightning from the clouds at the same time it would have been at the hazard of expiring for it in flames later times have laid all the blame upon the goths and vandals but however unwilling the partizans of the christian system may be to believe or to acknowledge it it is nevertheless true that the age of ignorance commenced with the christian system there was more knowledge in the world before that period than for many centuries afterwards and as to religious knowledge the christian system as already said was only another species of mythology and the mythology to which it succeeded was a corruption of an ancient system of theism note by paine it is impossible for us now to know at what time the heathen mythology began but it is certain from the internal evidence that it carries that it did not begin in the same state or condition in which it ended all the gods of that mythology except saturn were of modern invention the supposed reign of saturn was prior to that which is called the heathen mythology and was so far a species of theism that it admitted the belief of only one god saturn is supposed to have abdicated the govemment in favour of his three sons and one daughter jupiter pluto neptune and juno after this thousands of other gods and demigods were imaginarily created and the calendar of gods increased as fast as the calendar of saints and the calendar of courts have increased since all the corruptions that have taken place in theology and in religion have been produced by admitting of what man calls revealed religion the mythologists pretended to more revealed religion than the christians do they had their oracles and their priests who were supposed to receive and deliver the word of god verbally on almost all occasions since then all corruptions down from moloch to modem predestinarianism and the human sacrifices of the heathens to the christian sacrifice of the creator have been produced by admitting of what is called revealed religion the most effectual means to prevent all such evils and impositions is not to admit of any other revelation than that which is manifested in the book of creation and to contemplate the creation as the only true and real word of god that ever did or ever will exist and every thing else called the word of god is fable and imposition author it is owing to this long interregnum of science and to no other cause that we have now to look back through a vast chasm of many hundred years to the respectable characters we call the ancients had the progression of knowledge gone on proportionably with the stock that before existed that chasm would have been filled up with characters rising superior in knowledge to each other and those ancients we now so much admire would have appeared respectably in the background of the scene but the christian system laid all waste and if we take our stand about the beginning of the sixteenth century we look back through that long chasm to the times of the ancients as over a vast sandy desert in which not a shrub appears to intercept the vision to the fertile hills beyond it is an inconsistency scarcely possible to be credited that any thing should exist under the name of a religion that held it to be irreligious to study and contemplate the structure of the universe that god had made but the fact is too well established to be denied the event that served more than any other to break the first link in this long chain of despotic ignorance is that known by the name of the reformation by luther from that time though it does not appear to have made any part of the intention of luther or of those who are called reformers the sciences began to revive and liberality their natural associate began to appear this was the only public good the reformation did for with respect to religious good it might as well not have taken place the mythology still continued the same and a multiplicity of national popes grew out of the downfal of the pope of christendom chapter xiii comparison of christianism with the religious ideas inspired by nature having thus shewn from the internal evidence of things the cause that produced a change in the state of learning and the motive for substituting the study of the dead languages in the place of the sciences i proceed in addition to the several observations already made in the former part of this work to compare or rather to confront the evidence that the structure of the universe affords with the christian system of religion but as i cannot begin this part better than by referring to the ideas that occurred to me at an early part of life and which i doubt not have occurred in some degree to almost every other person at one time or other i shall state what those ideas were and add thereto such other matter as shall arise out of the subject giving to the whole by way of preface a short introduction my father being of the quaker profession it was my good fortune to have an exceedingly good moral education and a tolerable stock of useful learning though i went to the grammar school i did not learn latin not only because i had no inclination to learn languages but because of the objection the quakers have against the books in which the language is taught but this did not prevent me from being acquainted with the subjects of all the latin books used in the school the natural bent of my mind was to science i had some turn and i believe some talent for poetry but this i rather repressed than encouraged as leading too much into the field of imagination as soon as i was able i purchased a pair of globes and attended the philosophical lectures of martin and ferguson and became afterwards acquainted with dr bevis of the society called the royal society then living in the temple and an excellent astronomer i had no disposition for what was called politics it presented to my mind no other idea than is contained in the word jockeyship when therefore i turned my thoughts towards matters of government i had to form a system for myself that accorded with the moral and philosophic principles in which i had been educated i saw or at least i thought i saw a vast scene opening itself to the world in the affairs of america and it appeared to me that unless the americans changed the plan they were then pursuing with respect to the government of england and declared themselves independent they would not only involve themselves in a multiplicity of new difficulties but shut out the prospect that was then offering itself to mankind through their means it was from these motives that i published the work known by the name of common sense which is the first work i ever did publish and so far as i can judge of myself i believe i should never have been known in the world as an author on any subject whatever had it not been for the affairs of america i wrote common sense the latter end of the year and published it the first of january independence was declared the fourth of july following note the pamphlet common sense was first advertised as just published on january his plea for the officers of excise written before leaving england was printed but not published until despite his reiterated assertion that common sense was the first work he ever published the notion that he was junius still finds somr believers an indirect comment on our painejunians may be found in part of this work where paine says a man capable of writing homer would not have thrown away his own fame by giving it to another it is probable that paine ascribed the letters of junius to thomas hollis his friend f lanthenas in his translation of the age of reason advertises his translation of the letters of junius from the english thomas hollis this he could hardly have done without consultation with paine unfortunately this translation of junius cannot be found either in the bibliotheque nationale or the british museum and it cannot be said whether it contains any attempt at an identification of junius editor any person who has made observations on the state and progress of the human mind by observing his own can not but have observed that there are two distinct classes of what are called thoughts those that we produce in ourselves by reflection and the act of thinking and those that bolt into the mind of their own accord i have always made it a rule to treat those voluntary visitors with civility taking care to examine as well as i was able if they were worth entertaining and it is from them i have acquired almost all the knowledge that i have as to the learning that any person gains from school education it serves only like a small capital to put him in the way of beginning learning for himself afterwards every person of learning is finally his own teacher the reason of which is that principles being of a distinct quality to circumstances cannot be impressed upon the memory their place of mental residence is the understanding and they are never so lasting as when they begin by conception thus much for the introductory part from the time i was capable of conceiving an idea and acting upon it by reflection i either doubted the truth of the christian system or thought it to be a strange affair i scarcely knew which it was but i well remember when about seven or eight years of age hearing a sermon read by a relation of mine who was a great devotee of the church upon the subject of what is called redemption by the death of the son of god after the sermon was ended i went into the garden and as i was going down the garden steps for i perfectly recollect the spot i revolted at the recollection of what i had heard and thought to myself that it was making god almighty act like a passionate man that killed his son when he could not revenge himself any other way and as i was sure a man would be hanged that did such a thing i could not see for what purpose they preached such sermons this was not one of those kind of thoughts that had any thing in it of childish levity it was to me a serious reflection arising from the idea i had that god was too good to do such an action and also too almighty to be under any necessity of doing it i believe in the same manner to this moment and i moreover believe that any system of religion that has anything in it that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true system it seems as if parents of the christian profession were ashamed to tell their children any thing about the principles of their religion they sometimes instruct them in morals and talk to them of the goodness of what they call providence for the christian mythology has five deities there is god the father god the son god the holy ghost the god providence and the goddess nature but the christian story of god the father putting his son to death or employing people to do it for that is the plain language of the story cannot be told by a parent to a child and to tell him that it was done to make mankind happier and better is making the story still worse as if mankind could be improved by the example of murder and to tell him that all this is a mystery is only making an excuse for the incredibility of it how different is this to the pure and simple profession of deism the true deist has but one deity and his religion consists in contemplating the power wisdom and benignity of the deity in his works and in endeavouring to imitate him in every thing moral scientifical and mechanical the religion that approaches the nearest of all others to true deism in the moral and benign part thereof is that professed by the quakers but they have contracted themselves too much by leaving the works of god out of their system though i reverence their philanthropy i can not help smiling at the conceit that if the taste of a quaker could have been consulted at the creation what a silent and drabcolored creation it would have been not a flower would have blossomed its gaieties nor a bird been permitted to sing quitting these reflections i proceed to other matters after i had made myself master of the use of the globes and of the orrery note by paine as this book may fall into the bands of persons who do not know what an orrery is it is for their information i add this note as the name gives no idea of the uses of the thing the orrery has its name from the person who invented it it is a machinery of clockwork representing the universe in miniature and in which the revolution of the earth round itself and round the sun the revolution of the moon round the earth the revolution of the planets round the sun their relative distances from the sun as the center of the whole system their relative distances from each other and their different magnitudes are represented as they really exist in what we call the heavens author and conceived an idea of the infinity of space and of the eternal divisibility of matter and obtained at least a general knowledge of what was called natural philosophy i began to compare or as i have before said to confront the internal evidence those things afford with the christian system of faith though it is not a direct article of the christian system that this world that we inhabit is the whole of the habitable creation yet it is so worked up therewith from what is called the mosaic account of the creation the story of eve and the apple and the counterpart of that story the death of the son of god that to believe otherwise that is to believe that god created a plurality of worlds at least as numerous as what we call stars renders the christian system of faith at once little and ridiculous and scatters it in the mind like feathers in the air the two beliefs can not be held together in the same mind and he who thinks that be believes both has thought but little of either though the belief of a plurality of worlds was familiar to the ancients it is only within the last three centuries that the extent and dimensions of this globe that we inhabit have been ascertained several vessels following the tract of the ocean have sailed entirely round the world as a man may march in a circle and come round by the contrary side of the circle to the spot he set out from the circular dimensions of our world in the widest part as a man would measure the widest round of an apple or a ball is only twentyfive thousand and twenty english miles reckoning sixtynine miles and an half to an equatorial degree and may be sailed round in the space of about three years note by paine allowing a ship to sail on an average three miles in an hour she would sail entirely round the world in less than one year if she could sail in a direct circle but she is obliged to follow the course of the ocean author a world of this extent may at first thought appear to us to be great but if we compare it with the immensity of space in which it is suspended like a bubble or a balloon in the air it is infinitely less in proportion than the smallest grain of sand is to the size of the world or the finest particle of dew to the whole ocean and is therefore but small and as will be hereafter shown is only one of a system of worlds of which the universal creation is composed it is not difficult to gain some faint idea of the immensity of space in which this and all the other worlds are suspended if we follow a progression of ideas when we think of the size or dimensions of a room our ideas limit themselves to the walls and there they stop but when our eye or our imagination darts into space that is when it looks upward into what we call the open air we cannot conceive any walls or boundaries it can have and if for the sake of resting our ideas we suppose a boundary the question immediately renews itself and asks what is beyond that boundary and in the same manner what beyond the next boundary and so on till the fatigued imagination returns and says there is no end certainly then the creator was not pent for room when he made this world no larger than it is and we have to seek the reason in something else if we take a survey of our own world or rather of this of which the creator has given us the use as our portion in the immense system of creation we find every part of it the earth the waters and the air that surround it filled and as it were crouded with life down from the largest animals that we know of to the smallest insects the naked eye can behold and from thence to others still smaller and totally invisible without the assistance of the microscope every tree every plant every leaf serves not only as an habitation but as a world to some numerous race till animal existence becomes so exceedingly refined that the effluvia of a blade of grass would be food for thousands since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied why is it to be supposed that the immensity of space is a naked void lying in eternal waste there is room for millions of worlds as large or larger than ours and each of them millions of miles apart from each other having now arrived at this point if we carry our ideas only one thought further we shall see perhaps the true reason at least a very good reason for our happiness why the creator instead of making one immense world extending over an immense quantity of space has preferred dividing that quantity of matter into several distinct and separate worlds which we call planets of which our earth is one but before i explain my ideas upon this subject it is necessary not for the sake of those that already know but for those who do not to show what the system of the universe is chapter xiv system of the universe that part of the universe that is called the solar system meaning the system of worlds to which our earth belongs and of which sol or in english language the sun is the center consists besides the sun of six distinct orbs or planets or worlds besides the secondary bodies called the satellites or moons of which our earth has one that attends her in her annual revolution round the sun in like manner as the other satellites or moons attend the planets or worlds to which they severally belong as may be seen by the assistance of the telescope the sun is the center round which those six worlds or planets revolve at different distances therefrom and in circles concentric to each other each world keeps constantly in nearly the same tract round the sun and continues at the same time turning round itself in nearly an upright position as a top turns round itself when it is spinning on the ground and leans a little sideways it is this leaning of the earth degrees that occasions summer and winter and the different length of days and nights if the earth turned round itself in a position perpendicular to the plane or level of the circle it moves in round the sun as a top turns round when it stands erect on the ground the days and nights would be always of the same length twelve hours day and twelve hours night and the season would be uniformly the same throughout the year every time that a planet our earth for example turns round itself it makes what we call day and night and every time it goes entirely round the sun it makes what we call a year consequently our world turns three hundred and sixtyfive times round itself in going once round the sun the names that the ancients gave to those six worlds and which are still called by the same names are mercury venus this world that we call ours mars jupitcr and saturn they appear larger to the eye than the stars being many million miles nearer to our earth than any of the stars are the planet venus is that which is called the evening star and sometimes the morning star as she happens to set after or rise before the sun which in either case is never more than three hours the sun as before said being the center the planet or world nearest the sun is mercury his distance from the sun is thirtyfour million miles and he moves round in a circle always at that distance from the sun as a top may be supposed to spin round in the tract in wliich a horse goes in a mill the second world is venus she is fiftyseven million miles distant from the sun and consequently moves round in a circle much greater than that of mercury the third world is this that we inhabit and which is eightyeight million miles distant from the sun and consequently moves round in a circle greater than that of venus the fourth world is mars he is distant from the sun one hundred and thirtyfour million miles and consequently moves round in a circle greater than that of our earth the fifth is jupiter he is distant from the sun five hundred and fiftyseven million miles and consequently moves round in a circle greater than that of mars the sixth world is saturn he is distant from the sun seven hundred and sixtythree million miles and consequently moves round in a circle that surrounds the circles or orbits of all the other worlds or planets the space therefore in the air or in the immensity of space that our solar system takes up for the several worlds to perform their revolutions in round the sun is of the extent in a strait lirie of the whole diameter of the orbit or circle in which saturn moves round the sun which being double his distance from the sun is fifteen hundred and twentysix million miles and its circular extent is nearly five thousand million and its globical content is almost three thousand five hundred million times three thousand five hundred million square miles note by paine if it should be asked how can man know these things i have one plain answer to give which is that man knows how to calculate an eclipse and also how to calculate to a minute of time when the planet venus in making her revolutions round the sun will come in a strait line between our earth and the sun and will appear to us about the size of a large pea passing across the face of the sun this happens but twice in about a hundred years at the distance of about eight years from each other and has happened twice in our time both of which were foreknown by calculation it can also be known when they will happen again for a thousand years to come or to any other portion of time as therefore man could not be able to do these things if he did not understand the solar system and the manner in which the revolutions of the several planets or worlds are performed the fact of calculating an eclipse or a transit of venus is a proof in point that the knowledge exists and as to a few thousand or even a few million miles more or less it makes scarcely any sensible difference in such immense distances author but this immense as it is is only one system of worlds beyond this at a vast distance into space far beyond all power of calculation are the stars called the fixed stars they are called fixed because they have no revolutionary motion as the six worlds or planets have that i have been describing those fixed stars continue always at the same distance from each other and always in the same place as the sun does in the center of our system the probability therefore is that each of those fixed stars is also a sun round which another system of worlds or planets though too remote for us to discover performs its revolutions as our system of worlds does round our central sun by this easy progression of ideas the immensity of space will appear to us to be filled with systems of worlds and that no part of space lies at waste any more than any part of our globe of earth and water is left unoccupied having thus endeavoured to convey in a familiar and easy manner some idea of the structure of the universe i return to explain what i before alluded to namely the great benefits arising to man in consequence of the creator having made a plurality of worlds such as our system is consisting of a central sun and six worlds besides satellites in preference to that of creating one world only of a vast extent chapter xv advantages of the existence of many worlds in each solar system it is an idea i have never lost sight of that all our knowledge of science is derived from the revolutions exhibited to our eye and from thence to our understanding which those several planets or worlds of which our system is composed make in their circuit round the sun had then the quantity of matter which these six worlds contain been blended into one solitary globe the consequence to us would have been that either no revolutionary motion would have existed or not a sufficiency of it to give us the ideas and the knowledge of science we now have and it is from the sciences that all the mechanical arts that contribute so much to our earthly felicity and comfort are derived as therefore the creator made nothing in vain so also must it be believed that be organized the structure of the universe in the most advantageous manner for the benefit of man and as we see and from experience feel the benefits we derive from the structure of the universe formed as it is which benefits we should not have had the opportunity of enjoying if the structure so far as relates to our system had been a solitary globe we can discover at least one reason why a plurality of worlds has been made and that reason calls forth the devotional gratitude of man as well as his admiration but it is not to us the inhabitants of this globe only that the benefits arising from a plurality of worlds are limited the inhabitants of each of the worlds of which our system is composed enjoy the same opportunities of knowledge as we do they behold the revolutionary motions of our earth as we behold theirs all the planets revolve in sight of each other and therefore the same universal school of science presents itself to all neither does the knowledge stop here the system of worlds next to us exhibits in its revolutions the same principles and school of science to the inhabitants of their system as our system does to us and in like manner throughout the immensity of space our ideas not only of the almightiness of the creator but of his wisdom and his beneficence become enlarged in proportion as we contemplate the extent and the structure of the universe the solitary idea of a solitary world rolling or at rest in the immense ocean of space gives place to the cheerful idea of a society of worlds so happily contrived as to administer even by their motion instruction to man we see our own earth filled with abundance but we forget to consider how much of that abundance is owing to the scientific knowledge the vast machinery of the universe has unfolded chapter xvi application of the preceding to the system of the christians but in the midst of those reflections what are we to think of the christian system of faith that forms itself upon the idea of only one world and that of no greater extent as is before shown than twentyfive thousand miles an extent which a man walking at the rate of three miles an hour for twelve hours in the day could he keep on in a circular direction would walk entirely round in less than two years alas what is this to the mighty ocean of space and the almighty power of the creator from whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceit that the almighty who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protection should quit the care of all the rest and come to die in our world because they say one man and one woman had eaten an apple and on the other hand are we to suppose that every world in the boundless creation had an eve an apple a serpent and a redeemer in this case the person who is irreverently called the son of god and sometimes god himself would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world in an endless succession of death with scarcely a momentary interval of life it has been by rejecting the evidence that the word or works of god in the creation affords to our senses and the action of our reason upon that evidence that so many wild and whimsical systems of faith and of religion have been fabricated and set up there may be many systems of religion that so far from being morally bad are in many respects morally good but there can be but one that is true and that one ncccssarily must as it ever will be in all things consistent with the ever existing word of god that we behold in his works but such is the strange construction of the christian system of faith that every evidence the heavens affords to man either directly contradicts it or renders it absurd it is possible to believe and i always feel pleasure in encouraging myself to believe it that there have been men in the world who persuaded themselves that what is called a pious fraud might at least under particular circumstances be productive of some good but the fraud being once established could not afterwards be explained for it is with a pious fraud as with a bad action it begets a calamitous necessity of going on the persons who first preached the christian system of faith and in some measure combined with it the morality preached by jesus christ might persuade themselves that it was better than the heathen mythology that then prevailed from the first preachers the fraud went on to the second and to the third till the idea of its being a pious fraud became lost in the belief of its being true and that belief became again encouraged by the interest of those who made a livelihood by preaching it but though such a belief might by such means be rendered almost general among the laity it is next to impossible to account for the continual persecution carried on by the church for several hundred years against the sciences and against the professors of science if the church had not some record or tradition that it was originally no other than a pious fraud or did not foresee that it could not be maintained against the evidence that the structure of the universe afforded chapter xvii of the means employed in all time and almost universally to deceive the peoples having thus shown the irreconcileable inconsistencies between the real word of god existing in the universe and that which is called the word of god as shown to us in a printed book that any man might make i proceed to speak of the three principal means that have been employed in all ages and perhaps in all countries to impose upon mankind those three means are mystery miracle and prophecy the first two are incompatible with true religion and the third ought always to be suspected with respect to mystery everything we behold is in one sense a mystery to us our own existence is a mystery the whole vegetable world is a mystery we cannot account how it is that an acorn when put into the ground is made to develop itself and become an oak we know not how it is that the seed we sow unfolds and multiplies itself and returns to us such an abundant interest for so small a capital the fact however as distinct from the operating cause is not a mystery because we see it and we know also the means we are to use which is no other than putting the seed in the ground we know therefore as much as is necessary for us to know and that part of the operation that we do not know and which if we did we could not perform the creator takes upon himself and performs it for us we are therefore better off than if we had been let into the secret and left to do it for ourselves but though every created thing is in this sense a mystery the word mystery cannot be applied to moral truth any more than obscurity can be applied to light the god in whom we believe is a god of moral truth and not a god of mystery or obscurity mystery is the antagonist of truth it is a fog of human invention that obscures truth and represents it in distortion truth never invelops itself in mystery and the mystery in which it is at any time enveloped is the work of its antagonist and never of itself religion therefore being the belief of a god and the practice of moral truth cannot have connection with mystery the belief of a god so far from having any thing of mystery in it is of all beliefs the most easy because it arises to us as is before observed out of necessity and the practice of moral truth or in other words a practical imitation of the moral goodness of god is no other than our acting towards each other as he acts benignly towards all we cannot serve god in the manner we serve those who cannot do without such service and therefore the only idea we can have of serving god is that of contributing to the happiness of the living creation that god has made this cannot be done by retiring ourselves from the society of the world and spending a recluse life in selfish devotion the very nature and design of religion if i may so express it prove even to demonstration that it must be free from every thing of mystery and unincumbered with every thing that is mysterious religion considered as a duty is incumbent upon every living soul alike and therefore must be on a level to the understanding and comprehension of all man does not learn religion as he learns the secrets and mysteries of a trade he learns the theory of religion by reflection it arises out of the action of his own mind upon the things which he sees or upon what he may happen to hear or to read and the practice joins itself thereto when men whether from policy or pious fraud set up systems of religion incompatible with the word or works of god in the creation and not only above but repugnant to human comprehension they were under the necessity of inventing or adopting a word that should serve as a bar to all questions inquiries and speculations the word mystery answered this purpose and thus it has happened that religion which is in itself without mystery has been corrupted into a fog of mysteries as mystery answered all general purposes miracle followed as an occasional auxiliary the former served to bewilder the mind the latter to puzzle the senses the one was the lingo the other the legerdemain but before going further into this subject it will be proper to inquire what is to be understood by a miracle in the same sense that every thing may be said to be a mystery so also may it be said that every thing is a miracle and that no one thing is a greater miracle than another the elephant though larger is not a greater miracle than a mite nor a mountain a greater miracle than an atom to an almighty power it is no more difficult to make the one than the other and no more difficult to make a million of worlds than to make one every thing therefore is a miracle in one sense whilst in the other sense there is no such thing as a miracle it is a miracle when compared to our power and to our comprehension it is not a miracle compared to the power that performs it but as nothing in this description conveys the idea that is affixed to the word miracle it is necessary to carry the inquiry further mankind have conceived to themselves certain laws by which what they call nature is supposed to act and that a miracle is something contrary to the operation and effect of those laws but unless we know the whole extent of those laws and of what are commonly called the powers of nature we are not able to judge whether any thing that may appear to us wonderful or miraculous be within or be beyond or be contrary to her natural power of acting the ascension of a man several miles high into the air would have everything in it that constitutes the idea of a miracle if it were not known that a species of air can be generated several times lighter than the common atmospheric air and yet possess elasticity enough to prevent the balloon in which that light air is inclosed from being compressed into as many times less bulk by the common air that surrounds it in like manner extracting flashes or sparks of fire from the human body as visibly as from a steel struck with a flint and causing iron or steel to move without any visible agent would also give the idea of a miracle if we were not acquainted with electricity and magnetism so also would many other experiments in natural philosophy to those who are not acquainted with the subject the restoring persons to life who are to appearance dead as is practised upon drowned persons would also be a miracle if it were not known that animation is capable of being suspended without being extinct besides these there are performances by slight of hand and by persons acting in concert that have a miraculous appearance which when known are thought nothing of and besides these there are mechanical and optical deceptions there is now an exhibition in paris of ghosts or spectres which though it is not imposed upon the spectators as a fact has an astonishing appearance as therefore we know not the extent to which either nature or art can go there is no criterion to determine what a miracle is and mankind in giving credit to appearances under the idea of their being miracles are subject to be continually imposed upon since then appearances are so capable of deceiving and things not real have a strong resemblance to things that are nothing can be more inconsistent than to suppose that the almighty would make use of means such as are called miracles that would subject the person who performed them to the suspicion of being an impostor and the person who related them to be suspected of lying and the doctrine intended to be supported thereby to be suspected as a fabulous invention of all the modes of evidence that ever were invented to obtain belief to any system or opinion to which the name of religion has been given that of miracle however successful the imposition may have been is the most inconsistent for in the first place whenever recourse is had to show for the purpose of procuring that belief for a miracle under any idea of the word is a show it implies a lameness or weakness in the doctrine that is preached and in the second place it is degrading the almighty into the character of a showman playing tricks to amuse and make the people stare and wonder it is also the most equivocal sort of evidence that can be set up for the belief is not to depend upon the thing called a miracle but upon the credit of the reporter who says that he saw it and therefore the thing were it true would have no better chance of being believed than if it were a lie suppose i were to say that when i sat down to write this book a hand presented itself in the air took up the pen and wrote every word that is herein written would any body believe me certainly they would not would they believe me a whit the more if the thing had been a fact certainly they would not since then a real miracle were it to happen would be subject to the same fate as the falsehood the inconsistency becomes the greater of supposing the almighty would make use of means that would not answer the purpose for which they were intended even if they were real if we are to suppose a miracle to be something so entirely out of the course of what is called nature that she must go out of that course to accomplish it and we see an account given of such a miracle by the person who said he saw it it raises a question in the mind very easily decided which is is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie we have never seen in our time nature go out of her course but we have good reason to believe that millions of lies have been told in the same time it is therefore at least millions to one that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie the story of the whale swallowing jonah though a whale is large enough to do it borders greatly on the marvellous but it would have approached nearer to the idea of a miracle if jonah had swallowed the whale in this which may serve for all cases of miracles the matter would decide itself as before stated namely is it more probable that a man should have swallowed a whale or told a lie but suppose that jonah had really swallowed the whale and gone with it in his belly to nineveh and to convince the people that it was true have cast it up in their sight of the full length and size of a whale would they not have believed him to have been the devil instead of a prophet or if the whale had carried jonah to nineveh and cast him up in the same public manner would they not have believed the whale to have been the devil and jonah one of his imps the most extraordinary of all the things called miracles related in the new testament is that of the devil flying away with jesus christ and carrying him to the top of a high mountain and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the world how happened it that he did not discover america or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest i have too much respect for the moral character of christ to believe that he told this whale of a miracle himself neither is it easy to account for what purpose it could have been fabricated unless it were to impose upon the connoisseurs of miracles as is sometimes practised upon the connoisseurs of queen annes farthings and collectors of relics and antiquities or to render the belief of miracles ridiculous by outdoing miracle as don quixote outdid chivalry or to embarrass the belief of miracles by making it doubtful by what power whether of god or of the devil any thing called a miracle was performed it requires however a great deal of faith in the devil to believe this miracle in every point of view in which those things called miracles can be placed and considered the reality of them is improbable and their existence unnecessary they would not as before observed answer any useful purpose even if they were true for it is more difficult to obtain belief to a miracle than to a principle evidently moral without any miracle moral principle speaks universally for itself miracle could be but a thing of the moment and seen but by a few after this it requires a transfer of faith from god to man to believe a miracle upon mans report instead therefore of admitting the recitals of miracles as evidence of any system of religion being true they ought to be considered as symptoms of its being fabulous it is necessary to the full and upright character of truth that it rejects the crutch and it is consistent with the character of fable to seek the aid that truth rejects thus much for mystery and miracle as mystery and miracle took charge of the past and the present prophecy took charge of the future and rounded the tenses of faith it was not sufficient to know what had been done but what would be done the supposed prophet was the supposed historian of times to come and if he happened in shooting with a long bow of a thousand years to strike within a thousand miles of a mark the ingenuity of posterity could make it pointblank and if he happened to be directly wrong it was only to suppose as in the case of jonah and nineveh that god had repented himself and changed his mind what a fool do fabulous systems make of man it has been shewn in a former part of this work that the original meaning of the words prophet and prohesying has been changed and that a prophet in the sense of the word as now used is a creature of modem invention and it is owing to this change in the meaning of the words that the flights and metaphors of the jewish poets and phrases and expressions now rendered obscure by our not being acquainted with the local circumstances to which they applied at the time they were used have been erected into prophecies and made to bend to explanations at the will and whimsical conceits of sectaries expounders and commentators every thing unintelligible was prophetical and every thing insignificant was typical a blunder would have served for a prophecy and a dishclout for a type if by a prophet we are to suppose a man to whom the almighty communicated some event that would take place in future either there were such men or there were not if there were it is consistent to believe that the event so communicated would be told in terms that could be understood and not related in such a loose and obscure manner as to be out of the comprehension of those that heard it and so equivocal as to fit almost any circumstance that might happen afterwards it is conceiving very irreverently of the almighty to suppose he would deal in this jesting manner with mankind yet all the things called prophecies in the book called the bible come under this description but it is with prophecy as it is with miracle it could not answer the purpose even if it were real those to whom a prophecy should be told could not tell whether the man prophesied or lied or whether it had been revealed to him or whether he conceited it and if the thing that he prophesied or pretended to prophesy should happen or some thing like it among the multitunic of things that are daily happening nobody could again know whether he foreknew it or guessed at it or whether it was accidental a prophet therefore is a character useless and unnecessary and the safe side of the case is to guard against being imposed upon by not giving credit to such relations upon the whole mystery miracle and prophecy are appendages that belong to fabulous and not to true religion they are the means by which so many lo heres and lo theres have been spread about the world and religion been made into a trade the success of one impostor gave encouragement to another and the quieting salvo of doing some good by keeping up a pious fraud protected them from remorse recapitulation having now extended the subject to a greater length than i first intended i shall bring it to a close by abstracting a summvy from the whole first that the idea or belief of a word of god existing in print or in writing or in speech is inconsistent in itself for the reasons already assigned these reasons among many others are the want of an universal language the mutability of language the errors to which translations are subject the possibility of totally suppressing such a word the probability of altering it or of fabricating the whole and imposing it upon the world secondly that the creation we behold is the real and ever existing word of god in which we cannot be deceived it proclaimeth his power it demonstrates his wisdom it manifests his goodness and beneficenec thirdly that the moral duty of man consists in imitating the moral goodness and beneficence of god manifested in the creation towards all his creatures that seeing as we daily do the goodness of god to all men it is an example calling upon all men to practise the same towards each other and consequently that every thing of persecution and revenge between man and man and every thing of cruelty to animals is a violation of moral duty i trouble not myself about the manner of future existence i content myself with believing even to positive conviction that the power that gave me existence is able to continue it in any form and manner he pleases either with or without this body and it appears more probable to me that i shall continue to exist hereafter than that i should have had existence as i now have before that existence began it is certain that in one point all nations of the earth and all religions agree all believe in a god the things in which they disagrce are the redundancies annexed to that belief and therefore if ever an universal religion should prevail it will not be believing any thing new but in getting rid of redundancies and believing as man believed at first in the childhood of the world according to the first french version and the strict translation of the final sentence is deism was the religion of adam supposing him not an imaginary being but none the less must it be left to all men to follow as is their right the religion and worship they prefer editor adam if ever there was such a man was created a deist but in the mean time let every man follow as he has a right to do the religion and worship he prefers end of part i the age of reasonpart ii contents preface chapter ithe old testament chapter iithe new testament chapter iiiconclusion preface i have mentioned in the former part of the age of reason that it had long been my intention to publish my thoughts upon religion but that i had originally reserved it to a later period in life intending it to be the last work i should undertake the circumstances however which existed in france in the latter end of the year determined me to delay it no longer the just and humane principles of the revolution which philosophy had first diffused had been departed from the idea always dangerous to society as it is derogatory to the almighty that priests could forgive sins though it seemed to exist no longer had blunted the feelings of humanity and callously prepared men for the commission of all crimes the intolerant spirit of church persecution had transferred itself into politics the tribunals stiled revolutionary supplied the place of an inquisition and the guillotine of the stake i saw many of my most intimate friends destroyed others daily carried to prison and i had reason to believe and had also intimations given me that the same danger was approaching myself under these disadvantages i began the former part of the age of reason i had besides neither bible nor testament it must be borne in mind that throughout this work paine generaly means by bible only the old testamut and speaks of the now as the testament editor to refer to though i was writing against both nor could i procure any notwithstanding which i have produced a work that no bible believer though writing at his ease and with a library of church books about him can refute towards the latter end of december of that year a motion was made and carried to exclude foreigners from the convention there were but two anacharsis cloots and myself and i saw i was particularly pointed at by bourdon de loise in his speech on that motion conceiving after this that i had but a few days of liberty i sat down and brought the work to a close as speedily as possible and i had not finished it more than six hours in the state it has since appeared this is an allusion to the essay which paine wrote at an earlier part of see introduction editor before a guard came there about three in the morning with an order signed by the two committees of public safety and surety general for putting me in arrestation as a foreigner and conveying me to the prison of the luxembourg i contrived in my way there to call on joel barlow and i put the manuscript of the work into his hands as more safe than in my possession in prison and not knowing what might be the fate in france either of the writer or the work i addressed it to the protection of the citizens of the united states it is justice that i say that the guard who executed this order and the interpreter to the committee of general surety who accompanied them to examine my papers treated me not only with civility but with respect the keeper of the luxembourg benoit a man of good heart shewed to me every friendship in his power as did also all his family while he continued in that station he was removed from it put into arrestation and carried before the tribunal upon a malignant accusation but acquitted after i had been in luxembourg about three weeks the americans then in paris went in a body to the convention to reclaim me as their countryman and friend but were answered by the president vadier who was also president of the committee of surety general and had signed the order for my arrcstation that i was born in england these excited americans do not seem to have understood or reported the most important item in vadeers reply namely that their application was unofficial ie not made through or sanctioned by gouverneur morris american minister for the detailed history of all this see vol iii editor i heard no more after this from any person out of the walls of the prison till the fall of robespierre on the th of thermidor july about two months before this event i was seized with a fever that in its progress had every symptom of becoming mortal and from the effects of which i am not recovered it was then that i remembered with renewed satisfaction and congratulated myself most sincerely on having written the former part of the age of reason i had then but little expectation of surviving and those about me had less i know therefore by experience the conscientious trial of my own principles i was then with three chamber comrades joseph vanheule of bruges charles bastfni and michael robyns of louvain the unceasing and anxious attention of these three friends to me by night and day i remember with gratitude and mention with pleasure it happened that a physician dr graham and a surgeon mr bond part of the suite of general ohara the officer who at yorktown virginia carried out the sword of cornwallis for surrender and satirically offered it to rochambcau instead of washington paine loaned him pounds when he ohara left the prison the money he had concealed in the lock of his celldoor edifor were then in the luxembourg i ask not myself whether it be convenient to them as men under the english government that i express to them my thanks but i should reproach myself if i did not and also to the physician of the luxembourg dr markoski i have some reason to believe because i cannot discover any other that this illness preserved me in existence among the papers of robespierre that were examined and reported upon to the convention by a committee of deputies is a note in the hand writing of robespierre in the following words demander que thomas paine soit decrete daccusation pour linteret de lamerique autant que de la france demand that thomas paine be decreed of accusation for the interest of america as well as of france from what cause it was that the intention was not put in execution i know not and cannot inform myself and therefore i ascribe it to impossibility on account of that illness the convention to repair as much as lay in their power the injustice i had sustained invited me publickly and unanimously to return into the convention and which i accepted to shew i could bear an injury without permitting it to injure my principles or my disposition it is not because right principles have been violated that they are to be abandoned i have seen since i have been at liberty several publications written some in america and some in england as answers to the former part of the age of reason if the authors of these can amuse themselves by so doing i shall not interrupt them they may write against the work and against me as much as they please they do me more service than they intend and i can have no objection that they write on they will find however by this second part without its being written as an answer to them that they must return to their work and spin their cobweb over again the first is brushed away by accident they will now find that i have furnished myself with a bible and testament and i can say also that i have found them to be much worse books than i had conceived if i have erred in any thing in the former part of the age of reason it has been by speaking better of some parts than they deserved i observe that all my opponents resort more or less to what they call scripture evidence and bible authority to help them out they are so little masters of the subject as to confound a dispute about authenticity with a dispute about doctrines i will however put them right that if they should be disposed to write any more they may know how to begin thomas paine october chapter i the old testament it has often been said that any thing may be proved from the bible but before any thing can be admitted as proved by bible the bible itself must be proved to be true for if the bible be not true or the truth of it be doubtful it ceases to have authority and cannot be admitted as proof of any thing it has been the practice of all christian commentators on the bible and of all christian priests and preachers to impose the bible on the world as a mass of truth and as the word of god they have disputed and wrangled and have anathematized each other about the supposeable meaning of particular parts and passages therein one has said and insisted that such a passage meant such a thing another that it meant directly the contrary and a third that it meant neither one nor the other but something different from both and this they have called undffstanding the bible it has happened that all the answers that i have seen to the former part of the age of reason have been written by priests and these pious men like their predecessors contend and wrangle and understand the bible each understands it differently but each understands it best and they have agreed in nothing but in telling their readers that thomas paine understands it not now instead of wasting their time and heating themselves in fractious disputations about doctrinal points drawn from the bible these men ought to know and if they do not it is civility to inform them that the first thing to be understood is whether there is sufficient authority for believing the bible to be the word of god or whether there is not there are matters in that book said to be done by the express command of god that are as shocking to humanity and to every idea we have of moral justice as any thing done by robespierre by carrier by joseph le bon in france by the english government in the east indies or by any other assassin in modern times when we read in the books ascribed to moses joshua etc that they the israelites came by stealth upon whole nations of people who as the history itself shews had given them no offence that they put all those nations to the sword that they spared neither age nor infancy that they utterly destroyed men women and children that they left not a soul to breathe expressions that are repeated over and over again in those books and that too with exulting ferocity are we sure these things are facts are we sure that the creator of man commissioned those things to be done are we sure that the books that tell us so were written by his authority it is not the antiquity of a tale that is an evidence of its truth on the contrary it is a symptom of its being fabulous for the more ancient any history pretends to be the more it has the resemblance of a fable the origin of every nation is buried in fabulous tradition and that of the jews is as much to be suspected as any other to charger the commission of things upon the almighty which in their own nature and by every rule of moral justice are crimes as all assassination is and more especially the assassination of infants is matter of serious concern the bible tells us that those assassinations were done by the express command of god to believe therefore the bible to be true we must unbelieve all our belief in the moral justice of god for wherein could crying or smiling infants offend and to read the bible without horror we must undo every thing that is tender sympathising and benevolent in the heart of man speaking for myself if i had no other evidence that the bible is fabulous than the sacrifice i must make to believe it to be true that alone would be sufficient to determine my choice but in addition to all the moral evidence against the bible i will in the progress of this work produce such other evidence as even a priest cannot deny and show from that evidence that the bible is not entitled to credit as being the word of god but before i proceed to this examination i will show wherein the bible differs from all other ancient writings with respect to the nature of the evidence necessary to establish its authenticity and this is is the more proper to be done because the advocates of the bible in their answers to the former part of the age of reason undertake to say and they put some stress thereon that the authenticity of the bible is as well established as that of any other ancient book as if our belief of the one could become any rule for our belief of the other i know however but of one ancient book that authoritatively challenges universal consent and belief and that is euclids elements of geometry euclid according to chronological history lived three hundred years before christ and about one hundred before archimedes he was of the city of alexandria in egypt author and the reason is because it is a book of selfevident demonstration entirely independent of its author and of every thing relating to time place and circumstance the matters contained in that book would have the same authority they now have had they been written by any other person or had the work been anonymous or had the author never been known for the identical certainty of who was the author makes no part of our belief of the matters contained in the book but it is quite otherwise with respect to the books ascribed to moses to joshua to samuel etc those are books of testimony and they testify of things naturally incredible and therefore the whole of our belief as to the authenticity of those books rests in the first place upon the certainty that they were written by moses joshua and samuel secondly upon the credit we give to their testimony we may believe the first that is may believe the certainty of the authorship and yet not the testimony in the same manner that we may believe that a certain person gave evidence upon a case and yet not believe the evidence that he gave but if it should be found that the books ascribed to moses joshua and samuel were not written by moses joshua and samuel every part of the authority and authenticity of those books is gone at once for there can be no such thing as forged or invented testimony neither can there be anonymous testimony more especially as to things naturally incredible such as that of talking with god face to face or that of the sun and moon standing still at the command of a man the greatest part of the other ancient books are works of genius of which kind are those ascribed to homer to plato to aristotle to demosthenes to cicero etc here again the author is not an essential in the credit we give to any of those works for as works of genius they would have the same merit they have now were they anonymous nobody believes the trojan story as related by homer to be true for it is the poet only that is admired and the merit of the poet will remain though the story be fabulous but if we disbelieve the matters related by the bible authors moses for instance as we disbelieve the things related by homer there remains nothing of moses in our estimation but an imposter as to the ancient historians from herodotus to tacitus we credit them as far as they relate things probable and credible and no further for if we do we must believe the two miracles which tacitus relates were performed by vespasian that of curing a lame man and a blind man in just the same manner as the same things are told of jesus christ by his historians we must also believe the miracles cited by josephus that of the sea of pamphilia opening to let alexander and his army pass as is related of the red sea in exodus these miracles are quite as well authenticated as the bible miracles and yet we do not believe them consequently the degree of evidence necessary to establish our belief of things naturally incredible whether in the bible or elsewhere is far greater than that which obtains our belief to natural and probable things and therefore the advocates for the bible have no claim to our belief of the bible because that we believe things stated in other ancient writings since that we believe the things stated in those writings no further than they are probable and credible or because they are selfevident like euclid or admire them because they are elegant like homer or approve them because they are sedate like plato or judicious like aristotle having premised these things i proceed to examine the authenticity of the bible and i begin with what are called the five books of moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy my intention is to shew that those books are spurious and that moses is not the author of them and still further that they were not written in the time of moses nor till several hundred years afterwards that they are no other than an attempted history of the life of moses and of the times in which he is said to have lived and also of the times prior thereto written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship several hundred years after the death of moses as men now write histories of things that happened or are supposed to have happened several hundred or several thousand years ago the evidence that i shall produce in this case is from the books themselves and i will confine myself to this evidence only were i to refer for proofs to any of the ancient authors whom the advocates of the bible call prophane authors they would controvert that authority as i controvert theirs i will therefore meet them on their own ground and oppose them with their own weapon the bible in the first place there is no affirmative evidence that moses is the author of those books and that he is the author is altogether an unfounded opinion got abroad nobody knows how the style and manner in which those books are written give no room to believe or even to suppose they were written by moses for it is altogether the style and manner of another person speaking of moses in exodus leviticus and numbers for every thing in genesis is prior to the times of moses and not the least allusion is made to him therein the whole i say of these books is in the third person it is always the lord said unto moses or moses said unto the lord or moses said unto the people or the people said unto moses and this is the style and manner that historians use in speaking of the person whose lives and actions they are writing it may be said that a man may speak of himself in the third person and therefore it may be supposed that moses did but supposition proves nothing and if the advocates for the belief that moses wrote those books himself have nothing better to advance than supposition they may as well be silent but granting the grammatical right that moses might speak of himself in the third person because any man might speak of himself in that manner it cannot be admitted as a fact in those books that it is moses who speaks without rendering moses truly ridiculous and absurd for example numbers xii now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were on the face of the earth if moses said this of himself instead of being the meekest of men he was one of the most vain and arrogant coxcombs and the advocates for those books may now take which side they please for both sides are against them if moses was not the author the books are without authority and if he was the author the author is without credit because to boast of meekness is the reverse of meekness and is a lie in sentiment in deuteronomy the style and manner of writing marks more evidently than in the former books that moses is not the writer the manner here used is dramatical the writer opens the subject by a short introductory discourse and then introduces moses as in the act of speaking and when he has made moses finish his harrangue he the writer resumes his own part and speaks till he brings moses forward again and at last closes the scene with an account of the death funeral and character of moses this interchange of speakers occurs four times in this book from the first verse of the first chapter to the end of the fifth verse it is the writer who speaks he then introduces moses as in the act of making his harrangue and this continues to the end of the th verse of the fourth chapter here the writer drops moses and speaks historically of what was done in consequence of what moses when living is supposed to have said and which the writer has dramatically rehearsed the writer opens the subject again in the first verse of the fifth chapter though it is only by saying that moses called the people of isracl together he then introduces moses as before and continues him as in the act of speaking to the end of the th chapter he does the same thing at the beginning of the th chapter and continues moses as in the act of speaking to the end of the th chapter at the th chapter the writer speaks again through the whole of the first verse and the first line of the second verse where he introduces moses for the last time and continues him as in the act of speaking to the end of the d chapter the writer having now finished the rehearsal on the part of moses comes forward and speaks through the whole of the last chapter he begins by telling the reader that moses went up to the top of pisgah that he saw from thence the land which the writer says had been promised to abraham isaac and jacob that he moses died there in the land of moab that he buried him in a valley in the land of moab but that no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day that is unto the time in which the writer lived who wrote the book of deuteronomy the writer then tells us that moses was one hundred and ten years of age when he died that his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated and he concludes by saying that there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses whom says this anonymous writer the lord knew face to face having thus shewn as far as grammatical evidence implics that moses was not the writer of those books i will after making a few observations on the inconsistencies of the writer of the book of deuteronomy proceed to shew from the historical and chronological evidence contained in those books that moses was not because he could not be the writer of them and consequently that there is no authority for believing that the inhuman and horrid butcheries of men women and children told of in those books were done as those books say they were at the command of god it is a duty incumbent on every true deist that he vindicates the moral justice of god against the calumnies of the bible the writer of the book of deuteronomy whoever he was for it is an anonymous work is obscure and also contradictory with himself in the account he has given of moses after telling that moses went to the top of pisgah and it does not appear from any account that he ever came down again he tells us that moses died there in the land of moab and that he buried him in a valley in the land of moab but as there is no antecedent to the pronoun he there is no knowing who he was that did bury him if the writer meant that he god buried him how should he the writer know it or why should we the readers believe him since we know not who the writer was that tells us so for certainly moses could not himself tell where he was buried the writer also tells us that no man knoweth where the sepulchre of moses is unto this day meaning the time in which this writer lived how then should he know that moses was buried in a valley in the land of moab for as the writer lived long after the time of moses as is evident from his using the expression of unto this day meaning a great length of time after the death of moses he certainly was not at his funeral and on the other hand it is impossible that moses himself could say that no man knoweth where the sepulchre is unto this day to make moses the speaker would be an improvement on the play of a child that hides himself and cries nobody can find me nobody can find moses this writer has no where told us how he came by the speeches which he has put into the mouth of moses to speak and therefore we have a right to conclude that he either composed them himself or wrote them from oral tradition one or other of these is the more probable since he has given in the fifth chapter a table of commandments in which that called the fourth commandment is different from the fourth commandment in the twentieth chapter of exodus in that of exodus the reason given for keeping the seventh day is because says the commandment god made the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh but in that of deuteronomy the reason given is that it was the day on which the children of israel came out of egypt and therefore says this commandment the lord thy god commanded thee to kee the sabbathday this makes no mention of the creation nor that of the coming out of egypt there are also many things given as laws of moses in this book that are not to be found in any of the other books among which is that inhuman and brutal law xxi which authorizes parents the father and the mother to bring their own children to have them stoned to death for what it pleased them to call stubbornness but priests have always been fond of preaching up deuteronomy for deuteronomy preaches up tythes and it is from this book xxv they have taken the phrase and applied it to tything that thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn and that this might not escape observation they have noted it in the table of contents at the head of the chapter though it is only a single verse of less than two lines o priests priests ye are willing to be compared to an ox for the sake of tythes an elegant pocket edition of paines theological works london r carlile has in its title a picture of paine as a moses in evening dress unfolding the two tables of his age of reason to a famer from whom the bishop of llandaff who replied to this work has taken a sheaf and a lamb which he is carrying to a church at the summit of a well stocked hill editor though it is impossible for us to know identically who the writer of deuteronomy was it is not difficult to discover him professionally that he was some jewish priest who lived as i shall shew in the course of this work at least three hundred and fifty years after the time of moses i come now to speak of the historical and chronological evidence the chronology that i shall use is the bible chronology for i mean not to go out of the bible for evidence of any thing but to make the bible itself prove historically and chronologically that moses is not the author of the books ascribed to him it is therefore proper that i inform the readers such an one at least as may not have the opportunity of knowing it that in the larger bibles and also in some smaller ones there is a series of chronology printed in the margin of every page for the purpose of shawing how long the historical matters stated in each page happened or are supposed to have happened before christ and consequently the distance of time between one historical circumstance and another i begin with the book of genesis in genesis xiv the writer gives an account of lot being taken prisoner in a battle between the four kings against five and carried off and that when the account of lot being taken came to abraham that he armed all his household and marched to rescue lot from the captors and that he pursued them unto dan ver to shew in what manner this expression of pursuing them unto dan applies to the case in question i will refer to two circumstances the one in america the other in france the city now called new york in america was originally new amsterdam and the town in france lately called havre marat was before called havredegrace new amsterdam was changed to new york in the year havredegrace to havre marat in the year should therefore any writing be found though without date in which the name of newyork should be mentioned it would be certain evidence that such a writing could not have been written before and must have been written after new amsterdam was changed to new york and consequently not till after the year or at least during the course of that year and in like manner any dateless writing with the name of havre marat would be certain evidence that such a writing must have been written after havredegrace became havre marat and consequently not till after the year or at least during the course of that year i now come to the application of those cases and to show that there was no such place as dan till many years after the death of moses and consequently that moses could not be the writer of the book of genesis where this account of pursuing them unto dan is given the place that is called dan in the bible was originally a town of the gentiles called laish and when the tribe of dan seized upon this town they changed its name to dan in commemoration of dan who was the father of that tribe and the great grandson of abraham to establish this in proof it is necessary to refer from genesis to chapter xviii of the book called the book of judges it is there said ver that they the danites came unto laish to a people that were quiet and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword the bible is filled with murder and burned the city with fire and they built a city ver and dwelt therein and ver they called the name of the city dan after the name of dan their father howbeit the name of the city was laish at the first this account of the danites taking possession of laish and changing it to dan is placed in the book of judges immediately after the death of samson the death of samson is said to have happened bc and that of moses bc and therefore according to the historical arrangement the place was not called dan till years after the death of moses there is a striking confusion between the historical and the chronological arrangement in the book of judges the last five chapters as they stand in the book are put chronologically before all the preceding chapters they are made to be years before the th chapter before the th before the th before the th go before the th and years before the st chapter this shews the uncertain and fabulous state of the bible according to the chronological arrangement the taking of laish and giving it the name of dan is made to be twenty years after the death of joshua who was the successor of moses and by the historical order as it stands in the book it is made to be years after the death of joshua and after that of moses but they both exclude moses from being the writer of genesis because according to either of the statements no such a place as dan existed in the time of moses and therefore the writer of genesis must have been some person who lived after the town of laish had the name of dan and who that person was nobody knows and consequently the book of genesis is anonymous and without authority i come now to state another point of historical and chronological evidence and to show therefrom as in the preceding case that moses is not the author of the book of genesis in genesis xxxvi there is given a genealogy of the sons and descendants of esau who are called edomites and also a list by name of the kings of edom in enumerating of which it is said verse and these are the kings that reigned in edom before there reigned any king over the children of israel now were any dateless writing to be found in which speaking of any past events the writer should say these things happened before there was any congress in america or before there was any convention in france it would be evidence that such writing could not have been written before and could only be written after there was a congress in america or a convention in france as the case might be and consequently that it could not be written by any person who died before there was a congress in the one country or a convention in the other nothing is more frequent as well in history as in conversation than to refer to a fact in the room of a date it is most natural so to do because a fact fixes itself in the memory better than a date secondly because the fact includes the date and serves to give two ideas at once and this manner of speaking by circumstances implies as positively that the fact alluded to is past as if it was so expressed when a person in speaking upon any matter says it was before i was married or before my son was born or before i went to america or before i went to france it is absolutely understood and intended to be understood that he has been married that he has had a son that he has been in america or been in france language does not admit of using this mode of expression in any other sense and whenever such an expression is found anywhere it can only be understood in the sense in which only it could have been used the passage therefore that i have quoted that these are the kings that reigned in edom before there reigned any king over the children of israel could only have been written after the first king began to reign over them and consequently that the book of genesis so far from having been written by moses could not have been written till the time of saul at least this is the positive sense of the passage but the expression any king implies more kings than one at least it implies two and this will carry it to the time of david and if taken in a general sense it carries itself through all times of the jewish monarchy had we met with this verse in any part of the bible that professed to have been written after kings began to reign in israel it would have been impossible not to have seen the application of it it happens then that this is the case the two books of chronicles which give a history of all the kings of israel are professedly as well as in fact written after the jewish monarchy began and this verse that i have quoted and all the remaining verses of genesis xxxvi are word for word in chronicles i beginning at the d verse it was with consistency that the writer of the chronicles could say as he has said chron i these are the kings that reigned in edom before there reigned any king ever the children of israel because he was going to give and has given a list of the kings that had reigned in israel but as it is impossible that the same expression could have been used before that period it is as certain as any thing can be proved from historical language that this part of genesis is taken from chronicles and that genesis is not so old as chronicles and probably not so old as the book of homer or as aesops fables admitting homer to have been as the tables of chronology state contemporary with david or solomon and aesop to have lived about the end of the jewish monarchy take away from genesis the belief that moses was the author on which only the strange belief that it is the word of god has stood and there remains nothing of genesis but an anonymous book of stories fables and traditionary or invented absurdities or of downright lies the story of eve and the serpent and of noah and his ark drops to a level with the arabian tales without the merit of being entertaining and the account of men living to eight and nine hundred years becomes as fabulous as the immortality of the giants of the mythology besides the character of moses as stated in the bible is the most horrid that can be imagined if those accounts be true he was the wretch that first began and carried on wars on the score or on the pretence of religion and under that mask or that infatuation committed the most unexampled atrocities that are to be found in the history of any nation of which i will state only one instance when the jewish army returned from one of their plundering and murdering excursions the account goes on as follows numbers xxxi and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp and moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from the battle and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with him but all the womenchildren that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves among the detestable villains that in any period of the world have disgraced the name of man it is impossible to find a greater than moses if this account be true here is an order to butcher the boys to massacre the mothers and debauch the daughters let any mother put herself in the situation of those mothers one child murdered another destined to violation and herself in the hands of an executioner let any daughter put herself in the situation of those daughters destined as a prey to the murderers of a mother and a brother and what will be their feelings it is in vain that we attempt to impose upon nature for nature will have her course and the religion that tortures all her social ties is a false religion after this detestable order follows an account of the plunder taken and the manner of dividing it and here it is that the profanenegs of priestly hypocrisy increases the catalogue of crimes verse and the lords tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lords tribute was threescore and twelve and the asses were thirty thousand of which the lords tribute was threescore and one and the persons were sixteen thousand of which the lords tribute was thirty and two in short the matters contained in this chapter as well as in many other parts of the bible are too horrid for humanity to read or for decency to hear for it appears from the th verse of this chapter that the number of womenchildren consigned to debauchery by the order of moses was thirtytwo thousand people in general know not what wickedness there is in this pretended word of god brought up in habits of superstition they take it for granted that the bible is true and that it is good they permit themselves not to doubt of it and they carry the ideas they form of the benevolence of the almighty to the book which they have been taught to believe was written by his authority good heavens it is quite another thing it is a book of lies wickedness and blasphemy for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the almighty but to return to my subject that of showing that moses is not the author of the books ascribed to him and that the bible is spurious the two instances i have already given would be sufficient without any additional evidence to invalidate the authenticity of any book that pretended to be four or five hundred years more ancient than the matters it speaks of refers to them as facts for in the case of pursuing them unto dan and of the kings that reigned over the children of israel not even the flimsy pretence of prophecy can be pleaded the expressions are in the preter tense and it would be downright idiotism to say that a man could prophecy in the preter tense but there are many other passages scattered throughout those books that unite in the same point of evidence it is said in exodus another of the books ascribed to moses xvi and the children of israel did eat manna until they came to a land inhabited they did eat manna untit they came unto the borders of the land of canaan whether the children of israel ate manna or not or what manna was or whether it was anything more than a kind of fungus or small mushroom or other vegetable substance common to that part of the country makes no part of my argument all that i mean to show is that it is not moses that could write this account because the account extends itself beyond the life time of moses moses according to the bible but it is such a book of lies and contradictions there is no knowing which part to believe or whether any died in the wilderness and never came upon the borders of the land of canaan and consequently it could not be he that said what the children of israel did or what they ate when they came there this account of eating manna which they tell us was written by moses extends itself to the time of joshua the successor of moses as appears by the account given in the book of joshua after the children of israel had passed the river jordan and came into the borders of the land of canaan joshua v and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna any more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year but a more remarkable instance than this occurs in deuteronomy which while it shows that moses could not be the writer of that book shows also the fabulous notions that prevailed at that time about giants in deuteronomy iii among the conquests said to be made by moses is an account of the taking of og king of bashan for only og king of bashan remained of the race of giants behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbath of the children of ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man a cubit is foot inches the length therefore of the bed was feet inches and the breadth feet inches thus much for this giants bed now for the historical part which though the evidence is not so direct and positive as in the former cases is nevertheless very presumable and corroborating evidence and is better than the best evidence on the contrary side the writer by way of proving the existence of this giant refers to his bed as an ancient relick and says is it not in rabbath or rabbah of the children of ammon meaning that it is for such is frequently the bible method of affirming a thing but it could not be moses that said this because moses could know nothing about rabbah nor of what was in it rabbah was not a city belonging to this giant king nor was it one of the cities that moses took the knowledge therefore that this bed was at rabbah and of the particulars of its dimensions must be referred to the time when rabbah was taken and this was not till four hundred years after the death of moses for which see sam xii and joab davids general fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city etc as i am not undertaking to point out all the contradictions in time place and circumstance that abound in the books ascribed to moses and which prove to demonstration that those books could not be written by moses nor in the time of moses i proceed to the book of joshua and to shew that joshua is not the author of that book and that it is anonymous and without authority the evidence i shall produce is contained in the book itself i will not go out of the bible for proof against the supposed authenticity of the bible false testimony is always good against itself joshua according to joshua i was the immediate successor of moses he was moreover a military man which moses was not and he continued as chief of the people of israel twentyfive years that is from the time that moses died which according to the bible chronology was bc until bc when according to the same chronology joshua died if therefore we find in this book said to have been written by joshua references to facts done after the death of joshua it is evidence that joshua could not be the author and also that the book could not have been written till after the time of the latest fact which it records as to the character of the book it is horrid it is a military history of rapine and murder as savage and brutal as those recorded of his predecessor in villainy and hypocrisy moses and the blasphemy consists as in the former books in ascribing those deeds to the orders of the almighty in the first place the book of joshua as is the case in the preceding books is written in the third person it is the historian of joshua that speaks for it would have been absurd and vainglorious that joshua should say of himself as is said of him in the last verse of the sixth chapter that his fame was noised throughout all the country i now come more immediately to the proof in joshua xxiv it is said and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that overlived joshua now in the name of common sense can it be joshua that relates what people had done after he was dead this account must not only have been written by some historian that lived after joshua but that lived also after the elders that outlived joshua there are several passages of a general meaning with respect to time scattered throughout the book of joshua that carrics the time in which the book was written to a distance from the time of joshua but without marking by exclusion any particular time as in the passage above quoted in that passage the time that intervened between the death of joshua and the death of the elders is excluded descriptively and absolutely and the evidence substantiates that the book could not have been written till after the death of the last but though the passages to which i allude and which i am going to quote do not designate any particular time by exclusion they imply a time far more distant from the days of joshua than is contained between the death of joshua and the death of the elders such is the passage x where after giving an account that the sun stood still upon gibeon and the moon in the valley of ajalon at the command of joshua a tale only fit to amuse children note this tale of the sun standing still upon motint gibeon and the moon in the valley of ajalon is one of those fables that detects itself such a circumstance could not have happened without being known all over the world one half would have wondered why the sun did not rise and the other why it did not set and the tradition of it would be universal whereas there is not a nation in the world that knows anything about it but why must the moon stand still what occasion could there be for moonlight in the daytime and that too whilst the sun shined as a poetical figure the whole is well enough it is akin to that in the song of deborah and barak the stars in their courses fought against sisera but it is inferior to the figurative declaration of mahomet to the persons who came to expostulate with him on his goings on wert thou said he to come to me with the sun in thy right hand and the moon in thy left it should not alter my career for joshua to have exceeded mahomet he should have put the sun and moon one in each pocket and carried them as guy faux carried his dark lanthorn and taken them out to shine as he might happen to want them the sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related that it is difficult to class them separately one step above the sublime makes the ridiculous and one step above the ridiculous makes the sublime again the account however abstracted from the poetical fancy shews the ignorance of joshua for he should have commanded the earth to have stood still author the passage says and there was no day like that before it nor after it that the lord hearkened to the voice of a man the time implied by the expression after it that is after that day being put in comparison with all the time that passed before it must in order to give any expressive signification to the passage mean a great letgth of time for example it would have been ridiculous to have said so the next day or the next week or the next month or the next year to give therefore meaning to the passage comparative with the wonder it relates and the prior time it alludes to it must mean centuries of years less however than one would be trifling and less than two would be barely admissible a distant but general time is also expressed in chapter viii where after giving an account of the taking the city of ai it is said ver th and joshua burned ai and made it an heap for ever a desolation unto this day and again ver where speaking of the king of ai whom joshua had hanged and buried at the entering of the gate it is said and he raised thereon a great heap of stones which remaineth unto this day that is unto the day or time in which the writer of the book of joshua lived and again in chapter x where after speaking of the five kings whom joshua had hanged on five trees and then thrown in a cave it is said and he laid great stones on the caves mouth which remain unto this very day in enumerating the several exploits of joshua and of the tribes and of the places which they conquered or attempted it is said xv as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem the children of judah could not drive them out but the jebusites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem unto this day the question upon this passage is at what time did the jebusites and the children of judah dwell together at jerusalem as this matter occurs again in judges i i shall reserve my observations till i come to that part having thus shewn from the book of joshua itself without any auxiliary evidence whatever that joshua is not the author of that book and that it is anonymous and consequently without authority i proceed as beforementioned to the book of judges the book of judges is anonymous on the face of it and therefore even the pretence is wanting to call it the word of god it has not so much as a nominal voucher it is altogether fatherless this book begins with the same expression as the book of joshua that of joshua begins chap i now after the death of moses etc and this of the judges begins now after the death of joshua etc this and the similarity of stile between the two books indicate that they are the work of the same author but who he was is altogether unknown the only point that the book proves is that the author lived long after the time of joshua for though it begins as if it followed immediately after his death the second chapter is an epitome or abstract of the whole book which according to the bible chronology extends its history through a space of years that is from the death of joshua bc to the death of samson bc and only years before saul went to seek his fathers asses and was made king but there is good reason to believe that it was not written till the time of david at least and that the book of joshua was not written before the same time in judges i the writer after announcing the death of joshua proceeds to tell what happened between the children of judah and the native inhabitants of the land of canaan in this statement the writer having abruptly mentioned jerusalem in the th verse says immediately after in the th verse by way of explanation now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and taken it consequently this book could not have been written before jerusalem had been taken the reader will recollect the quotation i have just before made from joshua xv where it said that the jebusites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem at this day meaning the time when the book of joshua was written the evidence i have already produced to prove that the books i have hitherto treated of were not written by the persons to whom they are ascribed nor till many years after their death if such persons ever lived is already so abundant that i can afford to admit this passage with less weight than i am entitled to draw from it for the case is that so far as the bible can be credited as an history the city of jerusalem was not taken till the time of david and consequently that the book of joshua and of judges were not written till after the commencement of the reign of david which was years after the death of joshua the name of the city that was afterward called jerusalem was originally jebus or jebusi and was the capital of the jebusites the account of davids taking this city is given in samuel v etc also in chron xiv etc there is no mention in any part of the bible that it was ever taken before nor any account that favours such an opinion it is not said either in samuel or in chronicles that they utterly destroyed men women and children that they left not a soul to breathe as is said of their other conquests and the silence here observed implies that it was taken by capitulation and that the jebusites the native inhabitants continued to live in the place after it was taken the account therefore given in joshua that the jebusites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem at this day corresponds to no other time than after taking the city by david having now shown that every book in the bible from genesis to judges is without authenticity i come to the book of ruth an idle bungling story foolishly told nobody knows by whom about a strolling countrygirl creeping slily to bed to her cousin boaz the text of ruth does not imply the unpleasant sense paines words are likely to convey editor pretty stuff indeed to be called the word of god it is however one of the best books in the bible for it is free from murder and rapine i come next to the two books of samuel and to shew that those books were not written by samuel nor till a great length of time after the death of samuel and that they are like all the former books anonymous and without authority to be convinced that these books have been written much later than the time of samuel and consequently not by him it is only necessary to read the account which the writer gives of saul going to seek his fathers asses and of his interview with samuel of whom saul went to enquire about those lost asses as foolish people nowadays go to a conjuror to enquire after lost things the writer in relating this story of saul samuel and the asses does not tell it as a thing that had just then happened but as an ancient story in the time this writer lived for he tells it in the language or terms used at the time that samuel lived which obliges the writer to explain the story in the terms or language used in the time the writer lived samuel in the account given of him in the first of those books chap ix called the seer and it is by this term that saul enquires after him ver and as they saul and his servant went up the hill to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and they said unto them is the seer here saul then went according to the direction of these maidens and met samuel without knowing him and said unto him ver tell me i pray thee where the seers house is and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer as the writer of the book of samuel relates these questions and answers in the language or manner of speaking used in the time they are said to have been spoken and as that manner of speaking was out of use when this author wrote he found it necessary in order to make the story understood to explain the terms in which these questions and answers are spoken and he does this in the th verse where he says beforetune in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus he spake come let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer this proves as i have before said that this story of saul samuel and the asses was an ancient story at the time the book of samuel was written and consequently that samuel did not write it and that the book is without authenticity but if we go further into those books the evidence is still more positive that samuel is not the writer of them for they relate things that did not happen till several years after the death of samuel samuel died before saul for i samuel xxviii tells that saul and the witch of endor conjured samuel up after he was dead yet the history of matters contained in those books is extended through the remaining part of sauls life and to the latter end of the life of david who succceded saul the account of the death and burial of samuel a thing which he could not write himself is related in i samuel xxv and the chronology affixed to this chapter makes this to be bc o yet the history of this first book is brought down to bc that is to the death of saul which was not till four years after the death of samuel the second book of samuel begins with an account of things that did not happen till four years after samuel was dead for it begins with the reign of david who succeeded saul and it goes on to the end of davids reign which was fortythree years after the death of samuel and therefore the books are in themselves positive evidence that they were not written by samuel i have now gone through all the books in the first part of the bible to which the names of persons are affixed as being the authors of those books and which the church styling itself the christian church have imposed upon the world as the writings of moses joshua and samuel and i have detected and proved the falsehood of this imposition and now ye priests of every description who have preached and written against the former part of the age of reason what have ye to say will ye with all this mass of evidence against you and staring you in the face still have the assurance to march into your pulpits and continue to impose these books on your congregations as the works of inspired penmen and the word of god when it is as evident as demonstration can make truth appear that the persons who ye say are the authors are not the authors and that ye know not who the authors are what shadow of pretence have ye now to produce for continuing the blasphemous fraud what have ye still to offer against the pure and moral religion of deism in support of your system of falsehood idolatry and pretended revelation had the cruel and murdering orders with which the bible is filled and the numberless torturing executions of men women and children in consequence of those orders been ascribed to some friend whose memory you revered you would have glowed with satisfaction at detecting the falsehood of the charge and gloried in defending his injured fame it is because ye are sunk in the cruelty of superstition or feel no interest in the honour of your creator that ye listen to the horrid tales of the bible or hear them with callous indifference the evidence i have produced and shall still produce in the course of this work to prove that the bible is without authority will whilst it wounds the stubbornness of a priest relieve and tranquillize the minds of millions it will free them from all those hard thoughts of the almighty which priestcraft and the bible had infused into their minds and which stood in everlasting opposition to all their ideas of his moral justice and benevolence i come now to the two books of kings and the two books of chronicles those books are altogether historical and are chiefly confined to the lives and actions of the jewish kings who in general were a parcel of rascals but these are matters with which we have no more concern than we have with the roman emperors or homers account of the trojan war besides which as those books are anonymous and as we know nothing of the writer or of his character it is impossible for us to know what degree of credit to give to the matters related therein like all other ancient histories they appear to be a jumble of fable and of fact and of probable and of improbable things but which distance of time and place and change of circumstances in the world have rendered obsolete and uninteresting the chief use i shall make of those books will be that of comparing them with each other and with other parts of the bible to show the confusion contradiction and cruelty in this pretended word of god the first book of kings begins with the reign of solomon which according to the bible chronology was bc and the second book ends bc being a little after the reign of zedekiah whom nebuchadnezzar after taking jerusalem and conquering the jews carried captive to babylon the two books include a space of years the two books of chroniclcs are an history of the same times and in general of the same persons by another author for it would be absurd to suppose that the same author wrote the history twice over the first book of chronicles after giving the genealogy from adam to saul which takes up the first nine chapters begins with the reign of david and the last book ends as in the last book of kings soon after the reign of zedekiah about bc the last two verses of the last chapter bring the history years more forward that is to but these verses do not belong to the book as i shall show when i come to speak of the book of ezra the two books of kings besides the history of saul david and solomon who reigned over all israel contain an abstract of the lives of seventeen kings and one queen who are stiled kings of judah and of nineteen who are stiled kings of israel for the jewish nation immediately on the death of solomon split into two parties who chose separate kings and who carried on most rancorous wars against each other these two books are little more than a history of assassinations treachery and wars the cruelties that the jews had accustomed themselves to practise on the canaanites whose country they had savagely invaded under a pretended gift from god they afterwards practised as furiously on each other scarcely half their kings died a natural death and in some instances whole families were destroyed to secure possession to the successor who after a few years and sometimes only a few months or less shared the same fate in kings x an account is given of two baskets full of childrens heads seventy in number being exposed at the entrance of the city they were the children of ahab and were murdered by the orders of jehu whom elisha the pretended man of god had anointed to be king over israel on purpose to commit this bloody deed and assassinate his predecessor and in the account of the reign of menahem one of the kings of israel who had murdered shallum who had reigned but one month it is said kings xv that menahem smote the city of tiphsah because they opened not the city to him and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up could we permit ourselves to suppose that the almighty would distinguish any nation of people by the name of his chosen people we must suppose that people to have been an example to all the rest of the world of the purest piety and humanity and not such a nation of ruffians and cutthroats as the ancient jews were a people who corrupted by and copying after such monsters and imposters as moses and aaron joshua samuel and david had distinguished themselves above all others on the face of the known earth for barbarity and wickedness if we will not stubbornly shut our eyes and steel our hearts it is impossible not to see in spite of all that longestablished superstition imposes upon the mind that the flattering appellation of his chosen people is no other than a lie which the priests and leaders of the jews had invented to cover the baseness of their own characters and which christian priests sometimes as corrupt and often as cruel have professed to believe the two books of chronicles are a repetition of the same crimes but the history is broken in several places by the author leaving out the reign of some of their kings and in this as well as in that of kings there is such a frequent transition from kings of judah to kings of israel and from kings of israel to kings of judah that the narrative is obscure in the reading in the same book the history sometimes contradicts itself for example in kings i we are told but in rather ambiguous terms that after the death of ahaziah king of israel jehoram or joram who was of the house of ahab reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram or joram son of jehoshaphat king of judah and in viii of the same book it is said and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah began to reign that is one chapter says joram of judah began to reign in the second year of joram of israel and the other chapter says that joram of israel began to reign in the fifth year of joram of judah several of the most extraordinary matters related in one history as having happened during the reign of such or such of their kings are not to be found in the other in relating the reign of the same king for example the two first rival kings after the death of solomon were rehoboam and jeroboam and in i kings xii and xiii an account is given of jeroboam making an offering of burnt incense and that a man who is there called a man of god cried out against the altar xiii o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and mens bones shall be burned upon thee verse and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of the man of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand which he put out against him dried up so that he could not pull it again to him one would think that such an extraordinary case as this which is spoken of as a judgement happening to the chief of one of the parties and that at the first moment of the separation of the israelites into two nations would if it had been true have been recorded in both histories but though men in later times have believed all that the prophets have said unto them it does appear that those prophets or historians disbelieved each other they knew each other too well a long account also is given in kings about elijah it runs through several chapters and concludes with telling kings ii and it came to pass as they elijah and elisha still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven hum this the author of chronicles miraculous as the story is makes no mention of though he mentions elijah by name neither does he say anything of the story related in the second chapter of the same book of kings of a parcel of children calling elisha bald head and that this man of god ver turned back and looked upon them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two shebears out of the wood and tare forty and two children of them he also passes over in silence the story told kings xiii that when they were burying a man in the sepulchre where elisha had been buried it happened that the dead man as they were letting him down ver touched the bones of elisha and he the dead man revived and stood up on his feet the story does not tell us whether they buried the man notwithstanding he revived and stood upon his feet or drew him up again upon all these stories the writer of the chronicles is as silent as any writer of the present day who did not chose to be accused of lying or at least of romancing would be about stories of the same kind but however these two historians may differ from each other with respect to the tales related by either they are silent alike with respect to those men styled prophets whose writings fill up the latter part of the bible isaiah who lived in the time of hezekiab is mentioned in kings and again in chronicles when these histories are speaking of that reign but except in one or two instances at most and those very slightly none of the rest are so much as spoken of or even their existence hinted at though according to the bible chronology they lived within the time those histories were written and some of them long before if those prophets as they are called were men of such importance in their day as the compilers of the bible and priests and commentators have since represented them to be how can it be accounted for that not one of those histories should say anything about them the history in the books of kings and of chronicles is brought forward as i have already said to the year bc it will therefore be proper to examine which of these prophets lived before that period here follows a table of all the prophets with the times in which they lived before christ according to the chronology affixed to the first chapter of each of the books of the prophets and also of the number of years they lived before the books of kings and chronicles were written table of the prophets with the time in which they lived before christ and also before the books of kings and chronicles were written years years before names before kings and observations christ chronicles isaiah mentioned mentioned only in jeremiah the last two chapters of chronicles ezekiel not mentioned daniel not mentioned hosea not mentioned joel not mentioned amos not meneioned obadiah not mentioned jonah see the note micah not mentioned nahum i not mentioned habakkuk not mentioned zepbaniah not mentioned haggai zechariah all three after the year mdachi note in kings xiv the name of jonah is mentioned on account of the restoration of a tract of land by jeroboam but nothing further is said of him nor is any allusion made to the book of jonah nor to his expedition to nineveh nor to his encounter with the whale author this table is either not very honourable for the bible historians or not very honourable for the bible prophets and i leave to priests and commentators who are very learned in little things to settle the point of etiquette between the two and to assign a reason why the authors of kings and of chronicles have treated those prophets whom in the former part of the age of reason i have considered as poets with as much degrading silence as any historian of the present day would treat peter pindar i have one more observation to make on the book of chronicles after which i shall pass on to review the remaining books of the bible in my observations on the book of genesis i have quoted a passage from xxxvi which evidently refers to a time after that kings began to reign over the children of israel and i have shown that as this verse is verbatim the same as in chronicles i where it stands consistently with the order of history which in genesis it does not that the verse in genesis and a great part of the th chapter have been taken from chronicles and that the book of genesis though it is placed first in the bible and ascribed to moses has been manufactured by some unknown person after the book of chronicles was written which was not until at least eight hundred and sixty years after the time of moses the evidence i proceed by to substantiate this is regular and has in it but two stages first as i have already stated that the passage in genesis refers itself for time to chronicles secondly that the book of chronicles to which this passage refers itself was not begun to be written until at least eight hundred and sixty years after the time of moses to prove this we have only to look into chronicles iii where the writer in giving the genealogy of the descendants of david mentions zedekiah and it was in the time of zedekiah that nebuchadnezzar conquered jerusalem bc and consequently more than years after moses those who have superstitiously boasted of the antiquity of the bible and particularly of the books ascribed to moses have done it without examination and without any other authority than that of one credulous man telling it to another for so far as historical and chronological evidence applies the very first book in the bible is not so ancient as the book of homer by more than three hundred years and is about the same age with aesops fables i am not contending for the morality of homer on the contrary i think it a book of false glory and tending to inspire immoral and mischievous notions of honour and with respect to aesop though the moral is in general just the fable is often cruel and the cruelty of the fable does more injury to the heart especially in a child than the moral does good to the judgment having now dismissed kings and chronicles i come to the next in course the book of ezra as one proof among others i shall produce to shew the disorder in which this pretended word of god the bible has been put together and the uncertainty of who the authors were we have only to look at the first three verses in ezra and the last two in chronicles for by what kind of cutting and shuffling has it been that the first three verses in ezra should be the last two verses in chronicles or that the last two in chronicles should be the first three in ezra either the authors did not know their own works or the compilers did not know the authors last two verses of chronicles ver now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying earth hath the lord god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him an house in jerusalem which is in judah who is there among you of all his people the lord his god be with him and let him go up first three verses of ezra ver now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus saith cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him an house at jerusalem which is in judah who is there among you of all his people his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of the lord god of israel he is the god which is in jerusalem the last verse in chronicles is broken abruptly and ends in the middle of the phrase with the word up without signifying to what place this abrupt break and the appearance of the same verses in different books show as i have already said the disorder and ignorance in which the bible has been put together and that the compilers of it had no authority for what they were doing nor we any authority for believing what they have done note i observed as i passed along several broken and senseless passages in the bible without thinking them of consequence enough to be introduced in the body of the work such as that samuel xiii where it is said saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over israel saul chose him three thousand men c the first part of the verse that saul reigned one year has no sense since it does not tell us what saul did nor say any thing of what happened at the end of that one year and it is besides mere absurdity to say he reigned one year when the very next phrase says he had reigned two for if he had reigned two it was impossible not to have reigned one another instance occurs in joshua v where the writer tells us a story of an angel for such the table of contents at the head of the chapter calls him appearing unto joshua and the story ends abruptly and without any conclusion the story is as follows ver and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto bim and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries verse and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant verse and the captain of the lords host said unto josbua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standeth is holy and joshua did so and what then nothing for here the story ends and the chapter too either this story is broken off in the middle or it is a story told by some jewish humourist in ridicule of joshuas pretended mission from god and the compilers of the bible not perceiving the design of the story have told it as a serious matter as a story of humour and ridicule it has a great deal of point for it pompously introduces an angel in the figure of a man with a drawn sword in his hand before whom joshua falls on his face to the earth and worships which is contrary to their second commandment and then this most important embassy from heaven ends in telling joshua to pull off his shoe it might as well have told him to pull up his breeches it is certain however that the jews did not credit every thing their leaders told them as appears from the cavalier manner in which they speak of moses when he was gone into the mount as for this moses say they we wot not what is become of him exod xxxii author the only thing that has any appearance of certainty in the book of ezra is the time in which it was written which was immediately after the return of the jews from the babylonian captivity about bc ezra who according to the jewish commentators is the same person as is called esdras in the apocrypha was one of the persons who returned and who it is probable wrote the account of that affair nebemiah whose book follows next to ezra was another of the returned persons and who it is also probable wrote the account of the same affair in the book that bears his name but those accounts are nothing to us nor to any other person unless it be to the jews as a part of the history of their nation and there is just as much of the word of god in those books as there is in any of the histories of france or rapins history of england or the history of any other country but even in matters of historical record neither of those writers are to be depended upon in ezra ii the writer gives a list of the tribes and families and of the precise number of souls of each that returned from babylon to jerusalem and this enrolment of the persons so returned appears to have been one of the principal objects for writing the book but in this there is an error that destroys the intention of the undertaking the writer begins his enrolment in the following manner ii the children of parosh two thousand one hundred seventy and four ver the children of shephatiah three hundred seventy and two and in this manner he proceeds through all the families and in the th verse he makes a total and says the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore but whoever will take the trouble of casting up the several particulars will find that the total is but so that the error is what certainty then can there be in the bible for any thing here mr paine includes the long list of numbers from the bible of all the children listed and the total thereof this can be had directly from the bible nehemiah in like manner gives a list of the returned families and of the number of each family he begins as in ezra by saying vii the children of parosh two thousand three hundred and seventytwo and so on through all the families the list differs in several of the particulars from that of ezra in ver nehemiah makes a total and says as ezra had said the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore but the particulars of this list make a total but of so that the error here is these writers may do well enough for biblemakers but not for any thing where truth and exactness is necessary the next book in course is the book of esther if madam esther thought it any honour to offer herself as a kept mistress to ahasuerus or as a rival to queen vashti who had refused to come to a drunken king in the midst of a drunken company to be made a show of for the account says they had been drinking seven days and were merry let esther and mordecai look to that it is no business of ours at least it is none of mine besides which the story has a great deal the appearance of being fabulous and is also anonymous i pass on to the book of job the book of job differs in character from all the books we have hitherto passed over treachery and murder make no part of this book it is the meditations of a mind strongly impressed with the vicissitudes of human life and by turns sinking under and struggling against the pressure it is a highly wrought composition between willing submission and involuntary discontent and shows man as he sometimes is more disposed to be resigned than he is capable of being patience has but a small share in the character of the person of whom the book treats on the contrary his grief is often impetuous but he still endeavours to keep a guard upon it and seems determined in the midst of accumulating ills to impose upon himself the hard duty of contentment i have spoken in a respectful manner of the book of job in the former part of the age of reason but without knowing at that time what i have learned since which is that from all the evidence that can be collected the book of job does not belong to the bible i have seen the opinion of two hebrew commentators abenezra and spinoza upon this subject they both say that the book of job carries no internal evidence of being an hebrew book that the genius of the composition and the drama of the piece are not hebrew that it has been translated from another language into hebrew and that the author of the book was a gentile that the character represented under the name of satan which is the first and only time this name is mentioned in the bible in a later work paine notes that in the bible by which be always means the old testament alone the word satan occurs also in chron xxi and remarks that the action there ascribed to satan is in sam xxiv attributed to jehovah essay on dreams in these places however and in ps cix satan means adversary and is so translated as version in sam xix and kings v xi as a proper name with the article satan appears in the old testament only in job and in zech iii but the authenticity of the passage in zechariah has been questioned and it may be that in finding the proper name of satan in job alone paine was following some opinion met with in one of the authorities whose comments are condensed in his paragraph editor does not correspond to any hebrew idea and that the two convocations which the deity is supposed to have made of those whom the poem calls sons of god and the familiarity which this supposed satan is stated to have with the deity are in the same case it may also be observed that the book shows itself to be the production of a mind cultivated in science which the jews so far from being famous for were very ignorant of the allusions to objects of natural philosophy are frequent and strong and are of a different cast to any thing in the books known to be hebrew the astronomical names pleiades orion and arcturus are greek and not hebrew names and it does not appear from any thing that is to be found in the bible that the jews knew any thing of astronomy or that they studied it they had no translation of those names into their own language but adopted the names as they found them in the poem paines jewish critic david levi fastened on this slip detence of the old testament p in the original the names are ash arcturus kesil orion kimah pleiades though the identifications of the constellations in the asv have been questioned editor that the jews did translate the literary productions of the gentile nations into the hebrew language and mix them with their own is not a matter of doubt proverbs xxxi i is an evidence of this it is there said the word of king lemuel the prophecy which his mother taught him this verse stands as a preface to the proverbs that follow and which are not the proverbs of solomon but of lemuel and this lemuel was not one of the kings of israel nor of judah but of some other country and consequently a gentile the jews however have adopted his proverbs and as they cannot give any account who the author of the book of job was nor how they came by the book and as it differs in character from the hebrew writings and stands totally unconnected with every other book and chapter in the bible before it and after it it has all the circumstantial evidence of being originally a book of the gentiles the prayer known by the name of agurs prayer in proverbs xxx immediately preceding the proverbs of lemuel and which is the only sensible wellconceived and wellexpressed prayer in the bible has much the appearance of being a prayer taken from the gentiles the name of agur occurs on no other occasion than this and he is introduced together with the prayer ascribed to him in the same manner and nearly in the same words that lemuel and his proverbs are introduced in the chapter that follows the first verse says the words of agur the son of jakeh even the prophecy here the word prophecy is used with the same application it has in the following chapter of lemuel unconnected with anything of prediction the prayer of agur is in the th and th verses remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither riches nor poverty but feed me with food convenient for me lest i be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain this has not any of the marks of being a jewish prayer for the jews never prayed but when they were in trouble and never for anything but victory vengeance or riches author prov xxx and xxxi the word prophecy in these verses is tranrinted oracle or burden marg in the revised version the prayer of agur was quoted by paine in his plea for the officers of excise editor the biblemakers and those regulators of time the bible chronologists appear to have been at a loss where to place and how to dispose of the book of job for it contains no one historical circumstance nor allusion to any that might serve to determine its place in the bible but it would not have answered the purpose of these men to have informed the world of their ignorance and therefore they have affixed it to the aera of bc which is during the time the israelites were in egypt and for which they have just as much authority and no more than i should have for saying it was a thousand years before that period the probability however is that it is older than any book in the bible and it is the only one that can be read without indignation or disgust we know nothing of what the ancient gentile world as it is called was before the time of the jews whose practice has been to calumniate and blacken the character of all other nations and it is from the jewish accounts that we have learned to call them heathens but as far as we know to the contrary they were a just and moral people and not addicted like the jews to cruelty and revenge but of whose profession of faith we are unacquainted it appears to have been their custom to personify both virtue and vice by statues and images as is done nowadays both by statuary and by painting but it does not follow from this that they worshipped them any more than we do i pass on to the book of psalms of which it is not necessary to make much observation some of them are moral and others are very revengeful and the greater part relates to certain local circumstances of the jewish nation at the time they were written with which we have nothing to do it is however an error or an imposition to call them the psalms of david they are a collection as songbooks are nowadays from different songwriters who lived at different times the th psalm could not have been written till more than years after the time of david because it is written in commemoration of an event the capitivity of the jews in babylon which did not happen till that distance of time by the rivers of babylon we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away cartive required of us a song saying sing us one of the songs of zion as a man would say to an american or to a frenchman or to an englishman sing us one of your american songs or your french songs or your english songs this remark with respect to the time this psalm was written is of no other use than to show among others already mentioned the general imposition the world has been under with respect to the authors of the bible no regard has been paid to time place and circumstance and the names of persons have been affixed to the several books which it was as impossible they should write as that a man should walk in procession at his own funeral the book of proverbs these like the psalms are a collection and that from authors belonging to other nations than those of the jewish nation as i have shewn in the observations upon the book of job besides which some of the proverbs ascribed to solomon did not appear till two hundred and fifty years after the death of solomon for it is said in xxv i these are also proverbs of solomon which the men of hezekiah king of judah copied out it was two hundred and fifty years from the time of solomon to the time of hezekiah when a man is famous and his name is abroad he is made the putative father of things he never said or did and this most probably has been the case with solomon it appears to have been the fashion of that day to make proverbs as it is now to make jestbooks and father them upon those who never saw them a tom paines jest book had appeared in london with little or nothing of paine in it editor the book of ecclesiastes or the preacher is also ascribed to solomon and that with much reason if not with truth it is written as the solitary reflections of a wornout debauchee such as solomon was who looking back on scenes he can no longer enjoy cries out all is vanity a great deal of the metaphor and of the sentiment is obscure most probably by translation but enough is left to show they were strongly pointed in the original those that look out of the window shall be darkened is an obscure figure in translation for loss of sight author from what is transmitted to us of the character of solomon he was witty ostentatious dissolute and at last melancholy he lived fast and died tired of the world at the age of fiftyeight years seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines are worse than none and however it may carry with it the appearance of heightened enjoyment it defeats all the felicity of affection by leaving it no point to fix upon divided love is never happy this was the case with solomon and if he could not with all his pretensions to wisdom discover it beforehand he merited unpitied the mortification he afterwards endured in this point of view his preaching is unnecessary because to know the consequences it is only necessary to know the cause seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines would have stood in place of the whole book it was needless after this to say that all was vanity and vexation of spirit for it is impossible to derive happiness from the company of those whom we deprive of happiness to be happy in old age it is necessary that we accustom ourselves to objects that can accompany the mind all the way through life and that we take the rest as good in their day the mere man of pleasure is miserable in old age and the mere drudge in business is but little better whereas natural philosophy mathematical and mechanical science are a continual source of tranquil pleasure and in spite of the gloomy dogmas of priests and of superstition the study of those things is the study of the true theology it teaches man to know and to admire the creator for the principles of science are in the creation and are unchangeable and of divine origin those who knew benjaman franklin will recollect that his mind was ever young his temper ever serene science that never grows grey was always his mistress he was never without an object for when we cease to have an object we become like an invalid in an hospital waiting for death solomons songs amorous and foolish enough but which wrinkled fanaticism has called divine the compilers of the bible have placed these songs after the book of ecclesiastes and the chronologists have affixed to them the aera of bc o at which time solomon according to the same chronology was nineteen years of age and was then forming his seraglio of wives and concubines the biblemakers and the chronologists should have managed this matter a little better and either have said nothing about the time or chosen a time less inconsistent with the supposed divinity of those songs for solomon was then in the honeymoon of one thousand debaucheries it should also have occurred to them that as he wrote if he did write the book of ecclesiastes long after these songs and in which he exclaims that all is vanity and vexation of spirit that he included those songs in that description this is the more probable because he says or somebody for him ecclesiastes ii i got me mensingers and womensingers most probably to sing those songs and musical instruments of all sores and behold ver ii all was vanity and vexation of spirit the compilers however have done their work but by halves for as they have given us the songs they should have given us the tunes that we might sing them the books called the books of the prophets fill up all the remaining part of the bible they are sixteen in number beginning with isaiah and ending with malachi of which i have given a list in the observations upon chronicles of these sixteen prophets all of whom except the last three lived within the time the books of kings and chronicles were written two only isaiah and jeremiah are mentioned in the history of those books i shall begin with those two reserving what i have to say on the general character of the men called prophets to another part of the work whoever will take the trouble of reading the book ascribed to isaiah will find it one of the most wild and disorderly compositions ever put together it has neither beginning middle nor end and except a short historical part and a few sketches of history in the first two or three chapters is one continued incoherent bombastical rant full of extravagant metaphor without application and destitute of meaning a schoolboy would scarcely have been excusable for writing such stuff it is at least in translation that kind of composition and false taste that is properly called prose run mad the historical part begins at chapter xxxvi and is continued to the end of chapter xxxix it relates some matters that are said to have passed during the reign of hezekiah king of judah at which time isaiah lived this fragment of history begins and ends abruptly it has not the least connection with the chapter that precedes it nor with that which follows it nor with any other in the book it is probable that isaiah wrote this fragment himself because he was an actor in the circumstances it treats of but except this part there are scarcely two chapters that have any connection with each other one is entitled at the beginning of the first verse the burden of babylon another the burden of moab another the burden of damascus another the burden of egypt another the burden of the desert of the sea another the burden of the valley of vision as you would say the story of the knight of the burning mountain the story of cinderella or the glassen slipper the story of the sleeping beauty in the wood etc etc i have already shown in the instance of the last two verses of chronicles and the first three in ezra that the compilers of the bible mixed and confounded the writings of different authors with each other which alone were there no other cause is sufficient to destroy the authenticity of an compilation because it is more than presumptive evidence that the compilers are ignorant who the authors were a very glaring instance of this occurs in the book ascribed to isaiah the latter part of the th chapter and the beginning of the th so far from having been written by isaiah could only have been written by some person who lived at least an hundred and fifty years after isaiah was dead these chapters are a compliment to cyrus who permitted the jews to return to jerusalem from the babylonian captivity to rebuild jerusalem and the temple as is stated in ezra the last verse of the th chapter and the beginning of the th isaiah are in the following words that saith of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shalt be built and to the temple thy foundations shall be laid thus saith the lord to his enointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings to open before him the twoleaved gates and the gates shall not be shut i will go before thee etc what audacity of church and priestly ignorance it is to impose this book upon the world as the writing of isaiah when isaiah according to their own chronology died soon after the death of hezekiah which was bc and the decree of cyrus in favour of the jews returning to jerusalem was according to the same chronology bc which is a distance of time between the two of years i do not suppose that the compilers of the bible made these books but rather that they picked up some loose anonymous essays and put them together under the names of such authors as best suited their purpose they have encouraged the imposition which is next to inventing it for it was impossible but they must have observed it when we see the studied craft of the scripturemakers in making every part of this romantic book of schoolboys eloquence bend to the monstrous idea of a son of god begotten by a ghost on the body of a virgin there is no imposition we are not justified in suspecting them of every phrase and circumstance are marked with the barbarous hand of superstitious torture and forced into meanings it was impossible they could have the head of every chapter and the top of every page are blazoned with the names of christ and the church that the unwary reader might suck in the error before he began to read behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son isa vii i has been interpreted to mean the person called jesus christ and his mother mary and has been echoed through christendom for more than a thousand years and such has been the rage of this opinion that scarcely a spot in it but has been stained with blood and marked with desolation in consequence of it though it is not my intention to enter into controversy on subjects of this kind but to confine myself to show that the bible is spurious and thus by taking away the foundation to overthrow at once the whole structure of superstition raised thereon i will however stop a moment to expose the fallacious application of this passage whether isaiah was playing a trick with ahaz king of judah to whom this passage is spoken is no business of mine i mean only to show the misapplication of the passage and that it has no more reference to christ and his mother than it has to me and my mother the story is simply this the king of syria and the king of israel i have already mentioned that the jews were split into two nations one of which was called judah the capital of which was jerusalem and the other israel made war jointly against ahaz king of judah and marched their armies towards jerusalem ahaz and his people became alarmed and the account says is vii their hearts were moved as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind in this situation of things isaiah addresses himself to ahaz and assures him in the name of the lord the cant phrase of all the prophets that these two kings should not succeed against him and to satisfy ahaz that this should be the case tells him to ask a sign this the account says ahaz declined doing giving as a reason that he would not tempt the lord upon which isaiah who is the speaker says ver therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and the th verse says and before this child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land which thou abhorrest or dreadest meaning syria and the kingdom of israel shall be forsaken of both her kings here then was the sign and the time limited for the completion of the assurance or promise namely before this child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good isaiah having committed himself thus far it became necessary to him in order to avoid the imputation of being a false prophet and the consequences thereof to take measures to make this sign appear it certainly was not a difficult thing in any time of the world to find a girl with child or to make her so and perhaps isaiah knew of one beforehand for i do not suppose that the prophets of that day were any more to be trusted than the priests of this be that however as it may he says in the next chapter ver and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son here then is the whole story foolish as it is of this child and this virgin and it is upon the barefaced perversion of this story that the book of matthew and the impudence and sordid interest of priests in later times have founded a theory which they call the gospel and have applied this story to signify the person they call jesus christ begotten they say by a ghost whom they call holy on the body of a woman engaged in marriage and afterwards married whom they call a virgin seven hundred years after this foolish story was told a theory which speaking for myself i hesitate not to believe and to say is as fabulous and as false as god is true in is vii it is said that the child should be called immanuel but this name was not given to either of the children otherwise than as a character which the word signifies that of the prophetess was called mahershalalhashbaz and that of mary was called jesus author but to show the imposition and falsehood of isaiah we have only to attend to the sequel of this story which though it is passed over in silence in the book of isaiah is related in chronicles xxviii and which is that instead of these two kings failing in their attempt against ahaz king of judah as isaiah had pretended to foretel in the name of the lord they succeeded ahaz was defeated and destroyed an hundred and twenty thousand of his people were slaughtered jerusalem was plundered and two hundred thousand women and sons and daughters carried into captivity thus much for this lying prophet and imposter isaiah and the book of falsehoods that bears his name i pass on to the book of jeremiah this prophet as he is called lived in the time that nebuchadnezzar besieged jerusalem in the reign of zedekiah the last king of judah and the suspicion was strong against him that he was a traitor in the interest of nebuchadnezzar every thing relating to jeremiah shows him to have been a man of an equivocal character in his metaphor of the potter and the clay ch xviii he guards his prognostications in such a crafty manner as always to leave himself a door to escape by in case the event should be contrary to what he had predicted in the th and th verses he makes the almighty to say at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and destroy it if that nation against whom i have pronounced turn from their evil i will repent me of the evil that i thought to do unto them here was a proviso against one side of the case now for the other side verses and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent me of the good wherewith i said i would benefit them here is a proviso against the other side and according to this plan of prophesying a prophet could never be wrong however mistaken the almighty might be this sort of absurd subterfuge and this manner of speaking of the almighty as one would speak of a man is consistent with nothing but the stupidity of the bible as to the authenticity of the book it is only necessary to read it in order to decide positively that though some passages recorded therein may have been spoken by jeremiah he is not the author of the book the historical parts if they can be called by that name are in the most confused condition the same events are several times repeated and that in a manner different and sometimes in contradiction to each other and this disorder runs even to the last chapter where the history upon which the greater part of the book has been employed begins anew and ends abruptly the book has all the appearance of being a medley of unconnected anecdotes respecting persons and things of that time collected together in the same rude manner as if the various and contradictory accounts that are to be found in a bundle of newspapers respecting persons and things of the present day were put together without date order or explanation i will give two or three examples of this kind it appears from the account of chapter xxxvii that the army of nebuchadnezzer which is called the army of the chaldeans had besieged jerusalem some time and on their hearing that the army of pharaoh of egypt was marching against them they raised the siege and retreated for a time it may here be proper to mention in order to understand this confused history that nebuchadnezzar had besieged and taken jerusalem during the reign of jehoakim the redecessor of zedekiah and that it was nebuchadnezzar who had make zedekiah king or rather viceroy and that this second siege of which the book of jeremiah treats was in consequence of the revolt of zedekiah against nebuchadnezzar this will in some measure account for the suspicion that affixes itself to jeremiah of being a traitor and in the interest of nebuchadnezzar whom jeremiah calls xliii the servant of god chapter xxxvii says and it came to pass that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaohs army that jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go as this account states into the land of benjamin to separate himself thence in the midst of the people and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward was there whose name was irijah and he took jeremiah the prophet saying thou fallest away to the chaldeans then jeremiah said it is false i fall not away to the chaldeans jeremiah being thus stopt and accused was after being examined committed to prison on suspicion of being a traitor where he remained as is stated in the last verse of this chapter but the next chapter gives an account of the imprisonment of jeremiah which has no connection with this account but ascribes his imprisonment to another circumstance and for which we must go back to chapter xxi it is there stated ver that zedekiah sent pashur the son of malchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to jeremiah to enquire of him concerning nebuchadnezzar whose army was then before jerusalem and jeremiah said to them ver thus saith the lord behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth to the clialdeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey this interview and conference breaks off abruptly at the end of the th verse of chapter xxi and such is the disorder of this book that we have to pass over sixteen chapters upon various subjects in order to come at the continuation and event of this conference and this brings us to the first verse of chapter xxxviii as i have just mentioned the chapter opens with saying then shaphatiah the son of mattan gedaliah the son of pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of malchiah here are more persons mentioned than in chapter xxi heard the words that jeremiah spoke unto all the people saying thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live which are the words of the conference therefore say they to zedekiah we beseech thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of the people but the hurt and at the th verse it is said then they took jeremiah and put him into the dungeon of malchiah these two accounts are different and contradictory the one ascribes his imprisonment to his attempt to escape out of the city the other to his preaching and prophesying in the city the one to his being seized by the guard at the gate the other to his being accused before zedekiah by the conferees i observed two chapters in i samuel xvi and xvii that contradict each other with respect to david and the manner he became acquainted with saul as jeremiah xxxvii and xxxviii contradict each other with respect to the cause of jeremiahs imprisonment in samuel xvi it is said that an evil spirit of god troubled saul and that his servants advised him as a remedy to seek out a man who was a cunning player upon the harp and saul said ver provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me then answered one of his servants and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a mighty man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the lord is with him wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son and verse david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearer and when the evil spirit from god was upon saul verse david took his harp and played with his hand and saul was refreshed and was well but the next chapter xvii gives an account all different to this of the manner that saul and david became acquainted here it is ascribed to davids encounter with goliah when david was sent by his father to carry provision to his brethren in the camp in the th verse of this chapter it is said and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine goliah he said to abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth and abner said as thy soul liveth king i cannot tell and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand and saul said unto him whose son art thou thou young man and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the betblehemite these two accounts belie each other because each of them supposes saul and david not to have known each other before this book the bible is too ridiculous for criticism author in the next chapter jer xxxix we have another instance of the disordered state of this book for notwithstanding the siege of the city by nebuchadnezzar has been the subject of several of the preceding chapters particularly xxxvii and xxxviii chapter xxxix begins as if not a word had been said upon the subject and as if the reader was still to be informed of every particular respecting it for it begins with saying ver in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and besieged it etc but the instance in the last chapter lii is still more glaring for though the story has been told over and over again this chapter still supposes the reader not to know anything of it for it begins by saying ver i zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah ver and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and pitched against it and built forts against it etc it is not possible that any one man and more particularly jeremiah could have been the writer of this book the errors are such as could not have been committed by any person sitting down to compose a work were i or any other man to write in such a disordered manner no body would read what was written and every body would suppose that the writer was in a state of insanity the only way therefore to account for the disorder is that the book is a medley of detached unauthenticated anecdotes put together by some stupid bookmaker under the name of jeremiah because many of them refer to him and to the circumstances of the times he lived in of the duplicity and of the false predictions of jeremiah i shall mention two instances and then proceed to review the remainder of the bible it appears from chapter xxxviii that when jeremiah was in prison zedekiah sent for him and at this interview which was private jeremiah pressed it strongly on zedekiah to surrender himself to the enemy if says he ver thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylons princes then thy soul shall live etc zedekiah was apprehensive that what passed at this conference should be known and he said to jeremiah ver if the princes meaning those of judah hear that i have talked with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death and also what the king said unto thee then thou shalt say unto them i presented my supplication before the king that he would not cause me to return to jonathans house to die there then came all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and he told them according to all the words the king had comenanded thus this man of god as he is called could tell a lie or very strongly prevaricatc when he supposed it would answer his purpose for certainly he did not go to zedekiah to make this supplication neither did he make it he went because he was sent for and he employed that opportunity to advise zedekiah to surrender himself to nebuchadnezzar in chapter xxxiv is a prophecy of jeremiah to zedekiah in these words thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he will burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but thou shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to babylon yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord thou shalt not die by the sword but thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings that were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and they will lament thee saying ah lord for i have pronounced the word saith the lord now instead of zedekiah beholding the eyes of the king of babylon and speaking with him mouth to mouth and dying in peace and with the burning of odours as at the funeral of his fathers as jeremiah had declared the lord himself had pronounced the reverse according to chapter iii was the case it is there said that the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes then he put out the eyes of zedekiah and bound him in chains and carried him to babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death what then can we say of these prophets but that they are impostors and liars as for jeremiah he experienced none of those evils he was taken into favour by nebuchadnezzar who gave him in charge to the captain of the guard xxxix take him said he and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee jeremiah joined himself afterwards to nebuchadnezzar and went about prophesying for him against the egyptians who had marched to the relief of jerusalem while it was besieged thus much for another of the lying prophets and the book that bears his name i have been the more particular in treating of the books ascribed to isaiah and jeremiah because those two are spoken of in the books of kings and chronicles which the others are not the remainder of the books ascribed to the men called prophets i shall not trouble myself much about but take them collectively into the observations i shall offer on the character of the men styled prophets in the former part of the age of reason i have said that the word prophet was the bibleword for poet and that the flights and metaphors of jewish poets have been foolishly erected into what are now called prophecies i am sufficiently justified in this opinion not only because the books called the prophecies are written in poetical language but because there is no word in the bible except it be the word prophet that describes what we mean by a poet i have also said that the word signified a performer upon musical instruments of which i have given some instances such as that of a company of prophets prophesying with psalteries with tabrets with pipes with harps etc and that saul prophesied with them sam x it appears from this passage and from other parts in the book of samuel that the word prophet was confined to signify poetry and music for the person who was supposed to have a visionary insight into concealed things was not a prophet but a seer i know not what is the hebrew word that corresponds to the word seer in english but i observe it is translated into french by le voyant from the verb voir to see and mhich means the person who sees or the seer author the hebrew word for seer in samuel ix transliterated is chozeh the gazer it is translated in is xlvii the stargazers editor i sam ix and it was not till after the word seer went out of use which most probably was when saul banished those he called wizards that the profession of the seer or the art of seeing became incorporated into the word prophet according to the modern meaning of the word prophet and prophesying it signifies foretelling events to a great distance of time and it became necessary to the inventors of the gospel to give it this latitude of meaning in order to apply or to stretch what they call the prophecies of the old testament to the times of the new but according to the old testament the prophesying of the seer and afterwards of the prophet so far as the meaning of the word seer was incorporated into that of prophet had reference only to things of the time then passing or very closely connected with it such as the event of a battle they were going to engage in or of a journey or of any enterprise they were going to undertake or of any circumstance then pending or of any difficulty they were then in all of which had immediate reference to themselves as in the case already mentioned of ahaz and isaiah with respect to the expression behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and not to any distant future time it was that kind of prophesying that orresponds to what we call fortunetelling such as casting nativities predicting riches fortunate or unfortunate marriages conjuring for lost goods etc and it is the fraud of the christian church not that of the jews and the ignorance and the superstition of modern not that of ancient times that elevated those poetical musical conjuring dreaming strolling gentry into the rank they have since had but besides this general character of all the prophets they had also a particular character they were in parties and they prophesied for or against according to the party they were with as the poetical and political writers of the present day write in defence of the party they associate with against the other after the jews were divided into two nations that of judah and that of israel each party had its prophets who abused and accused each other of being false prophets lying prophets impostors etc the prophets of the party of judah prophesied against the prophets of the party of israel and those of the party of israel against those of judah this party prophesying showed itself immediately on the separation under the first two rival kings rehoboam and jeroboam the prophet that cursed or prophesied against the altar that jeroboam had built in bethel was of the party of judah where rehoboam was king and he was waylaid on his return home by a prophet of the party of israel who said unto him i kings xiii art thou the man of god that came from judah and he said i am then the prophet of the party of israel said to him i am a prophet also as thou art signifying of judah and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with thee unto thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but says the th verse he lied unto him the event however according to the story is that the prophet of judah never got back to judah for he was found dead on the road by the contrivance of the prophet of israel who no doubt was called a true prophet by his own party and the prophet of judah a lying brophet in kings iii a story is related of prophesying or conjuring that shews in several particulars the character of a prophet jehoshaphat king of judah and joram king of israel had for a while ceased their party animosity and entered into an alliance and these two together with the king of edom engaged in a war against the king of moab after uniting and marching their armies the story says they were in great distress for water upon which jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may enquire of the lord by him and one of the servants of the king of israel said here is elisha elisha was of the party of judah and jehoshaphat the king of judah said the word of the lord is with him the story then says that these three kings went down to elisha and when elisha who as i have said was a judahmite prophet saw the king of israel he said unto him what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and the prophets of thy mother nay but said the king of israel the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hands of the king of moab meaning because of the distress they were in for water upon which elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat king of judah i would not look towards thee nor see thee here is all the venom and vulgarity of a party prophet we are now to see the performance or manner of prophesying ver bring me said elisha a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him here is the farce of the conjurer now for the prophecy and elisha said singing most probably to the tune he was playing thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches which was just telling them what every countryman could have told them without either fiddle or farce that the way to get water was to dig for it but as every conjuror is not famous alike for the same thing so neither were those prophets for though all of them at least those i have spoken of were famous for lying some of them excelled in cursing elisha whom i have just mentioned was a chief in this branch of prophesying it was he that cursed the fortytwo children in the name of the lord whom the two shebears came and devoured we are to suppose that those children were of the party of israel but as those who will curse will lie there is just as much credit to be given to this story of elishas two shebears as there is to that of the dragon of wantley of whom it is said poor children three devoured be that could not with him grapple and at one sup he eat them up as a man would eat an apple there was another description of men called prophets that amused themselves with dreams and visions but whether by night or by day we know not these if they were not quite harmless were but little mischievous of this class are ezekiel and daniel and the first question upon these books as upon all the others is are they genuine that is were they written by ezekiel and daniel of this there is no proof but so far as my own opinion goes i am more inclined to believe they were than that they were not my reasons for this opinion are as follows first because those books do not contain internal evidence to prove they were not written by ezekiel and daniel as the books ascribed to moses joshua samuel etc prove they were not written by moses joshua samuel etc secondly because they were not written till after the babylonish captivity began and there is good reason to believe that not any book in the bible was written before that period at least it is proveable from the books themselves as i have already shown that they were not written till after the commencement of the jewish monarchy thirdly because the manner in which the books ascribed to ezekiel and daniel are written agrees with the condition these men were in at the time of writing them had the numerous commentators and priests who have foolishly employed or wasted their time in pretending to expound and unriddle those books been carred into captivity as ezekiel and daniel were it would greatly have improved their intellects in comprehending the reason for this mode of writing and have saved them the trouble of racking their invention as they have done to no purpose for they would have found that themselves would be obliged to write whatever they had to write respecting their own affairs or those of their friends or of their country in a concealed manner as those men have done these two books differ from all the rest for it is only these that are filled with accounts of dreams and visions and this difference arose from the situation the writers were in as prisoners of war or prisoners of state in a foreign country which obliged them to convey even the most trifling information to each other and all their political projects or opinions in obscure and metaphorical terms they pretend to have dreamed dreams and seen visions because it was unsafe for them to speak facts or plain language we ought however to suppose that the persons to whom they wrote understood what they meant and that it was not intended anybody else should but these busy commentators and priests have been puzzling their wits to find out what it was not intended they should know and with which they have nothing to do ezekiel and daniel were carried prisoners to babylon under the first captivity in the time of jehoiakim nine years before the second captivity in the time of zedekiah the jews were then still numerous and had considerable force at jerusalem and as it is natural to suppose that men in the situation of ezekiel and daniel would be meditating the recovery of their country and their own deliverance it is reasonable to suppose that the accounts of dreams and visions with which these books are filled are no other than a disguised mode of correspondence to facilitate those objects it served them as a cypher or secret alphabet if they are not this they are tales reveries and nonsense or at least a fanciful way of wearing off the wearisomeness of captivity but the presumption is they are the former ezekiel begins his book by speaking of a vision of cherubims and of a wheel within a wheel which he says he saw by the river chebar in the land of his captivity is it not reasonable to suppose that by the cherubims he meant the temple at jerusalem where they had figures of cherubims and by a wheel within a wheel which as a figure has always been understood to signify political contrivance the project or means of recovering jerusalem in the latter part of his book he supposes himself transported to jerusalem and into the temple and he refers back to the vision on the river chebar and says xliii that this last vision was like the vision on the river chebar which indicates that those pretended dreams and visions had for their object the recovery of jerusalem and nothing further as to the romantic interpretations and applications wild as the dreams and visions they undertake to explain which commentators and priests have made of those books that of converting them into things which they call prophecies and making them bend to times and circumstances as far remote even as the present day it shows the fraud or the extreme folly to which credulity or priestcraft can go scarcely anything can be more absurd than to suppose that men situated as ezekiel and daniel were whose country was overrun and in the possession of the enemy all their friends and relations in captivity abroad or in slavery at home or massacred or in continual danger of it scarcely any thing i say can be more absurd than to suppose that such men should find nothing to do but that of employing their time and their thoughts about what was to happen to other nations a thousand or two thousand years after they were dead at the same time nothing more natural than that they should meditate the recovery of jerusalem and their own deliverance and that this was the sole object of all the obscure and apparently frantic writing contained in those books in this sense the mode of writing used in those two books being forced by necessity and not adopted by choice is not irrational but if we are to use the books as prophecies they are false in ezekiel xxix speaking of egypt it is said no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast pass through it neither shall it be inhabited for forty years this is what never came to pass and consequently it is false as all the books i have already reviewed are i here close this part of the subject in the former part of the age of reason i have spoken of jonah and of the story of him and the whale a fit story for ridicule if it was written to be believed or of laughter if it was intended to try what credulity could swallow for if it could swallow jonah and the whale it could swallow anything but as is already shown in the observations on the book of job and of proverbs it is not always certain which of the books in the bible are originally hebrew or only translations from the books of the gentiles into hebrew and as the book of jonah so far from treating of the affairs of the jews says nothing upon that subject but treats altogether of the gentiles it is more probable that it is a book of the gentiles than of the jews i have read in an ancient persian poem saadi i believe but have mislaid the reference this phrase and now the whale swallowed jonah the sun set editor and that it has been written as a fable to expose the nonsense and satyrize the vicious and malignant character of a bibleprophet or a predicting priest jonah is represented first as a disobedient prophet running away from his mission and taking shelter aboard a vessel of the gentiles bound from joppa to tarshish as if he ignorantly supposed by such a paltry contrivance he could hide himself where god could not find him the vessel is overtaken by a storm at sea and the mariners all of whom are gentiles believing it to be a judgement on account of some one on board who had committed a crime agreed to cast lots to discover the offender and the lot fell upon jonah but before this they had cast all their wares and merchandise overboard to lighten the vessel while jonah like a stupid fellow was fast asleep in the hold after the lot had designated jonah to be the offender they questioned him to know who and what he was and he told them he was an hebrew and the story implies that he confessed himself to be guilty but these gentiles instead of sacrificing him at once without pity or mercy as a company of bibleprophets or priests would have done by a gentile in the same case and as it is related samuel had done by agag and moses by the women and children they endeavoured to save him though at the risk of their own lives for the account says nevertheless that is though jonah was a jew and a foreigner and the cause of all their misfortunes and the loss of their cargo the men rowed hard to bring the boat to land but they could not for the sea wrought and was tempestuous against them still however they were unwilling to put the fate of the lot into execution and they cried says the account unto the lord saying we beseech thee o lord let us not perish for this mans life and lay not upon us innocent blood for thou o lord hast done as it pleased thee meaning thereby that they did not presume to judge jonah guilty since that he might be innocent but that they considered the lot that had fallen upon him as a decree of god or as it pleased god the address of this prayer shows that the gentiles worshipped one supreme being and that they were not idolaters as the jews represented them to be but the storm still continuing and the danger encreasing they put the fate of the lot into execution and cast jonah in the sea where according to the story a great fish swallowed him up whole and alive we have now to consider jonah securely housed from the storm in the fishs belly here we are told that he prayed but the prayer is a madeup prayer taken from various parts of the psalms without connection or consistency and adapted to the distress but not at all to the condition that jonah was in it is such a prayer as a gentile who might know something of the psalms could copy out for him this circumstance alone were there no other is sufficient to indicate that the whole is a madeup story the prayer however is supposed to have answered the purpose and the story goes on takingoff at the same time the cant language of a bibleprophet saying the lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out jonah upon dry land jonah then received a second mission to nineveh with which he sets out and we have now to consider him as a preacher the distress he is represented to have suffered the remembrance of his own disobedience as the cause of it and the miraculous escape he is supposed to have had were sufficient one would conceive to have impressed him with sympathy and benevolence in the execution of his mission but instead of this he enters the city with denunciation and malediction in his mouth crying yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown we have now to consider this supposed missionary in the last act of his mission and here it is that the malevolent spirit of a bibleprophet or of a predicting priest appears in all that blackness of character that men ascribe to the being they call the devil having published his predictions he withdrew says the story to the east side of the city but for what not to contemplate in retirement the mercy of his creator to himself or to others but to wait with malignant impatience the destruction of nineveh it came to pass however as the story relates that the ninevites reformed and that god according to the bible phrase repented him of the evil he had said he would do unto them and did it not this saith the first verse of the last chapter displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry his obdurate heart would rather that all nineveh should be destroyed and every soul young and old perish in its ruins than that his prediction should not be fulfilled to expose the character of a prophet still more a gourd is made to grow up in the night that promises him an agreeable shelter from the heat of the sun in the place to which he is retired and the next morning it dies here the rage of the prophet becomes excessive and he is ready to destroy himself it is better said he for me to die than to live this brings on a supposed expostulation between the almighty and the prophet in which the former says doest thou well to be angry for the gourd and jonah said i do well to be angry even unto death then said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for which thou hast not laboured neither madest it to grow which came up in a night and perished in a night and should not i spare nineveh that great city in which are more than threescore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left here is both the winding up of the satire and the moral of the fable as a satire it strikes against the character of all the bibleprophets and against all the indiscriminate judgements upon men women and children with which this lying book the bible is crowded such as noahs flood the destruction of the cities of sodom and gomorrah the extirpation of the canaanites even to suckling infants and women with child because the same reflection that there are more than threescore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left meaning young children applies to all their cases it satirizes also the supposed partiality of the creator for one nation more than for another as a moral it preaches against the malevolent spirit of prediction for as certainly as a man predicts ill he becomes inclined to wish it the pride of having his judgment right hardens his heart till at last he beholds with satisfaction or sees with disappointment the accomplishment or the failure of his predictions this book ends with the same kind of strong and welldirected point against prophets prophecies and indiscriminate judgements as the chapter that benjamin franklin made for the bible about abraham and the stranger ends against the intolerant spirit of religious persecutions thus much for the book jonah the story of abraham and the fireworshipper ascribed to franklin is from saadi see my sacred anthology p paine has often been called a mere scoffer but he seems to have been among the first to treat with dignity the book of jonah so especially liable to the ridicule of superficial readers and discern in it the highest conception of deity known to the old testament editor of the poetical parts of the bible that are called prophecies i have spoken in the former part of the age of reason and already in this where i have said that the word for prophet is the bibleword for poet and that the flights and metaphors of those poets many of which have become obscure by the lapse of time and the change of circumstances have been ridiculously erected into things called prophecies and applied to purposes the writers never thought of when a priest quotes any of those passages he unriddles it agreeably to his own views and imposes that explanation upon his congregation as the meaning of the writer the whore of babylon has been the common whore of all the priests and each has accused the other of keeping the strumpet so well do they agree in their explanations there now remain only a few books which they call books of the lesser prophets and as i have already shown that the greater are impostors it would be cowardice to disturb the repose of the little ones let them sleep then in the arms of their nurses the priests and both be forgotten together i have now gone through the bible as a man would go through a wood with an axe on his shoulder and fell trees here they lie and the priests if they can may replant them they may perhaps stick them in the ground but they will never make them grow i pass on to the books of the new testament chapter ii the new testament the new testament they tell us is founded upon the prophecies of the old if so it must follow the fate of its foundation as it is nothing extraordinary that a woman should be with child before she was married and that the son she might bring forth should be executed even unjustly i see no reason for not believing that such a woman as mary and such a man as joseph and jesus existed their mere existence is a matter of indifference about which there is no ground either to believe or to disbelieve and which comes under the common head of it may be so and what then the probability however is that there were such persons or at least such as resembled them in part of the circumstances because almost all romantic stories have been suggested by some actual circumstance as the adventures of robinson crusoe not a word of which is true were suggested by the case of alexander selkirk it is not then the existence or the nonexistence of the persons that i trouble myself about it is the fable of jesus christ as told in the new testament and the wild and visionary doctrine raised thereon against which i contend the story taking it as it is told is blasphemously obscene it gives an account of a young woman engaged to be married and while under this engagement she is to speak plain language debauched by a ghost under the impious pretence luke i that the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee notwithstanding which joseph afterwards marries her cohabits with her as his wife and in his turn rivals the ghost this is putting the story into intelligible language and when told in this manner there is not a priest but must be ashamed to own it mary the supposed virgin mother of jesus had several other children sons and daughters see matt xiii author obscenity in matters of faith however wrapped up is always a token of fable and imposture for it is necessary to our serious belief in god that we do not connect it with stories that run as this does into ludicrous interpretations this story is upon the face of it the same kind of story as that of jupiter and leda or jupiter and europa or any of the amorous adventures of jupiter and shews as is already stated in the former part of the age of reason that the christian faith is built upon the heathen mythology as the historical parts of the new testament so far as concerns jesus christ are confined to a very short space of time less than two years and all within the same country and nearly to the same spot the discordance of time place and circumstance which detects the fallacy of the books of the old testament and proves them to be impositions cannot be expected to be found here in the same abundance the new testament compared with the old is like a farce of one act in which there is not room for very numerous violations of the unities there are however some glaring contradictions which exclusive of the fallacy of the pretended prophecies are sufficient to show the story of jesus christ to be false i lay it down as a position which cannot be controverted first that the agreement of all the parts of a story does not prove that story to be true because the parts may agree and the whole may be false secondly that the disagreement of the parts of a story proves the whole cannot be true the agreement does not prove truth but the disagreement proves falsehood positively the history of jesus christ is contained in the four books ascribed to matthew mark luke and john the first chapter of matthew begins with giving a genealogy of jesus christ and in the third chapter of luke there is also given a genealogy of jesus christ did these two agree it would not prove the genealogy to be true because it might nevertheless be a fabrication but as they contradict each other in every particular it proves falsehood absolutely if matthew speaks truth luke speaks falsehood and if luke speaks truth matthew speaks falsehood and as there is no authority for believing one more than the other there is no authority for believing either and if they cannot be believed even in the very first thing they say and set out to prove they are not entitled to be believed in any thing they say afterwards truth is an uniform thing and as to inspiration and revelation were we to admit it it is impossible to suppose it can be contradictory either then the men called apostles were imposters or the books ascribed to them have been written by other persons and fathered upon them as is the case in the old testament the book of matthew gives i a genealogy by name from david up through joseph the husband of mary to christ and makes there to be twent eight generations the book of luke gives also a genealogy by name from christ through joseph the husband of mary down to david and makes there to be fortythree generations besides which there is only the two names of david and joseph that are alike in the two lists i here insert both genealogical lists and for the sake of perspicuity and comparison have placed them both in the same direction that is from joseph down to david genealogy according to genealogy according to matthew luke christ christ joseph joseph jacob heli matthan matthat eleazer levi eliud melchl achim janna sadoc joseph azor mattathias eliakim amos abiud naum zorobabel esli salathiel nagge jechonias maath josias mattathias amon semei manasses joseph ezekias juda achaz joanna joatham rhesa ozias zorobabel joram salathiel josaphat neri asa melchi abia addi roboam cosam solomon elmodam david er jose eliezer jorim matthat levi simeon juda joseph jonan eliakim melea menan mattatha nathan david note from the birth of david to the birth of christ is upwards of years and as the lifetime of christ is not included there are but full generations to find therefore the average age of each person mentioned in the list at the time his first son was born it is only necessary to divide by which gives years for each person as the lifetime of man was then but of the same extent it is now it is an absurdity to suppose that following generations should all be old bachelors before they married and the more so when we are told that solomon the next in succession to david had a house full of wives and mistresses before he was twentyone years of age so far from this genealogy being a solemn truth it is not even a reasonable lie the list of luke gives about twentysix years for the average age and this is too much author now if these men matthew and luke set out with a falsehood between them as these two accounts show they do in the very commencement of their history of jesus christ and of who and of what he was what authority as i have before asked is there left for believing the strange things they tell us afterwards if they cannot be believed in their account of his natural genealogy how are we to believe them when they tell us he was the son of god begotten by a ghost and that an angel announced this in secret to his mother if they lied in one genealogy why are we to believe them in the other if his natural genealogy be manufactured which it certainly is why are we not to suppose that his celestial genealogy is manufactured also and that the whole is fabulous can any man of serious reflection hazard his future happiness upon the belief of a story naturally impossible repugnant to every idea of decency and related by persons already detected of falsehood is it not more safe that we stop ourselves at the plain pure and unmixed belief of one god which is deism than that we commit ourselves on an ocean of improbable irrational indecent and contradictory tales the first question however upon the books of the new testament as upon those of the old is are they genuine were they written by the persons to whom they are ascribed for it is upon this ground only that the strange things related therein have been credited upon this point there is no direct proof for or against and all that this state of a case proves is doubtfulness and doubtfulness is the opposite of belief the state therefore that the books are in proves against themselves as far as this kind of proof can go but exclusive of this the presumption is that the books called the evangelists and ascribed to matthew mark luke and john were not written by matthew mark luke and john and that they are impositions the disordered state of the history in these four books the silence of one book upon matters related in the other and the disagreement that is to be found among them implies that they are the productions of some unconnected individuals many years after the things they pretend to relate each of whom made his own legend and not the writings of men living intimately together as the men called apostles are supposed to have done in fine that they have been manufactured as the books of the old testament have been by other persons than those whose names they bear the story of the angel announcing what the church calls the immaculate conception is not so much as mentioned in the books ascribed to mark and john and is differently related in matthew and luke the former says the angel appeared to joseph the latter says it was to mary but either joseph or mary was the worst evidence that could have been thought of for it was others that should have testified for them and not they for themselves were any girl that is now with child to say and even to swear it that she was gotten with child by a ghost and that an angel told her so would she be believed certainly she would not why then are we to believe the same thing of another girl whom we never saw told by nobody knows who nor when nor where how strange and inconsistent is it that the same circumstance that would weaken the belief even of a probable story should be given as a motive for believing this one that has upon the face of it every token of absolute impossibility and imposture the story of herod destroying all the children under two years old belongs altogether to the book of matthew not one of the rest mentions anything about it had such a circumstance been true the universality of it must have made it known to all the writers and the thing would have been too striking to have been omitted by any this writer tell us that jesus escaped this slaughter because joseph and mary were warned by an angel to flee with him into egypt but he forgot to make provision for john the baptist who was then under two years of age john however who staid behind fared as well as jesus who fled and therefore the story circumstantially belies itself not any two of these writers agree in reciting exactly in the same words the written inscription short as it is which they tell us was put over christ when he was crucified and besides this mark says he was crucified at the third hour nine in the morning and john says it was the sixth hour twelve at noon according to john xix the sentence was not passed till about the sixth hour noon and consequently the execution could not be till the afternoon but mark xv says expressly that he was crucified at the third hour nine in the moming author the inscription is thus stated in those books matthew this is jesus the king of the jews mark the king of the jews luke this is the king of the jews john jesus of nazareth the king of the jews we may infer from these circumstances trivial as they are that those writers whoever they were and in whatever time they lived were not present at the scene the only one of the men called apostles who appears to have been near to the spot was peter and when he was accused of being one of jesuss followers it is said matthew xxvi then peter began to curse and to swear saying i know not the man yet we are now called to believe the same peter convicted by their own account of perjury for what reason or on what authority should we do this the accounts that are given of the circumstances that they tell us attended the crucifixion are differently related in those four books the book ascribed to matthew says there was darkness over all the land from the sixth hour unto the ninth hour that the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom that there was an earthquake that the rocks rent that the graves opened that the bodies of many of the saints that slept arose and came out of their graves after the resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many such is the account which this dashing writer of the book of matthew gives but in which he is not supported by the writers of the other books the writer of the book ascribed to mark in detailing the circumstances of the crucifixion makes no mention of any earthquake nor of the rocks rending nor of the graves opening nor of the dead men walking out the writer of the book of luke is silent also upon the same points and as to the writer of the book of john though he details all the circumstances of the crucifixion down to the burial of christ he says nothing about either the darkness the veil of the temple the earthquake the rocks the graves nor the dead men now if it had been true that these things had happened and if the writers of these books had lived at the time they did happen and had been the persons they are said to be namely the four men called apostles matthew mark luke and john it was not possible for them as true historians even without the aid of inspiration not to have recorded them the things supposing them to have been facts were of too much notoriety not to have been known and of too much importance not to have been told all these supposed apostles must have been witnesses of the earthquake if there had been any for it was not possible for them to have been absent from it the opening of the graves and resurrection of the dead men and their walking about the city is of still greater importance than the earthquake an earthquake is always possible and natural and proves nothing but this opening of the graves is supernatural and directly in point to their doctrine their cause and their apostleship had it been true it would have filled up whole chapters of those books and been the chosen theme and general chorus of all the writers but instead of this little and trivial things and mere prattling conversation of he said this and she said that are often tediously detailed while this most important of all had it been true is passed off in a slovenly manner by a single dash of the pen and that by one writer only and not so much as hinted at by the rest it is an easy thing to tell a lie but it is difficult to support the lie after it is told the writer of the book of matthew should have told us who the saints were that came to life again and went into the city and what became of them afterwards and who it was that saw them for he is not hardy enough to say that he saw them himself whether they came out naked and all in natural buff hesaints and shesaints or whether they came full dressed and where they got their dresses whether they went to their former habitations and reclaimed their wives their husbands and their property and how they were received whether they entered ejectments for the recovery of their possessions or brought actions of crim con against the rival interlopers whether they remained on earth and followed their former occupation of preaching or working or whether they died again or went back to their graves alive and buried themselves strange indeed that an army of saints should retum to life and nobody know who they were nor who it was that saw them and that not a word more should be said upon the subject nor these saints have any thing to tell us had it been the prophets who as we are told had formerly prophesied of these things they must have had a great deal to say they could have told us everything and we should have had posthumous prophecies with notes and commentaries upon the first a little better at least than we have now had it been moses and aaron and joshua and samuel and david not an unconverted jew had remained in all jerusalem had it been john the baptist and the saints of the times then present everybody would have known them and they would have outpreached and outfamed all the other apostles but instead of this these saints are made to pop up like jonahs gourd in the night for no purpose at all but to wither in the morning thus much for this part of the story the tale of the resurrection follows that of the crucifixion and in this as well as in that the writers whoever they were disagree so much as to make it evident that none of them were there the book of matthew states that when christ was put in the sepulchre the jews applied to pilate for a watch or a guard to be placed over the septilchre to prevent the body being stolen by the disciples and that in consequence of this request the sepulchre was made sure sealing the stone that covered the mouth and setting a watch but the other books say nothing about this application nor about the sealing nor the guard nor the watch and according to their accounts there were none matthew however follows up this part of the story of the guard or the watch with a second part that i shall notice in the conclusion as it serves to detect the fallacy of those books the book of matthew continues its account and says xxviii that at the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre mark says it was sunrising and john says it was dark luke says it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that came to the sepulchre and john states that mary magdalene came alone so well do they agree about their first evidence they all however appear to have known most about mary magdalene she was a woman of large acquaintance and it was not an ill conjecture that she might be upon the stroll the bishop of llandaff in his famous apology censured paine severely for this insinuation against mary magdalene but the censure really falls on our english version which by a chapterheading luke vii has unwarrantably identified her as the sinful woman who anointed jesus and irrevocably branded her editor the book of matthew goes on to say ver and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it but the other books say nothing about any earthquake nor about the angel rolling back the stone and sitting upon it and according to their account there was no angel sitting there mark says the angel mark says a young man and luke two men editor was within the sepulchre sitting on the right side luke says there were two and they were both standing up and john says they were both sitting down one at the head and the other at the feet matthew says that the angel that was sitting upon the stone on the outside of the sepulchre told the two marys that christ was risen and that the women went away quickly mark says that the women upon seeing the stone rolled away and wondering at it went into the sepulchre and that it was the angel that was sitting within on the right side that told them so luke says it was the two angels that were standing up and john says it was jesus christ himself that told it to mary magdalene and that she did not go into the sepulchre but only stooped down and looked in now if the writers of these four books had gone into a court of justice to prove an alibi for it is of the nature of an alibi that is here attempted to be proved namely the absence of a dead body by supernatural means and had they given their evidence in the same contradictory manner as it is here given they would have been in danger of having their ears cropt for perjury and would have justly deserved it yet this is the evidence and these are the books that have been imposed upon the world as being given by divine inspiration and as the unchangeable word of god the writer of the book of matthew after giving this account relates a story that is not to be found in any of the other books and which is the same i have just before alluded to now says he that is after the conversation the women had had with the angel sitting upon the stone behold some of the watch meaning the watch that he had said had been placed over the sepulchre came into the city and shawed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governors ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying that his disciples stole him away is commonly reported among the jews until this day the expression until this day is an evidence that the book ascribed to matthew was not written by matthew and that it has been manufactured long after the times and things of which it pretends to treat for the expression implies a great length of intervening time it would be inconsistent in us to speak in this manner of any thing happening in our own time to give therefore intelligible meaning to the expression we must suppose a lapse of some generations at least for this manner of speaking carries the mind back to ancient time the absurdity also of the story is worth noticing for it shows the writer of the book of matthew to have been an exceeding weak and foolish man he tells a story that contradicts itself in point of possibility for though the guard if there were any might be made to say that the body was taken away while they were asleep and to give that as a reason for their not having prevented it that same sleep must also have prevented their knowing how and by whom it was done and yet they are made to say that it was the disciples who did it were a man to tender his evidence of something that he should say was done and of the manner of doing it and of the person who did it while he was asleep and could know nothing of the matter such evidence could not be received it will do well enough for testament evidence but not for any thing where truth is concerned i come now to that part of the evidence in those books that respects the pretended appearance of christ after this pretended resurrection the writer of the book of matthew relates that the angel that was sitting on the stone at the mouth of the sepulchre said to the two marys xxviii behold christ is gone before you into galilee there ye shall see him lo i have told you and the same writer at the next two verses makes christ himself to speak to the same purpose to these women immediately after the angel had told it to them and that they ran quickly to tell it to the disciples and it is said ver then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshipped him but the writer of the book of john tells us a story very different to this for he says xx then the same day at evening being the first day of the week that is the same day that christ is said to have risen when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst of them according to matthew the eleven were marching to galilee to meet jesus in a mountain by his own appointment at the very time when according to john they were assembled in another place and that not by appointment but in secret for fear of the jews the writer of the book of luke xxiv contradicts that of matthew more pointedly than john does for he says expressly that the meeting was in jerusalem the evening of the same day that he christ rose and that the eleven were there now it is not possible unless we admit these supposed disciples the right of wilful lying that the writers of these books could be any of the eleven persons called disciples for if according to matthew the eleven went into galilee to meet jesus in a mountain by his own appointment on the same day that he is said to have risen luke and john must have been two of that eleven yet the writer of luke says expressly and john implies as much that the meeting was that same day in a house in jerusalem and on the other hand if according to luke and john the eleven were assembled in a house in jerusalem matthew must have been one of that eleven yet matthew says the meeting was in a mountain in galilee and consequently the evidence given in those books destroy each other the writer of the book of mark says nothing about any meeting in galilee but he says xvi that christ after his resurrection appeared in another form to two of them as they walked into the country and that these two told it to the residue who would not believe them this belongs to the late addition to mark which originally ended with xvi editor luke also tells a story in which he keeps christ employed the whole of the day of this pretended resurrection until the evening and which totally invalidates the account of going to the mountain in galilee he says that two of them without saying which two went that same day to a village called emmaus three score furlongs seven miles and a half from jerusalem and that christ in disguise went with them and stayed with them unto the evening and supped with them and then vanished out of their sight and reappeared that same evening at the meeting of the eleven in jerusalem this is the contradictory manner in which the evidence of this pretended reappearance of christ is stated the only point in which the writers agree is the skulking privacy of that reappearance for whether it was in the recess of a mountain in galilee or in a shutup house in jerusalem it was still skulking to what cause then are we to assign this skulking on the one hand it is directly repugnant to the supposed or pretended end that of convincing the world that christ was risen and on the other hand to have asserted the publicity of it would have exposed the writers of those books to public detection and therefore they have been under the necessity of making it a private affair as to the account of christ being seen by more than five hundred at once it is paul only who says it and not the five hundred who say it for themselves it is therefore the testimony of but one man and that too of a man who did not according to the same account believe a word of the matter himself at the time it is said to have happened his evidence supposing him to have been the writer of corinthians xv where this account is given is like that of a man who comes into a court of justice to swear that what he had sworn before was false a man may often see reason and he has too always the right of changing his opinion but this liberty does not extend to matters of fact i now come to the last scene that of the ascension into heaven here all fear of the jews and of every thing else must necessarily have been out of the question it was that which if true was to seal the whole and upon which the reality of the future mission of the disciples was to rest for proof words whether declarations or promises that passed in private either in the recess of a mountain in galilee or in a shutup house in jerusalem even supposing them to have been spoken could not be evidence in public it was therefore necessary that this last scene should preclude the possibility of denial and dispute and that it should be as i have stated in the former part of the age of reason as public and as visible as the sun at noonday at least it ought to have been as public as the crucifixion is reported to have been but to come to the point in the first place the writer of the book of matthew does not say a syllable about it neither does the writer of the book of john this being the case is it possible to suppose that those writers who affect to be even minute in other matters would have been silent upon this had it been true the writer of the book of mark passes it off in a careless slovenly manner with a single dash of the pen as if he was tired of romancing or ashamed of the story so also does the writer of luke and even between these two there is not an apparent agreement as to the place where this final parting is said to have been the last nine verses of mark being ungenuine the story of the ascension rests exclusively on the words in luke xxiv was carried up into heavenwords omitted by several ancient authorities editor the book of mark says that christ appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat alluding to the meeting of the eleven at jerusalem he then states the conversation that he says passed at that meeting and immediately after says as a schoolboy would finish a dull story so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god but the writer of luke says that the ascension was from bethany that he christ led them out as far as bethany and was fiarted from them there and was carried up into heaven so also was mahomet and as to moses the apostle jude says ver that michael and the devil disputed about his body while we believe such fables as these or either of them we believe unworthily of the almighty i have now gone through the examination of the four books ascribed to matthew mark luke and john and when it is considered that the whole space of time from the crucifixion to what is called the ascension is but a few days apparently not more than three or four and that all the circumstances are reported to have happened nearly about the same spot jerusalem it is i believe impossible to find in any story upon record so many and such glaring absurdities contradictions and falsehoods as are in those books they are more numerous and striking than i had any expectation of finding when i began this examination and far more so than i had any idea of when i wrote the former part of the age of reason i had then neither bible nor testament to refer to nor could i procure any my own situation even as to existence was becoming every day more precarious and as i was willing to leave something behind me upon the subject i was obliged to be quick and concise the quotations i then made were from memory only but they are correct and the opinions i have advanced in that work are the effect of the most clear and longestablished conviction that the bible and the testament are impositions upon the world that the fall of man the account of jesus christ being the son of god and of his dying to appease the wrath of god and of salvation by that strange means are all fabulous inventions dishonourable to the wisdom and power of the almighty that the only true religion is deism by which i then meant and now mean the belief of one god and an imitation of his moral character or the practice of what are called moral virtues and that it was upon this only so far as religion is concerned that i rested all my hopes of happiness hereafter so say i now and so help me god but to retum to the subject though it is impossible at this distance of time to ascertain as a fact who were the writers of those four books and this alone is sufficient to hold them in doubt and where we doubt we do not believe it is not difficult to ascertain negatively that they were not written by the persons to whom they are ascribed the contradictions in those books demonstrate two things first that the writers cannot have been eyewitnesses and earwitnesses of the matters they relate or they would have related them without those contradictions and consequently that the books have not been written by the persons called apostles who are supposed to have been witnesses of this kind secondly that the writers whoever they were have not acted in concerted imposition but each writer separately and individually for himself and without the knowledge of the other the same evidence that applies to prove the one applies equally to prove both cases that is that the books were not written by the men called apostles and also that they are not a concerted imposition as to inspiration it is altogether out of the question we may as well attempt to unite truth and falsehood as inspiration and contradiction if four men are eyewitnesses and earwitnesses to a scene they will without any concert between them agree as to time and place when and where that scene happened their individual knowledge of the thing each one knowing it for himself renders concert totally unnecessary the one will not say it was in a mountain in the country and the other at a house in town the one will not say it was at sunrise and the other that it was dark for in whatever place it was and whatever time it was they know it equally alike and on the other hand if four men concert a story they will make their separate relations of that story agree and corroborate with each other to support the whole that concert supplies the want of fact in the one case as the knowledge of the fact supersedes in the other case the necessity of a concert the same contradictions therefore that prove there has been no concert prove also that the reporters had no knowledge of the fact or rather of that which they relate as a fact and detect also the falsehood of their reports those books therefore have neither been written by the men called apostles nor by imposters in concert how then have they been written i am not one of those who are fond of believing there is much of that which is called wilful lying or lying originally except in the case of men setting up to be prophets as in the old testament for prophesying is lying professionally in almost all other cases it is not difficult to discover the progress by which even simple supposition with the aid of credulity will in time grow into a lie and at last be told as a fact and whenever we can find a charitable reason for a thing of this kind we ought not to indulge a severe one the story of jesus christ appearing after he was dead is the story of an apparition such as timid imaginations can always create in vision and credulity believe stories of this kind had been told of the assassination of julius caesar not many years before and they generally have their origin in violent deaths or in execution of innocent persons in cases of this kind compassion lends its aid and benevolently stretches the story it goes on a little and a little farther till it becomes a most certain truth once start a ghost and credulity fills up the history of its life and assigns the cause of its appearance one tells it one way another another way till there are as many stories about the ghost and about the proprietor of the ghost as there are about jesus christ in these four books the story of the appearance of jesus christ is told with that strange mixture of the natural and impossible that distinguishes legendary tale from fact he is represented as suddenly coming in and going out when the doors are shut and of vanishing out of sight and appearing again as one would conceive of an unsubstantial vision then again he is hungry sits down to meat and eats his supper but as those who tell stories of this kind never provide for all the cases so it is here they have told us that when he arose he left his graveclothes behind him but they have forgotten to provide other clothes for him to appear in afterwards or to tell us what be did with them when he ascended whether he stripped all off or went up clothes and all in the case of elijah they have been careful enough to make him throw down his mantle how it happened not to be burnt in the chariot of fire they also have not told us but as imagination supplies all deficiencies of this kind we may suppose if we please that it was made of salamanders wool those who are not much acquainted with ecclesiastical history may suppose that the book called the new testament has existed ever since the time of jesus christ as they suppose that the books ascribed to moses have existed ever since the time of moses but the fact is historically otherwise there was no such book as the new testament till more than three hundred years after the time that christ is said to have lived at what time the books ascribed to matthew mark luke and john began to appear is altogether a matter of uncertainty there is not the least shadow of evidence of who the persons were that wrote them nor at what time they were written and they might as well have been called by the names of any of the other supposed apostles as by the names they are now called the originals are not in the possession of any christian church existing any more than the two tables of stone written on they pretend by the finger of god upon mount sinai and given to moses are in the possession of the jews and even if they were there is no possibility of proving the handwriting in either case at the time those four books were written there was no printing and consequently there could be no publication otherwise than by written copies which any man might make or alter at pleasure and call them originals can we suppose it is consistent with the wisdom of the almighty to commit himself and his will to man upon such precarious means as these or that it is consistent we should pin our faith upon such uncertainties we cannot make nor alter nor even imitate so much as one blade of grass that he has made and yet we can make or alter words of god as easily as words of man the former part of the age of reason has not been published two years and there is already an expression in it that is not mine the expression is the book of luke was carried by a majority of one voice only it may be true but it is not i that have said it some person who might know of that circumstance has added it in a note at the bottom of the page of some of the editions printed either in england or in america and the printers after that have erected it into the body of the work and made me the author of it if this has happened within such a short space of time notwithstanding the aid of printing which prevents the alteration of copies individually what may not have happened in a much greater length of time when there was no printing and when any man who could write could make a written copy and call it an original by matthew mark luke or john author the spurious addition to paines work alluded to in his footnote drew on him a severe criticism from dr priestley letters to a philosophical unbeliever p yet it seems to have been priestley himself who in his quotation first incorporated into paines text the footnote added by the editor of the american edition the american added vide moshiems sic ecc history which priestley omits in a modern american edition i notice four verbal alterations introduced into the above footnote editor about three hundred and fifty years after the time that christ is said to have lived several writings of the kind i am speaking of were scattered in the hands of divers individuals and as the church had begun to form itself into an hierarchy or church government with temporal powers it set itself about collecting them into a code as we now see them called the new testament they decided by vote as i have before said in the former part of the age of reason which of those writings out of the collection they had made should be the word of god and which should not the robbins of the jews had decided by vote upon the books of the bible before as the object of the church as is the case in all national establishments of churches was power and revenue and terror the means it used it is consistent to suppose that the most miraculous and wonderful of the writings they had collected stood the best chance of being voted and as to the authenticity of the books the vote stands in the place of it for it can be traced no higher disputes however ran high among the people then calling themselves christians not only as to points of doctrine but as to the authenticity of the books in the contest between the person called st augustine and fauste about the year the latter says the books called the evangelists have been composed long after the times of the apostles by some obscure men who fearing that the world would not give credit to their relation of matters of which they could not be informed have published them under the names of the apostles and which are so full of sottishness and discordant relations that there is neither agreement nor connection between them and in another place addressing himself to the advocates of those books as being the word of god he says it is thus that your predecessors have inserted in the scriptures of our lord many things which though they carry his name agree not with his doctrine this is not surprising since that we have often proved that these things have not been written by himself nor by his apostles but that for the greatest part they are founded upon tales upon vague reports and put together by i know not what half jews with but little agreement between them and which they have nevertheless published under the name of the apostles of our lord and have thus attributed to them their own errers and their lies i have taken these two extracts from boulangers life of paul written in french boulanger has quoted them from the writings of augustine against fauste to which he refers author this bishop faustus is usualy styled the manichaeum augustine having entitled his book contra fsustum manichaeum libri xxxiii in which nearly the whole of faustus very able work is quoted editor the reader will see by those extracts that the authenticity of the books of the new testament was denied and the books treated as tales forgeries and lies at the time they were voted to be the word of god but the interest of the church with the assistance of the faggot bore down the opposition and at last suppressed all investigation miracles followed upon miracles if we will believe them and men were taught to say they believed whether they believed or not but by way of throwing in a thought the french revolution has excommunicated the church from the power of working miracles she has not been able with the assistance of all her saints to work one miracle since the revolution began and as she never stood in greater need than now we may without the aid of divination conclude that all her former miracles are tricks and lies boulanger in his life of paul has collected from the ecclesiastical histories and the writings of the fathers as they are called several matters which show the opinions that prevailed among the different sects of christians at the time the testament as we now see it was voted to be the word of god the following extracts are from the second chapter of that work the marcionists a christian sect asserted that the evangelists were filled with falsities the manichaeans who formed a very numerous sect at the commencement of christianity rejected as false all the new testament and showed other writings quite different that they gave for authentic the cerinthians like the marcionists admitted not the acts of the apostles the encratites and the sevenians adopted neither the acts nor the epistles of paul chrysostom in a bomily which he made upon the acts of the apostles says that in his time about the year many people knew nothing either of the author or of the book st irene who lived before that time reports that the valentinians like several other sects of the christians accused the scriptures of being filled with imperfections errors and contradictions the ebionites or nazarenes who were the first christians rejected all the epistles of paul and regarded him as an impostor they report among other things that he was originally a pagan that he came to jerusalem where he lived some time and that having a mind to marry the daughter of the high priest he had himself been circumcised but that not being able to obtain her he quarrelled with the jews and wrote against circumcision and against the observation of the sabbath and against all the legal ordinances author much abridged from the exam crit de la vie de st paul by na boulanger editor when we consider the lapse of more than three hundred years intervening between the time that christ is said to have lived and the time the new testament was formed into a book we must see even without the assistance of historical evidence the exceeding uncertainty there is of its authenticity the authenticity of the book of homer so far as regards the authorship is much better established than that of the new testament though homer is a thousand years the most ancient it was only an exceeding good poet that could have written the book of homer and therefore few men only could have attempted it and a man capable of doing it would not have thrown away his own fame by giving it to another in like manner there were but few that could have composed euclids elements because none but an exceeding good geometrician could have been the author of that work but with respect to the books of the new testament particularly such parts as tell us of the resurrection and ascension of christ any person who could tell a story of an apparition or of a mans walking could have made such books for the story is most wretchedly told the chance therefore of forgery in the testament is millions to one greater than in the case of homer or euclid of the numerous priests or parsons of the present day bishops and all every one of them can make a sermon or translate a scrap of latin especially if it has been translated a thousand times before but is there any amongst them that can write poetry like homer or science like euclid the sum total of a parsons learning with very few exceptions is a b ab and hic haec hoc and their knowledge of science is three times one is three and this is more than sufficient to have enabled them had they lived at the time to have written all the books of the new testament as the opportunities of forgery were greater so also was the inducement a man could gain no advantage by writing under the name of homer or euclid if he could write equal to them it would be better that he wrote under his own name if inferior he could not succeed pride would prevent the former and impossibility the latter but with respect to such books as compose the new testament all the inducements were on the side of forgery the best imagined history that could have been made at the distance of two or three hundred years after the time could not have passed for an original under the name of the real writer the only chance of success lay in forgery for the church wanted pretence for its new doctrine and truth and talents were out of the question but as it is not uncommon as before observed to relate stories of persons walking after they are dead and of ghosts and apparitions of such as have fallen by some violent or extraordinary means and as the people of that day were in the habit of believing such things and of the appearance of angels and also of devils and of their getting into peoples insides and skaking them like a fit of an ague and of their being cast out again as if by an emetic mary magdalene the book of mark tells us had brought up or been brought to bed of seven devils it was nothing extraordinary that some story of this kind should get abroad of the person called jesus christ and become afterwards the foundation of the four books ascribed to matthew mark luke and john each writer told a tale as he heard it or thereabouts and gave to his book the name of the saint or the apostle whom tradition had given as the eyewitness it is only upon this ground that the contradictions in those books can be acounted for and if this be not the case they are downright impositions lies and forgeries without even the apology of credulity that they have been written by a sort of half jews as the foregoing quotations mention is discernible enough the frequent references made to that chief assassin and impostor moses and to the men called prophets establishes this point and on the other hand the church has complimented the fraud by admitting the bible and the testament to reply to each other between the christianjew and the christiangentile the thing called a prophecy and the thing prophesied of the type and the thing typified the sign and the thing signified have been industriously rummaged up and fitted together like old locks and picklock keys the story foolishly enough told of eve and the serpent and naturally enough as to the enmity between men and serpents for the serpent always bites about the heel because it cannot reach higher and the man always knocks the serpent about the head as the most effectual way to prevent its biting it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel gen iii author this foolish story i say has been made into a prophecy a type and a promise to begin with and the lying imposition of isaiah to ahaz that a virgin shall conceive and bear a son as a sign that ahaz should conquer when the event was that he was defeated as already noticed in the observations on the book of isaiah has been perverted and made to serve as a winder up jonah and the whale are also made into a sign and type jonah is jesus and the whale is the grave for it is said and they have made christ to say it of himself matt xii for as jonah was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nighis in the heart of the earth but it happens aukwardly enough that christ according to their own account was but one day and two nights in the grave about hours instead of that is the friday night the saturday and the saturday night for they say he was up on the sunday morning by sunrise or before but as this fits quite as well as the bite and the kick in genesis or the virgin and her son in isaiah it will pass in the lump of orthodox things thus much for the historical part of the testament and its evidences epistles of paul the epistles ascribed to paul being fourteen in number almost fill up the remaining part of the testament whether those epistles were written by the person to whom they are ascribed is a matter of no great importance since that the writer whoever he was attempts to prove his doctrine by argument he does not pretend to have been witness to any of the scenes told of the resurrection and the ascension and he declares that he had not believed them the story of his being struck to the ground as he was journeying to damascus has nothing in it miraculous or extraordinary he escaped with life and that is more than many others have done who have been struck with lightning and that he should lose his sight for three days and be unable to eat or drink during that time is nothing more than is common in such conditions his companions that were with him appear not to have suffered in the same manner for they were well enough to lead him the remainder of the journey neither did they pretend to have seen any vision the character of the person called paul according to the accounts given of him has in it a great deal of violence and fanaticism he had persecuted with as much heat as he preached afterwards the stroke he had received had changed his thinking without altering his constitution and either as a jew or a christian he was the same zealot such men are never good moral evidences of any doctrine they preach they are always in extremes as well of action as of belief the doctrine he sets out to prove by argument is the resurrection of the same body and he advances this as an evidence of immortality but so much will men differ in their manner of thinking and in the conclusions they draw from the same premises that this doctrine of the resurrection of the same body so far from being an evidence of immortality appears to me to be an evidence againt it for if i have already died in this body and am raised again in the same body in which i have died it is presumptive evidence that i shall die again that resurrection no more secures me against the repetition of dying than an aguefit when past secures me against another to believe therefore in immortality i must have a more elevated idea than is contained in the gloomy doctrine of the resurrection besides as a matter of choice as well as of hope i had rather have a better body and a more convenient form than the present every animal in the creation excels us in something the winged insects without mentioning doves or eagles can pass over more space with greater ease in a few minutes than man can in an hour the glide of the smallest fish in proportion to its bulk exceeds us in motion almost beyond comparison and without weariness even the sluggish snail can ascend from the bottom of a dungeon where man by the want of that ability would perish and a spider can launch itself from the top as a playful amusement the personal powers of man are so limited and his heavy frame so little constructed to extensive enjoyment that there is nothing to induce us to wish the opinion of paul to be true it is too little for the magnitude of the scene too mean for the sublimity of the subject but all other arguments apart the consciousness of existence is the only conceivable idea we can have of another life and the continuance of that consciousness is immortality the consciousness of existence or the knowing that we exist is not necessarily confined to the same form nor to the same matter even in this life we have not in all cases the same form nor in any case the same matter that composed our bodies twenty or thirty years ago and yet we are conscious of being the same persons even legs and arms which make up almost half the human frame are not necessary to the consciousness of existence these may be lost or taken away and the full consciousness of existence remain and were their place supplied by wings or other appendages we cannot conceive that it could alter our consciousness of existence in short we know not how much or rather how little of our composition it is and how exquisitely fine that little is that creates in us this consciousness of existence and all beyond that is like the pulp of a peach distinct and separate from the vegetative speck in the kernel who can say by what exceeding fine action of fine matter it is that a thought is produced in what we call the mind and yet that thought when produced as i now produce the thought i am writing is capable of becoming immortal and is the only production of man that has that capacity statues of brass and marble will perish and statues made in imitation of them are not the same statues nor the same workmanship any more than the copy of a picture is the same picture but print and reprint a thought a thousand times over and that with materials of any kind carve it in wood or engrave it on stone the thought is eternally and identically the same thought in every case it has a capacity of unimpaired existence unaffected by change of matter and is essentially distinct and of a nature different from every thing else that we know of or can conceive if then the thing produced has in itself a capacity of being immortal it is more than a token that the power that produced it which is the selfsame thing as consciousness of existence can be immortal also and that as independently of the matter it was first connected with as the thought is of the printing or writing it first appeared in the one idea is not more difficult to believe than the other and we can see that one is true that the consciousness of existence is not dependent on the same form or the same matter is demonstrated to our senses in the works of the creation as far as our senses are capable of receiving that demonstration a very numerous part of the animal creation preaches to us far better than paul the belief of a life hereafter their little life resembles an earth and a heaven a present and a future state and comprises if it may be so expressed immortality in miniature the most beautiful parts of the creation to our eye are the winged insects and they are not so originally they acquire that form and that inimitable brilliancy by progressive changes the slow and creeping caterpillar worm of to day passes in a few days to a torpid figure and a state resembling death and in the next change comes forth in all the miniature magnificence of life a splendid butterfly no resemblance of the former creature remains every thing is changed all his powers are new and life is to him another thing we cannot conceive that the consciousness of existence is not the same in this state of the animal as before why then must i believe that the resurrection of the same body is necessary to continue to me the consciousness of existence hereafter in the former part of the agee of reason i have called the creation the true and only real word of god and this instance or this text in the book of creation not only shows to us that this thing may be so but that it is so and that the belief of a future state is a rational belief founded upon facts visible in the creation for it is not more difficult to believe that we shall exist hereafter in a better state and form than at present than that a worm should become a butterfly and quit the dunghill for the atmosphere if we did not know it as a fact as to the doubtful jargon ascribed to paul in corinthians xv which makes part of the burial service of some christian sectaries it is as destitute of meaning as the tolling of a bell at the funeral it explains nothing to the understanding it illustrates nothing to the imagination but leaves the reader to find any meaning if he can all flesh says he is not the same flesh there is one flesh of men another of beasts another of fishes and another of birds and what then nothing a cook could have said as much there are also says he bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is the other and what then nothing and what is the difference nothing that he has told there is says he one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars and what then nothing except that he says that one star differlth from another star in glory instead of distance and he might as well have told us that the moon did not shine so bright as the sun all this is nothing better than the jargon of a conjuror who picks up phrases he does not understand to confound the credulous people who come to have their fortune told priests and conjurors are of the same trade sometimes paul affects to be a naturalist and to prove his system of resurrection from the principles of vegetation thou fool says he that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die to which one might reply in his own language and say thou fool paul that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die not for the grain that dies in the ground never does nor can vegetate it is only the living grains that produce the next crop but the metaphor in any point of view is no simile it is succession and not resurrection the progress of an animal from one state of being to another as from a worm to a butterfly applies to the case but this of a grain does not and shows paul to have been what he says of others a fool whether the fourteen epistles ascribed to paul were written by him or not is a matter of indifference they are either argumentative or dogmatical and as the argument is defective and the dogmatical part is merely presumptive it signifies not who wrote them and the same may be said for the remaining parts of the testament it is not upon the epistles but upon what is called the gospel contained in the four books ascribed to matthew mark luke and john and upon the pretended prophecies that the theory of the church calling itself the christian church is founded the epistles are dependant upon those and must follow their fate for if the story of jesus chiist be fabulous all reasoning founded upon it as a supposed truth must fall with it we know from history that one of the principal leaders of this church athanasius lived at the time the new testament was formed athanasius died according to the church chronology in the year author and we know also from the absurd jargon he has left us under the name of a creed the character of the men who formed the new testament and we know also from the same history that the authenticity of the books of which it is composed was denied at the time it was upon the vote of such as athanasius that the testament was decreed to be the word of god and nothing can present to us a more strange idea than that of decreeing the word of god by vote those who rest their faith upon such authority put man in the place of god and have no true foundation for future happiness credulity however is not a crime but it becomes criminal by resisting conviction it is strangling in the womb of the conscience the efforts it makes to ascertain truth we should never force belief upon ourselves in any thing i here close the subject on the old testament and the new the evidence i have produced to prove them forgeries is extracted from the books themselves and acts like a twoedge sword either way if the evidence be denied the authenticity of the scriptures is denied with it for it is scripture evidence and if the evidence be admitted the authenticity of the books is disproved the contradictory impossibilities contained in the old testament and the new put them in the case of a man who swears for and against either evidence convicts him of perjury and equally destroys reputation should the bible and the testament hereafter fall it is not that i have done it i have done no more than extracted the evidence from the confused mass of matters with which it is mixed and arranged that evidence in a point of light to be clearly seen and easily comprehended and having done this i leave the reader to judge for himself as i have judged for myself chapter iii conclusion in the former part of the age of reason i have spoken of the three frauds mystery miracle andprophecy and as i have seen nothing in any of the answers to that work that in the least affects what i have there said upon those subjects i shall not encumber this second part with additions that are not necessary i have spoken also in the same work upon what is celled revelation and have shown the absurd misapplication of that term to the books of the old testament and the new for certainly revelation is out of the question in reciting any thing of which man has been the actor or the witness that which man has done or seen needs no revelation to tell him he has done it or seen it for he knows it already nor to enable him to tell it or to write it it is ignorance or imposition to apply the term revelation in such cases yet the bible and testament are classed under this fraudulent description of being all revelation revelation then so far as the term has relation between god and man can only be applied to something which god reveals of his will to man but though the power of the almighty to make such a communication is necessarily admitted because to that power all things are possible yet the thing so revealed if any thing ever was revealed and which by the bye it is impossible to prove is revelation to the person only to whom it is made his account of it to another is not revelation and whoever puts faith in that account puts it in the man from whom the account comes and that man may have been deceived or may have dreamed it or he may be an impostor and may lie there is no possible criterion whereby to judge of the truth of what he tells for even the morality of it would be no proof of revelation in all such cases the proper answer should be when it is revealed to me i will believe it to be revelation but it is not and cannot be incumbent upon me to believe it to be revelation before neither is it proper that i should take the word of man as the word of god and put man in the place of god this is the manner in which i have spoken of revelation in the former part of the age of reason and which whilst it reverentially admits revelation as a possible thing because as before said to the almighty all things are possible it prevents the imposition of one man upon another and precludes the wicked use of pretended revelation but though speaking for myself i thus admit the possibility of revelation i totally disbelieve that the almighty ever did communicate any thing to man by any mode of speech in any language or by any kind of vision or appearance or by any means which our senses are capable of receiving otherwise than by the universal display of himself in the works of the creation and by that repugnance we feel in ourselves to bad actions and disposition to good ones a fair parallel of the then unknown aphorism of kant two things fill the soul with wonder and reverence increasing evermore as i meditate more closely upon them the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me kritik derpraktischen vernunfe kants religious utterances at the beginning of the french revolution brought on him a royal mandate of silence because he had worked out from the moral law within a principle of human equality precisely similar to that which paine had derived from his quaker doctrine of the inner light of every man about the same time paines writings were suppressed in england paine did not understand german but kant though always independent in the formation of his opinions was evidently well acquainted with the literature of the revolution in america england and france editor the most detestable wickedness the most horrid cruelties and the greatest miseries that have afflicted the human race have had their origin in this thing called revelation or revealed religion it has been the most dishonourable belief against the character of the divinity the most destructive to morality and the peace and happiness of man that ever was propagated since man began to exist it is better far better that we admitted if it were possible a thousand devils to roam at large and to preach publicly the doctrine of devils if there were any such than that we permitted one such impostor and monster as moses joshua samuel and the bible prophets to come with the pretended word of god in his mouth and have credit among us whence arose all the horrid assassinations of whole nations of men women and infants with which the bible is filled and the bloody persecutions and tortures unto death and religious wars that since that time have laid europe in blood and ashes whence arose they but from this impious thing called revealed religion and this monstrous belief that god has spoken to man the lies of the bible have been the cause of the one and the lies of the testament of the other some christians pretend that christianity was not established by the sword but of what period of time do they speak it was impossible that twelve men could begin with the sword they had not the power but no sooner were the professors of christianity sufficiently powerful to employ the sword than they did so and the stake and faggot too and mahomet could not do it sooner by the same spirit that peter cut off the ear of the high priests servant if the story be true he would cut off his head and the head of his master had he been able besides this christianity grounds itself originally upon the hebrew bible and the bible was established altogether by the sword and that in the worst use of it not to terrify but to extirpate the jews made no converts they butchered all the bible is the sire of the new testament and both are called the word of god the christians read both books the ministers preach from both books and this thing called cliristianity is made up of both it is then false to say that christianity was not established by the sword the only sect that has not persecuted are the quakers and the only reason that can be given for it is that they are rather deists than christians they do not believe much about jesus christ and they call the scriptures a dead letter this is an interesting and correct testimony as to the beliefs of the earlier quakers one of whom was paines father editor had they called them by a worse name they had been nearer the truth it is incumbent on every man who reverences the character of the creator and who wishes to lessen the catalogue of artificial miseries and remove the cause that has sown persecutions thick among mankind to expel all ideas of a revealed religion as a dangerous heresy and an impious fraud what is it that we have learned from this pretended thing called revealed religion nothing that is useful to man and every thing that is disbonourable to his maker what is it the bible teaches us repine cruelty and murder what is it the testament teaches us to believe that the almighty committed debauchery with a woman engaged to be married and the belief of this debauchery is called faith as to the fragments of morality that are irregularly and thinly scattered in those books they make no part of this pretended thing revealed religion they are the natural dictates of conscience and the bonds by which society is held together and without which it cannot exist and are nearly the same in all religions and in all societies the testament teaches nothing new upon this subject and where it attempts to exceed it becomes mean and ridiculous the doctrine of not retaliating injuries is much better expressed in proverbs which is a collection as well from the gentilcs as the jews than it is in the testament it is there said xxv i if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he be thirsty give him water to drink according to what is called christs sermon on the mount in the book of matthew where among some other and good things a great deal of this feigned morality is introduced it is there expressly said that the doctrine of forbearance or of not retaliating injuries was not any part of the doctrine of the jews but as this doctrine is found in proverbs it must according to that statement have been copied from the gentiles from whom christ had leamed it those men whom jewish and christian idolators have abusively called heathen had much better and clearer ideas of justice and morality than are to be found in the old testament so far as it is jewish or in the new the answer of solon on the question which is the most perfect popular govemment has never been exceeded by any man since his time as containing a maxim of political morality that says he where the least injury done to the meanest individual is considered as an insult on the whole constitution solon lived about years before christ author but when it is said as in the testament if a man smite thee on the right chcek turn to him the other also it is assassinating the dignity of forbearance and sinking man into a spaniel loving of enemies is another dogma of feigned morality and has besides no meaning it is incumbent on man as a moralist that he does not revenge an injury and it is equally as good in a political sense for there is no end to retaliation each retaliates on the other and calls it justice but to love in proportion to the injury if it could be done would be to offer a premium for a crime besides the word enemies is too vague and general to be used in a moral maxim which ought always to be clear and defined like a proverb if a man be the enemy of another from mistake and prejudice as in the case of religious opinions and sometimes in politics that man is different to an enemy at heart with a criminal intention and it is incumbent upon us and it contributes also to our own tranquillity that we put the best construction upon a thing that it will bear but even this erroneous motive in him makes no motive for love on the other part and to say that we can love voluntarily and without a motive is morally and physically impossible morality is injured by prescribing to it duties that in the first place are impossible to be performed and if they could be would be productive of evil or as before said be premiums for crime the maxim of doing as we would be done unto does not include this strange doctrine of loving enemies for no man expects to be loved himself for his crime or for his enmity those who preach this doctrine of loving their enemies are in general the greatest persecutors and they act consistently by so doing for the doctrine is hypocritical and it is natural that hypocrisy should act the reverse of what it preaches for my own part i disown the doctrine and consider it as a feigned or fabulous morality yet the man does not exist that can say i have persecuted him or any man or any set of men either in the american revolution or in the french revolution or that i have in any case returned evil for evil but it is not incumbent on man to reward a bad action with a good one or to return good for evil and wherever it is done it is a voluntary act and not a duty it is also absurd to suppose that such doctrine can make any part of a revealed religion we imitate the moral character of the creator by forbearing with each other for he forbears with all but this doctrine would imply that he loved man not in proportion as he was good but as he was bad if we consider the nature of our condition here we must see there is no occasion for such a thing as revealed religion what is it we want to know does not the creation the universe we behold preach to us the existence of an almighty power that governs and regulates the whole and is not the evidence that this creation holds out to our senses infinitely stronger than any thing we can read in a book that any imposter might make and call the word of god as for morality the knowledge of it exists in every mans conscience here we are the existence of an almighty power is sufficiently demonstrated to us though we cannot conceive as it is impossible we should the nature and manner of its existence we cannot conceive how we came here ourselves and yet we know for a fact that we are here we must know also that the power that called us into being can if he please and when he pleases call us to account for the manner in which we have lived here and therefore without seeking any other motive for the belief it is rational to believe that he will for we know beforehand that he can the probability or even possibility of the thing is all that we ought to know for if we knew it as a fact we should be the mere slaves of terror our belief would have no merit and our best actions no virtue deism then teaches us without the possibility of being deceived all that is necessary or proper to be known the creation is the bible of the deist he there reads in the handwriting of the creator himself the certainty of his existence and the immutability of his power and all other bibles and testaments are to him forgeries the probability that we may be called to account hereafter will to reflecting minds have the influence of belief for it is not our belief or disbelief that can make or unmake the fact as this is the state we are in and which it is proper we should be in as free agents it is the fool only and not the philosopher nor even the prudent man that will live as if there were no god but the belief of a god is so weakened by being mixed with the strange fable of the christian creed and with the wild adventures related in the bible and the obscurity and obscene nonsense of the testament that the mind of man is bewildered as in a fog viewing all these things in a confused mass he confounds fact with fable and as he cannot believe all he feels a disposition to reject all but the belief of a god is a belief distinct from all other things and ought not to be confounded with any the notion of a trinity of gods has enfeebled the belief of one god a multiplication of beliefs acts as a division of belief and in proportion as anything is divided it is weakened religion by such means becomes a thing of form instead of fact of notion instead of principle morality is banished to make room for an imaginary thing called faith and this faith has its origin in a supposed debauchery a man is preached instead of a god an execution is an object for gratitude the preachers daub themselves with the blood like a troop of assassins and pretend to admire the brilliancy it gives them they preach a humdrum sermon on the merits of the execution then praise jesus christ for being executed and condemn the jews for doing it a man by hearing all this nonsense lumped and preached together confounds the god of the creation with the imagined god of the christians and lives as if there were none of all the systems of religion that ever were invented there is none more derogatory to the almighty more unedifying to man more repugnant to reason and more contradictory in itself than this thing called christianity too absurd for belief too impossible to convince and too inconsistent for practice it renders the heart torpid or produces only atheists and fanatics as an engine of power it serves the purpose of despotism and as a means of wealth the avarice of priests but so far as respects the good of man in general it leads to nothing here or hereafter the only religion that has not been invented and that has in it every evidence of divine originality is pure and simple deism it must have been the first and will probably be the last that man believes but pure and simple deism does not answer the purpose of despotic governments they cannot lay hold of religion as an engine but by mixing it with human inventions and making their own authority a part neither does it answer the avarice of priests but by incorporating themselves and their functions with it and becoming like the government a party in the system it is this that forms the otherwise mysterious connection of church and state the church human and the state tyrannic were a man impressed as fully and strongly as he ought to be with the belief of a god his moral life would be regulated by the forcc of belief he would stand in awe of god and of himself and would not do the thing that could not be concealed from either to give this belief the full opportunity of force it is necessary that it acts alone this is deism but when according to the christian trinitarian scheme one part of god is represented by a dying man and another part called the holy ghost by a flying pigeon it is impossible that belief can attach itself to such wild conceits the book called the book of matthew says iii that the holy ghost descended in the shape of a dove it might as well have said a goose the creatures are equally harmless and the one is as much a nonsensical lie as the other acts ii says that it descended in a mighty rushing wind in the shape of cloven tongues perbaps it was cloven feet such absurd stuff is fit only for tales of witches and wizards author it has been the scheme of the christian church and of all the other invented systems of religion to hold man in ignorance of the creator as it is of government to hold him in ignorance of his rights the systems of the one are as false as those of the other and are calculated for mutual support the study of theology as it stands in christian churches is the study of nothing it is founded on nothing it rests on no principles it proceeds by no authorities it has no data it can demonstrate nothing and admits of no conclusion not any thing can be studied as a science without our being in possession of the principles upon which it is founded and as this is not the case with christian theology it is therefore the study of nothing instead then of studying theology as is now done out of the bible and testament the meanings of which books are always controverted and the authenticity of which is disproved it is necessary that we refer to the bible of the creation the principles we discover there are eternal and of divine origin they are the foundation of all the science that exists in the world and must be the foundation of theology we can know god only through his works we cannot have a conception of any one attribute but by following some principle that leads to it we have only a confused idea of his power if we have not the means of comprehending something of its immensity we can have no idea of his wisdom but by knowing the order and manner in which it acts the principles of science lead to this knowledge for the creator of man is the creator of science and it is through that medium that man can see god as it were face to face could a man be placed in a situation and endowed with power of vision to behold at one view and to contemplate deliberately the structure of the universe to mark the movements of the several planets the cause of their varying appearances the unerring order in which they revolve even to the remotest comet their connection and dependence on each other and to know the system of laws established by the creator that governs and regulates the whole he would then conceive far beyond what any church theology can teach him the power the wisdom the vastness the munificence of the creator he would then see that all the knowledge man has of science and that all the mechanical arts by which he renders his situation comfortable here are derived from that source his mind exalted by the scene and convinced by the fact would increase in gratitude as it increased in knowledge his religion or his worship would become united with his improvement as a man any employment he followed that had connection with the principles of the creation as everything of agriculture of science and of the mechanical arts has would teach him more of god and of the gratitude he owes to him than any theological christian sermon he now hears great objects inspire great thoughts great munificence excites great gratitude but the grovelling tales and doctrines of the bible and the testament are fit only to excite contempt though man cannot arrive at least in this life at the actual scene i have described he can demonstrate it because he has knowledge of the principles upon which the creation is constructed we know that the greatest works can be represented in inodel and that the universe can be represented by the same means the same principles by which we measure an inch or an acre of ground will measure to millions in extent a circle of an inch diameter has the same geometrical properties as a circle that would circumscribe the universe the same properties of a triangle that will demonstrate upon paper the course of a ship will do it on the ocean and when applied to what are called the heavenly bodies will ascertain to a minute the time of an eclipse though those bodies are millions of miles distant from us this knowledge is of divine origin and it is from the bible of the creation that man has learned it and not from the stupid bible of the church that teaches man nothing the biblemakers have undertaken to give us in the first chapter of genesis an account of the creation and in doing this they have demonstrated nothing but their ignorance they make there to have been three days and three nights evenings and mornings before there was any sun when it is the presence or absence of the sun that is the cause of day and night and what is called his rising and setting that of moming and evening besides it is a puerile and pitiful idea to suppose the almighty to say let there be light it is the imperative manner of speaking that a conjuror uses when he says to his cups and balls presto be gone and most probably has been taken from it as moses and his rod is a conjuror and his wand longinus calls this expression the sublime and by the same rule the conjurer is sublime too for the manner of speaking is expressively and grammatically the same when authors and critics talk of the sublime they see not how nearly it borders on the ridiculous the sublime of the critics like some parts of edmund burkes sublime and beautiful is like a windmill just visible in a fog which imaginanation might distort into a flying mountain or an archangel or a flock of wild geese author all the knowledge man has of science and of machinery by the aid of which his existence is rendered comfortable upon earth and without which he would be scarcely distinguishable in appearance and condition from a common animal comes from the great machine and structure of the universe the constant and unwearied observations of our ancestors upon the movements and revolutions of the heavenly bodies in what are supposed to have been the early ages of the world have brought this knowledge upon earth it is not moses and the prophets nor jesus christ nor his apostles that have done it the almighty is the great mechanic of the creation the first philosopher and original teacher of all science let us then learn to reverence our master and not forget the labours of our ancestors had we at this day no knowledge of machinery and were it possible that man could have a view as i have before described of the structure and machinery of the universe he would soon conceive the idea of constructing some at least of the mechanical works we now have and the idea so conceived would progressively advance in practice or could a model of the universe such as is called an orrery be presented before him and put in motion his mind would arrive at the same idea such an object and such a subject would whilst it improved him in knowledge useful to himself as a man and a member of society as well as entertaining afford far better matter for impressing him with a knowledge of and a belief in the creator and of the reverence and gratitude that man owes to him than the stupid texts of the bible and the testament from which be the talents of the preacher what they may only stupid sermons can be preached if man must preach let him preach something that is edifying and from the texts that are known to be true the bible of the creation is inexhaustible in texts every part of science whether connected with the geometry of the universe with the systems of animal and vegetable life or with the properties of inanimate matter is a text as well for devotion as for philosophy for gratitude as for human improvement it will perhaps be said that if such a revolution in the system of religion takes place every preacher ought to be a philosopher most certainly and every house of devotion a school of science it has been by wandering from the immutable laws of science and the light of reason and setting up an invented thing called revealed religion that so many wild and blasphemous conceits have been formed of the almighty the jews have made him the assassin of the human species to make room for the religion of the jews the christians have made him the murderer of himself and the founder of a new religion to supersede and expel the jewish religion and to find pretence and admission for these things they must have supposed his power or his wisdom imperfect or his will changeable and the changeableness of the will is the imperfection of the judgement the philosopher knows that the laws of the creator have never changed with respect either to the principles of science or the properties of matter why then is it to be supposed they have changed with respect to man i here close the subject i have shown in all the foregoing parts of this work that the bible and testament are impositions and forgeries and i leave the evidence i have produced in proof of it to be refuted if any one can do it and i leave the ideas that are suggested in the conclusion of the work to rest on the mind of the reader certain as i am that when opinions are free either in matters of govemment or religion truth will finally and powerfully prevail
