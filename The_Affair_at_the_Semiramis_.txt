the affair at the semiramis hotel i mr ricardo when the excitements of the villa rose were done with returned to grosvenor square and resumed the busy unnecessary life of an amateur but the studios had lost their savour artists their attractiveness and even the russian opera seemed a trifle flat life was altogether a disappointment fate like an actress at a restaurant had taken the wooden pestle in her hand and stirred all the sparkle out of the champagne mr ricardo languished until one unforgettable morning he was sitting disconsolately at his breakfasttable when the door was burst open and a square stout man with the blue shaven face of a french comedian flung himself into the room ricardo sprang towards the newcomer with a cry of delight my dear hanaud he seized his visitor by the arm feeling it to make sure that here in flesh and blood stood the man who had introduced him to the acutest sensations of his life he turned towards his butler who was still bleating expostulations in the doorway at the unceremonious irruption of the french detective another place burton at once he cried and as soon as he and hanaud were alone what good wind blows you to london business my friend the disappearance of bullion somewhere on the line between paris and london but it is finished yes i take a holiday a light had suddenly flashed in mr ricardos eyes and was now no less suddenly extinguished hanaud paid no attention whatever to his friends disappointment he pounced upon a piece of silver which adorned the tablecloth and took it over to the window everything is as it should be my friend he exclaimed with a grin grosvenor square the times open at the money column and a false antique upon the table thus i have dreamed of you all mr ricardo is in that sentence ricardo laughed nervously recollection made him wary of hanauds sarcasms he was shy even to protest the genuineness of his silver but indeed he had not the time for the door opened again and once more the butler appeared on this occasion however he was alone mr calladine would like to speak to you sir he said calladine cried ricardo in an extreme surprise that is the most extraordinary thing he looked at the clock upon his mantelpiece it was barely halfpast eight at this hour too mr calladine is still wearing evening dress the butler remarked ricardo started in his chair he began to dream of possibilities and here was hanaud miraculously at his side where is mr calladine he asked i have shown him into the library good said mr ricardo i will come to him but he was in no hurry he sat and let his thoughts play with this incident of calladines early visit it is very odd he said i have not seen calladine for months no nor has anyone yet a little while ago no one was more often seen he fell apparently into a muse but he was merely seeking to provoke hanauds curiosity in this attempt however he failed hanaud continued placidly to eat his breakfast so that mr ricardo was compelled to volunteer the story which he was burning to tell drink your coffee hanaud and you shall hear about calladine hanaud grunted with resignation and mr ricardo flowed on calladine was one of englands young men everybody said so he was going to do very wonderful things as soon as he had made up his mind exactly what sort of wonderful things he was going to do meanwhile you met him in scotland at newmarket at ascot at cowes in the box of some great lady at the opera not before halfpast ten in the evening there in any fine house where the candles that night happened to be lit he went everywhere and then a day came and he went nowhere there was no scandal no trouble not a whisper against his good name he simply vanished for a little while a few people asked what has become of calladine but there never was any answer and london has no time for unanswered questions other promising young men dined in his place calladine had joined the huge legion of the cometonothings no one even seemed to pass him in the street now unexpectedly at halfpast eight in the morning and in evening dress he calls upon me why i ask myself mr ricardo sank once more into a reverie hanaud watched him with a broadening smile of pure enjoyment and in time i suppose he remarked casually you will perhaps ask him mr ricardo sprang out of his pose to his feet before i discuss serious things with an acquaintance he said with a scathing dignity i make it a rule to revive my impressions of his personality the cigarettes are in the crystal box they would be said hanaud unabashed as ricardo stalked from the room but in five minutes mr ricardo came running back all his composure gone it is the greatest good fortune that you my friend should have chosen this morning to visit me he cried and hanaud nodded with a little grimace of resignation there goes my holiday you shall command me now and always i will make the acquaintance of your young friend he rose up and followed ricardo into his study where a young man was nervously pacing the floor mr calladine said ricardo this is mr hanaud the young man turned eagerly he was tall with a noticeable elegance and distinction and the face which he showed to hanaud was in spite of its agitation remarkably handsome i am very glad he said you are not an official of this country you can advise without yourself taking action if youll be so good hanaud frowned he bent his eyes uncompromisingly upon calladine what does that mean he asked with a note of sternness in his voice it means that i must tell someone calladine burst out in quivering tones that i dont know what to do i am in a difficulty too big for me thats the truth hanaud looked at the young man keenly it seemed to ricardo that he took in every excited gesture every twitching feature in one comprehensive glance then he said in a friendlier voice sit down and tell me and he himself drew up a chair to the table i was at the semiramis last night said calladine naming one of the great hotels upon the embankment there was a fancydress ball all this happened by the way in those faroff days before the war nearly in fact three years ago today when london flinging aside its reticence its shy selfconsciousness had become a city of carnivals and masquerades rivalling its neighbours on the continent in the spirit of its gaiety and exceeding them by its stupendous luxury i went by the merest chance my rooms are in the adelphi terrace there cried mr ricardo in surprise and hanaud lifted a hand to check his interruptions yes continued calladine the night was warm the music floated through my open windows and stirred old memories i happened to have a ticket i went calladine drew up a chair opposite to hanaud and seating himself told with many nervous starts and in troubled tones a story which to mr ricardos thinking was as fabulous as any out of the arabian nights i had a ticket he began but no domino i was consequently stopped by an attendant in the lounge at the top of the staircase leading down to the ballroom you can hire a domino in the cloakroom mr calladine he said to me i had already begun to regret the impulse which had brought me and i welcomed the excuse with which the absence of a costume provided me i was indeed turning back to the door when a girl who had at that moment run down from the stairs of the hotel into the lounge cried gaily thats not necessary and at the same moment she flung to me a long scarlet cloak which she had been wearing over her own dress she was young fair rather tall slim and very pretty her hair was drawn back from her face with a ribbon and rippled down her shoulders in heavy curls and she was dressed in a satin coat and kneebreeches of pale green and gold with a white waistcoat and silk stockings and scarlet heels to her satin shoes she was as straightlimbed as a boy and exquisite like a figure in dresden china i caught the cloak and turned to thank her but she did not wait with a laugh she ran down the stairs a supple and shining figure and was lost in the throng at the doorway of the ballroom i was stirred by the prospect of an adventure i ran down after her she was standing just inside the room alone and she was gazing at the scene with parted lips and dancing eyes she laughed again as she saw the cloak about my shoulders a delicious gurgle of amusement and i said to her may i dance with you oh do she cried with a little jump and clasping her hands she was of a high and joyous spirit and not difficult in the matter of an introduction this gentleman will do very well to present us she said leading me in front of a bust of the god pan which stood in a niche of the wall i am as you see straight out of an opera my name is celymne or anything with an eighteenth century sound to it you are what you will for this evening we are friends and for tomorrow i asked i will tell you about that later on she replied and she began to dance with a light step and a passion in her dancing which earned me many an envious glance from the other men i was in luck for celymne knew no one and though of course i saw the faces of a great many people whom i remembered i kept them all at a distance we had been dancing for about half an hour when the first queerish thing happened she stopped suddenly in the midst of a sentence with a little gasp i spoke to her but she did not hear she was gazing past me her eyes wide open and such a rapt look upon her face as i had never seen she was lost in a miraculous vision i followed the direction of her eyes and to my astonishment i saw nothing more than a stout short middleaged woman egregiously overdressed as marie antoinette so you do know someone here i said and i had to repeat the words sharply before my friend withdrew her eyes but even then she was not aware of me it was as if a voice had spoken to her whilst she was asleep and had disturbed but not wakened her then she came to theres really no other word i can think of which describes her at that moment she came to with a deep sigh no she answered she is a mrs blumenstein from chicago a widow with ambitions and a great deal of money but i dont know her yet you know all about her i remarked she crossed in the same boat with me celymne replied did i tell you that i landed at liverpool this morning she is staying at the semiramis too oh let us dance she twitched my sleeve impatiently and danced with a kind of violence and wildness as if she wished to banish some sinister thought and she did undoubtedly banish it we supped together and grew confidential as under such conditions people will she told me her real name it was joan carew i have come over to get an engagement if i can at covent garden i am supposed to sing all right but i dont know anyone i have been brought up in italy you have some letters of introduction i suppose i asked oh yes one from my teacher in milan one from an american manager in my turn i told her my name and where i lived and i gave her my card i thought you see that since i used to know a good many operatic people i might be able to help her thank you she said and at that moment mrs blumenstein followed by a party chiefly those lapdog young men who always seem to gather about that kind of person came into the supperroom and took a table close to us there was at once an end of all confidences indeed of all conversation joan carew lost all the lightness of her spirit she talked at random and her eyes were drawn again and again to the grotesque slander on marie antoinette finally i became annoyed shall we go i suggested impatiently and to my surprise she whispered passionately yes please let us go her voice was actually shaking her small hands clenched we went back to the ballroom but joan carew did not recover her gaiety and halfway through a dance when we were near to the door she stopped abruptly extraordinarily abruptly i shall go she said abruptly i am tired i have grown dull i protested but she made a little grimace youll hate me in half an hour lets be wise and stop now while we are friends she said and whilst i removed the domino from my shoulders she stooped very quickly it seemed to me that she picked up something which had lain hidden beneath the sole of her slipper she certainly moved her foot and i certainly saw something small and bright flash in the palm of her glove as she raised herself again but i imagined merely that it was some object which she had dropped yes well go she said and we went up the stairs into the lobby certainly all the sparkle had gone out of our adventure i recognized her wisdom but i shall meet you again i asked yes i have your address ill write and fix a time when you will be sure to find me in goodnight and a thousand thanks i should have been bored to tears if you hadnt come without a domino she was speaking lightly as she held out her hand but her grip tightened a little and clung her eyes darkened and grew troubled her mouth trembled the shadow of a great trouble had suddenly closed about her she shivered i am half inclined to ask you to stay however dull i am and dance with me till daylight the safe daylight she said it was an extraordinary phrase for her to use and it moved me let us go back then i urged she gave me an impression suddenly of someone quite forlorn but joan carew recovered her courage no no she answered quickly she snatched her hand away and ran lightly up the staircase turning at the corner to wave her hand and smile it was then halfpast one in the morning so far calladine had spoken without an interruption mr ricardo it is true was bursting to break in with the most important questions but a salutary fear of hanaud restrained him now however he had an opportunity for calladine paused halfpast one he said sagely ah and when did you go home hanaud asked of calladine true said mr ricardo it is of the greatest consequence calladine was not sure his partner had left behind her the strangest medley of sensations in his breast he was puzzled haunted and charmed he had to think about her he was a trifle uplifted sleep was impossible he wandered for a while about the ballroom then he walked to his chambers along the echoing streets and sat at his window and some time afterwards the hoot of a motorhorn broke the silence and a car stopped and whirred in the street below a moment later his bell rang he ran down the stairs in a queer excitement unlocked the street door and opened it joan carew still in her masquerade dress with her scarlet cloak about her shoulders slipped through the opening shut the door she whispered drawing herself apart in a corner your cab asked calladine it has gone calladine latched the door above in the well of the stairs the light spread out from the open door of his flat down here all was dark he could just see the glimmer of her white face the glitter of her dress but she drew her breath like one who has run far they mounted the stairs cautiously he did not say a word until they were both safely in his parlour and even then it was in a low voice what has happened you remember the woman i stared at you didnt know why i stared but any girl would have understood she was wearing the loveliest pearls i ever saw in my life joan was standing by the edge of the table she was tracing with her finger a pattern on the cloth as she spoke calladine started with a horrible presentiment yes she said i worship pearls i always have done for one thing they improve on me i havent got any of course i have no money but friends of mine who do own pearls have sometimes given theirs to me to wear when they were going sick and they have always got back their lustre i think that has had a little to do with my love of them oh i have always longed for them just a little string sometimes i have felt that i would have given my soul for them she was speaking in a dull monotonous voice but calladine recalled the ecstasy which had shone in her face when her eyes first had fallen on the pearls the longing which had swept her quite into another world the passion with which she had danced to throw the obsession off and i never noticed them at all he said yet they were wonderful the colour the lustre all the evening they tempted me i was furious that a fat coarse creature like that should have such exquisite things oh i was mad she covered her face suddenly with her hands and swayed calladine sprang towards her but she held out her hand no i am all right and though he asked her to sit down she would not you remember when i stopped dancing suddenly yes you had something hidden under your foot the girl nodded her key and under his breath calladine uttered a startled cry for the first time since she had entered the room joan carew raised her head and looked at him her eyes were full of terror and with the terror was mixed an incredulity as though she could not possibly believe that that had happened which she knew had happened a little yale key the girl continued i saw mrs blumenstein looking on the floor for something and then i saw it shining on the very spot mrs blumensteins suite was on the same floor as mine and her maid slept above all the maids do i knew that oh it seemed to me as if i had sold my soul and was being paid now calladine understood what she had meant by her strange phrase the safe daylight i went up to my little suite joan carew continued i sat there with the key burning through my glove until i had given her time enough to fall asleep and though she hesitated before she spoke the words she did speak them not looking at calladine and with a shudder of remorse making her confession complete then i crept out the corridor was dimly lit far away below the music was throbbing up here it was as silent as the grave i opened the door her door i found myself in a lobby the suite though bigger was arranged like mine i slipped in and closed the door behind me i listened in the darkness i couldnt hear a sound i crept forward to the door in front of me i stood with my fingers on the handle and my heart beating fast enough to choke me i had still time to turn back but i couldnt there were those pearls in front of my eyes lustrous and wonderful i opened the door gently an inch or so and then it all happened in a second joan carew faltered the night was too near to her its memory too poignant with terror she shut her eyes tightly and cowered down in a chair with the movement her cloak slipped from her shoulders and dropped on to the ground calladine leaned forward with an exclamation of horror joan carew started up what is it she asked nothing go on i found myself inside the room with the door shut behind me i had shut it myself in a spasm of terror and i dared not turn round to open it i was helpless what do you mean she was awake joan carew shook her head there were others in the room before me and on the same errand men calladine drew back his eyes searching the girls face yes he said slowly i didnt see them at first i didnt hear them the room was quite dark except for one jet of fierce white light which beat upon the door of a safe and as i shut the door the jet moved swiftly and the light reached me and stopped i was blinded i stood in the full glare of it drawn up against the panels of the door shivering sick with fear then i heard a quiet laugh and someone moved softly towards me oh it was terrible i recovered the use of my limbs in a panic i turned to the door but i was too late whilst i fumbled with the handle i was seized a hand covered my mouth i was lifted to the centre of the room the jet went out the electric lights were turned on there were two men dressed as apaches in velvet trousers and red scarves like a hundred others in the ballroom below and both were masked i struggled furiously but of course i was like a child in their grasp tie her legs the man whispered who was holding me shes making too much noise i kicked and fought but the other man stooped and tied my ankles and i fainted calladine nodded his head yes he said when i came to the lights were still burning the door of the safe was open the room empty i had been flung on to a couch at the foot of the bed i was lying there quite free was the safe empty asked calladine suddenly i didnt look she answered oh and she covered her face spasmodically with her hands i looked at the bed someone was lying there under a sheet and quite still there was a clock ticking in the room it was the only sound i was terrified i was going mad with fear if i didnt get out of the room at once i felt that i should go mad that i should scream and bring everyone to find me alone with what was under the sheet in the bed i ran to the door and looked out through a slit into the corridor it was still quite empty and below the music still throbbed in the ballroom i crept down the stairs meeting no one until i reached the hall i looked into the ballroom as if i was searching for someone i stayed long enough to show myself then i got a cab and came to you a short silence followed joan carew looked at her companion in appeal you are the only one i could come to she added i know no one else calladine sat watching the girl in silence then he asked and his voice was hard and is that all you have to tell me yes you are quite sure joan carew looked at him perplexed by the urgency of his question she reflected for a moment or two quite calladine rose to his feet and stood beside her then how do you come to be wearing this he asked and he lifted a chain of platinum and diamonds which she was wearing about her shoulders you werent wearing it when you danced with me joan carew stared at the chain no its not mine i have never seen it before then a light came into her eyes the two men they must have thrown it over my head when i was on the couch before they went she looked at it more closely thats it the chains not very valuable they could spare it and it would accuse me of what they did yes thats very good reasoning said calladine coldly joan carew looked quickly up into his face oh you dont believe me she cried you think oh its impossible and holding him by the edge of his coat she burst into a storm of passionate denials but you went to steal you know he said gently and she answered him at once yes i did but not this and she held up the necklace should i have stolen this should i have come to you wearing it if i had stolen the pearls if i had and she stopped if my story were not true calladine weighed her argument and it affected him no i think you wouldnt he said frankly most crimes no doubt were brought home because the criminal had made some incomprehensibly stupid mistake incomprehensibly stupid that is by the standards of normal life nevertheless calladine was inclined to believe her he looked at her that she should have murdered was absurd moreover she was not making a parade of remorse she was not playing the unctuous penitent she had yielded to a temptation had got herself into desperate straits and was at her wits ends how to escape from them she was frank about herself calladine looked at the clock it was nearly five oclock in the morning and though the music could still be heard from the ballroom in the semiramis the night had begun to wane upon the river you must go back he said ill walk with you they crept silently down the stairs and into the street it was only a step to the semiramis they met no one until they reached the strand there many like joan carew in masquerade were standing about or walking hither and thither in search of carriages and cabs the whole street was in a bustle what with drivers shouting and people coming away you can slip in unnoticed said calladine as he looked into the thronged courtyard ill telephone to you in the morning you will she cried eagerly clinging for a moment to his arm yes for certain he replied wait in until you hear from me ill think it over ill do what i can thank you she said fervently he watched her scarlet cloak flitting here and there in the crowd until it vanished through the doorway then for the second time he walked back to his chambers while the morning crept up the river from the sea this was the story which calladine told in mr ricardos library mr ricardo heard it out with varying emotions he began with a thrill of expectation like a man on a dark threshold of great excitements the setting of the story appealed to him too by a sort of brilliant bizarrerie which he found in it but as it went on he grew puzzled and a trifle disheartened there were flaws and chinks he began to bubble with unspoken criticisms then swift and clever thrusts which he dared not deliver he looked upon the young man with disfavour as upon one who had half opened a door upon a theatre of great promise and shown him a spectacle not up to the mark hanaud on the other hand listened imperturbably without an expression upon his face until the end then he pointed a finger at calladine and asked him what to ricardos mind was a most irrelevant question you got back to your rooms then before five mr calladine and it is now nine oclock less a few minutes yes yet you have not changed your clothes explain to me that what did you do between five and halfpast eight calladine looked down at his rumpled shirt front upon my word i never thought of it he cried i was worried out of my mind i couldnt decide what to do finally i determined to talk to mr ricardo and after i had come to that conclusion i just waited impatiently until i could come round with decency hanaud rose from his chair his manner was grave but conveyed no single hint of an opinion he turned to ricardo let us go round to your young friends rooms in the adelphi he said and the three men drove thither at once ii calladine lodged in a corner house and upon the first floor his rooms large and square and lofty with adams mantelpieces and a delicate tracery upon their ceilings breathed the grace of the eighteenth century broad high windows embrasured in thick walls overlooked the river and took in all the sunshine and the air which the river had to give and they were furnished fittingly when the three men entered the parlour mr ricardo was astounded he had expected the untidy litter of a man run to seed the neglect and the dust of the recluse but the room was as clean as the deck of a yacht an aubusson carpet made the floor luxurious underfoot a few coloured prints of real value decorated the walls and the mahogany furniture was polished so that a lady could have used it as a mirror there was even by the newspapers upon the round table a china bowl full of fresh red roses if calladine had turned hermit he was a hermit of an unusually fastidious type indeed as he stood with his two companions in his dishevelled dress he seemed quite out of keeping with his rooms so you live here mr calladine said hanaud taking off his hat and laying it down yes with your servants of course they come in during the day said calladine and hanaud looked at him curiously do you mean that you sleep here alone yes but your valet i dont keep a valet said calladine and again the curious look came into hanauds eyes yet he suggested gently there are rooms enough in your set of chambers to house a family calladine coloured and shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other i prefer at night not to be disturbed he said stumbling a little over the words i mean i have a liking for quiet gabriel hanaud nodded his head with sympathy yes yes and it is a difficult thing to get as difficult as my holiday he said ruefully with a smile for mr ricardo however he turned towards calladine no doubt now that you are at home you would like a bath and a change of clothes and when you are dressed perhaps you will telephone to the semiramis and ask miss carew to come round here meanwhile we will read your newspapers and smoke your cigarettes hanaud shut the door upon calladine but he turned neither to the papers nor the cigarettes he crossed the room to mr ricardo who seated at the open window was plunged deep in reflections you have an idea my friend cried hanaud it demands to express itself that sees itself in your face let me hear it i pray mr ricardo started out of an absorption which was altogether assumed i was thinking he said with a faraway smile that you might disappear in the forests of africa and at once everyone would be very busy about your disappearance you might leave your village in leicestershire and live in the fogs of glasgow and within a week the whole village would know your postal address but london what a city how different how indifferent turn out of st jamess into the adelphi terrace and not a soul will say to you dr livingstone i presume but why should they asked hanaud if your name isnt dr livingstone mr ricardo smiled indulgently scoffer he said you understand me very well and he sought to turn the tables on his companion and you does this room suggest nothing to you have you no ideas but he knew very well that hanaud had ever since hanaud had crossed the threshold he had been like a man stimulated by a drug his eyes were bright and active his body alert yes he said i have he was standing now by ricardos side with his hands in his pockets looking out at the trees on the embankment and the barges swinging down the river you are thinking of the strange scene which took place in this room such a very few hours ago said ricardo the girl in her masquerade dress making her confession with the stolen chain about her throat hanaud looked backwards carelessly no i wasnt giving it a thought he said and in a moment or two he began to walk about the room with that curiously light step which ricardo was never able to reconcile with his cumbersome figure with the heaviness of a bear he still padded he went from corner to corner opened a cupboard here a drawer of the bureau there and stooped suddenly he stood erect again with a small box of morocco leather in his hand his body from head to foot seemed to ricardo to be expressing the question have i found it he pressed a spring and the lid of the box flew open hanaud emptied its contents into the palm of his hand there were two or three sticks of sealingwax and a seal with a shrug of the shoulders he replaced them and shut the box you are looking for something ricardo announced with sagacity i am replied hanaud and it seemed that in a second or two he found it yet yet he found it with his hands in his pockets if he had found it mr ricardo saw him stop in that attitude in front of the mantelshelf and heard him utter a long low whistle upon the mantelshelf some photographs were arranged a box of cigars stood at one end a book or two lay between some delicate ornaments of china and a small engraving in a thin gilt frame was propped at the back against the wall ricardo surveyed the shelf from his seat in the window but he could not imagine which it was of these objects that so drew and held hanauds eyes hanaud however stepped forward he looked into a vase and turned it upside down then he removed the lid of a porcelain cup and from the very look of his great shoulders ricardo knew that he had discovered what he sought he was holding something in his hands turning it over examining it when he was satisfied he moved swiftly to the door and opened it cautiously both men could hear the splashing of water in a bath hanaud closed the door again with a nod of contentment and crossed once more to the window yes it is all very strange and curious he said and i do not regret that you dragged me into the affair you were quite right my friend this morning it is the personality of your young mr calladine which is the interesting thing for instance here we are in london in the early summer the trees out freshly green lilac and flowers in the gardens and i dont know what tingle of hope and expectation in the sunlight and the air i am middleaged yet theres a riot in my blood a recapture of youth a belief that just round the corner beyond the reach of my eyes wonders wait for me dont you too feel something like that well then and he heaved his shoulders in astonishment can you understand a young man with money with fastidious tastes goodlooking hiding himself in a corner at such a time except for some overpowering reason no nor can i there is another thing i put a question or two to calladine yes said ricardo he has no servants here at night he is quite alone and here is what i find interesting he has no valet that seems a small thing to you hanaud asked at a movement from ricardo well it is no doubt a trifle but its a significant trifle in the case of a young rich man it is generally a sign that there is something strange perhaps even something sinister in his life mr calladine some months ago turned out of st jamess into the adelphi can you tell me why no replied mr ricardo can you hanaud stretched out a hand in his open palm lay a small round hairy bulb about the size of a big button and of a colour between green and brown look he said what is that mr ricardo took the bulb wonderingly it looks to me like the fruit of some kind of cactus hanaud nodded it is you will see some pots of it in the hothouses of any really good botanical gardens kew has them i have no doubt paris certainly has they are labelled anhalonium luinii but amongst the indians of yucatan the plant has a simpler name what name asked ricardo mescal mr ricardo repeated the name it conveyed nothing to him whatever there are a good many bulbs just like that in the cup upon the mantelshelf said hanaud ricardo looked quickly up why he asked mescal is a drug ricardo started yes you are beginning to understand now hanaud continued why your young friend calladine turned out of st jamess into the adelphi terrace ricardo turned the little bulb over in his fingers you make a decoction of it i suppose he said or you can use it as the indians do in yucatan replied hanaud mescal enters into their religious ceremonies they sit at night in a circle about a fire built in the forest and chew it whilst one of their number beats perpetually upon a drum hanaud looked round the room and took notes of its luxurious carpet its delicate appointments outside the window there was a thunder in the streets a clamour of voices boats went swiftly down the river on the ebb beyond the mass of the semiramis rose the great greywhite dome of st pauls opposite upon the southwark bank the giant skysigns the big highlander drinking whisky and the rest of them waited gaunt skeletons for the night to limn them in fire and give them life below the trees in the gardens rustled and waved in the air were the uplift and the sparkle of the young summer its a long way from the forests of yucatan to the adelphi terrace of london said hanaud yet here i think in these rooms when the servants are all gone and the house is very quiet there is a little corner of wild mexico a look of pity came into mr ricardos face he had seen more than one young man of great promise slacken his hold and let go just for this reason calladine it seemed was another its like bhang and kieff and the rest of the devilish things i suppose he said indignantly tossing the button upon the table hanaud picked it up no he replied its not quite like any other drug it has a quality of its own which just now is of particular importance to you and me yes my friend and he nodded his head very seriously we must watch that we do not make the big fools of ourselves in this affair there mr ricardo agreed with an ineffable air of wisdom i am entirely with you now why hanaud asked mr ricardo was at a loss for a reason but hanaud did not wait i will tell you mescal intoxicates yes but it does more it gives to the man who eats of it colourdreams colourdreams mr ricardo repeated in a wondering voice yes strange heated charms in which violent things happen vividly amongst bright colours colour is the gift of this little prosaic brown button he spun the bulb in the air like a coin and catching it again took it over to the mantelpiece and dropped it into the porcelain cup are you sure of this ricardo cried excitedly and hanuad raised his hand in warning he went to the door opened it for an inch or so and closed it again i am quite sure he returned i have for a friend a very learned chemist in the collge de france he is one of those enthusiasts who must experiment upon themselves he tried this drug yes ricardo said in a quieter voice and what did he see he had a vision of a wonderful garden bathed in sunlight an old garden of gorgeous flowers and emerald lawns ponds with golden lilies and thick yew hedges a garden where peacocks stepped indolently and groups of gay people fantastically dressed quarrelled and fought with swords that is what he saw and he saw it so vividly that when the vapours of the drug passed from his brain and he waked he seemed to be coming out of the real world into a world of shifting illusions hanauds strong quiet voice stopped and for a while there was a complete silence in the room neither of the two men stirred so much as a finger mr ricardo once more was conscious of the thrill of strange sensations he looked round the room he could hardly believe that a room which had been nay was the home and shrine of mysteries in the dark hours could wear so bright and innocent a freshness in the sunlight of the morning there should be something sinister which leaped to the eyes as you crossed the threshold out of the real world mr ricardo quoted i begin to see yes you begin to see my friend that we must be very careful not to make the big fools of ourselves my friend of the collge de france saw a garden but had he been sitting alone in the windowseat where you are listening through a summer night to the music of the masquerade at the semiramis might he not have seen the ballroom the dancers the scarlet cloak and the rest of this story you mean cried ricardo now fairly startled that calladine came to us with the fumes of mescal still working in his brain that the false world was the real one still for him i do not know said hanaud at present i only put questions i ask them of you i wish to hear how they sound let us reason this problem out calladine let us say takes a great deal more of the drug than my professor it will have on him a more powerful effect while it lasts and it will last longer fancy dress balls are familiar things to calladine the music floating from the semiramis will revive old memories he sits here the pageant takes shape before him he sees himself taking his part in it oh he is happier here sitting quietly in his windowseat than if he was actually at the semiramis for he is there more intensely more vividly more really than if he had actually descended this staircase he lives his story through the story of a heated brain the scene of it changes in the way dreams have it becomes tragic and sinister it oppresses him with horror and in the morning so obsessed with it that he does not think to change his clothes he is knocking at your door mr ricardo raised his eyebrows and moved ah you see a flaw in my argument said hanaud but mr ricardo was wary too often in other days he had been leaped upon and trounced for a careless remark let me hear the end of your argument he said there was then to your thinking no temptation of jewels no theft no murder in a word no celymne she was born of recollections and the music of the semiramis no cried hanaud come with me my friend i am not so sure that there was no celymne with a smile upon his face hanaud led the way across the room he had the dramatic instinct and rejoiced in it he was going to produce a surprise for his companion and savouring the moment in advance he managed his effects he walked towards the mantelpiece and stopped a few paces away from it look mr ricardo looked and saw a broad adams mantelpiece he turned a bewildered face to his friend you see nothing hanaud asked nothing look again i am not sure but is it not that celymne is posing before you mr ricardo looked again there was nothing to fix his eyes he saw a book or two a cup a vase or two and nothing else really expect a very pretty and apparently valuable piece of and suddenly mr ricardo understood straight in front of him in the very centre of the mantelpiece a figure in painted china was leaning against a china stile it was the figure of a perfectly impossible courtier feminine and exquisite as could be and apparelled also even to the scarlet heels exactly as calladine had described joan carew hanaud chuckled with satisfaction when he saw the expression upon mr ricardos face ah you understand he said do you dream my friend at times yes like the rest of us then recollect your dreams things people which you have seen perhaps that day perhaps months ago pop in and out of them without making themselves prayed for you cannot understand why yet sometimes they cut their strange capers there logically too through subtle associations which the dreamer once awake does not apprehend thus our friend here sits in the window intoxicated by his drug the music plays in the semiramis the curtain goes up in the heated theatre of his brain he sees himself step upon the stage and who else meets him but the china figure from his mantelpiece mr ricardo for a moment was all enthusiasm then his doubt returned to him what you say my dear hanaud is very ingenious the figure upon the mantelpiece is also extremely convincing and i should be absolutely convinced but for one thing yes said hanaud watching his friend closely i am i may say it i think a man of the world and i ask myself mr ricardo never could ask himself anything without assuming a manner of extreme pomposity i ask myself whether a young man who has given up his social ties who has become a hermit and still more who has become the slave of a drug would retain that scrupulous carefulness of his body which is indicated by dressing for dinner when alone hanaud struck the table with the palm of his hand and sat down in a chair yes that is the weak point in my theory you have hit it i knew it was there that weak point and i wondered whether you would seize it yes the consumers of drugs are careless untidy even unclean as a rule but not always we must be careful we must wait for what asked ricardo beaming with pride for the answer to a telephone message replied hanaud with a nod towards the door both men waited impatiently until calladine came into the room he wore now a suit of blue serge he had a clearer eye his skin a healthier look he was altogether a more reputable person but he was plainly very ill at ease he offered his visitors cigarettes he proposed refreshments he avoided entirely and awkwardly the object of their visit hanaud smiled his theory was working out sobered by his bath calladine had realised the foolishness of which he had been guilty you telephone to the semiramis of course said hanaud cheerfully calladine grew red yes he stammered yet i did not hear that volume of hallos which precedes telephonic connection in your country of leisure hanaud continued i telephoned from my bedroom you would not hear anything in this room yes yes the walls of these old houses are solid hanaud was playing with his victim and when may we expect miss carew i cant say replied calladine its very strange she is not in the hotel i am afraid that she has gone away fled mr ricardo and hanaud exchanged a look they were both satisfied now there was no word of truth in calladines story then there is no reason for us to wait said hanaud i shall have my holiday after all and while he was yet speaking the voice of a newsboy calling out the first edition of an evening paper became distantly audible hanaud broke off his farewell for a moment he listened with his head bent then the voice was heard again confused indistinct hanaud picked up his hat and cane and without another word to calladine raced down the stairs mr ricardo followed him but when he reached the pavement hanaud was half down the little street at the corner however he stopped and ricardo joined him coughing and out of breath whats the matter he gasped listen said hanaud at the bottom of duke street by charing cross station the newsboy was shouting his wares both men listened and now the words came to them mispronounced but decipherable mysterious crime at the semiramis hotel ricardo stared at his companion you were wrong then he cried calladines story was true for once in a way hanaud was quite disconcerted i dont know yet he said we will buy a paper but before he could move a step a taxicab turned into the adelphi from the strand and wheeling in front of their faces stopped at calladines door from the cab a girl descended let us go back said hanaud iii mr ricardo could no longer complain it was halfpast eight when calladine had first disturbed the formalities of his house in grosvenor square it was barely ten now and during that short time he had been flung from surprise to surprise he had looked underground on a morning of fresh summer and had been thrilled by the contrast between the queer sinister life below and within and the open call to joy of the green world above he had passed from incredulity to belief from belief to incredulity and when at last incredulity was firmly established and the story to which he had listened proved the emanation of a drugged and heated brain lo the facts buffeted him in the face and the story was shown to be true i am alive once more mr ricardo thought as he turned back with hanaud and in his excitement he cried his thought aloud are you said hanaud and what is life without a newspaper if you will buy one from that remarkably raucous boy at the bottom of the street i will keep an eye upon calladines house till you come back mr ricardo sped down to charing cross and brought back a copy of the fourth edition of the star he handed it to hanaud who stared at it doubtfully folded as it was shall we see what it says ricardo asked impatiently by no means hanaud answered waking from his reverie and tucking briskly away the paper into the tail pocket of his coat we will hear what miss joan carew has to say with our minds undisturbed by any discoveries i was wondering about something totally different yes mr ricardo encouraged him what was it i was wondering since it is only ten oclock at what hour the first editions of the evening papers appear it is a question mr ricardo replied sententiously which the greatest minds have failed to answer and they walked along the street to the house the front door stood open during the day like the front door of any other house which is let off in sets of rooms hanaud and ricardo went up the staircase and rang the bell of calladines door a middleaged woman opened it mr calladine is in said hanaud i will ask replied the woman what name shall i say it does not matter i will go straight in said hanaud quietly i was here with my friend but a minute ago he went straight forward and into calladines parlour mr ricardo looked over his shoulder as he opened the door and saw a girl turn to them suddenly a white face of terror and flinch as though already she felt the hand of a constable upon her shoulder calladine on the other hand uttered a cry of relief these are my friends he exclaimed to the girl the friends of whom i spoke to you and to hanaud he said this is miss carew hanaud bowed you shall tell me your story mademoiselle he said very gently and a little colour returned to the girls cheeks a little courage revived in her but you have heard it she answered not from you said hanaud so for a second time in that room she told the history of that night only this time the sunlight was warm upon the world the comfortable sounds of lifes routine were borne through the windows and the girl herself wore the inconspicuous blue serge of a thousand other girls afoot that morning these trifles of circumstance took the edge of sheer horror off her narrative so that to tell the truth mr ricardo was a trifle disappointed he wanted a crescendo motive in his music whereas it had begun at its fortissimo hanaud however was the perfect listener he listened without stirring and with most compassionate eyes so that joan carew spoke only to him and to him each moment that passed with greater confidence the life and sparkle of her had gone altogether there was nothing in her manner now to suggest the waywardness the gay irresponsibility the radiance which had attracted calladine the night before she was just a very young and very pretty girl telling in a low and remorseful voice of the tragic dilemma to which she had brought herself of celymne all that remained was something exquisite and fragile in her beauty in the slimness of her figure in her daintiness of hand and foot something almost of the hothouse but the story she told was detail for detail the same which calladine had already related thank you said hanaud when she had done now i must ask you two questions i will answer them mr ricardo sat up he began to think of a third question which he might put himself something uncommonly subtle and searching which hanaud would never have thought of but hanaud put his questions and ricardo almost jumped out of his chair you will forgive me miss carew but have you ever stolen before joan carew turned upon hanaud with spirit then a change swept over her face you have a right to ask she answered never she looked into his eyes as she answered hanaud did not move he sat with a hand upon each knee and led to his second question early this morning when you left this room you told mr calladine that you would wait at the semiramis until he telephoned to you yes yet when he telephoned you had gone out yes why i will tell you said joan carew i could not bear to keep the little diamond chain in my room for a moment even hanaud was surprised he had lost sight of that complication now he leaned forward anxiously indeed with a greater anxiety than he had yet shown in all this affair i was terrified continued joan carew i kept thinking they must have found out by now they will search everywhere i didnt reason i lay in bed expecting to hear every moment a loud knocking on the door besides the chain itself being there in my bedroom her chain the dead womans chain no i couldnt endure it i felt as if i had stolen it then my maid brought in my tea you had locked it away cried hanaud yes my maid did not see it joan carew explained how she had risen dressed wrapped the chain in a pad of cottonwool and enclosed it in an envelope the envelope had not the stamp of the hotel upon it it was a rather large envelope one of a packet which she had bought in a crowded shop in oxford street on her way from euston to the semiramis she had bought the envelopes of that particular size in order that when she sent her letter of introduction to the director of the opera at covent garden she might enclose with it a photograph and to whom did you send it asked mr ricardo to mrs blumenstein at the semiramis i printed the address carefully then i went out and posted it where hanaud inquired in the big letterbox of the post office at the corner of trafalgar square hanaud looked at the girl sharply you had your wits about you i see he said what if the envelope gets lost said ricardo hanuad laughed grimly if one envelope is delivered at its address in london today it will be that one he said the news of the crime is published you see and he swung round to joan did you know that miss carew no she answered in an awestricken voice well then it is let us see what the special investigator has to say about it and hanaud with a deliberation which mr ricardo found quite excruciating spread out the newspaper on the table in front of him iv there was only one new fact in the couple of columns devoted to the mystery mrs blumenstein had died from chloroform poisoning she was of a stout habit and the thieves were not skilled in the administration of the ansthetic its murder none the less said hanaud and he gazed straight at joan asking her by the direct summons of his eyes what she was going to do i must tell my story to the police she replied painfully and slowly but she did not hesitate she was announcing a meditated plan hanaud neither agreed nor differed his face was blank and when he spoke there was no cordiality in his voice well he asked and what is it that you have to say to the police miss that you went into the room to steal and that you were attacked by two strangers dressed as apaches and masked that is all yes and how many men at the semiramis ball were dressed as apaches and wore masks come make a guess a hundred at the least i should think so then what will your confession do beyond i quote your english idiom putting you in the coach mr ricardo now smiled with relief hanaud was taking a definite line his knowledge of idiomatic english might be incomplete but his heart was in the right place the girl traced a vague pattern on the tablecloth with her fingers yet i think i must tell the police she repeated looking up and dropping her eyes again mr ricardo noticed that her eyelashes were very long for the first time hanauds face relaxed and i think you are quite right he cried heartily to mr ricardos surprise tell them the truth before they suspect it and they will help you out of the affair if they can not a doubt of it come i will go with you myself to scotland yard thank you said joan and the pair drove away in a cab together hanaud returned to grosvenor square alone and lunched with ricardo it was all right he said the police were very kind miss joan carew told her story to them as she had told it to us fortunately the envelope with the aluminium chain had already been delivered and was in their hands they were much mystified about it but miss joans story gave them a reasonable explanation i think they are inclined to believe her and if she is speaking the truth they will keep her out of the witnessbox if they can she is to stay here in london then asked ricardo oh yes she is not to go she will present her letters at the opera house and secure an engagement if she can the criminals might be lulled thereby into a belief that the girl had kept the whole strange incident to herself and that there was nowhere even a knowledge of the disguise which they had used hanaud spoke as carelessly as if the matter was not very important and ricardo with an unusual flash of shrewdness said it is clear my friend that you do not think those two men will ever be caught at all hanaud shrugged his shoulders there is always a chance but listen there is a room with a hundred guns one of which is loaded outside the room there are a hundred pigeons one of which is white you are taken into the room blindfold you choose the loaded gun and you shoot the one white pigeon that is the value of the chance but exclaimed ricardo those pearls were of great value and i have heard at a trial expert evidence given by pearl merchants all agree that the pearls of great value are known so when they come upon the market that is true hanaud interrupted imperturbably but how are they known by their weight said mr ricardo exactly replied hanaud but did you not also hear at this trial of yours that pearls can be peeled like an onion no it is true remove a skin two skins the weight is altered the pearl is a trifle smaller it has lost a little of its value yes but you can no longer identify it as the soandso pearl which belonged to this or that sultan was stolen by the vizier bought by messrs lustre and steinopolis of hatton garden and subsequently sold to the wealthy mrs blumenstein no your pearl has vanished altogether there is a new pearl which can be traded he looked at ricardo who shall say that those pearls are not already in one of the queer little back streets of amsterdam undergoing their transformation mr ricardo was not persuaded because he would not be i have some experience in these matters he said loftily to hanaud i am sure that we shall lay our hands upon the criminals we have never failed hanaud grinned from ear to ear the only experience which mr ricardo had ever had was gained on the shores of geneva and at aix under hanauds tuition but hanaud did not argue and there the matter rested the days flew by it was londons playtime the green and gold of early summer deepened and darkened wondrous warm nights under englands pale blue sky when the streets rang with the joyous feet of youth led in clear dawns and lovely glowing days hanaud made acquaintance with the wooded reaches of the thames joan carew sang louise at covent garden with notable success and the affair of the semiramis hotel in the minds of the few who remembered it was already added to the long list of unfathomed mysteries but towards the end of may there occurred a startling development joan carew wrote to mr ricardo that she would call upon him in the afternoon and she begged him to secure the presence of hanaud she came as the clock struck she was pale and agitated and in the room where calladine had first told the story of her visit she told another story which to mr ricardos thinking was yet more strange and yes yet more suspicious it has been going on for some time she began i thought of coming to you at once then i wondered whether if i waited oh youll never believe me let us hear said hanaud patiently i began to dream of that room the two men disguised and masked the still figure in the bed night after night i was terrified to go to sleep i felt the hand upon my mouth i used to catch myself falling asleep and walk about the room with all the lights up to keep myself awake but you couldnt said hanaud with a smile only the old can do that no i couldnt she admitted and oh my nights were horrible until she paused and looked at her companions doubtfully until one night the mask slipped what cried hanaud and a note of sternness rang suddenly in his voice what are you saying with a desperate rush of words and the colour staining her forehead and cheeks joan carew continued it is true the mask slipped on the face of one of the men of the man who held me only a little way it just left his forehead visible no more well asked hanaud and mr ricardo leaned forward swaying between the austerity of criticism and the desire to believe so thrilling a revelation i waked up the girl continued in the darkness and for a moment the whole scene remained vividly with me for just long enough for me to fix clearly in my mind the figure of the apache with the white forehead showing above the mask when was that asked ricardo a fortnight ago why didnt you come with your story then i waited said joan what i had to tell wasnt yet helpful i thought that another night the mask might slip lower still besides i it is difficult to describe just what i felt i felt it important just to keep that photograph in my mind not to think about it not to talk about it not even to look at it too often lest i should begin to imagine the rest of the face and find something familiar in the mans carriage and shape when there was nothing really familiar to me at all do you understand that she asked with her eyes fixed in appeal on hanauds face yes replied hanaud i follow your thought i thought there was a chance now the strangest chance that the truth might be reached i did not wish to spoil it and she turned eagerly to ricardo as if having persuaded hanaud she would now turn her batteries on his companion my whole point of view was changed i was no longer afraid of falling asleep lest i should dream i wished to dream but but you could not suggested hanaud no that is the truth replied joan carew whereas before i was anxious to keep awake and yet must sleep from sheer fatigue now that i tried consciously to put myself to sleep i remained awake all through the night and only towards morning when the light was coming through the blinds dropped off into a heavy dreamless slumber hanaud nodded it is a very perverse world miss carew and things go by contraries ricardo listened for some note of irony in hanauds voice some look of disbelief in his face but there was neither the one nor the other hanaud was listening patiently then came my rehearsals joan carew continued and that wonderful opera drove everything else out of my head i had such a chance if only i could make use of it when i went to bed now i went with that haunting music in my ears the call of paris oh you must remember it but can you realise what it must mean to a girl who is going to sing it for the first time in covent garden mr ricardo saw his opportunity he the connoisseur to whom the psychology of the green room was as an open book could answer that question it is true my friend he informed hanaud with quiet authority the great march of events leaves the artist cold he lives aloof while the tumbrils thunder in the streets he adds a delicate tint to the picture he is engaged upon or recalls his triumph in his last great part thank you said hanaud gravely and now miss carew may perhaps resume her story it was the very night of my dbut she continued i had supper with some friends a great artist carmen valeri honoured me with her presence i went home excited and that night i dreamed again yes this time the chin the lips the eyes were visible there was only a black strip across the middle of the face and i thought nay i was sure that if that strip vanished i should know the man and it did vanish three nights afterwards and you did know the man the girls face became troubled she frowned i knew the face that was all she answered i was disappointed i had never spoken to the man i am sure of that still but somewhere i have seen him you dont even remember when asked hanaud no joan carew reflected for a moment with her eyes upon the carpet and then flung up her head with a gesture of despair no i try all the time to remember but it is no good mr ricardo could not restrain a movement of indignation he was being played with the girl with her fantastic story had worked him up to a real pitch of excitement only to make a fool of him all his earlier suspicions flowed back into his mind what if after all she was implicated in the murder and the theft what if with a perverse cunning she had told hanaud and himself just enough of what she knew just enough of the truth to persuade them to protect her what if her frank confession of her own overpowering impulse to steal the necklace was nothing more than a subtle appeal to the sentimental pity of men an appeal based upon a wider knowledge of mens weaknesses than a girl of nineteen or twenty ought to have mr ricardo cleared his throat and sat forward in his chair he was girding himself for a singularly searching interrogatory when hanaud asked the most irrelevant of questions how did you pass the evening of that night when you first dreamed complete the face of your assailant joan carew reflected then her face cleared i know she exclaimed i was at the opera and what was being given the jewels of the madonna hanaud nodded his head to ricardo it seemed that he had expected precisely that answer now he continued you are sure that you have seen this man yes very well said hanaud there is a game you play at childrens parties is there not animal vegetable or mineral and always you get the answer let us play that game for a few minutes you and i joan carew drew up her chair to the table and sat with her chin propped upon her hands and her eyes fixed on hanauds face as he put each question she pondered on it and answered if she answered doubtfully he pressed it you crossed on the lucania from new york yes picture to yourself the diningroom the tables you have the picture quite clear yes was it at breakfast that you saw him no at luncheon no at dinner she paused for a moment summoning before her eyes the travellers at the tables no not in the diningtable at all then no in the library when you were writing letters did you not one day lift your head and see him no on the promenade deck did he pass you when you sat in your deckchair or did you pass him when he sat in his chair no step by step hanaud took her back to new york to her hotel to journeys in the train then he carried her to milan where she had studied it was extraordinary to ricardo to realise how much hanaud knew of the curriculum of a student aspiring to grand opera from milan he brought her again to new york and at the last with a start of joy she cried yes it was there hanaud took his handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his forehead ouf he grunted to concentrate the mind on a day like this it makes one hot i can tell you now miss carew let us hear it was at a concert at the house of a mrs starlingshield in fifth avenue and in the afternoon joan carew sang she was a stranger to new york and very nervous she saw nothing but a mist of faces whilst she sang but when she had finished the mist cleared and as she left the improvised stage she saw the man he was standing against the wall in a line of men there was no particular reason why her eyes should single him out except that he was paying no attention to her singing and indeed she forgot him altogether afterwards i just happened to see him clearly and distinctly she said he was tall cleanshaven rather dark not particularly young thirtyfive or so i should say a man with a heavy face and beginning to grow stout he moved away whilst i was bowing to the audience and i noticed him afterwards walking about talking to people do you remember to whom no did he notice you do you think i am sure he didnt the girl replied emphatically he never looked at the stage where i was singing and he never looked towards me afterwards she gave so far as she could remember the names of such guests and singers as she knew at that party and that is all she said thank you said hanaud it is perhaps a good deal but it is perhaps nothing at all you will let me hear from you she cried as she rose to her feet miss carew i am at your service he returned she gave him her hand timidly and he took it cordially for mr ricardo she had merely a bow a bow which recognised that he distrusted her and that she had no right to be offended then she went and hanaud smiled across the table at ricardo yes he said all that you are thinking is true enough a man who slips out of society to indulge a passion for a drug in greater peace a girl who on her own confession tried to steal and to crown all this fantastic story it is natural to disbelieve every word of it but we disbelieved before when we left calladines lodging in the adelphi and we were wrong let us be warned you have an idea exclaimed ricardo perhaps said hanaud and he looked down the theatre column of the times let us distract ourselves by going to the theatre you are the most irritating man mr ricardo broke out impulsively if i had to paint your portrait i should paint you with your finger against the side of your nose saying mysteriously i know when you know nothing at all hanaud made a schoolboys grimace we will go and sit in your box at the opera tonight he said and you shall explain to me all through the beautiful music the theory of the tonic solfa they reached covent garden before the curtain rose mr ricardos box was on the lowest tier and next to the omnibus box we are near the stage said hanaud as he took his seat in the corner and so arranged the curtain that he could see and yet was hidden from view i like that the theatre was full stalls and boxes shimmered with jewels and satin and all that was famous that season for beauty and distinction had made its tryst there that night yes this is wonderful said hanaud what opera do they play he glanced at his programme and cried with a little start of surprise we are in luck it is the jewels of the madonna do you believe in omens mr ricardo asked coldly he had not yet recovered from his rebuff of the afternoon no but i believe that carmen valeri is at her best in this part said hanaud mr ricardo belonged to that body of critics which must needs spoil your enjoyment by comparisons and recollections of other great artists he was at a disadvantage certainly tonight for the opera was new but he did his best he imagined others in the part and when the great scene came at the end of the second act and carmen valeri on obtaining from her lover the jewels stolen from the sacred image gave such a display of passion as fairly enthralled that audience mr ricardo sighed quietly and patiently how calv would have brought out the psychological value of that scene he murmured and he was quite vexed with hanaud who sat with his opera glasses held to his eyes and every sense apparently concentrated on the stage the curtains rose and rose again when the act was concluded and still hanaud sat motionless as the sphynx staring through his glasses that is all said ricardo when the curtains fell for the fifth time they will come out said hanaud wait and from between the curtains carmen valeri was led out into the full glare of the footlights with the panoply of jewels flashing on her breast then at last hanaud put down his glasses and turned to ricardo with a look of exultation and genuine delight upon his face which filled that seasonworn dilettante with envy what a night said hanaud what a wonderful night and he applauded until he split his gloves at the end of the opera he cried we will go and take supper at the semiramis yes my friend we will finish our evening like gallant gentlemen come let us not think of the morning and boisterously he slapped ricardo in the small of the back in spite of his boast however hanaud hardly touched his supper and he played with rather than drank his brandy and soda he had a little table to which he was accustomed beside a glass screen in the depths of the room and he sat with his back to the wall watching the groups which poured in suddenly his face lighted up here is carmen valeri he cried once more we are in luck is it not that she is beautiful mr ricardo turned languidly about in his chair and put up his eyeglass so so he said ah returned hanaud then her companion will interest you still more for he is the man who murdered mrs blumenstein mr ricardo jumped so that his eyeglass fell down and tinkled on its cord against the buttons of his waistcoat what he exclaimed its impossible he looked again certainly the man fits joan carews description but he turned back to hanaud utterly astounded and as he looked at the frenchman all his earlier recollections of him of his swift deductions of the subtle imagination which his heavy body so well concealed crowded in upon ricardo and convinced him how long have you known he asked in a whisper of awe since ten oclock tonight but you will have to find the necklace before you can prove it the necklace said hanaud carelessly that is already found mr ricardo had been longing for a thrill he had it now he felt it in his very spine its found he said in a startled whisper yes ricardo turned again with as much indifference as he could assume towards the couple who were settling down at their table the man with a surly indifference carmen valeri with the radiance of a woman who has just achieved a triumph and is now free to enjoy the fruits of it confusedly recollections returned to ricardo of questions put that afternoon by hanaud to joan carew subtle questions into which the name of carmen valeri was continually entering she was a woman of thirty certainly beautiful with a clear pale face and eyes like the night then she is implicated too he said what a change for her he thought from the stage of covent garden to the felons cell from the gay supperroom of the semiramis with its bright frocks and its babel of laughter to the silence and the ignominious garb of the workrooms in aylesbury prison she exclaimed hanaud and in his passion for the contrasts of drama ricardo was almost disappointed she has nothing whatever to do with it she knows nothing andr favart there yes but carmen valeri shes as stupid as an owl and loves him beyond words do you want to know how stupid she is you shall know i asked mr clements the director of the opera house to take supper with us and here he is hanaud stood up and shook hands with the director he was of the world of business rather than of art and long experience of the ways of tenors and primadonnas had given him a goodhumoured cynicism they are spoilt children all tantrums and vanity he said and they would ruin you to keep a rival out of the theatre he told them anecdote upon anecdote and carmen valeri hanaud asked in a pause is she troublesome this season has been replied clements dryly at present she is playing at being good but she gave me a turn some weeks ago he turned to ricardo superstitions her trouble and andr favart knows it she left him behind in america this spring america suddenly cried ricardo so suddenly that clements looked at him in surprise she was singing in new york of course during the winter he returned well she left him behind and i was shaking hands with myself when he began to deal the cards over there she came to me in a panic she had just had a cable she couldnt sing on friday night there was a black knave next to the nine of diamonds she wouldnt sing for worlds and it was the first night of the jewels of the madonna imagine the fix i was in what did you do asked ricardo the only thing there was to do replied clements with a shrug of the shoulders i cabled favart some money and he dealt the cards again she came to me beaming oh she had been so distressed to put me in the cart but what could she do now there was a red queen next to the ace of hearts so she could sing without a scruple so long of course as she didnt pass a funeral on the way down to the opera house luckily she didnt but my money brought favart over here and now im living on a volcano for hes the greatest scoundrel unhung he never has a farthing however much she gives him hes a blackmailer hes a swindler he has no manners and no graces he looks like a butcher and treats her as if she were dirt he never goes near the opera except when she is singing in this part and she worships the ground he walks on well i suppose its time to go the lights had been turned off the great room was emptying mr ricardo and his friends rose to go but at the door hanaud detained mr clements and they talked together alone for some little while greatly to mr ricardos annoyance hanauds good humour however when he rejoined his friend was enough for two i apologise my friend with my hand on my heart but it was for your sake that i stayed behind you have a meretricious taste for melodrama which i deeply deplore but which i mean to gratify i ought to leave for paris tomorrow but i shall not i shall stay until thursday and he skipped upon the pavement as they walked home to grosvenor square mr ricardo bubbled with questions but he knew his man he would get no answer to any one of them tonight so he worked out the problem for himself as he lay awake in his bed and he came down to breakfast next morning fatigued but triumphant hanaud was already chipping off the top of his egg at the table so i see you have found it all out my friend he said not all replied ricardo modestly and you will not mind i am sure if i follow the usual custom and wish you a good morning not at all said hanaud i am all for good manners myself he dipped his spoon into his egg but i am longing to hear the line of your reasoning mr ricardo did not need much pressing joan carew saw andr favart at mrs starlingshields party and saw him with carmen valeri for carmen valeri was there i remember that you asked joan for the names of the artists who sang and carmen valeri was amongst them hanaud nodded his head exactly no doubt joan carew noticed carmen valeri particularly and so took unconsciously into her mind an impression of the man who was with her andr favart of his build of his walk of his type again hanaud agreed she forgets the man altogether but the picture remains latent in her mind an undeveloped film hanaud looked up in surprise and the surprise flattered mr ricardo not for nothing had he tossed about in his bed for the greater part of the night then came the tragic night at the semiramis she does not consciously recognise her assailant but she dreams the scene again and again and by a process of unconscious cerebration the figure of the man becomes familiar finally she makes her dbut is entertained at supper afterwards and meets once more carmen valeri yes for the first time since mrs starlingshields party interjected hanaud she dreams again she remembers asleep more than she remembers when awake the presence of carmen valeri at her supperparty has its effect by a process of association she recalls favart and the mask slips on the face of her assailant some days later she goes to the opera she hears carmen valeri sing in the jewels of the madonna no doubt the passion of her acting which i am more prepared to acknowledge this morning than i was last night affects joan carew powerfully emotionally she goes to bed with her head full of carmen valeri and she dreams not of carmen valeri but of the man who is unconsciously associated with carmen valeri in her thoughts the mask vanishes altogether she sees her assailant now has his portrait limned in her mind would know him if she met him in the street though she does not know by what means she identified him yes said hanaud it is curious the brain working while the body sleeps the dream revealing what thought cannot recall mr ricardo was delighted he was taken seriously but of course he said i could not have worked the problem out but for you you knew of andr favart and the kind of man he was hanaud laughed yes that is always my one little advantage i know all the cosmopolitan blackguards of europe his laughter ceased suddenly and he brought his clenched fist heavily down upon the table here is one of them who will be very well out of the world my friend he said very quietly but there was a look of force in his face and a hard light in his eyes which made mr ricardo shiver for a few moments there was silence then ricardo asked but have you evidence enough yes your two chief witnesses calladine and joan carew you said it yourself there are facts to discredit them will they be believed but they wont appear in the case at all hanaud said wait wait and once more he smiled by the way what is the number of calladines house ricardo gave it and hanaud therefore wrote a letter it is all for your sake my friend he said with a chuckle nonsense said ricardo you have the spirit of the theatre in your bones well i shall not deny it said hanaud and he sent out the letter to the nearest pillarbox mr ricardo waited in a fever of impatience until thursday came at breakfast hanaud would talk of nothing but the news of the day at luncheon he was no better the affair of the semiramis hotel seemed a thousand miles from any of his thoughts but at five oclock he said as he drank his tea you know of course that we go to the opera tonight yes do we yes your young friend calladine by the way will join us in your box that is very kind of him i am sure said mr ricardo the two men arrived before the rising of the curtain and in the crowded lobby a stranger spoke a few words to hanaud but what he said ricardo could not hear they took their seats in the box and hanaud looked at his programme ah it is il ballo de maschera tonight we always seem to hit upon something appropriate dont we then he raised his eyebrows oho do you see that our pretty young friend joan carew is singing in the rle of the page it is a showy part there is a particular melody with a longsustained trill in it as far as i remember mr ricardo was not deceived by hanauds apparent ignorance of the opera to be given that night and of the part joan carew was to take he was therefore not surprised when hanaud added by the way i should let calladine find it all out for himself mr ricardo nodded sagely yes that is wise i had thought of it myself but he had done nothing of the kind he was only aware that the elaborate stagemanagement in which hanaud delighted was working out to the desired climax whatever that climax might be calladine entered the box a few minutes later and shook hands with them awkwardly it was kind of you to invite me he said and very ill at ease he took a seat between them and concentrated his attention on the house as it filled up theres the overture said hanaud the curtains divided and were festooned on either side of the stage the singers came on in their turn the page appeared to a burst of delicate applause joan carew had made a small name for herself that season and with a stifled cry calladine shot back in the box as if he had been struck even then mr ricardo did not understand he only realised that joan carew was looking extraordinarily trim and smart in her boys dress he had to look from his programme to the stage and back again several times before the reason of calladines exclamation dawned on him when it did he was horrified hanaud in his craving for dramatic effects must have lost his head altogether joan carew was wearing from the ribbon in her hair to the scarlet heels of her buckled satin shoes the same dress as she had worn on the tragic night at the semiramis hotel he leaned forward in his agitation to hanaud you must be mad suppose favart is in the theatre and sees her hell be over on the continent by one in the morning no he wont replied hanaud for one thing he never comes to covent garden unless one opera with carmen valeri in the chief part is being played as you heard the other night at supper for a second thing he isnt in the house i know where he is he is gambling in dean street soho for a third thing my friend he couldnt leave by the nine oclock train for the continent if he wanted to arrangements have been made for a fourth thing he wouldnt wish to he has really remarkable reasons for desiring to stay in london but he will come to the theatre later clements will send him an urgent message with the result that he will go straight to clements office meanwhile we can enjoy ourselves eh never was the difference between the amateur dilettante and the genuine professional more clearly exhibited than by the behaviour of the two men during the rest of the performance mr ricardo might have been sitting on a coal fire from his jumps and twistings hanaud stolidly enjoyed the music and when joan carew sang her famous solo his hands clamoured for an encore louder than anyones in the boxes certainly whether excitement was keeping her up or no joan carew had never sung better in her life her voice was clear and fresh as a birds a bird with a soul inspiring its song even calladine drew his chair forward again and sat with his eyes fixed upon the stage and quite carried out of himself he drew a deep breath at the end she is wonderful he said like a man waking up she is very good replied mr ricardo correcting calladines transports we will go round to the back of the stage said hanaud they passed through the iron door and across the stage to a long corridor with a row of doors on one side there were two or three men standing about in evening dress as if waiting for friends in the dressingrooms at the third door hanaud stopped and knocked the door was opened by joan carew still dressed in her green and gold her face was troubled her eyes afraid courage little one said hanaud and he slipped past her into the room it is as well that my ugly familiar face should not be seen too soon the door closed and one of the strangers loitered along the corridor and spoke to a callboy the callboy ran off for five minutes more mr ricardo waited with a beating heart he had the joy of a man in the centre of things all those people driving homewards in their motorcars along the strand how he pitied them then at the end of the corridor he saw clements and andr favart they approached discussing the possibility of carmen valeris appearance in london opera during the next season we have to look ahead my dear friend said clements and though i should be extremely sorry at that moment they were exactly opposite joan carews door it opened she came out with a nervous movement she shut the door behind her at the sound andr favart turned and he saw drawn up against the panels of the door with a look of terror in her face the same gay figure which had interrupted him in mrs blumensteins bedroom there was no need for joan to act in the presence of this man her fear was as real as it had been on the night of the semiramis ball she trembled from head to foot her eyes closed she seemed about to swoon favart stared and uttered an oath his face turned white he staggered back as if he had seen a ghost then he made a wild dash along the corridor and was seized and held by two of the men in evening dress favart recovered his wits he ceased to struggle what does this outrage mean he asked and one of the men drew a warrant and notebook from his pocket you are arrested for the murder of mrs blumenstein in the semiramis hotel he said and i have to warn you that anything you may say will be taken down and may be used in evidence against you preposterous exclaimed favart theres a mistake we will go along to the police and put it right wheres your evidence against me hanaud stepped out of the doorway of the dressingroom in the propertyroom of the theatre he said at the sight of him favart uttered a violent cry of rage you are here too are you he screamed and he sprang at hanauds throat hanaud stepped lightly aside favart was borne down to the ground and when he stood up again the handcuffs were on his wrists favart was led away and hanaud turned to mr ricardo and clements let us go to the propertyroom he said they passed along the corridor and ricardo noticed that calladine was no longer with them he turned and saw him standing outside joan carews dressingroom he would like to come of course said ricardo would he asked hanaud then why doesnt he hes quite grown up you know and he slipped his arm through ricardos and led him back across the stage in the propertyroom there was already a detective in plain clothes mr ricardo had still not as yet guessed the truth what is it you really want sir the propertymaster asked of the director only the jewels of the madonna hanaud answered the propertymaster unlocked a cupboard and took from it the sparkling cuirass hanaud pointed to it and there lost amongst the huge glittering stones of paste and false pearls mrs blumensteins necklace was entwined then that is why favart came always to covent garden when the jewels of the madonna was being performed exclaimed ricardo hanaud nodded he came to watch over his treasure ricardo was piecing together the sections of the puzzle no doubt he knew of the necklace in america no doubt he followed it to england hanaud agreed mrs blumensteins jewels were quite famous in new york but to hide them here cried mr clements he must have been mad why asked hanaud can you imagine a safer hidingplace who is going to burgle the propertyroom of covent garden who is going to look for a priceless string of pearls amongst the stage jewels of an opera house you did said mr ricardo i replied hanaud shrugging his shoulders joan carews dreams led me to andr favart the first time we came here and saw the pearls of the madonna i was on the lookout naturally i noticed favart at the back of the stalls but it was a stroke of luck that i noticed those pearls through my opera glasses at the end of the second act cried ricardo suddenly i remember now yes replied hanaud but for that second act the pearls would have stayed comfortably here all through the season carmen valeri a fool as i told you would have tossed them about in her dressingroom without a notion of their value and at the end of july when the murder at the semiramis hotel had been forgotten favart would have taken them to amsterdam and made his bargain shall we go they left the theatre together and walked down to the grillroom of the semiramis but as hanaud looked through the glass door he drew back we will not go in i think eh why asked ricardo hanaud pointed to a table calladine and joan carew were seated at it taking their supper perhaps said hanaud with a smile perhaps my friend what who shall say that the rooms in the adelphi will not be given up they turned away from the hotel but hanaud was right and before the season was over mr ricardo had to put his hand in his pocket for a wedding present
