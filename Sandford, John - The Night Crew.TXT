the night crew john sandford chapter the corner of gayley and le conte at the edge of the campus frat boys cruised in their impeccably clean racinggreen miatas and cherryred camaro ragtops with their impeccably blonde dates all square shoulders frothy dresses and big white teeth two skinny kids one of each sex smelling of threeday sweat and dressed all in black unwrapped dingdongs and talked loud about jesus and the joy to come celebrating himand vanillacreme filling at the shell station a tanker truck pumped premium down a hole in the concrete pad under the eye of a bigbellied driver and above them all a quartermillion miles out a buttery new moon smiled down as it slid toward the pacific the bee was impatient checking her watch bouncing on her toes she was waiting at the corner a jansport backpack at her feet her face was a pale crescent in the headlights of passing cars in the los angeles neverdark the shell tanker driver stood in a puddle of gasoline fumes chewed a toothpick and watched her in a casual lookingatwomen way the bee was dressed by banana republic in khaki wash pants a tshirt with a queen bee on the chest a photographers vest with fifteen pockets hiking boots and a preppy blacksilk ski mask rolled up and worn as a watch cap when she saw the truck with the dish on the roof she pulled the mask down over her face picked up the backpack and stepped out to the curb the bee had small opaquegreen eyes like turquoise thumbtacks on the black mask anna batory riding without her seatbelt her feet braced on the trucks plastic dashboard saw the bee step out to the curb and pointed there she is creek grunted and eased the truck to the curb anna rolled down the passengerside window and spoke to the mask youre the bee youre late the bee snapped anna glanced at the dashboard clock then back out the window jason said tenthirty jason was sitting in the back of the truck on a gray metal folding chair next to louis he looked up from his sony chipcam and said thats what they told me tenthirty its nowtenthirtythree the bee said she turned her wrist to show the blue face on a stainlesssteel rolex sorry anna said i dont think thats good enough the bee said we might be too late and its all wasted behind the bee the shell gasdelivery man was taking an interest a lot of people in a tv truck and a blonde in a ski mask arguing you better get in anna said she could smell the fumes from the gas as she turned and pushed back the trucks side door louis caught it and pulled it the rest of the way the bee looked at the two men in the back nodded and said jason to jason said nothing to louis and climbed aboard around the corner to westwood then westwood to circle the bee said you know where circle is yeah we know where everything is creek said theyd been everywhere hold on creek took the truck around the corner humming to himself which he did when he was tightening up anna turned back to the bee found the other woman gaping at creek and grinned creek looked vaguely like the wookiee in star wars sixseven overmuscled and hairy he was wearing a usmc sweatshirt with the sleeves and neck torn out tattoos covered his arms just visible through the reddishblond hair on his biceps was an american flag in red blue and appalachiawhite skin deeply tanned with the scrolled sentiment these colors dont run hello anna lifted a hand to break the stare the bee tore her eyes away from creek we need some facts and figures anna said how many people on the raid where youre based what specifically you object tolike that weve got it all here but weve got to hurry the bee said she dug into the backpack came up with a plastic portfolio and took out a sheet of crisp white paper anna flicked on the overhead reading light the press release was tight professional laserprinted a twocolor preprinted logo of a running mustang set off the words free hearts at the top of the page are these quotes from you or from the collective anna asked ticking the paper with a fingernail anything thats in quotes you can attribute to either me or the rat we wrote the statement jointly will we meet the rat anna asked she passed the press release to louis who slipped it in a spring clip on the side of the fax hes in the building now the bee said leaning left to peer past anna out the windshield turn left here she said creek slowed for the turn wed like to get an action quote when they come out as they release the animals anna said no problem we can accommodate that the bee looked at her rolex then back out the window they were right in the middle of the ucla medical complex im sorry im so snappy but when jason agreed to tenthirty we specified exactlytenthirty the raid is already under way anna nodded and turned to louis howre the radios louis martinez sat in an office swivel chair that was bolted to the floor of the truck from the chair he could reach the scanners and transmitters the dual editing stations the fax and phones any of the screens in the steel racks he fiddled with the gear incessantly trying to capture a mental picture of afterdark los angeles in terms of accidents shootings car chases fires riots all clear he said weve got that shooting down in inglewood but that aint much theres a chase down south long beach but its heading the other way track it anna said cop chases had produced at least two famous video clips in the past couple of years if you could get out in front of one and catch it coming by it was a sure sale i got it louis said he pushed his glasses up his nose and grinned at the bee with his screwy nerdcharm whyd you choose bee he asked i didnt want a warm and fuzzy animal thats not the point of animal rescue the bee said her response was remote canned and louis grin slipped a fraction of an inch and thats why steve picked rat jason suggested the bee frowned at the use of rats real name but nodded yes and because we feel a spiritual affinity with our choices in the drivers seat creek grunted again shook his head once quick anna was watching him taking his temperature he didnt like these people and he didnt like the professional pr pointsthe press release the theatrical ski mask too much like a setup and creek was pure a smile curled one corner of annas mouth she could read creeks mind if she could see his eyes creek knew that he glanced at her then deliberately pulled his eyes away and said quickly theres a guy on the corner ahead and to the right a woman in a ski mask was standing on the corner making a hurryupwindmilling motion with one arm thats otter she said and thats the corner of circle they must be outturn right creek took the corner past the waving woman the street tilted uphill and a hundred yards up a cluster of women spilled down a driveway to the street two of them struggling with a blue plastic municipal garbage can a security guard was running down from the top of the hill another one trailing behind got them coming out anna said over her shoulder a quick pulse ran through her not quite excitement but some combination of pleasure and apprehension nobody ever knew for sure what would happen at these things nothing much probably but any time you had guards with guns did the guards have guns she took a halfsecond to look but couldnt tell as she looked she reached behind her lifted the lid on the steel box bolted on the back of her seat pulled the nagra tape recorder from its foam nest jason was looking past her through the windshield at the action and she snapped get ready yes mom he said he fitted a headset over the crown of his head plugged in the earphone creek was driving with one hand pulling on his own headset everybody hear me anna asked speaking into her face mike the radios were oneway anna talked everyone else listened creek said yeah and took the truck over the curb one big bounce and a nosedown squealing full stop jason had braced himself and louis had swiveled to let the chair take the jolt the bee toppled over and yelped shit ahead of them the women carrying the garbage can were jerking and twisting down the driveway doing the media polkalooking for the cameras running for the lights trying to stay away from the guards the raiders had gone into the back of the building over a loading dock the dock was contained inside a fence with a concrete patio big enough for fifteen or twenty cars at least a dozen women all masked milled around the patio then a man ran out of the medical building carrying a small squealing blackandwhite pig then another woman carrying boxes or maybe cages as the truck settled as bee yelped anna was out and running the nagra banging against her leg jason was two steps behind her with the backup sony and creek was out the drivers door his camera up on his shoulder off to annas left bee a little out of shape sputtered in their wake then creek lit up and anna yelled at the man with the pig bring the pig bring the pig this way bring the pig the man saw them coming and walked toward them and she had the nagras mike pointed at the squealing pig and jason lit up the security guards saw the camera lights and the first one turned to the man trailing yelled something to the other who ran back up the hill the first one continued down and shouted at creek hey no cameras here no cameras a group of masked women headed toward him walled him off from the rest of the milling crowd pushed him toward the ramp frustrated he climbed up the loading dock and hurried to the open door just as he was about to go through the door he jumped back and a young man in a blue oxford cloth shirt and jeans ran out of the building and headed toward the lights anna said to the microphone her voice calm even creek theres a kid coming in watch him jason stay with the pig creek backpedaled when anna spoke into his ear hed looked up from his eyepiece and spotted the kid in the blue shirt trouble maybe trouble made good movies the kid was striding toward them a dark smear under his nose one hand cupping his jaw he seemed to be crying they were gonna kill this pig for nothingfor soap tests or something shampoo the masked pigman shouted at jasons camera the pig was freaking out long shrieking bleats like a woman being stabbed shes gonna live now pigman shouted as the pig struggled against him shes gonna live the patio was chaos with the cameras and the pigman the women with cages all swirling around blue shirt arrived and anna saw that he wascrying tears running down his cheeks as creek tracked him with the lens the dark smear was blood which streamed from his nose and across his lips and chin give me that pig he screamed and he ran at the pigman gimme that the animal women blocked him out not hitting him just body blocking both creek and jason tracked the twirling scrum while anna tried to stay out of their line she kept the nagra pointed picking up the overall noise which could be laid back into the tape later if needed the bee caught annas arm hes just a flunky forget him she shouted over the screams and grunting of the struggle but were gonna do the mice now get the mice in the garbage cans the women with the blue garbage can were waiting their turn with the lights and anna spoke into the mike again jason get out of there go over to that blue garbage can its full of mice theyre gonna turn them loose jason took a step back lifted his head spotted the garbage can creek stay with the kid anna said stay with the kid as jason came up the women with the garbage can whod been waiting popped the lid and tipped it and two hundred or three hundred mice some black some white some tan scurried down the sides and ran out onto the patio looked around and headed for the nearest piece of cover jason hung close and then the kid in the blue shirt went that way screaming gimme those and sobbing tried to corral the mice they were everywhere running over his feet over his hands avoiding him making the break he finally gave up and slumped on the ground his head in his hands the mice all around jeez this is almost too good anna thought as creek tracked him the bee came back with her nagging voice do you want an oncamera statement and anna thought whos running this thing but she had to smile at the other womans effective management yeah but wed better hurry anna said the copsll be coming anna said into the mike jason get on the bee shell make a statement she pushed the mike up raised her voice shouted rat where are you the man with the pig turned toward her im the rat he said his teeth were bared his face spotted with what looked like mud but could be pig shit were gonna need you over here we need a comment anna said no problem he said he handed the struggling pig to a woman what exactly do you want the rat had a deep smooth voice a singers baritone his eyes were pale blue behind the black mask just tell us why you did it anna said nodding at jasons camera he leaned forward and stagewhispered for the publicity anna grinned back and said tell that to the camera jason yelled hey rat you wanna do this or what as the rat and the bee talked to jasons camera anna pulled the mike down in front of her face and said creek lets talk to the kid let me in there first creek hung back a couple of steps so the camera wouldnt be right in the kids face anna squatted next to him and patted him on the shoulder are you okay the kid looked up dazed a pale teenage child with brown eyes behind his goldrimmed glasses what are you okay anna asked again theyre gonna fire me he said he looked back at the building i was supposed to watch them they were my responsibility the animals i was supposed to keep everybody out but they came in so fast howd you get the bloody nose anna asked i tried to hold the door but they kicked through then about four of them held me and i couldnt get to the phone and they tipped everything over in the lab all the animal cages everything he touched his face i think the door hit me look theres gonna be two sides to this anna said she looked back at creek and said creek creek stepped away spotted a mouse looking at him from the top of the loading dock and closed in on it behind him the bee and the rat were still talking to jasons camera the pig was still struggling with the woman whod taken it but the squealing had stopped and the scene was almost quiet anna turned back to the kid and continued the animal rights guys will be heroes to some people and some people will be heroes to the scientific community she patted his thigh now go like this from your nose she made an upward rubbing gesture with her hand on her own face the kid gulped why want to keep your job anna grinned at him she was a small woman darkhaired with an oval face and cornflowerblue eyes behind goldrimmed glasses she had an effect on young males be a hero smear a little blood around your face and well put you on camera telling your side believe me they wont fire you i need the job the kid said tentatively smear a little blood and stand up whats your name the kid was no dummy hed been born in front of a tv set he wiped blood up his cheek and said charles mckinley how do i look his cheek looked like a raw sirloin great thats mckinley mckinley charles regular spelling yeah he touched his face again the blood was brilliant red whats your job up there charles anna got a few more details about the job his age where he lived thats really great she said now what the pig screamed and anna turned the woman whod been holding it had carried it toward jasons camera where jason was interviewing the rat as it screamed the animal kicked free and ran the rat stooped and tried to scoop it up like a bouncing football but the pig went through smacked into his ankle and the rat fell squarely on his butt shit he shouted get the pig jason was still on him lights in his face he rolled and the pig now panicked ran behind the woman whod originally held him did another quick turn and as the rat tried to get to his feet ran squarely into the rats chest knocking him flat on his butt again jason stayed with it as the rat scrambled to his feet anna grinned and turned back to the kid tell us what happened talk to this camera anna said pointing at creek creek come on back creek lit up and the kid told his story breaking into tears again as he got caught up with it anna stepped away to watch jason and when the rat got tangled in a long complicated explanation of animal rights she broke in how come all the women in the group there are some guysthey just didnt make it tonight rat said he started to say more when annas cell phone rang she unclipped it and stepped away glanced at creek who was still with the kid yeah louis calling from the truck seventyfive feet away excited jesus anna we got a jumper on wilshire hes on a ledge where a basic rule everything happened at once anna looked back at the two interviewers calculating i dont know somewhere on wilshire close i

he kept the address database cmon cmon im getting it howre we doing on the cops here you got a couplethree minutes i just heard the call get the address louis im hurrying anna turned to creek get

mike her voice urgent jason creek back in the truck now kill the lights move it hey what what jason kept shooting close down get in the truck now creeks light went down and he was moving no questions but the rat shouted at her wait a minute wait whatre hey anna we didnt talk and the rat started toward her anna the phone pressed to her ear walking back toward the truck fumbled a card out of her shirt pocket and thrust it back at the rat call me we gotta go creek yelled at her what we got a jumper she shouted back lets go jason they ran toward the truck louis had climbed into the drivers seat and was backing off the sidewalk as anna and creek came up he jammed it into park and climbed over the seat into the back and jason came through the side creek slipped into the drivers seat and louis shouted down westwood then left on wilshire its three blocks its a place called the shamrock creek i know the place jesus its two minutes from here gotta hustle anna said gotta hustle gotta hustle creek spun the truck in a uturn paused at le conte long enough to make sure he wouldnt hit anything then swept through louis whatever happens with the jumper this animal thing is an atape anna said over her shoulder we want the bloodynosed kid to be a hero jason said that pig really pissed off the rat i think its heading for a barbeque i got a great shot of this little mouse louis really cute creek shouted over his shoulder shut up shut up louis said to them all he had an earphone clamped over one ear then the guys still out there on a ledge theres hotel people talking to him hes from a party highschool kids creek had the gas pedal on the floor and they just caught the light at wilshire as they swept through the intersection anna said to jason give yourself some space on your tape you gotta be ready but the first tape is good too im ready jason said creek creek nodded creek was always ready louis talk to me anna said louis eyes were closed and he was leaning away from them listening hard therere cars on the way we got maybe a minute by ourselves maybe two minutes anna said wheres that three truck werent they still out they were drifting down south after that chase louis said theyre way the hell down by huntington beach theyre out of it anna said jason i want you tight on the guy creek will pull back a bit get the full jump if he goes but i wanna see his face you got it sugarbun jason said creek showed his teeth sugarbun jason grinned at him men anna getting intimate yeah creek glanced at anna who rolled her eyes men anna doing the thing jason said he was almost talking to himself looked as though he might giggle he was wound his eyes big he liked the movement maybe too much he was talented might go big in hollywood someday anna thought if he didnt blow his brains out through his nose doin the thing he muttered shamrock anna said and pointed ahead a twentystory greenglassandsteel building showed a bright green neon shamrock at the top and jason whod crawled between the seats spotted the jumper there he is hes toward the bottom like five or six stories up you can see him he pointed and anna noticed that his hand had a tremor not the trembling of excitement but the jerk of a nerve breakdown she glanced at his stark underfed face christ she thought hes back on the crank she turned away from his straining face and looked where he was looking five stories anna counted and there he was the wouldbe jumper wore dark pants and a white shirt from a block away in the lights that bathed the outside of the building he looked like a fly stuck to a sheet of glass get us there creek anna said breathlessly they were doing seventyfive the wheels screaming right up to the hotel then creek hammered the brake and cut sideways and they went over the curb again and jason spilled out running toward the hotel with his camera the man on the ledge had his back to a sheet of plate glass his arms spread the ledge anna thought wasnt more than a foot wideshe could see the tips of his shoes guys im gonna try to get up there anna said into her mike as she dropped from the truck youre gonna be on your own for a minute jason i want face she sprinted toward the hotels front entrance the nagra flapping under her arm hotels didnt want to know about media as far as hotels were concerned no media was good media anna had two options she could try to sneak in but that took time or she could run she ran forty miles a week on the beach and if the stairs were placed right no hotel security man in california could catch her she hit the glass doors and went through the lobby like she was on a motorcycle two bellmen huddled at the reception desk with a couple of clerks and one of the bellmen saw her and just had time to turn to open his mouth and shout hey when she was past him the elevators were straight ahead and a brass plaque with an arrow pointing to the right said stairs she took the stairs ran up one flight two then a man shouting again from the bottom hey third floor not even breathing hard anna got off at the fourth thered be security on the fifth floor and the desk people might have called them she ran into the hall on the fourth floor looked right and left decided that the right end would be the far end of the hotel there should be another flight of stairs that way she ran down the hall now aware of her heart pounding in her chest turned a corner past a niche with coke ice and candy machines to another stairway she pulled open the door looked up and down heard nothing and ran up to five she took three seconds two long breaths pulled off her headset shoved it with the nagra up under her jacket in back held it with one hand and sauntered into the hallway halfway down three older mensecurity probablystood outside an open doorway a dozen kids were scattered up and down the hall a few of them talking most just looking down at the open door all the kids were dressed up the boys in suits and ties the girls in pinkandblue party dresses all with the stark white look of fear on their faces one of the security men looked toward anna and even leaned her waybut as he did a woman shrieked and the in suits turned and ran through the open door my god anna thought he jumped the girls in pastel dresses were looking at the door the boys were looking at each other all were frozen anna knew that this was one of the moments shed remember they were like sculpture in some modern wisecracking installation called california kids then anna moved and when she did a couple of the girls began sobbing and one of the boys yelled oh no no jacob anna ran lightly down the hall found another open door a few rooms closer than the one where the security men had been she looked inside a man and woman both grayhaired horrified were standing at their window looking out anna stepped inside did he jump the woman whitefaced looked at her her mouth working nothing coming out then oh my god anna stepped around an open suitcase walked across the room and looked out the window the jumper was facedown a blackandwhite silhouette on the yellow stone six feet from the pool ten feet from the body jason was moving in with his camera from across the pool creek also focused on the body anna took out the recorder hit the record switch held it by her side didnt hide it just held it like a purse what happened she asked i dont know i think it was just kids having a party they were making noise we could hear them running in the hallway the next thing we know people were screaming and the hotel people came anna could feel the recorder taking up tape did you see him go she asked the grayhaired man i think he was coming in the man said he turned and it was like he lost his balance and all of a sudden he jumped like he was trying to make the pool the woman turned to her husband jim lets get out of here anna stepped back looked at the luggage tag on the suitcase james madson tilly ok are you mr and mrs madson the woman turned toward her yes yes are you with the hotel wed like to check out youd have to talk with the people downstairs are you all right maam what is your name lucille im all right but the man the boy he jim i think im going to throw up she started toward the bathroom with her husband behind her one hand in the middle of her back patting her and anna stepped to the door and looked out hotel security was there in force along with four or five uniformed cops she stepped back said madson madson tilly oklahoma tilly to the nagra then popped the recording tape and slipped it inside the waistband of her pants she had two spare tapes in a black pouch on the carrying strap she took out a spare slipped it into the recorder hotel security usually didnt ask if they could have the tape they simply took it destroyed it and apologized later anna stepped into the hall two of the men whod been in the room were just coming back out hotel security and a managertype before either could say anything anna said could somebody help my mother i think shes gonna be sick the managertype asked whats wrong she saw the man jump shes in the bathroom the manager went by into the madsons room while the security man ran down the hall toward the elevators anna turned the other way and walked back down the hall to the steps into the stairwell down and around and around to the first floor pause listen nothing she stepped into the hallway saw a sign that said parking ramp and went that way creek was standing fifty feet from the body no blood no movement nothing but a hotel clerk and three cops walking reluctantly toward it creek saw her coming and made his openhanded got anything gesture shed pulled the headset back on quick quotes from a witness she said into the mike they said there was some kind of party before he jumped or fell or whatever anna spotted jason headed toward them creek look up there fifth floor about one two three four five windows to the right of the jumpers window see where the curtain comes through creek nodded im gonna see if i can get the madsons to come over there jason came up and anna asked howd you do i got his face all the way to the ground jason said with trembling satisfaction he hit twenty feet away thats great anna said look up there to the left of where he was i want you to yell jim and lucille madson come to the window what jim and lucille dont have the lungs for it you got nice lungs jason said and his eyes seemed to loop stoned or coming down too much of this lately the last time shed gone to pick him up hed been wrecked just yell the names huh she said yes mom jason yelled and after a minute the madsons came to the window and peered out get them anna asked creek had the camera on the window yes the madsons went inside and jason dropped the camera off his shoulder his face suddenly somber you know what what look we gotta get i think im gonna hurl anna leaned closer to him what the heck are you doing jase are you stoned no no no im just having a little trouble dealing with this jason said he looked at the body at what anna cocked her head puzzled im just my heads fucked up he said then anna im sorry but i gotta go he said he pulled off the headset and handed it to her shamefaced im sorry but ive never seen this before ive seen bodies but this was he was smiling at me he turned his knees in so he was standing on the edges of his tennis shoes head down like an embarrassed little boy i gotta go you gotta couple of bucks i could borrow until we sell this shit take it out of my cut anna stared at him for a second concerned not angry jase how bad is it its nothing jason insisted youre probably done for tonight anyway you gotta couple of bucks yeah sure anna said she dug in her pants pocket came up with a short roll of twenties gave him two thanks and he went hurrying away across the stone patio creek peering after him in the background they could hear sirens fire rescue too late what was that all about anna asked watching as jason went out of the street creek shook his head i dont know well anna hoisted the camera looked through the eyepiece focused on the group of cops around the body and ran off fifteen seconds of tape then she ran it back fortyfive seconds and replayed the jump was there in and out of focus but undeniably real taking her breath away and at the last second the mans arms flailing his face passing through the rectangle of the lens display then the unyielding stone patio jeez she said she looked at creek this is she groped for a concept and found one this is hollywood creek muttered better go the pigs are about to fly she nodded and they headed for the truck walking fast but not too fast the cops were disorganized at the moment but five minutes from now they wouldnt be this would not be a good time to be noticed louis had backed the truck into the street jockeyed it into a noparking zone wheres jason he asked as anna and creek unloaded the cameras took off anna shrugged how come did he shoot it yeah he got some great stuff anna said i dont know what his problem is he freaked dont sound like the jason we know and love louis said puzzled an ambulance went by and creek turned the truck in another u and they headed through light traffic back west down wilshire we get it all louis asked we got it all anna said the jump is an aplusplus probably the best thing weve ever had exclusive im gonna sell it with the pig as a package as a poke louis said yeah lets find a spot where we can see the mountain anna pushed a speeddial button on the cell phone waited a moment then said let me speak to jack hatton anna batory tell him im on wilshire at the shamrock hotel creek looked at her curiously and louis said hatton whyre you calling hatton revenge anna said and grinned at him jack hatton came on ten seconds later his voice the perfect pitch of good cheer anna how you doing dont how you doing me anna shouted into the phone remember the swimming cats i hope you got lots more cat tape you jerk because we got the jumper coming off the ledge all the way down two cameras in focus twenty feet and there was nobody else here so go watch channel five

bleeding and when you see it on five seven nine eleven thirteen seventeen and nineteen tomorrow you can explain that too dickweed anna a pleading note now go away and she clicked off beside her creek grinned im proud a ya he said from the back louis said such language we really gonna blow off three no anna said but theyll be sweating blood im gonna jack them up for every nickel in their freelance budget most excellent louis said with great satisfaction get me a place where i can see the mountain and i will crank this puppy out anna punched the next speeddial button ill start selling chapter all done anna sat in comfort and quiet at her kitchen table a cup of steaming chickennoodle soup in front of her pricking up her nose with its oily saltiness she yawned rubbed the back of her neck her eyes were scratchy from the long night at moments like this coming down in the predawn cool creek and louis already headed home she thought of cigarettes and of younger days sitting in allnight jointsa bennys maybeeating blueberry pie with a cardboard crust drinking coffee talking smoking chesterfields some old name luckies gauloises or players when you were posing she didnt do that any more now she went home sometimes she cried a little weep didnt make her feel much better but did help her sleep anna batory was a small woman going on fivethree with black hair cut close skaterstyle or fencerstyle and she might have been a fencer with her thin railhard body the toughness was camouflaged by her oval face and white california smilebut she ran six miles every afternoon on the sand along the ocean and spent three hours a week working with weights at a serious gym anna wasnt pretty but she wasnt plain she was handsome or striking a woman whod wear well into old age if that ever came she thought her nose should have been shorter and her shoulders just a bit narrower her hands were as large as a mansshe could span a ninth on the steinway upright in the hall and fake a tenth she had pale blue killer eyes one of her ancestors had ruled poland and had fought the russians anna pushed herself away from the table and carrying her cup of soup prowled her house making sure that everything was right looking out windows touching her stuff talking to it now what happened to you old pot has creek been messing with you youre over here by the picture not way out at the edge sometimes she thought she was going crazy but it was a happy kind of craziness anna lived on the linnie canal in the heart of venice a halfmile from the pacific in an oldfashioned white clapboard house with a blueshingled roof the house made a sideways l the right half of the house including the tiny front porch was set back from the street the singlecar garage on the left side went right out to the street the small yard created by the l was wrapped in a white picket fence and inside the fence anna grew a jungle venice was coming backwas even fashionablebut shed lived on linnie since the bad old days anyone vaulting the fence would find himself knee deep in daggerlike spanish bayonet combatready cactus and the thorniest desert brush if he made it through hed fall facedown bloody and bruised in a soft bed of perennials and aromatic herbs the interior of annas house was as carefully cultivated as the yard the walls were of real plaster would hold a nail and were layered with a halfcenturys worth of paint hardwood floors glistened where the sun broke through the windows polished by feet and beach sand they squeaked when she walked on them and were cool on the soles of her feet the lower floor included a comfortable living room and spare bedroom both filled with craftsman furniture a bathroom a small den that she used as an office and the kitchen took up the rest of the floor the kitchen was barely functional anna had no interest in cooking the fact is creek told her once your main cooking appliance is a toaster creek liked to cook he considered himself an expert on stews on the second floor of annas house under the steep roof were her bedroom and an oversized bathroom creek and four of his larger friends had helped her bring in the tub hoisting it from outside with an illegal assist from a power company cherrypicker the tub was a rectangular monstrosity in which she could float freely touching neither bottom nor sides nor ends in which she could get her waas smooth and round as a river pebble in the adjoining bedroom the queensized bed was covered with a quilt made by her mother the material taken from clothes her parents had worn out when they were young under the canalside window the quilt looked like rags of pure light creek and louis had dropped her at the corner of dell and linnie just after dawn the truck couldnt conveniently turn around on linnie a deadend street no wider than most city alleys sorry about the witch louis said the witch would be calling her anna hated to bring work back to her house thats okay anna said for this one time anyway she waved goodbye with the cell phone and walked down the narrow street to her house a neighbor in his pajamas out to pick up the paper said hey anna anything interesting guy jumped off a building anna said nasty he smiled though as he shook his head and said ill watch for it and padded back inside anna had sold thirteen packages of the jumper wrapped with the animal rights raid at fifteen hundred dollars for local transmission shed sold to nine stations and at three thousand for the networkssouthern california stations outshed sold four hatton at channel three had called back twice pushing they wanted it had to have it finally said the witch would call she did five minutes after anna got home the cell phone buzzed and anna went to the kitchen table and picked it up screw us on this well never use your stuff again the witch opened as she usually did with a direct threat we can live with that anna said she looked out the kitchen window at the dark line of the canal in a couple of hours the reflected ball of the morning sun would start crawling down its length steaming the water bringing up the rich smell of algae soup shed been asleep in bed this whole conversation no more than a pleasant memory we already told hatton that i only agreed to talk to you as a courtesy courtesy my large white lithuanian butt the witch snapped anna could hear the pause as she hit on a cigarette if we dont buy you lose a big source of your income gone she said exhaling outa here i promise you we wont buy again you take a bigger hit than we do anna said you never know when were

be gone in a year or two and well sell to your replacement and well make our point you dont steal from us even if its swimming cats i apologized for that the witch shrilled what anna shouted she

price to creek whose laughter filled the background anna grinned and said were dropping thirtyfive thousand bucks in the potthats three times the record creek shouted at the phone we might as well quit well never do this again howre the radios louis anna asked good nothing happening call me anna hung up with creek still laughing about the money shed wait until creek had dropped louis and there was no chance of recovering for a quick run good stuff sometimes broke just at dawn although the regular station trucks would be out prowling around fairly soon waiting for bed anna trailed by the steinway touched a few keys yawned flipped through the sheets for liszts sonata in b minor shed been trying to clarify the fingerwork in the fast passages she didnt sit downher head wasnt quite right yet she put the music on the piano said hello to a couple of plants enjoyed the quiet went into the utility room and got a plastic watering can and filled it barefoot humming to herselfsomething stupid from les misйrablesthat she couldnt get out of her mindanna took the watering can out to the porch and started watering the potted plants geraniums and some daisies plants with an oldfashioned feel bright touches in the shade of the jungle back inside she refilled the can and walked through the house checking with two fingers the soil in a hundred more plants some of them were named after movie stars or singers like paul robert faye susan julia jack most were small from a desert somewhere on a brokendown salvation army table the first piece of furniture shed bought in california she kept a piece of wisconsin a clump of birdsfoot violets dug from the banks of the whitewater river and a flat of liliesofthevalley just now the liliesofthevalley were blooming their tiny white bell flowers producing a delicate perfume that reminded her of the smell of dooryard lilacs in the midwestern spring behind the california tan anna was a midwestern farm kid born and raised on a corn farm in wisconsin the farm was part of her toughness she had a farm kids lack of fear when it came to physical confrontation shed even been in a couple of fights in her twenties in the good old days of music school and latenight prowls down sunset as she climbed into her thirties the adrenaline charge diminished though her reputation hadnt the big guys still waved to her from the muscle pen on the beach and told people you dont fuck with anna if you wanna keep your face on straight the toughness extended to the psychological farm kids knew how the world worked right from the start shed taken the fuzzycoated bigeyed lambs to the locker and brought them back in little white packages thats the way it was anna finished watering the plants yawned again and stopped at the piano liszt was hard deliberately hard her home phone rang and she turned away from the piano and stepped into the small kitchen and picked it up this would be the signoff from louis and creek hello anna louis all done yeah but i was talking to a guy at seventeen about the animal rescue tape i dont know what they did but it sounds a little weird like how weird anna asked like theyre making some kind of cartoon out of it what she was annoyed but only mildly strange things happened in the world of broadcast television he said theyll be running it on the worm louis said channel seventeen called it the early bird news everybody else called it the worm anna glanced at the kitchen clock the broadcast was just a few minutes away ill take a look at it she said she went back to the piano and worked on the liszt until five oclock in the morning then pointed the remote at the tv and punched in seventeen a carefullycoiffed blonde dressed like it was midafternoon on rodeo looked out and said if you have any small children watching this show the film we are about to show you and there was the jumper up on the wall like a fly anna held her breath fearing for him though shed been there and knew what was about to happen but seeing it this way with the tv was like looking out a window and seeing it all over again the man seemed unsure of where he was of what to do he might have been trying at the last moment to get inside then he lost it anna felt her own fingers tightening looking for purchase felt her own muscles involuntarily trying to balance he hung there but with nothing to hold on to out over the air until with a convulsive effort he jumped and he screamedanna hadnt seen the scream hadnt picked it up maybe he hadbeen trying for the pool anna and the night crew had been there for the pictures not as reporters anna had gotten only enough basic information to identify the main characters she left it to the tv news staff to pull it together at channel seventeen the job went to an intense young woman in a spiffy green suit that precisely matched her spiffy green eyes identified as jacob harper junior a highschool senior from san dimas who was attending a spring dance at the shamrock and whod rented the room with a halfdozen other seniors police are investigating the possibility of a drug involvement as she spoke the tape ran again in slow motion then again freezing on the boys facenot a man anna thought just a child he hung there in midair screaming forever on jasons tape the madsons from tilly oklahoma were also shown but their faces at the window were cut into the jump so it appeared that the madsons were watchingas they had been though not when the tape was shot at the end of the report the tape was run again and anna recognized the symptoms they had a hit on their hands too bad about the kid but shed learned to separate herself from the things she covered if she didnt shed go crazy and she hadnt seen the jump only the aftermath the heap of crumpled clothing near the pool less than she would have seen sitting at her tv eating her breakfast like a few million angelenos were about to do anna drifted away from the television sat at the piano and started running scales scales were a form of meditation demanding but also a way to free herself from the tension of the night and she could keep an eye on the television while she worked through them five minutes after the report on the jump the blonde anchor now idiotically cheerful said something about animal commandos and a version of the animal rights tape came up the tape had been cut up and given a jittery silentmovie jerkiness a laurelandhardy quality as the masked animal rights raiders apparently danced with the squealing pig and dumped the garbage can full of mice then the rat was bowled over by the pigthey ran him falling crawling knocked down again and falling crawling and knocked down again they had him going up and down like a yoyo the guards whod come and gone so quickly had been caught briefly by both creek and jason now they were repeatedly shown across the concrete ramp and up the loading dock and then the tape was run backward so they seemed to run backward keystone kops the tape was funny and anna grinned as she watched no sign of the bloodied kid though no matter hed get his fifteen seconds on another channel good night anna said pointed the remote at the television and killed it she worked on scales for another ten minutes then closed the lid of the piano quickly checked on the back to see that the yellow dehumidifier light wasnt blinking and headed up to the bedroom in the world of the night crew roaming los angeles from ten oclock until dawn anna was tough in more subtle relationships in friendly talk from men she didnt know at parties she felt awkward uneasy and walked away alone this shyness had come late she hadnt always been like that the one big affair of her lifealmost four years long now seven years pasthad taken her heart and she hadnt yet gotten it back she was asleep within minutes of her head touching her pillow she didnt dream of anyone no old lovers no old times but she did feel the space around herself in her dreams full of friends and still somehow empty chapter the twofaced man hurried down the darkened pier saw the light in the side window in the back he carried an eighteeninch craftsman boxend wrench the kind used in changing trailerhitch balls the heft was right just the thing no noise he stopped briefly at the store window looked in past the closedsign all dark in the sales areabut he could see light coming from under a closed door that led to the back he beat on the door a rough frantic bambambambambam hey take an aspirin the twofaced man nearly jumped out of his shoes a black man was walking by carrying a bait bucket a tackle box and a long spinning rod what was this trouble but the fisherman was walking on out toward the end of the pier shaking his head oh okay he mustve been beating on the door too hard thats what it was the man forced a smile nodded his head had to be careful he balled his hand into a fist and bit hard on the knuckles bit until he bled the pain clearing his mind back to business he couldnt allow himself to blow up like this if there were a mistake a chance encounter a random cophe shuddered at the thought theyd lock him in a cage like a rat hed driven over here at ninety miles an hour if hed been stopped it all would have ended before he had her couldnt allow that he tried again with the door knocking sedately as though he were sane light flooded into the interior of the store through the door at the back the man knocked again noticed the blood trickling down the back of his hand when did that happen how did he the door opened yeah the boys eyes were dulled with dope but not so dulled not so far gone that they didnt drop to his shirt to the deep red patina that crusted the shirt from neckline to navel not so far gone that the doper couldnt say jesus christ what happened to you the twofaced man didnt answer he was already swinging the wrench the box end caught the boy on the bridge of the nose and he went down as though hed been struck by lightning the twofaced man turned and looked up the pier toward the street then down toward the ocean end nobody around good he stepped inside closed the door the boy had rolled to his knees was trying to get up the man grabbed him by the hair and dragged him into the back the doper was wrecked as in train wreck as in broken as in dying even through the layers of acid and speed he could feel the pain but he wasnt sure about it he might wake up he might still say fuck me what a trip he had done that in the past this stuff hed peeled off the slick white paper this was some bad shit abad batch of chemicals mustve got some glue in there or something he wasnt sure if the pain was the real thing or just another artifact of his own imagination an imagination that had grown up behind the counter in a video store renting horror stories the horror stories had planted snakes in his minds dreammemories of bittenoff heads chainsaw massacres cut throats women bricked into walls so jason suffered and groaned and tried to cover himself and frothed and somewhere in the remnant of his working brain he wondered is this real it was real all right the twofaced man kicked him in the chest and ribs broke away from jasons breastbone jason choked on a scream made bubbles instead the man was sweating and unbelieving jason sat on the floor of the shack his eyes open blood running from his mouth and ears and still he said nothing but aw man the man had been hoping for more hed hoped that the doper would plead with him beg whimper that would excite him would give him the taste of victory that hadnt happened and the heavy workkicking the boy to death had grown boring the boy didnt plead didnt argue he just groaned and said aw man or sometimes dude tell me what its like when you fuck her the man crooned tell me about her tits again cmon tell me tell me again what its like when you do the thing he kicked him again and jason groaned rocked with the blow and one arm jerked spasmodically tell me what its like to fuck her no response maybe a moan tell me about creek he looks like a monster he looks like bigfoot tell me about creek was he with you two were all three of you fucking her all three at once but the doper wasnt talking he was in nevernever land fuck you the twofaced man said finally he was tired of this he could hear the ocean pounding against the pilings below them a rhythmic roar he took a longbarreled smith wesson revolver from his coat pocket and showed it to the bubbling wreck on the floor see this im gonna shoot you man dude jason was long past recognizing anything even his own imminent death the killer realized he squatted gonna shoot you he pointed the pistol at the forehead and when the roar of the surf started to build again fired it once the boys head bumped back that was all the twofaced man waited for some sensation nothing came well shit he said hed been having more fun when the doper was alive had he really fucked her anna he had all the details so maybe he had he stood up pulled open the window on the oceanside wall and looked down deep water everything dark but he could hear the water hissing and boiling just like it should be he thought looking out for this kind of scene chapter at a little after one oclock anna stirred then woke all at once aware first of her pillow then the room then the faint whine of a jumbo jet blowing out of lax she lay in bed for a few minutes rolled over looked at the clock yawned sat up and stretched showered washed her hair anna liked dresses a little on the hippie side small flowers and low necklines when she wasnt working or working out for work she had a carefully thoughtout uniform designed to make her fit in as many social slots as possible the uniform consisted of creamcolored silk or white cotton blouses with black slacks expensive black boots and one of several linen or light woolen jackets depending on the season she had three hermиs silk scarves and always carried one or another in a buttoned inside pocket along with a pair of gold earrings if she dumped the jacket in the truck and rolled the sleeves on the blouse she was hanging out if she wore the coat she was all business still casual but working if she added the scarf and earrings she could get by at anything short of a formal affair even at a formal affair she could pass as a caterer any of the looks might be necessary in a nights work doing reconnaissance before the cameras lit up especially if the work scene involved cops or security people allergic to publicity she also needed a more formal look if shed be oncamera herself she didnt like going oncameraanonymity made everything easierbut sometimes an interviewer was necessary when there was no choice she needed the right look for the camera guys appearance didnt matter there was no way to camouflage the video lights now out of the shower she dried her hair pulled on a pair of shorts and a tshirt and laced her running shoes stopped in the kitchen for a glass of orange juice bracing against the wall to loosen her calves as she drank it the day was fine cool with blue skies and a light breeze from the ocean the beach was a halfmile away and she loosened up as she walked over on venice boulevard then took a finger street down to the beach a very large black man whod once been a secondstringlinebacker for the la raiders was doing pullups on a rack set into the sand he lifted a hand to anna continuing the pullup with only one hand anna waved back and continued on to the waters edge turned right and started running six miles three miles up three miles back she ran along the surf through the shore birds a quarter mile behind another runner feeling the sun when she started running her brain was empty the further along the beach she got the more it filled up maybe go south tonight havent been south for a while wonder what happened to that burned kid at that house fire the last time we went south kid was trying to save a cat wasnt he could be a feature on his recovery itd have to be the first item on the run louis could get a phone number on the other hand it might be a bone to throw to channel seventeen six miles a little over fortytwo minutes when she got back the linebacker was sitting on the bottom bench of the basketball bleachers putting braces on his knees hey dick anna said howre the knees snapcracklepop just like cornflakes he said rice krispies anna said yeah whatever aint been gettin nothing but worse gonna have to decide anna said i know he pushed himself up hobbled around the edge of the court so stiff i couldnt walk down to the water take the knife man anna said anythings better than this scared of the knife they put me to sleep i dont think ill wake up ill die in there oh come on dick they talked for another five minutes then anna headed home as she left the sad linebacker said if i could run half as good as you id still be playing the cell phone was chirping when she got home louis again ready to set up for the new night a little early for that hello not louis this is sergeant hardesty with the santa monica police he sounded a little surprised to be talking with someone is this anna batory he pronounced her name battery batory she said she spread her business cards around and often got tips on the cell phone whats happening maam im sorry but theres been an accident one of the persons involved carried a card in his billfold that said you should be contacted in case of trouble she didnt track for a second and then the smile died on her face oh my god creek anna said is his name creek i dont know maam the voice said shading toward professional sorrow i dont have an identification on the person could you go down there the body was on the beach just at the waterline if shed run another five or six miles that morning she would have tripped over it a line of three cop cars two with light bars and a plain white institutional chevy marked the spot a medical examiners van sat ten feet above the water the longest fingers of surf running up between its tires at the back of the van a cluster of civil servants gathered around what looked like a pile of seaweed a body covered with a wet green blanket two uniformed cops kept a semicircle of gawkers on the far side of the cop cars out on the ocean two jet skis chased each other in endless wavehopping circles their motors like distant chain saws beyond them a badlyhandled sloop pushed south toward marina del rey its jib flogging in the stiffening breeze anna trudged across the sand toward the cop cars with a growing dread shed tried to call creek at home but thered been no answer creek was always out on the water shed thought any number of times that he would someday die there one of the uniformed cops sidled along the line of cars cutting off her line they called me she said pointing toward the group on the waterline they think thats a friend of mine if you could just wait here she waited by the cars while the cop walked down to the group by the water and said something to a plainclothesman who looked briefly at anna and nodded the cop waved her over and passed her on his way back to the car hot he said as he passed and he added hope its not your friend anna jerked her head in a nod but the kind words did nothing to help the growing sourness in the back of her throat at the water a balding man in jeans and a tshirt squatted beside the body probing it two more men sat on the bumper of a medical examiners truck chatting one with a set of walkman headphones around his neck two plainclothes cops one male one female were watching the man at the body as anna came up they both turned to her the woman cop wore designer jeans with a crisp white blouse and carried a blue blazer folded over one arm her round retrochic sunglasses might have been stolen from one of the three blind mice she was darkhaired and darkcomplected a little taller than anna with a square chin and square white teeth she carried an automatic pistol in a shoulder rig her partner was a large man balding grayhaired a little too heavy with deep crowsfeet at the corners of his eyes his clothes were straight from jcpenney and his black wingtips and pant cuffs would be filled with sand like the woman hed taken his jacket off and carried what appeared to be an antique smith wesson revolver on his belt there was an odd body language between them anna noticed when they moved even a foot or two the guy tracked her but the woman was unaware of it the man smiled and the woman wrinkled her nose as though anna were a smudge on an antique table im jim wyatt the cop said this is my partner pam glass the woman nodded cool behind her glasses wyatt frowned then said do i know you ive met you i do tv news cop stuff anna said youve probably seen me around wyatt nodded grinned again the openness of a good interrogator thats it you were at that raid on the burglary ring god couple of years ago they thought the guys had killed that woman on marguerita anna pointed a finger at him felt as though she was babbling she didnt want to look at the body shed do anything to delay it you were the guy who kicked the door a good piece of tape the cops filtering across a yard to the target house while a neighbors dog went crazy barking wyatt drawing his gun waiting for others to get in position but not waiting too long because of the dog then he turned the corner of the house with two guys in body armor and they took down the door creek had gotten the good shots and the copsd taken three men a woman and two hundred pieces of stolen electronic equipment out of the place everything from home blood pressure kits to cell phones and bread machines there really hadnt been much danger but the tape was nice stalling dont be creek dont be creek that was me wyatt said flattered that she remembered pleased to meet her again hed been a hero for several hours are you still doing the tv stuff anna nodded yeah same stuff cops fires fights accidents movie stars a lot of police officers dont like to be called cops glass said breaking in i know anna said she glanced toward the blanketan army blanket olive drab the man squatting next to it was doing something to an exposed paperwhite ankle looked too small to be creek and too white no shoe or sock the skin wrinkled by the water the victims face was still covered by the blanket to wyatt she said i hope to god this isnt my friend his id said jason obrien she almost fell down jason shed never thought of jason a sense of relief flooded through her followed instantly by a sense of shame that she should be so relieved wyatt said are you all right she caught herself aw jeez jason he had a card that said to call you glass said wyatt looking down at the blanket said so youre pretty close not close but hes a friend he was our backup camera our second camera when we needed one he used to call me mom anna said hes a kidwas a kid did you see him yesterday yeah he was shooting with us last night he split around eleven you didnt see him after that glass asked no anna explained about the animal rights protest and the jumper and glass and wyatt nodded theyd seen the stories so what do you think anna asked drugs wyatt shook his head wasnt drugs whyd you think it was anna shrugged jason did a lot of dope i think he got weird all your friends do dope glass asked a couple anna said she wasnt intimidated there was no crime in knowing dopers jason did some crank a little crack when he could get it he liked cocaine but he couldnt afford it most of the time some weed whyd he leave last night wyatt asked anna shook her head i dont know he said he was gonna ride all night but then after the jumper i dont know she thought about it for a second now that he was deadif he was dead she thought if that was jason under the blankethis hasty departure seemed even odder he said the jumper made him feel bad and he was gonna take off we all figured that was bullshitthe rest of the crew and me maybe something was going on why was it bullshit glass asked cause ive seen him crawl inside a car with a decapitated woman to get a better shot and the head was laying on the front seat with the eyes still open and a smile on the face anna said hows a jumper gonna bother him there wasnt even any blood huh wyatt nodded and stared north up the beach toward the mountains hanging over malibu like the hills might have the answer when it didnt come he sighed and said will you take a look just to make sure weve got the right guy anna nodded swallowed found she had no saliva in her mouth she saw dead bodies all the time but not dead friends wyatt said frank lift the corner of the blanket huh frank stopped whatever he was doing with the leg and picked up the corner of the blanketwyatt was watching her faceand there was jason no drugs this one he was lying on his stomach his head slightly downhill toward the water his face turned toward her he didnt look like he was asleep he looked like hed been changed to wax the visible eye was cracked open and his tongue hung out like the limp end of a toolong suede belt his head looked wrong misshapen and something had happened to his cheeks there was no blood so the outlines werent clear but he seemed to have been slashed by a knife or razor but that hadnt killed him a bullet had in his forehead just above the visible eye was a clean dark bullet hole aw god anna said turning away she felt like she ought to spit thats him all right wyatt said frank dropped the blanket when did you find him he washed up about mmm two hours ago people saw his body in the surf thought he was drowning one of the lifeguards went in after him pulled him out as he spoke a tear rolled down annas cheek and she frowned and brushed it away no tears she didnt cry then another one started he involved with any gangs buying dope causing them trouble no i dont think so but i dont know him well enough to say for sure why wyatt shrugged those cuts on his face they looked like they might be gang signs they look the same on both sides both cheeks i dont know anna said okay listen were gonna need a complete statement from you wyatt said when you last saw him where he lives who he knows any troubles he might have had family that kind of stuff the address on his id isnt any good anna nodded he moved around a lothe was living down in inglewood i think an apartment ive never been to his place but ive got a phone number wed usually pick him up at the pier he worked at the shotshop photo place glass looked down at the pier a mile south right here yeah they all turned to look down at the santa monica pier a gray line of buildings thrusting into the water a mile to the south has he been having trouble with anyone buying the crank or something wyatt asked he was pretty cheerful last night he was riding with us because he heard about the raid and set up our contacthe only rides with us once or twice a month when weve got something complicated going on he just seemed like jason nothing special and you dont know about the crank who his supplier might have been no i dont anna said you dont know much about anything do you glass said get off my case anna snapped i got a goddamned friend dead on the beach and i dont need any bullshit from cops glass took a step toward her anna stood her ground but wyatt took a halfstep himself between them pam take it easy and to anna you too anna spent another ten minutes with them picking up their weird bodydance again and agreed to drive herself back to the station to make a statement wyatt walked part of the way back to her car with her sorry about pam he said she hasnt been doing homicide all that long shes still kind of street she like to fight anna asked shes not afraid of it wyatt said glancing back at the woman who was peering down at the body listen last night anna said jason might have been high i dont know i cant always tell because he was so hyper but when we got up to the hotel for the jumper he was shaking like a leaf he was okay when he was shooting but when we were riding up he was shaking jerking almost like spasms in his arms all right well tell the doc youre gonna be around right yeah wait anna dug in a pocket took out a business card borrowed a pen from wyatt and said turn around let me use your back using his back as a writing surfacehe seemed to like itshe scribbled two phone numbers on her card and handed it to him the first number is my home phone its unlisted with an answering machine the next one is the cell phone i carry around with me and on the front is the phone in the truck im always around one or two of them thanks make the statement he looked back at his partner sighed and started that way makes your teeth hurt doesnt it anna said after him he stopped and halfturned what does wanting to sleep with her so bad wyatt regarded her gloomily then broke down in a selfconscious grin i dont think a woman could ever know how bad it gets he said he started walking back then turned and in a tone that said this is important he added and its not just that i want to sleep with her you know thats only the start of it chapter anna made the statement and headed south creek lived in a town house in marina del rey with two egyptian mau cats seven hundred sailing books and a billiards table he claimed had been stolen from the set of a james cagney movie he still wasnt answering the phone and anna suspected that hed be on his boat lost dogwas a centerboard s with a little honda outboard hanging off the stern and creek had sailed it to honolulu and back on his return anna had presented him with a certificate of stupidity which hung proudly in the main cabin over the only berth big enough for creek to sleep on anna dumped her car in a parking lot walked across the tarmac to the basin down the long white ramp through the clutching pleasant odors of algae and gasoline she spotted the lost dogskellygreen sail covers so at least he wasnt out sailing he was in fact down below installing a marine head where hed once carried a porta potti creek she called come out of there creek poked his head up the companionway he was shiftless had a hacksaw in his hand and his hair was sodden with sweat he read annas face and said what happened jasons dead anna said bluntly creek stared at her for a moment then shook his head wearily and aw shit he ducked down the companionway and the hacksaw clanged into a toolbox a moment later he emerged again wearing gym shorts his body as hairy as a seventies shag carpet fuckin crank i bet he said he was shot anna said shot creek thought about it for a moment then shrugged an italian shrug with hands still probably dope yeah maybe anna said what else would it be i dont know anna said she filled him in on the details where the body was found how i was afraid it was you naw i wont float she let some of it out now his face looked like notebook paper it was white it was like she happened to look into the harbor water where a small dead fish floated bellyup like that fish he didnt look like hed ever been alive you know who he hung out with creek said you give those kids enough time theyll kill you fuckin crazy hollywood junkie crackheads anna looked up at him nibbled her lip she didnt want to tell him that shed given his name to the cops but she had to he had to be ready listen i had to make a statement to the cops we might have been the last people who saw jason alive except for the killer i told them about jason using the crank and the other stuff cause it might be relevant creek exhaled threw his head back and looked at the windex at the top of the mast wind is shit today he said and theyll be coming to see me anna nodded thats why i stopped by they wanted the names of everybody on the crew with jason she said i think we ought to bag it tonight maybe for a couple of days fine with me ive got work to do on the boat creek said he flopped his arms a gesture of resignation in the bad old days creek had run boatloads of grass up from mexico hed never been caught with a load but at the end the cops had known all about him and when hed been tripped up with a dime bag theyd used it to put him in chino for three hard years he considered himself lucky if this was alabama id still be inside he said he hadnt smuggled or used drugs in a decade but if the cops ran his name as a member of the night crew theyd get a hit when his name came up and theyd be around you better get in touch with louis already did on the phone anna said but i wanted you to know theyll probably be coming around i woulda lied to them nah they would of caught you and then they woulda wondered why you were lying he grinned at her you want to go out and sit in the sun on the afternoons when creek wasnt working hed crank up the honda outboard motor out of the marina into the pacific raise just enough sail to carry him out a bit further then back the jib ease the main lash the tiller to leeward and drift sometimes all night listening to the ocean anna shook her head at the invitation i dont think so she said i want to get back home take a bath i smell like a dead guy ive got it in my nose jason had worked with them on and off for two yearstheyd probably been out with him once a month perhaps a little more often say thirty times anna thought a few hours each time he was good at it he had an artistic eye knew how to frame a shot and wasnt afraid to stick his face into trouble his main shortcoming was a lack of focus he would get caught by something that interested himmight be a face or visually tricky shot and lose track of the story anna cleaned up the house for a halfhour bored on edge and depressed all at once and finally dragged two old mission chairs into the back and began sanding the paint off shed found them in a yard sale in reasonable condition and figured shed make about nine million percent profit on them if she could ever get the turquoise paint off them the work was fiddly dull but let her think about jason not puzzling out the murder not looking for connections just remembering the nights hed spent in the back of the truckthe decapitated woman on olympic the crazy navajo with the baseball bat in the sextoy joint the pink plastic penisshaped dildos hurtling through the videotape like babylonian arrows coming down on jerusalem she grinned at that memory stopped grinning when she remembered the fight at the black tulip when the horseplayers had gone after the tv lights or the time they taped the two young runaways sisters looking for protection on sunset the fiftyyearold wolves already closing in at seven oclock with the daylight fading she quit on the sanding went inside made a gin and tonic the tv was running in the background as it always was and as she turned to go back outdoors she saw the tape of the guy being hit by the pig he was getting more than his moneys worth she thought and grinned at the sight then jason got that shot she stopped smiling and still smelling of the paintstripper carried the drink out to the canalside deck and dropped into a canvas chair anna her name came out of the sky she looked up and saw hobart page looking down from his secondstory sundeck next door were having margaritas come on up thanks hobie but uh i had a friend die i just want to sit and think for a while another voice jim mcmillan hobies livein she could see his outline against the eastern sky jeez you okay yeah yeah bums me out though she said well come over if you need company shed just finished the drink when the phone rangthe home phone the unlisted number creek or louis maybe her father or one of a halfdozen other people she thought but it was the cops ms batory lieutenant wyatt youre working late anna said were just wrapping up here he said wrapping up did you find out who did it afraid not we did locate his apartment not much there unless we get a break were not gonna be able to do much with it it looks like dope or just random so youre giving up nobut right now weve got nothing wyatt said we checked out the shotshop and i think he might have been killed there he couldve been dropped right out the back window into the water and the window was unlocked which it wasnt supposed to be was there any blood he was pretty beat up not visible blood but there was a roll of photo paper in the backyou know one of those printed scene things yeah anyway the owner said it was back there half unrolled and now its gone maybe he was killed on the paper and the paper was thrown out the window it wouldve sunk so weve got crime scene guys looking for blood and checking around to see if the papers under the pier but even if we find it it wont be much were looking for anyone who saw anything but we havent found anyone so far did you talk to the fishermen out there there are always a few

the number nancy odum answered the phone in peru and passed it off to her husband martin martin odum said we dont fly and its a long way to come to get a stereo set if you could handle the arrangements wed be happy to pay you somethin for your time no thats okay anna said thinking no its not shed never arranged a funeral and hoped shed never have to martin odum continued in the same glum tone his mother and father are buried here in peru we thought maybe cremation we could sprinkle the ashes on their graves if thatd be okay with you ill take care of it anna said he had a few hundred dollars coming from my company ill use that for the cremation and to ship the remains uh his stuff do you want me to sell it i dont know how much id get but i could send you whatever it is thatd be nice of you maam they worked out the rest of the melancholy details the phones making funny satellite sounds and the odums sounded as morose as anna felt when they were done she hung up mixed another drink thought about making it a double and did back outside sitting in the canvas chair she let her mind drift and it drifted under the influence of the alcohol to the last funeral shed been to so long ago anna had grown up on a farm in southcentral wisconsin a acre corn operation that lay in the crook of the whitewater river not far from madison her mother was a piano teacher and shed died in an automobile accident when anna was six she could still remember the melancholy almost gothic circumstances of the funeral at the small baptist church and the slow procession to the tiny graveyard down the dusty gravel road how bright and warm the day had been the redwinged blackbirds just beginning to flock one particular bird perched on a cattail looking her in the eye as the procession passed death and music anna was the best pianist at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee the year she graduated she moved to ucla and the year she took her mfa she was one of the best two or three in the graduate school not good enough to make it as a concert pianist she would have had to have been the best in the world in her year and a year or two before and after as it wasone of the best at uclashe got session gigs movie music she still played the hard stuff out of habit and really out of a kind of trainedin love but in her one last semiregular gig sunday nights at the kingsborough hotel she played a dusty romantic outofdate jazz her mothers music theyd played a piece of it at her funeral and all those wisconsin farm folks had thought it was a wonderful thing too early halfdrunk anna went to bed alcohol never brought sleep instead it released unhappy images from some mental cage and they prowled through her dreams kicking old memories back to life from time to time halfawake shed imagine that shed just groaned or moaned at three in the morning she woke up looked at the clock felt herself sweating into the sheets at threefifteen she heard a noise and was instantly awake the noise had a solid reality to it not a dream noise anna slept in a pair of jockey underpants she slipped out of bed groped around for a tshirt that shed tossed at a chair but hadnt found it when she heard the noise again she moved silently to the head of the stairs listened tiktik scrape back door she thought definitely real she was getting oriented now stepped to the nightstand found the phone when she picked up the receiver the dial lighted and she pushed a speeddial button two rings and a man answered on the other end jim mcmillan from next door groggy with sleep what jim this is anna we got one hes right outside my back door holy cow then she heard him speak to hobie its anna shes got one outside her back door and hobie okay jim said to anna well call the cops and start the web you lay low a little excitement in his voice now yeah be careful life in venice was getting better but thered been some tough times still were their version of the neighborhood watch was a little heavierduty than most knowing that the cops would always take a while to get there jim would start a calling tree which would branch out over the surrounding two blocks and in five minutes thered be people all over the street but she had to get through the five minutes anna had both a handgun and a fishwhacker in the bedroom thered be people around so she went for the whacker which she kept against the back side of the chest of drawers on the way in the dark she stepped on the tshirt picked it up pulled it over her head she found the whacker and heard a windowpane break quietly like somebody had put pressure against it to crack it and then tried to pick out the piecesbut at least one piece had fallen onto the kitchen floor damn them theyd hurt her house anna went to the stairs began to creep down the whacker was made of hickory looked like a dwarf baseball bat and was meant to put ocean game fish out of their misery creek had drilled out the business end melted a few ounces of lead sinker on his barbeque grill and poured the lead into the bat if anyone was hit hard with it surgery would follow at the bottom of the stairs anna heard another piece of glass crack she moved to the open arch between the living room and the kitchen risked a quick peek the obscure figure of a man hovered outside the back window three feet to the right of the door hed done something to the window and had then broken out a piece as she watched a hand came through the broken pane and a needlethin ray of light played across the inside of the door he was trying to see the lock even if the posse arrived in the next couple of minutes she didnt want to be trapped inside the house with some cracksmoked goof she bunched herself in the arch eight feet from the door the hand with the light disappeared and then in the near darkness she saw another movement he was reaching far inside trying to get to the deadbolt she waited until the hand was at the door then launched herself across the room one big step with the whacker already swinging and whack hit too high and caught the window frame and the arm at the same time and as she swung she screamed get out and raised the whacker again but the man outside groaned and jerked his arm back through the window tearing out more glass she heard him stop once heavily on the porch a running step and then a heavyduty spotlight caught him from a neighbors yard across the canal and someone yelled there he is anna stepped to the door and flipped on the porch light and at the same time someone yelled hes going west and someone from the front of the house there he is larry there he is anna ran through the house to the front door and out down the short sidewalk to the streetten yards away a man in jeans and a black jacket was running away from her along the edge of the street he was hurt she thought something funny in the jerky way he held his left arm pak hee chung the korean businessman from across the street ran out of the front of his house carrying a shotgun saw anna and shouted get back inside and then fired the shotgun in the air a threefoot flame erupting from the gun as the muzzle blast shook the street the man in black now thirty yards away spun crouched anna shouted pak hes got a gun just as the man fired four quick pokpokpokpokshots and pak fumbled the shotgun and went down on his stomach gun anna screamed hes got a gun hobie ran out of the house behind her and shouted get out of the way anna ran back a few steps and turned to look at the man in black now running again forty yards and hobie opened up with a handgun five fast shots into the night the man kept going turned the corner there was a flash of lights another searchlight somebody screamed stop or ill shoot and again she heard the pokpokpokand a louder bangbang pak was on his feet again running down the narrow street apparently unhurt and for no apparent reason fired the shotgun into the air again again the lightning flash and the muzzle blast rattling the neighborhood like her dads twelvegauge anna thought in an instant of abstraction she found herself on her knees looking up the street then hobie was there next to her in his pajamas fumbling shells into a revolver goddamn he said excitedly i just shot the shit out of logans garage dont tell them it was me huh let them think it was the asshole logand like that any way yeah pak ran back still carrying the shotgun everybody okay what happened to the guy anna asked i dont know everybody was shooting nobody got hit bet we scared the shit out of him huh he looked back up the street and suddenly laughed wildly a long scary cackle and hobie and anna looked at each other this was something new then three more men were running around the corner at the end of the street one of them carrying a rifle they stopped when they saw pak hobie and anna whos that the rifleman shouted pak and hobie and anna hobie yelled back everybody okay yeah he came back that wayyou see him hes stuck down linnie didnt see him this way get the guys up here get the guys up here better get off the street pak said anna lock yourself inside well get a line set up and dig him out of here be careful anna said she looked down at her bare legs i better go put some pants on pak said youre okay with me and jacked another shell into the shot gun and grinned hobie was standing behind pak and he winked at anna while anna blushed and said ill be back in a second and pak yelled get those guys going we need a skirmish line by the time anna was dressed fifteen neighborhood men a halfdozen women and two cops had walked the street and found nothing at all anna walked with them as they checked again knocking at every door like smoke pak said mustve swum the canal when the last house was checked they gathered at paks wallowing in the scent of testosterone pak started a stream of instant coffee coming out of the microwave and poptarts from the toaster logan the old vietnam vet was saying like this night in fuckin dong ha man poppoppop a fuckin firefight in the front yard my garage is all shot to shit he didseem pleased anna thought the debriefingpartyat paks lasted an hour and everybody went to look at the broken glass on annas back porch the intruder had used masking tape to tape off one pane in the multipane window then used pressure to punch out a hole anna made a brief report to the two cops who seemed more interested in paks coffee and poptarts larry staberg brought his jigsaw and a piece of plywood over cut out a shape to fill the small broken windowpane and nailed it in place pretty much good as new he said as his wife rolled her eyes at anna good until i get it fixed anna said thanks everyone as the party broke up logan said to someone else as he walked away from anna when i heard him firing it sounded like a twentytwo but the holes in my garage are bigger than that maybe thirtyeights when she heard twentytwo a small bell dinged in the back of annas mind but she forgot about it on the way upstairs she wouldnt sleep much during the rest of the night but as much as she turned the whole episode over in her head she never put the used by the dark man together with the used on jason not then chapter late afternoon the day felt like it had gone on forever anna was a night person a full day in the sun left her feeling burned dried out and the midday traffic magnified the feeling at night los angeles traffic was manageable if she had to drive during the day all the time shed move to oregon or nevada or anywhere else in the small red corolla half a car length ahead of a cannibalistic chevy suburban walled in by a daredevil in a brown ups truck she felt like she was trapped in a clamshell and she was the clam after the excitement of the prowler shed tried to go back to bed not because she was sleepy but because she felt she ought to she never got up until noon at the earliest but she hadnt been able to sleep shed gone to bed too early under the influence of the booze and the chase had gotten her cranked up so after lying awake for an hour she got up showered went downstairs ate breakfastand got sleepy she fought it for a while and finally at eight oclock crashed on the couch when she got up three hours later she felt like her mouth was full of fungus off to a cranky start and trying to figure out the funeral made her even more cranky since the case involved murder and was believed to involve drugs the medical examiner wanted to get tissue tests back before releasing the body for cremation she should call back she was told every day or two for how long well you know whatever it takes the clerk said the cops had no similar problems with jasons apartment they had taken out two cardboard cartons of paper and that was it a sleepy inglewood police sergeant a fax from the odums in his hand gave her the keys were all done with it he said are you really working hard on this he yawned and rubbed his eyes causing her to yawn in sympathy yeah yeah he said we are but its basically a santa monica case nothing happened down here she borrowed the cops phone to call wyatt at santa monica and as she waited for the transfer frowned at the fax from the odums they had a fax did everybody have a fax yeah wyatt im down in inglewood are you doing anything up there wyatt talked for a couple of minutes and anna decided that he wasnt doing much theres nothing to go on wyatt said nobody saw anything nobody heard anythingwe had a guy out on the pier all last night talking to the fishermen and he came up with exactly zero we dont have anything back from the lab yet so were not even sure thats where he was killed and the most likely motive involves the worst anonymous ratshit dopers in the whole goddamn country so i dont know what more to do keep talking to his friends like your pal creek creeks okay anna said he did time for dope wyatt said he was dealing bigtime is the word he was smuggling not dealing and he quit cold he hasnt had anything stronger than jack daniels since he got out she could hear him yawn and it irritated her maybe you need a nap she suggested wyatt ignored the sarcasm yeah i could and pam backs you up on creek by the way she went out to talk to him pam your partner yeah anna halfsmiled and even on the phone wyatt picked up the vibration why hes a romeo or something not exactly he does have an effect on a certain kind of woman what kind the anal blazerwearing hermиsscarf owning powersunglasses type with no kids huh like you anna almost started then grinned into the phone shed deserved it wyatt continued pams got a collection of hermиs but no kids big surprise anna said goodbye hey wait he wanted to talk more about pamela glass anna wasnt in the mood from the inglewood police station anna headed over to jasons apartment the apartment was a neat fourbuilding complex surrounded by an eightfoot chainlink fence she took the car through a narrow access gate which a sign said would be locked at midnight the sign had been overpainted with graffiti she glanced at her watch already three oclock she had to move creek and louis would be at her house in two hours ready to roll she left the car in a guest parking slot and headed into the complex a dozen people sat in lawn chairs around a swimming pool drinking beer talking in the fading sunlight old paul simon tinkled from a boom box still crazy after all these years get it over jasons apartment was routine california stucco tan concrete steps going up to external walkways rust stains running down from roofedge gutters the weather had been dry but the walkways smelled like rain green red yellow and blue doors alternated down the walkways an uninterested attempt at decor anna looked at the keysfound the door a red one looked around waiting for somebody to object nobody did she was alone on the walk she had a little trouble with the key finally got it to go and pushed inside smelled carpet cleaner he hadnt been here long the apartment was nearly dark the only illumination coming through the open door and a back window the room she was in the front room was littered with empty pizza cartons comic books big gulp plastic cups a playboyand a penthouselay in the middle of the carpet the cops had dumped everything and left the litter where they dumped it she left the door open groped for the light switch found it flicked it nothing happened lights out jeez she said her voice didnt quite fill the room and she paused and thought what she stepped back and looked out along the walkway heard voices a womans then the deeper rumbling from a man coming up the stairs still worried about being taken for an intruder she pushed the door shut stood for a moment in the gloom waiting for her eyes to adjust there d be a circuit breaker somewhere she thought probably in a closet or back in the kitchen the apartment was almost tooquiet like the ghost of jason had muted all the little normal sounds the creeping subliminal pitterpatter of cockroaches warping of wood flaking of paint she pushed the feeling away and headed toward the small kitchen nook find the light he got her as she stepped into the kitchen he was off to the right next to a small dinette table anna was looking the other way sensed him a fraction of a second before he was on her started to turn started to say something to cry out he threw a large hand over her mouth wrapped a heavy arm around her chest tripped her with a sweeping leg and they lurched back into the living room and hit the floor anna on the bottom the impact took her breath away for a second and she thrashed frantically trying to get an arm loose trying to get her feet working trying to kick but he was very strong very professional hed done this before the arm around her chest tightened and he pulled her head back and said close by her ear if you scream ill punch your lights out if you stop kicking ill let you breathe cmon they thrashed for another moment but hed wrapped a leg around her legs and she felt as though she were fighting an anaconda and he said cmon goddammit i dont want to hurt you i just want you to shut up if youll shut up nod exhausted sweating scared she relaxed involuntarily and nodded and he said i swear to god if you scream im gonna bust you in the mouth and he took his hand away from her mouth she drew a breath to scream reconsidered let me go she said trying to look at him she started thrashing again trying to turn but he held her all she could see was his chin were gonna go like this over to the couch and im gonna sit you down ill be right in front of you and if you yell ill hit you i want to be clear about that all right all right not hurt yet here we go he rolled and pried one arm around behind her caught her fingers in a hold and she thought cop and said aloud that hurts not much he said not yet but it will if you put a move on me are you a cop you sound like a cop no hed released her legs got his knees under himself and slowly pushed up to his feet pulling anna along past a cable reel that jason was using as a coffee table then he pushed her and twirled her at the same time she found herself staggering uncontrollably backward until the couch hit her calves and she fell back onto it he was right there his face obscured in the gloom a fist an inch from her chest whats your name he asked let me out of here whats your fuckin name fuck you he didnt seem frightening somehow let me out of here in a minute gimme your arms what gimme he grabbed one hand and she tried to jerk free but he put a hand on her forehead and said sit still goddammit what do you want needle tracks what she stopped fighting and a penlight clicked on he turned her arm wrist up and played the beam down her forearm other arm she turned her other arm up and he looked it over then shined the light into her eyes dazzling her whats your name he asked again fuck you who are you what the hell are you doing here you oughta watch your mouth he said and its none of your business you sit right there if you start to get up yeah i know youll beat me up he sounded embarrassed yeah he was groping around on the floor keeping his eyes on her but not until he moved back to her did she see that hed picked up her purse he popped it open and dumped it on the wirereel table shined the penlight on it and stirred through it annas purse was small and there wasnt much a billfold a comb a lipstick a roll of clorets a handful of change a couple of rippedinhalf movie tickets he opened the billfold and looked at her drivers license she still couldnt see his face and the light held chest high made it more difficult anna batory he said he looked up from the license you were with the tv crew she wasnt going to be raped she decided probably not beaten up the guy had a hard force about him but not the hyped energy that produced an attack and he knew about her yeah im with the video crew you shot the video on jacob harper who now she was confused jacob harperthe kid who tried to fly off the shamrock oh yeah we were there what did the jumper have to do with jasons apartment whered jason obrien get his dope i dont know cmon he worked for you youve got a key to his apartment he didnt work for me he was a parttime guy like once a month and the cops gave me the key the cops after a moments silence he asked why would they do that because nobody wants his body im supposed to take care of funeral arrangements and theres nothing more here that the cops want huh he stood up looked around in the gloom and said damn it you hurt me anna said she was getting a feel for him he hadnt wanted to hurt her you could have broken my arm ah shut up he said youre not hurt and we both know it then your boyfriends a doper what this guy creek hes not my boyfriend hes my partner he hasnt done any dope for ten years bullshit hes got no job he lives in a nice apartment at the marina and hes got a yacht no job ill tell you what pal were out there two hundred and fifty nights a year yeah some tinkertoy fuckin movie wannabees with cameras for christs sake now she was getting hot yeah we grossed better than three hundred and fifty thousand last year men creek and louis took home better than ninety apiece after expenses how muchd you make that much ninety surprise yeah she would have sulked if she thought she could have afforded to but she had to stay on top of him another moment of silence then he was moving away from her over his shoulder he said fucking la you goddamn people are a bunch of ghouls you know that making a buck off snuff films she kept her mouth shut she was about to get out of this and didnt want to argue a step or two later he added dont scream after me itd just piss me off and id have to run and im probably gonna come back and see you again anna was on her feet about what i need to know about obrien im not done with him yet and youre the only connection ive got listen if you think jason had anything to do with the jumper youre wrong no youre wrong he said he hesitated then said i came down on you a little hard when we went to the floor you oughta take a couple ibuprofen hot bath or something you could have pulled something youre so thoughtful i bit my lip when we hit well thats just too bad she couldnt believe the gall he seemed to be looking for sympathy she crossed her arms over her chest well it stings like hell he said then he was out the door slamming it behind him as he went through she got a better look at him in the late afternoon an impression of sandybrown hair very white teeth probably blue eyes she thought athletic but not stripped down to muscle and bone maybe a few extra pounds in fact big shoulders and gone she went to the door after him thought about screaming jerked the door open and stepped outside and saw the top of his head disappearing down the stairwell opened her mouth shut it again she was safe enough unhurt and still alonemaybe she didntwant to piss him off the circuitbreaker box was in the kitchen the door open she threw the switch and two lights came up she went back through the living room shut the door and then took out the cell phone found wyatts card in the pile of purse litter and dialed him a clerk answered the phone and she asked that wyatt be called at home and that he call her back he called back two minutes later what he asked without preamble when anna picked up the phone i just got to jasons apartment and there was somebody here he jumped me you hurt he sounded cautious nervous why no he just tripped me and held me down and then he pushed me on the couch and then he left i thought he might be a cop but he said he wasnt white guy the odd tone still in his voice yeah hey you know him probably another doper but he was lying and he wasnt good at it as long as youre not hurt the door was locked and he was inside howd he do that hes probably a friend of obrien wyatt said look do you want a car to come around i can call inglewood she thought about it for a moment no i guess not i mean unless you wanted to look for fingerprints you know detect something wyatt sighed and said we got thirty sets of fingerprints out of the shotshop and we could probably get thirty more anna said tell me the truth about something you know instead of lying sure do you think jason might be connected to the jumper we filmed wyatt hesitated before he answered and anna read it you do she said sod the guy here tell me why look missannagoddammit youre not a police officer okay just clean up the apartment pack up his stuff and get out of there maybe you better call inglewood she said i better file a complaint the guy was trying to rape me silence okay ill do the call anna said i know where his prints are too theyre all over my purse and billfold ill mention to the inglewood cops that you might have some idea about who it is jesus youre a hardass youre just like pam bustin my balls all day now i gotta deal with you im tired of it life sucks and then you die anna said more silence then the kid who jumped off the building was tripping on wizards i dont know that brand anna said breaking in acid and speed maybe a lick of pcp okay like rattlers rattlers were last year he said but yeahlike that a little heavier on the acid anyway he popped a couple and decided the ledge was a runway and that he could fly so so the wizards are little pink extruded dots on strips of wax paper ive seen them anna said when you buy them the dealer just rips off however many dots you can pay for wyatt explained so the kid had a strip of dots in his jacket pocket when we rolled your friend over so did he what was left of them anyway coming out of the water huh thats weird thatsnot weird wyatt said thats just a coincidence these fuckin wizards are all over the place but i get this wild idea and put the two strips together and guess what the two papers matched up your friends strip had been ripped off the jumpers what yeah now thatsweird anna made a quick connection so howd the guy here know about it wyatt sighed again and said look you seem like an okay person huh yeah im an okay person okaymeant that a cop could trust herpersonexpressed a belief that she was some kind of wacko feminist to be doing what she was doing and he didnt want to argue about it hes an excop wyatt said hes a decent guy hes a jerk he scared my brains out anna said angry at wyatts defense whatd he want hes interested in the case wyatt said interested is that all it takes wyatt cut her off his name is jake harper he said the jumper was jacob harper junior his son his only kid ah what had harper said ghouls making a buck off snuff films she let it go im okay she thought when wyatt hung up jasons apartment was a sad clutter of heavily used clothing cheap film gear books on directing and moviemaking portfolio tapes cans of campbells soup all the hopes a kid might have in hollywood california bundled up and sent back to peru indiana it wouldnt mean a thing anna did a quick survey separating the potentially salable stuff from the useless stacked the salable stuff and then found the apartment rental office and talked to the sleepy manager not worth much but well be taking it out in the next few days until then its under police seal anna said they still need to process some fingerprints so if you could keep your eye on the place wed all appreciate it if it aint too torn up hes got some deposit money coming back the manager said nice of you to mention it anna said the manager was a chunky squarefaced iranian with a black beard and an accent that combined detroit and esfahan aint my building and the owners an asshole why should he get the kids cash right on brother anna said chapter along bad day and still not over on the way home anna stopped at a traffic light on santa monica and her eyes drifted to a mobil station on the corner a man was washing the windshield on a volvo station wagon at a selfserve pump he was wearing jeans and a loose widesleeved white cotton shirt such as might be advertised in the new yorkersea island cotton like that the instant she saw himhis hair thinner maybe lighter maybe speckled with white a few pounds heavier but the way his hands connected to his body something almost indefinablethe very instant she saw him she thought clark she slid down in her seat but couldnt tear her eyes from him he finished with the squeegee turned and deftly flipped the squeegee stick back toward a water can hung on the side of the gas pump the sponge end of the stick hit and slipped perfectly through the hole in the water can exactly as shed seen him do it fifty times before oh my god she said aloud a car behind her honked and her eyes snapped up to the rearview mirror then down to the traffic light green she automatically sent the car through the intersection then pulled over and turned the volvo was still there but clark had gone inside a moment later he came back out slipping his wallet into his pocket climbed in the car turned on the lights eased into the cross street then zipped across santa monica and headed the other way she thought about following him thought too long and he was gone clark she drove home on autopilot random thoughts images and memories scrambling over each other like rats she stuck the car in the narrow garage slipped sideways past the front fender into the house and without turning on the lights went to the phone she had messages waiting on the answering service she ignored them and dialed cheryl burns in eugene oregon she mumbled the number to herself as she poked it into the handset praying that cheryl would be in her shop she was she answered on the first ring hello pacifica pottery cheryl this is anna anna pleasure at the other end they got together every year or so when cheryl and her husband brought a load of their woodfired pots from oregon down to the la basin in between visits they talked on the phone once every two or three months anna and cheryl shared one of the close connections that time and distance didnt seem to affect how are you how is everything sort of messy right now anna said thinking about clark a guy i work with was murdered not creek no a guy named jason he was a college kid we used parttime you dont know him awkward segue listen what do you hear from clark there was an empty heartbeat there then an almost masculine chuckle uhoh are you seeing him again not seeing him but i just saw him anna said at a gas station hes here in la i saw him on santa monica i know he called and asked for your phone number last month sometime i didnt give it to him he called why didnt you tell me because you messed each other up so bad the first two times i didnt want the responsibility cheryl anna said pushing her hair up her forehead in exasperation i can take care of myself no you cant in her minds eye anna could see her shaking her head not with clark damn it cheryl but i saved his la address and phone number in case you called and wanted it cheryl said with a teasing tone i had the feeling you might hook up cosmic vibrations i guess a little jolt there pleasure whats he doing here hes got an artistinresidence gig with ucla composition two years he said so hell be around another dead space then cheryl again well you want his number i dont know i better go get it then you can tell me about the murder cheryl read clarks phone number anna noted it doodled around it as they talked at sixthirty still chatting anna casually picked up the tv remote aimed it at the set in the corner hit the power and mute buttons and flicked through the channels at cnn the harper kid was flying off the ledge followed by ten seconds of talking head then a shot of the pig taking out the rat theyd picked the keystone kops version cheryl have you seen the tv news thing about the guy who jumped off the ledge here in la well sure everybodys seen it you cant get away from it then excitedly was that you guys yeah its getting around have you see the animal rights thing at the medical center oh the guy with the pig cracked me up was that you too about two minutes apart story to story and youre getting them way up there in oregon hey its not like were in tibet as they talked the blue shirt kid came upanna had forgotten his namebut hed been interviewed again probably the day after the animal rights fight the interviewer was not familiar the kid was wearing a lab coat had a fat lip and a couple of grinning professortypes hung in the background of the interview louis had made him into the hero of the piece and that had influenced the stations whod picked it up and it was still building what was his name like the mountain right not everest mckinley charles mckinley he was playing the role just right anna thought watching the muted tv as cheryl chattered in her ear a sort of charming littleboy bashfulness anna and cheryl were still on the phone when creek arrived doing his shaveandahaircut knock anna walked out to the end of the phone cord to let him in said cheryl to him and he called out hi cheryl and stuck his head in the refrigerator cheryl says she wants your body anna said as he emerged with a bottle of leinenkugel light she can have it as long as she gives it a good cleaning once in a while creek said as anna repeated his answer creek popped the top on the beer and wandered down the hall a moment later anna heard him tinkling on the piano when she got off the phone she ripped darks number off the scratch pad where shed written it looked at it for a moment then folded it in two and stuck it under a magnet on the refrigerator clark she got a coke from the refrigerator and sat on the piano bench with creek facing away from the piano creek smelled pleasantly of sunsweat and turpentine youre early she said thought you might like to talk running around after jason like that he was chording his way through a fakebook rendition of autumn leaves yeah shed told him that morning about the prowler now she told him about the man in the apartment maybe i ought to look him up creek growled when she finished i dont think so she said reaching over to pat his back his back felt like a boulder hes got connections with the cops and the cops are talking drugs you better stay low i dont want him fuckin with you creek said i dont think he will anna said i talked to wyatt about himi was scared and called wyatt and he knew who he was oh and wyatt told me that his partner was over to interview you yeah i guess she felt the sudden evasiveness in his voice look at me creek she said he shook his head i aint looking at you oh my god you jumped her anna said halfamused halfhorrified did not jump her creek said and thats a nasty phrase anyway high school he segued to a couple of bars of aint misbehavin but she is a tastylittle thing pretty hard edges for a cheesecake anna said creeks adventures with women sometimes grew complex hey you know nobody really appreciates what a woman cop goes through every day creek said tartly especially one with some decent looks just how much of her did you look at none of your business ah and would i be right to suspect that this somehow leads to your getting the cabin painted on the boat you smell like paint she wants to learn to race and shes gonna help me with the maintenance creek said defensively so shut up help like teri did creek shuddered i asked you never to mention that name sorry now i have to find a priest creek said to cleanse me she smiled now sorry again easy to be sorry creek said you dont have to live with the pain anna snickered and creek laughed and went to the jelly roll blues running down the chords and after a little while anna said clark is in town the music stopped creek turned to her suddenly pale as though the tan had run out of his face like blood aw shit he said they left annas at ninethirty the long brutal day dragging on creek was brooding silent anna was annoyed by the silence the annoyance layered atop her already general grumpiness shed wanted to talk about clark but creek didnt want to hear it thats toopersonal he said i cant tell you what to do and i dont want to think about it go find a girlfriend to talk to louis was sitting outside his apartment standing on the curb in his white shirt and plaid jacket carrying the laptop hed updated the address database with gps numbers and claimed that with his new gps receiver he should be able to put them within a few feet of their actual position anywhere in la county southern ventura or santa barbara whats happening with jason he asked as he ducked his head and climbed aboard im trying to figure out a funeral anna said as he sat down creek pulled away from the curb and louis brought up the electronics anna asked whats going on louis started monitoring the cops from his apartment an hour or so before they went out he had a scanner on an old trunk at the foot of his bed and creek claimed to have seen him adjust the volume dial with his toes without opening his eyes nothing really heavy but somethings going on with the hookers up on sunset he said twiddling a dial hard to tell whats going on but i think it might make a movie boys or girls anna asked girls there was a call about ten minutes ago the cops hit a club up there cocaine thing and i guess dumped a bunch of girls out on the street lined them up and a fight started somebody said it looked like a riot everybodyll be there creek said he sounded as grumpy as anna felt i dont think so louis said not yet catching the crankiness in the front seat there hasnt been much on the air you sorta had to be following it so lets go anna said the riot was a bust a few cop cars still lingered a few girls strolled along the street mostly looking at reflections in the store windows there was the familiar air of trouble immediately past but no actionlike arriving ten minutes after a thunderstorm with nothing but puddles to show for the violence they headed toward the valley anna thinking about cruising ventura louis got some movement on the radio but it was small stuff and too far south by the time theyd arrive there wouldnt be anything to see or other crews would already be working it wish the bitches had been doing something louis said wouldve made the night simple dont call them that anna snapped why not louis asked thats what shut the fuck up louis anna said ooo whats your problem he was smiling trying for a bantering attitude but he didnt understand best be quiet louis creek said and louis shut up a minute later anna now in a sulk said sorry louis you can talk now is there a problem i dont know about he asked tentatively yeah but its mine anna said fatburger coming up creek said creek knew every fatburger in la county stop i need some caffeine anna said louis diet coke fatburger and a coke creek said anna got the food waited paid carried it out to the parking lot two valley guys in their late teens or early twenties both with buzz cuts threedayartisthangout stubble and black jackets were leaning against the hood of a beatup buick and one of them said hey mama anna put the fatburger sack and three cups of coffee on the hood of the truck and turned back to them hey mama what huh what one of the guys straightened up and said hey mama whatcha doing tonight ill tell you what im doing im working instead of leaning my lazy fat ass on a pieceofshit junker outside a fatburger hey the second guy pushed away from the buick then creek got out of the drivers side of the truck and the second guy leaned back against the buick again while the first one hitched up his jeans creek said anna get in the truck this guy wanted to talk to me anna said anna creek wasnt talking bullshit get in the fuckin truck anna still fuming picked up the food and got in the truck and creek said sorry guys back in the truck as they pulled out creek said what was that all about huh you want to get in a fight outside a fatburger and spend some more time talking to cops huh bad day bad day my ass creek said take your fuckin bad day someplace else jesus you guys go easy louis said nervous creek and anna didnt fight yeah yeah gimme a fatburger creek snarled they rode in silence until annas cell phone rang anna batory male voice familiar heavy stress she thought yeah this is the guy you met in obriens apartment this afternoon yeah harper anna said what do you wantwhered you get this number he ignored the use of his name and the demand for an explanation of the number i need to see you he said like right now actually i need you to come to where i am why should i because it has something to do with you harper said i gotta call the cops pretty soon but i need you over here first whathas to do with me look you might be in serious trouble if you want to know about it before the cops come banging on your door come see me now otherwise and hey you might even make a few bucks she thought for a second then said im bringing a friend itll cause them trouble harper said im not gonna be alone with you not after you jumped me like that you abuser creek looked at her oddly and harper after a second said whatever you want to do harper was waiting under a streetlight on cumpston a couple of blocks south of burbank boulevard a neighborhood of stucco ranch homes the yard behind him was bordered with an evergreen hedge long untrimmed and pierced by a picket gate that had curls of white paint peeling off creek got out with anna i understand you had a problem with anna creek said and anna suddenly realized that she might have a problem with the two men harper had turned toward creek with a small crouching movement that suggested hed just set his feet and he wasnt backing up he was goodlooking in a mildly beatup way anna thought a big man with broad shoulders big hands a nose that had been broken a couple of times he carried a heavy tan with suntouched hair like a beach bum but he was too old for that late thirties she thought he wore an expensive black sport coat silk she thought over a pair of jeans and way down in the lizard part of her brain something went hmm creek was gliding sideways and harper was pivoting to cover him and anna said i swear to god the first one of you guys who throws a punch ill kick him in the balls creek stopped moving and harper relaxed spread his hands he glanced quickly at anna but spoke to creek if you had the same problem you wouldve done the same thing pal creek stared for a moment then nodded abruptly so what do you want i want you to come in here he said he tipped his head back toward the house but dont touch anything whadda we got creek asked interested now we got a dead dope dealer harper said anna stopped have you called the cops no i will soon as youve gone through the cops could put you in jail for not calling in right away anna said yeah maybe but ive got bigger problems than that come on maybe you want to bring a camera he said it in a cheap way and anna said shove it while louis waited with the radios harper led them up the walk the door was just ajar a light on inside and harper took a ballpoint pen out of his pocket and pushed the door open with the butt end of it dont touch the door dont touch any thing was the door open when you got here yeah and the light was on he said as they stepped across the threshold as soon as i got in i knew aw jeez anna said the smell hit her and she flinched away from it old blood and human waste mixed up and curdling flies harper said absently tilting his head back anna looked up saw hundreds of bluebottle flies clustering around the light back here he led the way to a bedroom with mustardcovered walls and rolling stonescovers thumbtacked to the walls but the main attraction was a man who at first glance looked like a grotesque german expressionist painting muscles and blood exposed everything gone black hed been handcuffed to the bed his feet tied with ripped sheets he was nude except for a pair of briefs face up and gagged hed been cut to pieces with a knife and not quickly anna thought the face looked as though the skin had been peeled off a halo of blood surrounded the head as if it had been violently shaken back and forth so hed been alive for the peeling christ what is this whatre we here for creek asked weve seen this shit yeah sove i harper said he looked at anna you know him even if i did im not sure id recognize him she said but i dont think so name is sean macallister harper said been busted three times on minor drug stuff once with obrien in the car anna was nodding jesus we do know him sean oh my god harper was going on the bust never got to trial because there was some problem with the stop obrien lived here for a couple of weeks between apartments i dont knowwe never picked up jason here are you sure thats him as she said it she had to turn away pretty sure harper said his billfold was still in his pocket so what do you want from us why dont you just call the cops creek asked i wanted you to look at this harper said he was standing next to the bed and he pointed to the mans bare chest a knife rip crossed it from armpit to armpit what anna asked read it harper said read it she and creek edged closer she couldnt see it but creek could he looked at her suddenly and she said again what says anna creek said almost to himself and then she saw it her name in carved flesh my god she stood in shock for a moment then turned to harper why i dont know he was watching her closely he was a smalltime dealer thats about all i know your sons dealer i dont know i hope not i tracked him through your pal obrien he looked around the room all i found was a little grass nothing else no dots anna said and he nodded she looked at the grotesquerie again the muscle mass that had once been human the anna and she turned away from the bed suddenly felt as though a hand had been clapped over her mouth suffocating her i gotta get out of here chapter harper and creek followed her outside and anna held her head over the picket fence and gagged nothing came up but a stream of saliva after a moment she turned back to the two men sorry so you didnt know the guy harper said a statement not a question not except to nod to i never met jasons friends except on the job harper was looking at her skeptically and anna said look jason was a parttimer he worked maybe once or twice a month when he came up with something dope stuff no usually ucla stuff the night your son died that was the last time we saw him he had the inside track on a college animal rights group that raided the medical labs at ucla i saw it on tv the pig thing harper said howd that connect with my kid creek said it didnt the raid was college kids and your son was at a highschool party the only connection was that they were a few blocks apart about the same time and we happened to catch them both harper rubbed his chin looking at creek youre sure work it out yourself harper looked away into the middle distance then back and nodded all right but my kids dead your friends dead they shared a dealer and now a dealers deadand annas name is carved on his chest somethingsgoing on did you see any of these dot things in therethe wizards anna asked howd you know about the wizards harper asked sharply wyatt told me he told me about you so i wouldnt report that i was mugged okay he looked at his shoes sorry about the thing at the apartment i didnt know who it was i was in there illegally sort of not a good place to be caught messing with an apartment so howd you track this guy down anna asked looking at the house got wyatt to check jason on the computer found the arrest got macallisters name checked with the phone company and got an address no problem you keep stepping into shit like this its gonna be a problem creek said leave it to the cops i cant harper shook his head ive got a slightly different agenda than the cops what revenge anna asked nah harper said he looked back at the house as anna had but id like a little justice leave it to the cops creek said again you dont get justice from cops harper said you get procedure sometimes you get arrests occasionally you get convictions you never get justice so what do we do here creek asked anna took out her phone make a call they called wyatt at home hoping for a charitable referral to the local burbank cops what wyatt grumbled into the mouthpiece his voice was thickened by sleep anna identified herself and told him about the man on the bed stay out of the house dont touch anything wyatt said he was awake now and unhappy im gonna call la i think were in burbank she said all right ill call burbank you wait were in the street right outside the house anna said glancing at harper its a little complicated id better let you talk to your friend jake jake whats he doing there wyatt asked even more unhappy ill let him tell you anna said and she handed the phone to harper louis stuck his head out of the truck weve got a fire in hollywood hills the girlfriend of somebody big the way the fire guys are talking forget it anna said cutting him off weve got problems the first cop car arrived five minutes after harper got off the phone not burbank but north hollywood burbank was two blocks away the cops talked to harper briefly a little chilly and started the murder routine cops around the house neighbors on lawns yellow crime scene tape medical examiners la homicide detectives and eventually wyatt he nodded wordlessly as he passed them flashed a badge at a cop outside the door and went in five minutes later he was back out what a mess he said yeah anna said and we had a prowler at my house this morning he had a gun i hope you called someone wyatt said i live in venice the neighbors chased him off the cops came over and had a coke might not be you wyatt said i mean on the guys chest she got a quick mental flash of the body and felt herself tighten up whoever had done that was far gone but she wouldnt fool herself either cmon how many annas do you know wyatt said all right i dont want to scare you any more than you are butremember the cuts on obriens face i thought they looked like gang marks yes they were like this remember he made a quick slashing triangle design on the palm of his hand with the opposite index finger triangles anna said or as wyatt said quietly upsidedown as oh no she put her hands to her cheeks cant be as could be wyatt said we gotta have a serious talk with the la guys are they upset she looked toward the house about us going inside wyatt glanced toward harper not as much as you might think wasnt her fault anyway harper said stepping into the conversation she didnt know what she was gonna see i took her in i thought she might say somethingmight know the guy did she harper glanced at her then suddenly grinned the first time shed seen him smile nice smile she thought no she went outside and barfed did not anna said creek looking past them said apprehensively uhoh here we go an la detective was headed their way the languid dangerous stroll affected by cops when they were being cool he was carrying a rolled pamphlet he glanced at anna nodded at creek and said to harper how are you jake a movie line one that should have been followed by a cigarette flicked into the street harper shrugged you heard about my kid yeah brutal the detective looked back at the house and then said listen i know this is a really horseshit time to ask you this but i got a problem i gotta come see you about lucy gonna do it this time i gotta shes crazier than a shithouse mouse if i dont get out of there but i cant leave the kids call me harper said im hurtin for cash the cop was embarrassed well put it on your sears card harper said he poked the cop in the ribs and the cop nodded and said ill call youthanks he nodded at anna glanced at wyatt and strolled away what was all that about anna asked wyatt jakes a lawyer wyatt said he has about half the cop business in the county i thought you said he wasa cop was ten years ago the lead detectives name was carrol trippen a tall impatient prematurely whitehaired anglo he split them up talked to each of them for a moment compared their stories and finally sent them downtown to make statements are we in trouble should i get a lawyer anna asked as trippen started back toward the house harper pisses me off calling you guys trippen said sourly but it wasnt your fault and i know where hes coming from i got bigger things to worry about than hassling people who looked at a dead guy the cops kept anna harper creek and louis apart until the statements were done anna was interviewed by a sleepy cop with bad breath and a yellow shirt with a new coffee stain when they finished he peered at her over his coffee cup and said tell you what you know this guy the killer if its me shed been having second thoughts cmon even youthink its you so what do i do first thing is with this prowler you had id move out of your house stay at a motel for a few days dont tell anybody where you are when youve got to work meet your friends somewhere you got a cellular anybody can get in touch if they need to ill think about it anna said but she wouldnt leave her house do that and i need you back this afternoon if you can make itwe got a shrink and a serial killer profiler theyre gonna want to talk to you youre sure he did both jason and sean trippen talked to wyatt and they think so he says theres a level of violence there you dont see it on the average murder and this sean was tied to the jason guy and jason was tight with you all right and she knew himbut who was it harper and creek were waiting in the lobby when anna got out louis was wandering around with the truck waiting when creek saw anna step out of the elevator he dug out his cell phone pushed a speed dial got louis were ready are you headed home harper asked as the three of them walked down to the exit i guess anna said she glanced at her watch the nights shot are you moving out of your house harper asked no then id like to come by and look around he said bad idea said creek harper turned to him look i used to do this for a living i want to see where she liveswhat the place is like if the news is bad i want you to help get her out of there id just as soon she didnt get carved up until i find the guy who did my kid thats very sentimental anna said harper shrugged ive got priorities creek was nodding and youve got a point to anna maybe i should stay over good idea harper said anna shook her head said to creek youd drive me nuts and to harper when he lays around the house he lays aroundthe house nobody smiled at the old vauderville line this aint a comedy routine creek grumbled then maybe we could get the cops to send somebody over protection fat chance harper said you know how many serial killers are running around la right now probably a halfdozen anna grunted huh and glanced at creek halfdozen no creek said following her thought shaking his head we aintdoing no story on that anna sent creek and louis home in the truck louis was shook having talked with the cops twice in two days having had statements taken louis thrived in anonymitysought it treasured it everythings gonna be okay right he was anxious twisting a shredded copy of the la readerin his hands yeah for us anna told him you guys take the truck go home get some sleep i just dont want anything to happen to us to you louis said eyes large i mean if anything happened to you whatd happen to me itll be okay louis she said giving him a quick smile and a pat on the back i promise when she told him shed ride with harper creek took her aside to whisper furiously what the fuck is this you dont even knowhim he could be you know the guy nah we know what hes doinghis kid anna said oh horseshit creek said in exasperation he added you started acting perky as soon as we met him outside the house and now youre starting again perky that made her mad she put her hands on her hips and started what are you figure it out creek said and he stalked off to the truck when he got there he turned and said and what about clark smack but he was in the truck and kicking it over before she could think of a proper reply harper drove a black bmw il the cockpit showed as many antsized instrument lights as a jumbo jet a halfdozen golf putters cluttered the passenger side harper popped the passenger door for anna and tossed the putters in the back nice car she said when he climbed in the drivers side cars were about fourhundredth on her priority list of important things in life freeway cruiser he said indifferently and you play a little golf huh he looked at her cool and said i do two things i practice law and i play golf i mean like seriously im serious about both he said and she thought he was a little grim goodlooking but tight chasing a little white ball around a pasture he looked at her still not smiling if golf was about chasing a little white ball around a pasture i wouldnt do it he said she turned toward him her face serious touched his arm would you promise me something what the sudden apparent intimacy took him by surprise dont ever ever evertry to explain to me what golf is really about this time he grinned and she thought mmm harrison ford at her house he took a flashlight out of the trunk and walked once around the outside checked the bushes said ouch what the hell is that and a couple minutes later good inside he looked at the windows including the boardedup back window and said leave the board for the time being and you need to get some empty beer cans or pop cans before you go to sleep at night stack them up inside the door if anybody tries to come through itll sound like the end of the world okay your bushes scratched the heck out of me thats what theyre for okay you got a gun he asked yeah lets get it he followed her upstairs to the bedroom and she took the gun from its clip behind the beds headboard smith wesson she said handing him the chromed revolver good old sixforty he said he checked the ammo with threefiftyseven wadcutters youre in good shape do you know how to shoot it i went through a combat class when that was the fad she said i go up behind malibu every year or so and shoot up a gully like they showed us ten feet so keep it handy he said he handed the gun back glanced at the quilt on the bed said oldfashioned girl huh she opened her mouth to say something when the doorbell rang they both looked at the head of the stairs uhoh probably not aunt pansy with a fruit pie harper said glancing at his watch you think a killer is gonna ring the doorbell atshe glanced at her watch toofiveohfive in the morning probably not he said lets go see you go first why me cause youve got the gun that seemed practical if not particularly chivalrous she led the way down feeling slightly silly gun in her hand paused in the hallway then whispered back now what get away from the door and yell harper suggested the doorbell rang again as they stepped into the kitchen and anna shouted who is it me creek creeks voice all right oh boy anna said she went to the door slipped the chain and pulled it open creek slouched on the porch and his eyes stopped briefly on anna and then flicked back to harper just thought id check creek said to harper you all done yeah im done i need to talk to anna for a minute alone then ill be out of here creek nodded and stepped back on the porch and pulled the door shut sorry about that anna said and she was thinking that creek showed up at fairly inconvenient times yeah no problem harper took a slender leather wallet out of his jacket pocket took out a thin gold pen found a card and scribbled on it my home phone the office phone is on the front call me if anything comes up and youve got my card anna said drily he mustve taken it from her purse yup unembarrassed i think we should let the police she was talking over him and only caught the last part boyfriend stay over itd be another layer she stopped what maybe you oughta have your boyfriend stay over he repeated hed be another layer between you and the killer hes a big guy hes not my boyfriend creeks a friend yeah but you can trust him with my life harper bobbed his head and said then you might think about it even if he drives you nuts ill tell you what this guy isnt gonna go away this nut hes thinking about you all the time sooner or laterhell turn up chapter the twofaced man sat in the dirt a hedge brushing his right ear a fender a foot from his left the spot was guarded out of sight and had the feel of a den he was comfortable in it he put the pistol barrel beside his nose drew a breath scented with gunpowder and oil he waited and as he waited he lapsed into a fantasy he was invisible drifting through annas house hanging a few inches above the floor like a wisp or a genie she was in the bathroom naked doing her face bending over a counter looking in the mirror could she feel him there so close coming up behind he reached out to touch the smooth bumps made by her vertebrae mmm no she had to be totally unknowing unknowing hed be witness to her most intimate moments perfect moments but itd be kind of neat if he could materialize too not just an ethereal eye watching but somebody who had the power to materialize right behind her he edited now he could materialize and shed be naked there bending over the bathroom counter putting on lipstick no edit again shed be wearing nylons with a garter belt but thats all nylons and a garter belt no underwear putting on lipstick and hed come up behind her and the first thing shed feel would be his fingers trailing down her spine like a cold draft all right he liked that return he drifted in the door set down beside her she was leaning over the sink her breasts free nipples pink a dark shadow where her legs joined he put out a hand touched her spine when he was a child years before hed been captured by the image of humpty dumpty not the fall but the shell because thats how he knew himself to be he had two faces not one the outer face looked to the worlda somber face even when he was a child but pretty and forthright the inner face was something else dark moody fetid closed the inner face contemplated only himself he might have been whole once but the wholeness had been beaten out of him shattered like humpty dumpty his father had sold cars thousands of cars his father had been on television every night prime time with his fake nose and white painted face his oversized shoes and raggedyann hair he was the most famous clown in the world reeling across the sales floor with a gallonsized jug marked xxx hey you think big bandy is jes being funny when he sez you can get this likenew camaro for the lowlow price of whatd i say did i say another bandy slipothetongue thats old bandy getting into the old brandy again makin mistakes like saying this likenew camaro only whoops there i go again get down here quick and you could get this camaro for whoo thats good stuff old bandy may be into the old brandy again but im as good as my word so whatever ridiculous price i just said thats all youll pay he could take the ridicule at school old bandy being his father because everybody knew that old bandy was making millions what he couldnt take was when old bandy got into the old brandy at home and beat the shit out of him his mother was worse his mother was a small darkhaired devil who drank more old brandy than old bandy did and shed turn him inyou know what your son did todayas though he wasnt also her son and the things he did that every kid did would somehow boil in his fathers brain and hed open the bedroom door in fear and find the old man standing there with a stick in his hands and a darkness around his eyes his parents sex life was as bad as the beatings theyd get drunk and screw on the couch or the floor or the stairs and if everything wasnt going just right his father might hit her with an open hand bat her around she seemed to approve of it taunt him until he hit her their ravings were impossible to escape a shattering scream would drag him into the hallway and there theyd be sweating bleeding drunk naked whatever happened at home the family had an outer face for the world mom gave money to the symphony and the art museum and was something in the junior league and every other goddamn silly group willing to ignore her character in return for her money the young boy created the two faces as a means of survival the outer face was bland careful somber and never raised its voice to his parents never commented on the sex or the beatings not after the first few times with the stick but the inner face raged against them the inner face wanted to kill them his father had a automatic a big blue colt he kept it hidden in a leather holster fastened behind the headboard of his bed his father took it out every once in a while to look at it hold it aim it at the tv dryfire it then hed go into the bedroom reload it and hide it in the sixth grade twoface dreamed of killing his parents with the the dream had become part of his daily reality the inner face pleading with the outer the outer face prevailed with logic if he killed his parents theyd lock him in a room somewhere and that would be all for him even the inner face recognized the unacceptability of that outcome still the power of the killing mood was so strong that he took the shells out of the and threw them down a sewer not because he didnt want to kill them but because neither face wanted to go to jail but he would kill them sooner or later that was inevitable hed build an elaborate alibibuilding the mechanisms of the alibi was one of his favourite fantasiesand then hed do it hed kill his father outright he thought about a shotgun aiming it at the old mans chest pulling the trigger hed do his mother with a knife very slowly he got a hardon thinking about it life with his parents turned him twisted him he knew too much from the very start and the girls sensed it they shied away from him and when the hormones hit everything got worse he had the fire inside but no outlet and with adolescence the inner face grew stronger to dominate the outer although the outer continued to shield his real nature and the inner face needed to be fed for years the inner face was content with cruelties to animals and smaller children in eighth grade hed killed a cat he found crossing their back yard beat it to death with a dowel rod the first blow broke the cats back and a dozen more killed it he buried it along their back fence line carefully shoveling dirt over the body smoothing the spot even transplanting a chunk of sod to conceal the fresh dirt nobody had suspected him and in the next week a halfdozen cardboard signs were nailed to phone poles asking for help finding a redblackgray tabby named jimbo a small thrill which the inner face contemplated patiently turning it over and over the next time he killed a cat he killed it only after a protracted hunt he had to know where it came from so when he killed it he could carry it up to the neighbors porch ring a doorbell and with a real tear in his eye say a car hit your cat the neighbor lady had broken down in tears her daughter had been distraught and the outer face had cried with them real agony so much so that the neighbor lady walked him home to thank his parents for his concern in the eleventh grade he took a major step when the inner face noticed that mrs garner was never without her coffee mrs garner was thirty a darkhaired almostpretty young science teacher with long slender legs he was drawn to her from the start a week into class hed stopped at the front of the room and the outer face had ventured an awkward pleasantry mrs garner had frozen him had said go to your chair please two or three of the girls in the class had exchanged quick knowing glances smirking at the snub as quickly as thatsnaphe hated the woman and noticed that she carried the coffee cup with her during chemistry class and would from time to time duck into the teachers work space at the back of the room to freshen the cup the inner face considered that for a time that mrs garner never seemed to wash the cup after she started using it but simply filled and refilled it he got to class very early one day while mrs garner was in the teachers lounge for her hourly smoke and tipped a small dose of chlordane into the cup mrs garner never noticed when she drank it but a half hour later she suddenly declared herself to be ill and on the way to the door collapsed in convulsions twoface was a hero he took charge ran to the principals office got an ambulance on the way ran back knelt by mrs garner as her convulsions nearly pulled her apart she was sprawled on her back her dress hiked up her legs from twofaces perspective kneeling next to her he could see far up her legs to the squaredoff juncture and a few random dark hairs outside her white cotton underpants he was ferociously aroused and for years afterward he pictured himself kneeling next to mrs garners body he didnt think until later that day that for two hours after the poisoning the poison bottlean iodine bottle that hed emptied to take the chlordanewas still in his pocket if anyone had suspected poisoning he would have convicted himself and it didnt occur to him until after hed dumped the bottle in a trash barrel that he hadnt wiped it for fingerprints nor did he consider for almost a month that the chlordane bottle where hed gotten the poison was still in his parents garage with the other pesticides eventually he thought of it all and the two faces agreed hed been lucky to get away with it mrs garner lived and returned to class although her memory was never as good as it should have been her science was never as good the other teachers were told that she might have accidentally poisoned herself with one of the compounds that sat around the science room odd powders in small vials not all identified and they pitied her as her hands shook when she tried to grade papers or to write the two faces watched her for the rest of the year and for all of his last year in high school proud of their handiwork tempted to finish it but too smart the inner face retracted went back to the small cruelties the other face matured and learned even better how to mask the inside as twoface grew older he had some women but none that he really wanted he got the leftovers the losers the ones he wanted sensed the wrongness about him and turned away then came anna the look of her the sound of her she was his woman always had been he didnt know exactly why didnt realize that his first view of her reminded him of his first glimpse of mrs garner but there wasnt any doubt never the slightest from the first time hed seen her amongst the others heard them talk about her shed turned the key in him and the inner face had gone outside had dealt with his rivals one to go he still processed those images through his imagination like anna herself the images excited him turned him on as did the memories of mrs garner obrien and macallister thrashing in their own blood the inner face fed on the blood swelled with it and anna must feel it somewhere in her soul or would feel it when she was no longer surrounded by these others twoface and anna were fated to be together he fantasized anna bent over the bathroom counter her buttocks thrust toward him the sinewy structure of her spine and the soft sheets of her back muscles then anna turned and spoke to him he edited frantically she couldnt see him how could she speak to him he edited but she persisted and she said talking to les and he said the guys at seventeen are going to ditch their overnight monitoring guy and the guys in the truck are gonna have to do their own like with one scanner another voice oh thats horseshit the editing broke down snarled crashed and the twofaced man suddenly came back he was sitting in the dirt with a fender next to one cheek and a hedge next to the other he had a pistol in his hand the voice was real and so was anna he pushed himself up and stepped out anna chapter harper pushed and anna weakened he was having an effect on her creek could stay she decided but youve got to give me space she told creek when harper had gone you cant follow me around the house you cant fix anything maybe i could do some painting creek suggested peering around the front room no painting anna said no fixup no cleanup no hedgetrimming you sleep you watch tv we eat we got to work he grumbled about it but agreed im gonna have to repark the truck youve got the truck i thought louis dropped you off he shook his head i put him in a cabthe trucks down the block the deadend streets between the canals were too narrow for the truck to maneuver when they had to stop momentarily at annas theyd leave it at the intersection of linnie and dell usually with louis to watch it if its there when linkhof gets up hell call the cops and get it towed linkhof was the antisocial neighbor yeah i can ditch it at jerrys the cookll be there he can see it out the window anna nodded all right ill ride down with you she got a jacket and when creek said gun selfconsciously put the smith in her jacket pocket on the opposite side from her cell phone which she carried by habit if the cops see us walking back at this time of night theyll stop us and if they frisk us ill be downtown again anna said well stop at jerrys get a coffee the skyll be getting light in a half hour we can walk back then creek said besides he added were white white the way things worked in la still the pistol felt like a brick in her pocket as they walked in the dark toward the truck the truck represented a lot of heavy lifting theyd started five years earlier with a rusty dodge van castoff video gear and spanners and a lot of metal shelving from home depot which louis and creek had bolted to the floor the floor on the dodge leaked both from rustouts and the new bolt holes and louis sometimes emerged from the back suffering from advanced carbon monoxide poisoning after three years of street work building their reputation and their contacts walking tapes around to the tv stations theyd ditched the van and bought the truck from a cable station that had decided to get out of the news business the truck came with the dish and a compressedair lift louis put in the electronics the dish alone saved hours every night if they could use the relay antennas on the mountainand they could from almost anywhere in the los angeles bowlthey could dump video and voice to everyone and the equipment was getting better creeks camera was almost new anna felt a little thump every time she saw the truck a lot of work something she was good at but she didnt see the man by the truck until they were almost on top of him she and creek talking away and creek said hey the man turnedheavy shoulders big hands and she thought of harperbut this guy was black he said anna the questioned slowed creek creek had gone into his longstride somewhatsideways combat approach closing quickly but now he hesitated and anna said who is that and the man lifted an arm toward creek and creek said no and went straight into him the shots were loud the gun spitting short sharp spikes of fire at creek three times four five creek twisted still moving in while anna clawed at her pocket then creek was on him reaching and the man turned to run his head snapped back and he screamed and anna gave up on the gun and started for creek the shooter snapped forward and began to run creek let him go anna thought the man disappeared down the street as anna turned to creek and creek fell down slumped rolled looked up at her gun he groaned get the gun hes gone get gun get gun he said urgently and anna not wanting to believe dropped down next to him and said youre okay and in the dim light of the street saw the black blood on his mouth on his face and neck the blood on his shirt lights were coming on down the street and she screamed police call the police ambulance man shot this is anna call nineoneone and someone shouted back im calling creek grabbed her by the coat and said something urgent but unintelligible his hand was wrapped in fabric and anna plucked it away a womans nylon stocking a little darker than nude maybe suntan creek had pulled it off the shooters head snapping his head back the shooter wasnt black hed been wearing a mask that all ran through her head in an instant and then she tossed the stocking away and shouted down at him are you okay goddamn creek ahh a man was running up the street toward her anna yeah its me she shouted back halfstanding my friend is shot somebody help the man arrived a neighbor named wilson stood uncertainly over her in bluebird pajamas henrys called the cops he said gotta have an ambulance hes hurt bad anna said looking up at wilson eyes big another neighbor logan was in the street running toward them a flashlight in one hand a gun in the other somebody hit ambulance on the way wilson said let me take a look logan said he squatted next to creek shined the light on his face and neck three hits he said no arteries he pulled up creeks shirt there were two small puckered blood entry wounds one just outside creeks left nipple another two inches above that bad creek mumbled the face isnt bad i dont think i cant tell about the chest the goddamn slugs can rattle around in there he pulled the shirt down nothin to do but wait and to anna he said whatre you into darlin anna shook her head cops think its a fruitcake guy a nut stalkin ya yeah something like that she screamed back down the street wheres the fuckin ambulance and to creek hold on creek god more lights were flicking on and a man shouted back on the way two minutes creek was flat on his back his eyes halfhung looking sleepy she had him by the shirt blood on her hands and jacket logan at his head and she yelled at him creek cmon cmon hold on chapter neighbors started leaking down the street and built a ring around creek and anna then the cops arrived two car lengths ahead of the ambulance and the ambulance attendants dropped an oxygen mask on creeks face and lifted him onto a gurney anna pushed away stepped up next to the truck felt the pistol against her leg the cops were right there the red rack lights banging off the houses the neighbors gathering everybody watching creek if the cops found the gun on her theyd take it theyd ask questions might hold her until they checked the gun against slugs taken from creek she didnt have that time the truck door was right there and she stepped up and inside toward the back she opened the hideout box where they kept the nagra looked guiltily toward the open door pulled the gun out and dropped it in the box when she stepped back to the door creek was going into the ambulance his eyes staring up at the night sky logan stepped over blood pressures not too bad thats what they said jesus logan she clutched his arm let go if hes not bleeding out hell be okay he said logan was watching his hands he wanted to pat her somewhere but wasnt sure exactly where how shed take the intimacy once he hits the or theyll handle it the ambulance eased away from sight carefully working through sidestepping neighbors then the driver hit the siren button and the ambulance disappeared down the block and around the corner a uniformed cop walked over to them one hand resting casually on his pistol are you the lady who was with him anna nodded listen theres a lot going on here youve got to call the santa monica or la county the cop put her in the back of his car but left the door open while he and his partner worked the street taking names and addresses of witnesses another cop car arrived and two more cops began pushing people back toward their homes anna slumped in the back seat her mind filled with creek he was a big man almost overmuscled hardened by life but on the ground looking up at her hed seemed almost frail babylike dependent helpless she turned to look out the back window and felt the cell phone in her pocket the first two cops were down the block and after a seconds thought she found harpers card took out the cell phone and punched in the number nobody home she left a message and hung up put the phone away and she thought of the masked shooter he was harpers size but the voice the voice hadnt been right for harper as far as she could tell of course the shooter had been wearing the stocking but shed heard it before the voice was familiar somehow tickled something in the back of her brain another cop car arrived and after talking with the first arrivals the two new cops came over to the car you say the man ran that way they pointed down dell yeah and theres a stocking she showed them the nylon and one of the cops asked you dont wear nylons like this do you just curious no i wear nylons sometimes but not this color okay a flat okay not skeptical but not necessarily buying it either so you say he went that way the new cops put her back in the squad car and started tracing the path of the shooter walking down dell with their flashlights she watched until the phone rang she snapped it open and said yes harper couldnt wait to hear my voice again huh he said it lightly creeks been shot silence she tried again creeks been christ the guys going through a psychotic break the shooter how bad is he creek pretty bad i think he couldnt talk when they put him in the ambulance where are you in a cop car by my house on linnie we were walking up to the truck fifteen minutes harper said and he was gone he was almost a half hour not fifteen minutes rolling up in the growing light of dawn he spotted anna in the cop car and started toward her but the cops walled him away they argued for a while and she saw him show one of the cops a card but this cop apparently didnt need legal advice and shook his head youve got to go back downtown one of the uniforms said a moment later i understand youve already been there tonight yes she looked past him at harper who was arguing with another cop his hair flopping into his eyes as he talked why cant i talk to that man we want to get a statement from you before you talk to anyone else you have a right to see your lawyer if you want but theyll tell you about that downtown the cop said he looked back at harper he used to be a cop homicide anna said used to be the cop said so she did it all over again talked to cops to a different shift fresher just up three of them this time dictated a statement impatient worried about creek demanded information about creek he was alive they told her should be okay the detectives in the unit were beginning to gather around her this guy is this guy is berserk a detective named samson told her you remember that case down in anaheim asked another cop the guy would stalk these people for weeks then slash them then he started killing them when was that that was like this guys dead though samson said yeah when did that happen i dont knowi heard it he hung himself in prison besides its more like that one over in downey the kid with the taurus wagon said a third cop man i couldnt believe hed do them right in the wagon told his mother the blood was some kind of fertilizer for a greenhouse yeah i remember whatever happened to him he used both a gun and a knife didnt he can i go anna asked harper was waiting in the same spot where hed waited the night before in the hall near the exit creeks in the or at la general he said hes got three bullets still in him twentytwos if itd been almost anything else hed be dead they were walking at speed heading for the door they hit it with a bang and were into the street side by side the face isnt bad just barely caught some skin in and out no nerve damage nothing harper said the problem is with the chest one tore a hole in his left lung and collapsed it another one went between two ribs and rattled around behind his heart oh god standing on the street she started to cry one hand to her face harper draped an arm around her shoulder and pulled her head into his chest listen the docs down there are good i had the gun in my pocket i couldnt get it out well you cant he was right there she said pointing at a parking meter trying to make him see it the guy was right there he said my name i had the gun but i couldnt get it out she started to cry again and he squeezed her head in tight he smelled of clean sweat and deodorant his arms felt like bricks she let herself go for a moment leaning into the comfort of the man then pushed back wiped tears with the back of her hand lets go see him youre his sister harper muttered as they pushed through the emergency room door the place smelled like all emergency rooms a combination of alcohol and raw turkey anna nodded and five seconds later at the desk she said to a nurse my brother was shot and they brought him here can you tell me where he is her distress came through the nurse never questioned her hes still in surgery he said tipping his head down the hall theres a waiting room can anybody tell us how he is the nurse shook his head he should be all right if hes in good shape and they say he is thats the best thing how are they operating right now the nurse glanced at the clock they have been for almost two hours oh jesus the tears started again and harper steered her toward the waiting area anna wasnt good at waiting and harper was worse while she sat remembering the attack and the days before itall going back to jacobs leap and jasons deathhe read an aging copy of modern maturity the sports section of a threedayold usa today and a coverless time a man with a bad hand cut came in and harper went over to talk about it until a nurse shooed him away he walked around and jingled change in his pocket got coffee for the two of them three or four times he went to the desk came back with nothing new he put his feet up tried to sleep and failed an hour after they arrived pam glass walked in her face haggard she was wearing one of her power suits with an hermиs knotted at the throat but the rims of her eyes were red with stress and tears why didnt anybody call me she asked anna how is he anna said where we didnt know hes still in surgery he was supposed to call me this morning and he didnt and i thought i dont know what i thought she was not quite babbling i didnt hear from him and i went in and jim said hed been shot i was getting a cup of orange juice and jim came over and said creek was shot you better sit down harper said he introduced himself and said i saw you a couple of days ago i was in talking to jim oh yeah she said vaguely she looked back toward the operating suite what have you heard not much hes hurting and hes been in there a while oh my god anna was watching her and watching her knowing that creek had made a connection with the woman nothing forced here no sense that creek was a fling for her she liked him a lot and anna liked her for that anna sat on a toosoft chair with her legs curled beneath her and stared running mental movies of her time with creek glass tried to read a times harper wandered look harper finally said to anna were not gonna do your pal any good sitting around im not leaving until i know how he is anna said neither am i glass said harper pulled a chair out of the line beside annas and faced it toward her what have you been doing the last couple of days the question had a rhetorical sound to it and anna shrugged and opened her mouth and harper cut her off ill tell you what youve been shuttling around from one bunch of cops to another santa monica la venice these guys up in burbank whoever they were north hollywood whatever and you know what all those cops are hoping that somebody elsell get this guy because they aint got squat and they dont have enough time to chase him with everything else they gotta do were chasing him glass said grimly cmon harper said to her how many hours will you put on it the only reason la tolerates me running around is because i used to work there and theyre hoping i might turn something up and call them they just dont have the time theyll makethe time anna said grimly the only reason this guy isnt a big story is that nobodys paid attention to him if i want them to pay attention they will oh bullshit harper said howre you gonna do that you cant you dont know everything about television anna said interrupting you look at anybody in this placeshe waved at the emergency room in generaland i could do a story on himor herand i could sell it anybody you me the nurse guy the guy with the cut a serial killer everybody would take it if it was done right and ill tell you whatthe cops dont want to chase him ill put them on cnn tomorrow morning thentheyll chase him harper was shaking his head all right maybe you could do that but youd just start a clusterfuck glass said interrupting him theyd bring in the nine patrolmen with the flattest feet and put them in suits and have them go around with notepads playing investigator and nothing would get done i mean youd just panic themusand piss em off ive dealt with a couple of these guys the fruitcakes harper said intently theyre crazy and screwed up but most of them are sort of smart twisted but not stupid you sic the cops on him really heavyyou put him on tvand hell love it and then hell kill somebody else just to keep things going one of your friends maybe and hell be looking for you too hell be out thereand if the cops dont get him hell get you eventually are you trying to scare me anna asked coldly yes cause you should be scared now what im suggesting is we get a little proactive proactive you sound like the long beach chamber of commerce what im saying is you talk to me about your friends about creeks friends about the dopers youve known about weird shit youve seen the last couple of months creek must know some dopers living where he does theres dope coming through the marina all the time and with your job youve been down to look at creeks place glass asked sure looked at his boat looked at his house he turned back to anna but getting back to the point talk to me let me debrief you the shooteryou know him we can work out a few ideas together and ill check them out anna said look jake i dont know whats going on but i really think youre wasting your time this cant have anything to do with your son if you think about it he spread his hands then touched her knee so maybe it doesnt id like to find out for sure though thats the only thing ive goti want to know what the dope was about if you find the dealer whatre you gonna do glass asked i dont know he said kill him asked anna he looked away from them down the hall i dont know i doubt it but i wont know for sure until i get there they were still talking when a doctor came down the hall surgery gown showing a halfdozen blood spots his mask pulled down under his chin he pulled off his cap as he came up looked at anna and asked a little doubt in his voice are you mr creeks relatives anna and glass were on their feet how is he you dont look like sisters different mom anna said tell us again their intensity banished doubt about the connection and the doc smiled gravely and said unless theres something we didnt find he should be okay oh thank god anna said and glass started to leak tears again but hes hurt badly the surgeon continued the lung will repair itself fairly quickly but theres muscle damage in the chest wall and the back muscles and thatll take a while whens he gonna be able to talk harper asked tomorrow probably hes going to be pretty sleepy for a couple of days at least then hes going to hurtbut i doubt hell be in here a week did the police tell you about the circumstances of the shooting harper asked the doc nodded yes well list him under an aliaswe do it all the time in battering cases if somebody doesnt know exactly where to find him they wont aw thats great anna said glass started sniffing again and then turned to anna and said i dont cry for anything ever anna nodded neither do i she said another tear rolling down her cheek they stayed until creek had gone to the recovery room then glass left in a hurry im moving in here she declared ive got to get some stuff together and get some time off moving in anna asked the guy may be stalking you but hes killing the people around you glass said im gonna get a chair and sit in his room with a gun when she was gone harper and anna stood by the side of the street the sun beating down whatre you gonna do harper asked try to get some sleep anna said try to think of some names think of some names yeah im gonna talk to you and something else whats that when you go looking for this guy anna said in a way that left no doubt im coming with you chapter anna made lists she slept exhausted but her brain made lists the crazies the dopers the men whod come on to her in the past six months anyone who might have fixated on her she dreamed twisting in the percale sheets of the man at the truck the shooter a big man with something familiar to him a way of holding his shoulders and the voice hed said only one word her name but hed spoken it before in her hearing she knew this man but who was it she found herself paying attention to harper when he spoke her name was the voice the same she didnt think sobut now she was confusing her memories of the shooting with other moments with other people calling her name she made lists a thumpa human soundfrom downstairs she rose out of her sleep like a diver coming to the surface breaking through gasping looking around thinking gun but she had no gun the gun was in the truck then another thump running water and she recognized the thump as a toilet seat going up then coming down the water in the downstairs toilet harper hed been sleeping on the couch he wouldnt go away she pushed herself up glanced at the bedroom door closed not locked harper no she knew why harper was here when she came down from the bedroom hair still wet from the shower harper was putting at a paper circle on the living room carpet your floor breaks about an inch toward the back wall on a fifteenfoot putt he said do tell she went on past and picked up the phone in the kitchen he was awake for an hour about noon but hes sleeping again hes doing fine and without complications he could be out this week harper said he was squatting looking over a ball at the paper circle she put the phone back on the hook how is that possible this week they push them out in a hurry harper said he stood up and hovered over the ball then looked at anna are you going to say something before i putt no id hate to have you say something right in the middle of my backswing no go ahead he moved the putter head back an inch and anna said watch it the stroke came through and the ball missed the paper circle by two inches thats fuckin hilarious he said are we gonna talk or are you gonna spend the afternoon playing with your putter they walked out to jerrys into the sun anna quiet head down harper carrying the putter swinging it balancing it turning it like a walking stick the afternoon traffic was already building toward the rush and they had to wait before crossing pacific to the restaurant youre not scared enough harper said as they walked what most people if a madman was stalking them they couldnt move he said she thought about it as they crossed the street and said maybe im burned out on being scared going out every night we see all kinds of stuff people shot and stabbed and squashed in cars and burned to death when you see enough of it youve got to assume it wont happen to you you mustve felt like that when you were a cop nope never did i was scared shitless all the time logan had parked the truck in the restaurant lot after the shooting and now anna unlocked the door knelt on the seat and fished in the hideout box for the got it turned and caught harper appreciating her ass she hopped out of the truck and dropped the pistol in her jacket pocket i thought you kept the gun at home harper said grinning he knew hed been caught and he wasnt the least abashed by it he twirled the putter like a baton i do but i had it last night when creek got shot and i didnt want the cops to take it jerrys was annas regular spot with comfortable booths and decent coffee mostly empty in the late afternoon the waiters bustling around getting ready for the dinner rush the owner donna towjerrys exwifecame over with coffee and said heard about creek i called the hospital and they said hed be okay looks like it anna said they talked for a few more minutes anna giving her a quick account of the shooting too goddamn many guns around tow said as she headed back toward the kitchen anna and harper slid into a booth and a waitress brought a pot of coffee and two cups so what are we doing anna asked harper having you along wont make it easier harper said it might im probably smarter than you are anna said thatcould help he said he grinned again he wouldnt be goaded so what the grin faded and he squared himself in the booth and said names the whole thing is connected to obrien and jacob you shoot jacobs fall and the next thing the guy is coming after you and kills obrien and macallister who also happen to be connected by drugs somewhere in there well find his track but i didnt know that much about jason anna said wed done a few things over at ucla creek and louis and me and he was taking film classes and heard about us he came up with a storythis was a year or so agoand we shot it and sold it so he started looking for stuff and whenever hed come up with something he rode along shot it and got a cut ten percent but you werent social no hed get me by phone or if i needed an extra guy id call him up he was good with a camera and he had a cool head when things were getting rough hed keep shooting no matter what i know a sudden deep sadness crossed his face and anna reached out and touched his hand on the coffee cup im really sorry about your kid i mean i really am yeah he looked out the window at a woman skating by in the street walkman phones on her ears christ i hardly knew him i mean id see him all the timebut i didnt know him it was like i could get to know him later my exwife i think she did a pretty good job with him now this he shook himself and said so do you have any ideas about obrien where we start i know one name and faceboband ive heard about a couple of other people but if we can find bob we might have something bob she told harper was also in film at ucla a few months earlier jason had called about a possible story theyd arranged to meet in santa monica and when they did bob was with him they were both high they either shared the dope or shared the dealer she said one way or another so lets go talk to bob harper said pushing the coffee away hospital first anna said creek was in a thirdfloor critical care unit sleeping an iv dripping into his arm pam glass was curled up on a chair next to the bed reading a magazine wearing the same clothes shed been wearing that morning when she saw them coming she smiled weakly and stood up he should sleep for another hour or two she whispered have you been home anna asked no i just went down to the corner for a sandwich im okay god pam they both turned and looked at creek his hair had been tamed and was pulled back under his head his face was pale under the sailors tan his cheekbones more prominent than anna remembered and he looked she thought almost old an hour or two anna asked pam nodded what are you guys doing looking around harper said glass hardened up look i know you were a hotshot when you were with the sheriffs department but i dont think we really need harper grinned at her and said shhh what just a minute ago you were really worried about creek thats a very nice aspect of your personality he looked at anna and tipped his head toward the door lets go we can be back in two hours on the way to ucla harper said ive got a question but i dont know exactly how to phrase it think real hard anna said pretend the question is a putt okay the thing is youre an interesting woman were just starting to know each other and i figure we can go one of two wayswe can have a pure business relationship or we can think about maybe you know doing something together i mean not for sure but leave the possibility open since you dont seem to be involved with anybody you know what i mean no i dont think i understood the last sentence at all it was too complicated anna said she understood she was also enjoying herself im saying that ive been tempted to come on to you just a little bit harper said a little bit tempted or a little bit come on he changed lanes with a lurch cutting off a mercedes that had been coming up from behind a lot tempted to come on a little bit okay ive got that go ahead she put her feet on the dashboard but if theres no point ill forget it he said give up on the other hand if there is a point then ill continue to be tolerant and charming and liberal and shit in my own cowboy way jesus anna said pinching the bridge of her nose cowboy you were probably born in reseda so is there a point or not well she said letting her eyelids droop i wouldnt totallygive up totally he said satisfied tracing bob took time the administration offices were closed but they found a course guide in the library anna thought bob and jason had been taking an editing course together they found a course description that might be right located the classrooms on a map they got into the building as a kid was coming out then walked through the hallways looking for someone who might be a teacher they didnt find any but after talking to a few students scored with two palefaced kids in an editing room redhaired guy skinny sorta hardfaced like a skater harper said giving them a description from anna like from arkansas or somewhere this hillbilly accent asked one of the kids anna snapped her fingers thats him i forgot the accent well his names bob all right i dont know his last name but he works at kinkos at night bob was already on the job and recognized anna as soon as they walked in he lifted a hand walked over hows it going we need to talk anna said about jason jason i havent seen him for a couple of weeks we doneed to talk she said she looked around whos your supervisor they took him out behind the kinkos into an overflow parking lot where he lit a cigarette and said jesus i cant believe hes dead dead were gonna send his ashes back to indiana anna said bobhis last name was catwellshuddered when i die i hope they dont send me back to fort smith nasty he was murdered harper said the guy who did it took his time beat him to death his skull was in about fifty pieces aw man he said then what do you want why are you talking to me whoever killed him may be coming after me i dont know why but thats the way it is anna said theres a possibility that whoever did it was somehow involved in dealing drugs to jason you know jason got into it a little heavyand the last time i saw you you both were into it oh no catwell said he flicked the cigarette in a bush and took a step back toward the store harper moved quicklyvery quicklybetween catwell and the kinkos back door anna remembered the ease with which hed taken her at the apartment he said we really need to know where you got the crank or whatever fuck you catwell said you can get killed talking about shit like that talk to us or talk to the cops anna said the cops are crazy to get this guy hes killed two people and shot a third one that sounds like a reason notto talk if you give us a name well forget you harper said pressing him if you dont well feed you to the cops theyll be on you like a hot sweat and when they get the name they wont hide where they got it youll be right down there identifying the guy i dont have to tell anybody any fuckin thing he walked around harper toward the door you know better than that anna said talking to his back sometimes you do have to tell you know they can squeeze you if you dont help us the copsll be here in ten minutes so help please you wont be able to stay here if you dont harper said your assll be back in fort smith please anna said catwell got to the door before he stopped he faced the door unmoving for a full ten seconds then finally turned and said to anna so you used to like party down with jason and sean anna confused by the tone of his voice said what harper asked sean macallister catwell shifted his gaze to harper you know him yeah i saw him last night harper said to anna he said the late sean macallister anna was closing in on catwell when you said i partied down with them whatd you mean catwells eyes slid away and he made a you know bob of his head you know no i dont but ive

frizzy black hair and a goatee he looks like the devil catwell said and jesus please dont let him find out who you talked to got time to swing by the hospital again anna said looking at her watch he says the guys at the grill all night all right harper had a remote key entry for the car unlocked her door from twenty feet then opened it for her touched her back as she got in almost courtly she thought oldfashioned not unpleasant sorry about that sleepingaround thing bunch of kids bullshitting nobody pays any attention to it somebody did anna said still im a little shocked so weve got to check this bjs place our guy must be hanging out there if he heard that story yeah but that doesnt get going until late so we look up this tarpatkin first harper said im looking forward to that in the car headed back she asked casually what kind of women do you go out with lawyers golfers countryclubbers he thought for a long moment guided the car through a knot of curb cruisers and said finally i dont go out much anymore she looked at him curiously you dont seem shy im not im just tired i mostly want to work play golf and mess around at my house i used to go over to see jacob a couple of times a week maybe wed go out to eat youre gonna miss him i cant even believe hes gone harper said hunching down over the steering wheel holding on with both hands so maybe im being nosy he grinned maybe you are well thats what i do she said then she shut up because sooner or later she thought hed have a little more to say he wasnt glib he wasnt exactly taciturn but he didnt have much of a line of bullshit and after a while he said going out with women is just a lot of trouble most of them you meet you know nothings going to happenbut youve got to spend a few hours with them anyway being nice i guess im too busy for that when its obvious that nothings going to happen id like to say well thats that ill get you a cab and we can all go home anna pretended to be horrified have you ever done that of course not im too polite id think youve got a lot of women coming around you look okay youve got a lot of hair guys like you make some money youd be surprised how many women dont care about money he said but then he shrugged and added but yeah there were quite a few women around for a while now im getting a reputation as a nasty old curmudgeon so its not quite as intense as when i was on the market no girlfriends at all not right nownot for a while really id like to he stopped what she pressed like to what we dont know each other well enough he said for me to tell you what id like to do a parking place appeared a halfblock from the hospitals emergency entrance harper dove into it chortling fed the meter but as they started down toward the hospital a man in a suit in the dimly lit glassedin entry halfturned toward them saw them and then suddenly and hurriedly turned back to the hospital doors and disappeared inside did you see that anna said yeah harper broke into a trot anna running beside him somebody who doesnt want to talk to us you know him couldnt see his face she said white hair harper said they were moving fast now hit the doors to the entry burst into the reception area no whitehaired men a guard was looking at them quizzically harper hurried toward him anna a halfstep behind a whitehaired guy just came through here harper said did you see where he went the guard said yeah he hey who are you guys but hed started to point down the hall the elevators were just around the corner elevators anna said to harper and she said to the guard call the intensive care unit on the third floor if a whitehaired guy shows up watch him he may have a gun harper was already hurrying toward the elevators anna catching up as the guard said yes maam and picked up a phone they turned the corner three elevators one with the door open waiting of the other two one was on eight coming down the other was on two stopping at three damn it harper said he looked around and anna said stairsd be faster and they went left and up the stairs around two flights as they got to the third floor anna heard a door shut below them the hollow tunnel sound of metal on concrete she stopped looked down you hear that yeah harper grunted but he went on past into the corridor on three two nurses were talking at a work station one with a phone in her hand and looked up at them did a whitehaired man no nobody came here the guard just called is pam glass still down in intensive care the police officer i think so they went that way and anna blurted maybe he went down you heard that door close he couldnt have been too far ahead of us yeah they turned the corner into the intensive care unit glass was standing next to creeks bed creeks eyes were closed no whitehaired man nobody just came through here anna asked glass shook her head no what harper said tell them and ran back toward the stairs anna asked glass you got your gun yes keep a hand on it theres a guy and turned and ran after harper she caught him on the stairs and harper glanced back at her grunted shook his head and kept circling down they came out in a subbasement looked both ways finally turned left a shorter hall and an exit sign the exit led to an underground parking ramp they hurried along the ramp and harper said get the gun out anna took the gun out of her jacket pocket feeling a little sillyand a little dangerousand held it by her pants leg as they turned up the ramp toward a pay booth a latino was running out an adding machine in the booth and harper said did a man just run by here yes si he went that way one minute he pointed up the ramp to the street they ran up the ramp and found traffic harper looked both ways down at anna and said hes gone she shoved the gun back into her jacket and said yeah creek had been awake for a few minutes had maybe recognized glass but maybe not he was drifting glass said he thought he was on his boat anna told glass about the whitehaired man and finished with its possible that it was nothing no harper disagreed that move he madei saw that two hundred times when i was a cop especially working dope someone sees you figures you for the cops and he turns and splits runs in the front door runs out the back just like that and thats what he was doing i see it all the time glass said thats what it felt like anna admitted she kept looking at creek then glancing away his figure disturbed her he looked hollow tired old with lines in his face that she hadnt noticed before hed always been the opposite of those things a guy whod go on forever now he lay there little of him visible other than his hair and oddly pale eyelids breathing through a plastic mask his breath so shallow his life bumping along on the monitors overhead like a slow day on a stockmarket ticker chapter they left glass and creekglass said shed try to get creek moved again in case the whitehaired man was a real threatand went back into the night heading for the philadelphia grill the guy was probably a doper harper said cause he moved so fast like a guy whos holding he didnt stop to look us over he didnt stop to see if we were coming after himhe just took off and the way he went out he mustve already been in the hospital because he knew about the parking ramp exit and how to get there in a hurry that worries me he was scouting the place anna said what surprises me is he was old or older maybe notcouldve been blond couldve been the light on his hair no he was older fifties anyway the way he moved im thinking she closed her eyes letting the scene run through her mind he saw us he turned he sort of groped for the door he pulled it open almost hit himself with it he was a little creaky maybe even a little heavy he wasnt a kid though he just moved like an older guy that doesnt fit the profile of any psycho i ever heard of harper said thoughtfully maybe the guy in chicagogacey he was sorta porky and a little older than most of them i think hes not what i expected anna said the prowler was fast and the guy who shot creek hewas fast really fast he had to be a young guy so weve got twopeople giving us a hard time he looked at her with thin amusement and we cant find either one of them the philadelphia grill was a bakedmeatloafandpoweredpotatoes place on westwood jammed into the lower corner of a coloredconcrete building it had a wraparound glass window but the window was blocked with blinds pulled nearly shut inside the clientele seemed to hover over their coffee arms circling the cups as though somebody might try to take the coffee away from them and they tended to look up whenever the door opened the blinds which blocked the view in were open just enough that from the inside they could see out there he is anna muttered tarpatkin looked like her idea of a crazy killer his pitchblack hair six inches long streamed away from his narrow face as though an electric current were running through it he had thin black eyebrows over a long bony nose his lips were narrow tight and too pink the only color in his face he was dressed all in black and was reading a tabloidsized realestate newspaper he had one hand on a cup of tea showing a teabag string and tag under his hand he was wearing a heavy gold wedding band but on his middle finger an empty cup sat across the table from him what if hes the guy do you know him ever met him harper said no id remember the face then hes not the guy because you know the killer at least a little bit harper said slide into the booth across from him ill get a chair tarpatkin watched them coming eyes just over the top of the paper his expression didnt change when anna slid into the booth hi she said smiling harper hooked a chair from an empty table across from the booth turned in backward and sat down just blocking tarpatkins route out of the booth mr tarpatkinnames harper and my friend here is anna hello anna tarpatkin said is that a gun in your pocket or are you just happy to see me no no its a gun anna said pleasantly wed show it to you but in hereharper looked aroundsomebody might get excited and wed all start shooting what do you want tarpatkin asked just need to talk harper said thats all you guys ever want tarpatkin said talk then your ass winds up in jail what annas eyebrows went up and she glanced uncertainly at harper tarpatkin caught it and clouded up if you assholes aint cops you can get the fuck out of my booth were not cops but i used to be and i still know a lot of deputies harper said the thing is youre caught right in the middle of a major murder case and the cops are freaking out you can talk to us off the record or talk to them on the record youre talking bullshit man i dont know any murder mysteries his language veered from formal almost scholarly to the street and then back again he might have been two people tarpatkin shook out the newspaper as though he were about to resume reading one of your clients jason obrien got taken off in a really bad way a couple of days ago beat to death carved up with a knife when harper said it anna was watching tarpatkins eyes they flickered when jasons name was mentioned and maybe you know a guy named sean macallister another flicker he knows them both anna said to harper not taking her eyes off tarpatkin tarpatkin didnt deny it this was news he could use carved up you know a guy who likes knives harper asked tarpatkin thought for a second then said i know a couple of them but they dont know those two when did this happen i havent seen anything about it in the paper anna told him briefly and then said were looking for a guy selling wizards we understand you dont but were hoping that you might know who does right around herethe university neighborhood tarpatkin looked her over for a moment then said honey i dont know what kind of mission youre on but you really dont want to mess around with those people theyre amateurstheyre crazy and theyll kill you for a nickel somebody might be trying to kill me for free anna said were trying to get him to stop huh he pulled at his goatee then said let me give you fifteen seconds on how the smart part of this business worksand for the tape recorder if youre wearing one youll notice that this is all hypothetical he pulled a napkin out of a chrome napkin holder and smoothed it on the tabletop anna thought he was going to write on it but then he started folding it as he talked ladiner origami suppose you got a smalltime dealer tarpatkin said hes got maybe seventyfive a hundred regular customers he only takes new customers from recommendations and only after looking them over this guy is making say ten grand a week after expenses no taxes he flies over to the bahamas a few times a year and makes a deposit takes a little vacation in ten years with some careful investments hes got eight or ten million in the bank and he moves to the bahamas full time or mexico costa rica somewhere if hes smooth he dont have to worry too much about the cops because hes such a smalltimer and when they come around he cooperates the cops always want the big guyschrist if they busted everybody like this smalltimer theyd have to build twenty new jails so they dont i mean hey hes a small businessman a little better than insurance maybe not so good as selling stocks and bonds anna broke in but these other guys are different tarpatkin shook a finger at her like a schoolmaster making a point im coming to that honeytheyre very different they go into the dope business and they think if i sell a pound of crank i make ten thousand dollars if i sell a ton of crank i make twenty million dollars so ill sell a ton of crank this year and since theyve been to the movies they know the business is dangerous so they buy a load of guns and knives and dynamite and chain saws and whatever else they can think of then to get their heads right they get into the product themselves the next thing you know youve got these drug freaks with guns and dynamite and chain saws and theres crank all over the street and everybodys going crazy looking for themcompetitors cops dba they always find them go to jail dont get your twenty million or wind up in a bush somewhere with your head cut off he shook his head sadly and asked in his street patois is this any fuckin way to run a fuckin business and then back to the scholar i think not but these are the people who are selling your wizards so can you put us onto somebody tarpatkin shook his head no i cant i stay away from those people however if one of you has a cell phoneor a regular phone for that matteri could ask around and call you so you wanna talk to the cops harper said no but i dont know anythingnot what you want why would i i dont hang with those people i stay as far away as i can thats bull harper said you guys have always got your ears to the ground tarpatkin shrugged well you could drag me out into the street and beat the shit outa me until i tell you what you want except that i dont know it anna and harper looked at each other and then anna dug in her purse found a pen and wrote her cell phone number on tarpatkins folded napkin call me anytime she said i will youre a little sweetie about your hypothetical dealer sending his hypothetical money to the bahamas anna said how long has he been doing this hypothetically could be eight years tarpatkin said he bobbed his head and smiled one of his canine teeth was solid gold and it winked at her from beneath his ratty mustache outside harper said i dont know what we could do all we got is threats of siccing the cops on him we could drag him out in the alley and beat the shit out of him anna said wryly in that place we d get about three steps harper said i have a feeling they sort of look out for each other in fact just a minute he walked back to the diner door pulled it open looked in then walked back shaking his head hes gone hell be in the bahamas by dawn as they were getting into harpers bmw the phone in annas purse rang she glanced at harper then took the phone out and clicked it on hello a little girls voice oddly tinny with an adults vocabulary and intonations said the men you want to see are brothers named ronnie and tony and they live just a minute just a minute anna said and to harper gimme a paper she found the pen in her purse and harper groped in a door bin and finally came up with a road map write on it he said the tinny little girls voice recited an address in malibu and finished real modern gray weathered wood lots of black glass right on the hill above the highway you wont have any trouble finding it and sheit tarpatkinwas gone voicealtering phone deal harper said when anna described the voice lot of dealers use them you get like twenty choices of voice why so in case we were recording it he wouldnt be on the record strange life trying to make it to retirement harper said two years anna glanced at her watch weve got time to run out to malibu or we could head down to bjs harper glanced at her the question about bjs is this youll see some people you know but so what how do we pick out the guy if he talks to me or comes on to me somebodysgonna come on to you you go to a party box thats what its for anna thought about it for a minute harper was not only right but he was also on the track of the people whod fed dope to his son shed go with that malibu she said harper nodded we spot the house but we dont do anything i want to check with some guys in the sheriffs department run these names ronnie and tony harper had a thomas brothers guide stashed in the back seat anna turned on the cars reading lights as they dropped onto the pch and made the right turn up toward malibu and began paging through the maps if the address is right its just before the turnoff for corral canyon she said after a moment should be easy to pick out harper said they sat in companionable silence for a while not much traffic just cruising then harper said how come youre not going out with anyone i dont know she said she looked out her window away from him nothing to see but the dirt bluff rising away from the highway into the dark ive just had other things been a little lonely ive been busy she said and after a few seconds yeah ive been a little lonely then what ah theres this guy i went out with him years ago pretty intense i thought we were gonna get married but we didnt i saw him the other day at a gas station hes out here on a fellowship i guessi called a mutual friend anyway it all sorta came back on me whats he do hes a composer modern stuffthe new york philharmonic debuted one of his poems sketch of malaga one of his poems compositions he calls them poems hes not really that arty just knows how to work the levers on the classical music machine harper glanced at her sounds like you might resent that a little oh no i guess its necessary but i wasnt good at it so youre a musician thats what i really am she said harper had a way of listeningmaybe picked up when he was a copthat seemed to pull the words out of her he was attentive reallylistened she told him about growing up in wisconsin about her mothers death how shed been the best pianist in her high school the best theyd ever had that shed been the best at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee the year she graduated that she was one of the best two or three in graduate school not quite good enough she told him staring out the window at the night clark had also been a pianist not quite at her level but hed seen the writing on the wall much sooner than she had hed branched into direction and composition started working the music machine couldnt you have gone that way nah performance is one thing composition is something else takes a different kind of mind did you ever try it i was never really interested in it she said so what happened we were living together and he was the big intellectual and i was doing session gigs movie music i dont know it pulled us apart i kept thinking that if you just played well enough practised hard enough youd make it and that wasnt the game at all so i went to burbank and he went to yale ah thats really excellent harper said what she asked halfsmiling you doresent the mealy little poser no i really dont she protested then youd like him he even plays golf rock bandsplay golf harper said not impressed so are you pining for him i dont know she said maybe shit yeah its sort of a problem you know if youre thinking about it might be sorta awkward having you stay over im gonna stay over he said but i wont be rattling your doorknob in the night staying over is business okay was she just the smallest bit disappointed maybe would you play something on the piano for me he asked if you like the car seemed hushed the outside world away from the two of them what music do you listen to mostly hard rock or hard classical some old funky blues and jazz but only for an hour or so at a time we like the same things she said except im not so big on rock and a little bigger on the jazz what should i play for you maybe something by i dunno sousa maybe he turned quickly saw her embarrassed that was a joke for christs sake he laughed loosen up batory so who do you like you could play me anything by satie satie really really he said ive been listening to him a lot hes very delicate and funny sometimes he glanced at her interpreting her silence as skepticism im a lawyer not a fuckin moron he said she ducked her head and pointed up the hill malibu she said the house was a halfblock east of corral on a short hooked turnoff with a circle at the end there were two other homes on the circle all three showing lights and all with steel fences darkened and turned to resemble wrought iron facing the street the driveways were blocked with decorative eightfoothigh electric gates between stone pillars well just keep rolling through harper said looking out through the sweep of his headlights look for dogs anything that might be a dog i cant see anything anna said they were back out at corral harper stopped looked both ways then said wed be crazy to try to get in the front get in she looked back at the house at the fence and the hedge behind it the security sign next to the stone pillars beside the driveway that place is a fort lets go get an ice cream he said isnt there an ice cream place down at the shopping center she got a dutch chocolate and he took a raspberry and they sat on a bench outside of a ben jerrys and ate the ice cream talking about nothing of importance when they finished harper wiped his hands and face with the tiny napkin from the ice cream parlor pitched it into a trash container and said you drive why i want to go back there and take one more look maybe get out jake this is a really bad idea he nodded i know but i cant figure out what else to do i just want to stand on one of those stone pillars if i can and take a look see whats in there jake what you chicken he asked never a chicken never one of the houses had gone dark but the target house showed lights on all three floors well roll right up ill hop out do a quick stepup look in and then get right back in the car and were out of there he said aw man but she felt a little thrill a little of the roamingthroughthenight feel she took the car into the hook and heard harpers door pop she slowed and he said keep rolling slow ill latch the door dont want them to see headlights stopping he hopped out with the car still moving pushed the door shut until it caught looked around once as he approached the fence and then stepped on a horizontal bracebar pulled himself up and looked into the yard anna continued through the circle headed out toward the street she rolled her window down and looked over at his back and said in a harsh whisper lets go just a minute and suddenly he was over the fence and out of sight oh no she continued moving but her mind was churning better to move than to stop she thought shed go out to the street do a uturn out of sight and come back in what was he thinking hopping over the fence he wasa moron she was at the street touched the brakes to show the red flash of a departing car did the uturn on corral and started back in rolled the window down on his side as she went and tried to look back as she did somebody behind the fence screamed get him get him over there and harper shouted anna the highway she couldnt see him but his voice was clear enough anna rolled through the circle again accelerating the wheels squealing on the new blacktop down the short street a finger of fear in her throat left down the hill the bmw tracking as though it were on rails bak was that a shot her face jerked to the right but all she could see was hillside shed heard something but what was it bak a shot thats what it was she jammed her foot to the floor powering through sixtyfive downhill then hammered the brake as she got to the bottom paused at the highway then ran the light and headed around to the left she looked up the bluff saw nothing but scrub brush and weeds the house was right there fifty feet ahead and so was harper he was spilling down the hill tumbling hitting every ten feet dirt flying not quite out of control but not quite under control either a car passed her going north and as soon as it was clear she swerved across the highway to the left up onto the narrow weedy shoulder powered through the dirt and rocks until she was directly below him he landed in a cloud of dirt struggled to get up limped around the car as she popped the passenger door fell inside and gasped go go i cant she was looking into a stream of cars coming up from the south bak go thats a fuckin gun she jumped on the gas still on the shoulder blinked her lights a few times to intimidate a small white northbound car and swerved across the highway are you all right yeah he was out of breath and his shirt was ripped boy was that stupid he was looking out the back window no kidding she said angrily what did you yell at me later he was looking out the back window right now i think theyre coming after us a cadillac just cleared the bottom of the hill coming this way i heard them yelling about getting a car oh boy the highway was not particularly busy the northbound cars arrived in short packs with open stretches between the packs in the rearview mirror she saw headlights slewing left to pass a slow moving southbound car taking advantage of a break in the oncoming traffic youre gonna have to drive a little faster harper said hold onto your socks she floored it anna always liked speed and the big bmw accelerated like an unwinding spring seventy eighty ninety a hundred all without hesitation she blew past two cars had five seconds of peace in the righthand lane then squeezed past an idling jaguar in the face of an oncoming pickup harper winced then reached up to the overhead and found a handle to hang onto maybe not this fast he said theyre still back there she said the cadillac was cutting through the traffic like a shark through a school of tunabut its lights seemed to be getting smaller they blazed through malibu past the shopping center the garage doors of the beach houses blurring into one long gray line anna for christs sake youre doing a hundred and twelve slow down she shook her head she was mad and she could drive he deserved to be scared she took another car pushed a little harder on the gas glanced down at the speedometer a hundred and eighteen this thing rolls jesus harper said he turned to look behind them anna theyre out of sight theyre out of sight keep watching for them she said she let the car out for a few more seconds feeling the speed then eased off the gas watched the speed drop below a hundred fifteen minutes later they burned through the sunset intersection two minutes later she turned up temescal dropped to a cruise and looked at harper you were limping i mightve sprained my knee i banged myself up coming down the hill and got shot at but nothing happened jake she said in exasperation i was standing there and i could see some people moving inside a window and there was a crack in the drapes and i just thought i could take a look and i got in and there was another window down the side and then everybody started yelling he said talking fast there mustve been some kind of alarm and i was stuck in the back and people were coming out the front i ran right past the pool in back there was a woman out there she started yelling and i went over the edge and some asshole started shooting what do you expect prowling a house i used a fishwhacker on a guy who was doing that yeah well after a moment he said it seemed like a good idea at the time anna laughed aloud the first time since shed heard that jason was dead she liked the speed harper made her stop at a gas station pay phone got a number for the malibu cops dialed it and said theres been a shooting he gave them the address and hung up stir up the bees nest he said what for see what happens there was no point in even trying to go to bjs harper was a mess from the fall down the hill he looked as he said like hed been whipped through hell with a sootbag at annas house harper hobbled up the walk its not really damaged it just hurts but nothings loose ive got some of that blue ice stuff you can put on it she said thatd be good she kept the ice packs in the refrigerator and went to get one while harper disappeared into the bathroom she stood outside the door with the ice pack and said okay harper opened the door hed pulled his golf shirt over his head and turned around to show her his back he looked like hed been scourged long fiery rips running down his back not so good he said you mustve run into some thorn trees up there she walked around him to the medicine cabinet found some antiseptic cream cmon ill put some of this stuff on he sat shirtless in a kitchen chair while she pulled a desk lamp around focused it on his back some of the scratches were deep but none were still bleeding he also showed a scrape on his shoulder and a large redblue bruise on his forearm she dabbed on the antiseptic cream and he flinched and said ow and is there a sliver in there she touched the spot again and he flinched and she said maybe im gonna have to wipe this off well take it easy hey im doing the best i can she wiped the cream away with a kleenex spotted a broken thornand then further down his back three more of them sit still she said i need tweezers the thorns took quite a while but she got them all and layered on the antiseptic cream youll make a mess out of a shirt she said ive got a couple of old tshirts he said he stood up turned around once in his tracks stretched flexed testing his back and said im gonna be a little sore in the morning anna could suddenly smell him sweat and some kind of musky deodorant and blood maybe a salty smell and realized that she was standing very close to a large halfnaked man in her kitchen and that patching up his back might have broken down a wall a little before shed intended harper picked up the sudden change of atmosphere and laughed lightly and said suddenly got a little close in here yeah she flushed she reached over to pick up the firstaid cream and he caught her arm and said so could you kiss me once to make it feel better well he kissed her very easily and she kissed back again just a little out of her control for that extra halfsecond that she hadnt intended she pulled away and said oh boy and harper said maybe i better get that tshirt the tshirt put a little distance between them but not much at least she thought there wasnt so much skin around he brought a kitchen chair into the hallway next to the piano and said you were gonna play a satie for me its late i cant lie down until my back dries up a little he said so she played for him the delicate familiar simple little first gymnopedie the final chords hung in the hall and when they died she said there like it he bobbed his head yeah sticky silence i dont suppose youd want to come sit on my lap for a minute over on the couch he said maybe just for a minute she said so they necked for a while and he was careful with his hands held on tight but didnt presume or not too much you dont presume she said after a while too much im a subtle guy ive got you figured out and not presuming is my way of worming myself into your confidence then just when youre looking the other way bang could have picked a better word she said hmm harpers father had worked at a bank for forty years he said just high enough up to get a golf club membership back when that was done his mother had been a housewife and a better golfer than her husband harper had taken the game up early gone to college on a golf scholarship and was last man at ucla didnt get along with the coach he said got along with his wife though ah the coach and his pals convinced me id never make the tour he said i was taking the law enforcement sequence because that was the easiest one to fit around the golf the next thing i knew im working for the la sheriffs department nine years never liked it much i finally went off to law school because the police work was driving me nuts what happened with you and your wife ah you know we just couldnt keep it together first i was on the street all the time then i got sent to vice and i was hanging out with dopers and hookers mess around a little never but you start to reflect the culture sometimes i think i scared her or disgusted her he said then i started going to law school full time and then i moved up to homicide christ i was so busy i never saw either her or the kids and he carefully opened up anna again as he had in the car he got her to talk about her mother her brother her father pretty normal family until mom died anna said after that i dont know it just seemed like everybody started to work themselves to death we still had some good times but overall there was a pretty grim feeling to it when i go back now i dont want to stay did your brother teach you to drive like tonight anna laughed my dad used to fix saabs as a sidelinewed have six or seven saabs sitting around the house at any one time i started driving them when i was a kidi mean like really a kid when i was seven or eight my dad and my brother used to run them in the enduro races at the county fair id pit crew sexism harper said severe sexism she agreed once my dad always took me up to madison for my music lesson but one time in the summer hed cut hay when it was supposed to be dry all week and the next thing you know this big line of thunderstorms popped up over in minnesota you could see them coming on the tv radar and he was running around baling and he just didnt have time to take me so when he was out in the fieldi was so madi jumped in this old saab and drove in myself i was ten i had to look through the steering wheel to see out the windshield my music teacher didnt see me coming and i got through the lesson but she saw me drive away and she freaked out and called the cops and called my dad she laughed at the memory he never missed another lesson though ten he asked yup i can drive a tractor too and a frontend loader if you could do plumbing and welding id probably marry you he said and they necked a little more until he shifted uncomfortably and said we either stop now or we keep going better stop anna said she hopped off his lap leaving him a little tousled and forlorn she laughed and said you look harassed a little he said and again some underlying source of amusement seemed to rise to the surface of his eyes she turned and headed for the stairs no rattling of doorknobs okay okay he said watching her go she was on the stairs when he called after her you werent thinking about this other guy were you this clark weaselguy no no i wasnt and hes not a weasel she said and in fact the name clark had never touched her consciousness but it did that night sitting on harpers lap had aroused herhadnt turned her into a blubbering idiot but shed liked it a lotand in her sleep she relived a night with clark pizza and wine and a little grass and clark talking touching her turning her on she rolled and twisted and woke a halfdozen times listening but nobody touched a doorknob chapter the next morning they bumped around the kitchen not talking much but jostling each other eating toast looking at the blue morning sky touching working up to something then wyatt called for harper harper took the phone from anna listened a while said quietly thanks man let me know what anna said the malibu cops went over to tony and ronnies place after the shooting and the woman up thereyou could hear her screaming at meanyway she ran out the back and threw a bag of dope over the hill he picked up his putter and twirled it like a baton over the hill down where you were yeah she was trying to get rid of itshe thought they were being busted but a cop coming up from the next yard saw her found the bag they took five pounds of methedrine off the hill got a warrant took a halfpound of cocaine out of a bedroom and found receipts for a couple of rental storage places almost big enough to make the papers anna said almost they took the rental places down this morning and found lots of interesting chemicals theres a factory somewheretheyre still going through the paper looking for an address and theyre all arrested all but tony turns out tony didnt live therehe lives up the hillso they had to let him go he looked bleakly pleased with that so whatre we going to get out of this will they ask about your kid thats part of the agenda harper said putting on his grim face as a favor they owe me now creek didnt seem to have changed much although his doctor said he was improving he was awake asking about you the doc said he was more worried about you than about himself so hes fine anna said no hes still got one foot in the woods he could still have a clot problem the way his lung was damaged but hes looking better and that friend of his is a real morale boost glass was sitting by creeks bed reading a mystery looking up every few minutes to see if he had wakened i should have been here anna said a little finger of envy touched her glass had been here she hadnt she had been the one perceived as faithful of course she hadnt been shed been running around malibu getting shot at and necking with a guy creek didnt like blood work looks fine the doctor was saying he could be out walking around in a week and youd never know hed been shot but creeks face still looked like it had been made of old parchment anna shivered and turned away they were just leaving the hospital when the cell phone rang and anna lifted it out of her jacket pocket and said yeah let me talk to harper a mans voice not one that she knew she looked at harper and said jake its for you harper took the phone and said yeah he listened for a moment then handed it back to anna i dont know how to hang it up whats happening i gotta drop you off she looked at him catching his eyes she was beginning to get into him like she could get into creek harpers eyes shifted but just a second too late something happened she said im coming anna shut up i bailed your butt out last night when you were falling off the cliff that counts for something somethingbut this is different im going she said harper drove downtown hard jumping lights busting traffic ignoring the fingers from angry drivers getting there gimme the phone he said as they pulled into a noparking zone outside the parker center she handed it to him and he poked in a number listened for a minute then said were here and then okay he handed the phone back to anna and said wait here if a cop tries to move you tell him your boyfriends a cop and hes inside talking to lieutenant austen she nodded and said okay and he hopped out of the car and hurried away five minutes later he was back he jumped in the car did a uturn and they were gone headed north wherere we going malibu he said what for see a guy jake goddammit look i dont know whats going to happen ronnies houseor tony and ronnies or whatever it waslooked abandoned behind its gate fluorescentyellow crimescene tape was wrapped around the stone posts with a notice forbidding entry to anyone who wasnt a cop harper pulled into the driveway climbed out stuck a key in a lock at the side of the gate as the gate silently rolled back harper got into the car and drove up the driveway to the garage where he parked he walked around behind the car pressed a button on his key and the trunk popped open he took out a small brownpaper grocery sack with a rolled top like a kids lunch bag lets go he said anna started toward the house but he said this waywere just parking here he was walking away from the house up the hillside wherere we going the next house up is tonys theres a pathway up here somewhere through the plantings your friends anna said do they know what youre doing they think they do harper said he turned and looked down at her listen i sorta wish you werent here but i can use the help my friendsll help me out from a distance because they know id never talk about it but they wont be here when the shit hits the fan and i might need somebody to be here she shrugged so im here if this is the jerk who shot creek whos been chasing me around probably not this guy harper said he started up the hill again then pointed theres the break in the brush thats the path this isnt our guy but he knows our guy i think he took a few more steps up the hill then stopped again whatever happens here you do two things you dont freak out and you stand there with your gun and you watch everything and dont say shit no matter what happens no matter what happens if we bump into somebody youre this tough methedrine chick and you keep your mouth shut they climbed through a hedge and up the hill harper still carrying the sack then broke into a grassy slope below a pool patio the house a white concrete mediterraneanmodern loomed over the patio harper never hesitated but with anna hurrying behind climbed straight ahead crossed the patio took another key out of his pocket and pushed it into a backdoor lock alarms are off he said as he turned the key no dogs your friends tell you that yeah dont touch anything he stuck his head inside and hollered hello anybody home anybody no answer he took a few more steps into a redtiled wet room hello anybody home the house answered with the silence of emptiness were okay he said he unrolled the sack took out a pair of yellow plastic household gloves and handed them to her put these on she took the gloves and he took out a pair for himself stuck the bag under an arm and pulled the gloves on wiggling his fingers good he muttered he opened the sack again took out a brown fabric wad shook it into the recognizable form of two dark nylons and said for your head he pulled his on like a stocking cap so that hed pull it down over his face with one move then he opened the sack a last time and took out a gun a black revolver jake yeah now we both get one he said and she felt the weight of the pistol in her pocket these are bad people cmon whatre we doing look around the house probably wont be much but you cant tell the house might have been elegant in a certain californianouveau way but it wasnt the furniture looked like it had been rented complete with the phony modern graphics on the walls the pale green carpets were stained and the exposed hardwood near one row of windows was raw and warped as though the windows had been left open for several weeks and rain had come in and the curtains stank with tobaccocigars anna thought the basement was empty except for a pile of cardboard appliance boxes at the bottom of the stairsboxes for tvs stereos computers xerox machines satellite dishes vcrs an electric piano haul the packing boxes to the top of the stairs and fire it down harper said as he peered at the mess the master bedroom contained a circular bed with a circular headboard and custom rayon sheets it faced a projection tv beside the tv was a rack of porno tapes along with a few westerns and music videos the chest of drawers held perhaps two hundred sets of jockey underwear and almost nothing else a dozen suits hung in a closet along with a pile of blue boxes full of drycleaned shirts and more underwear the other four bedrooms had been slept inthe beds were unmadebut neither the bedrooms nor the adjoining baths showed much in the way of personal effectsnothing feminineand only the most basic shaving and washing supplies they found nothing of special interestno paper the house was eerily devoid of records of any kind he doesnt do business here harper said i dont think he really lives here anna agreed he must have a place somewhere elsethis is like a motel room you notice in the bathroom his shaving stuff is still in a dopp kit yeah harper glanced at his watch lets go were done not exactly he led the way downstairs looked around once more then pulled her into a booklined office all the books were in sets none of them as far as anna could tell had been opened harper started pulling them off the shelves letting them drop to the floor he did it almost idly jake anna asked whatre we doing waiting he said tony ought to be here any minute what she turned and looked out of the library the front door was out of sight but it was right around the corner well hear the car he said hell either put it in the garage and come in through the kitchen or hell leave it in the drive and come through the front door anna was confused what were gonna jump him more or less harper said he pushed a few more books on the floor one of them was a fake the cover fell open to reveal a hollowedout interior packed with money harper turned and gazed at her for a moment weighing her and then said thats why were here she thought she could talk him out of it jake we cant do thistoo much could go wrong somebody could get hurt bad but he wouldnt move ive done stuff like this two hundred times tony oughta be paranoid enough that and then they felt rather than heard arrival sounds from outside harper said quiet now just stick with this he dropped to his hands and knees and crabwalked into the front room from her angle in the office she could see him easing up to a crack in the drapes five seconds later he was back shit hes with somebody another guy stay with me anna aw she was trapped a bad idea that shed ridden too far and now it was too late to get out so she crouched tense and harper pulled the nylon over his face and waved a hand at her and she pulled hers down then harper took the gun out of his pocket and they waited tony came through the door and he was shouting when he came through you dont tell me that shit you dont tell me you just fuckin well better he was a short paunchy man in his late thirties wearing a gray dress suit a striped tie over a blue silk shirt the man with him was tall thin with a mustache a deep tan and a black leather briefcase in good shape like a serious tennis player when harper with the mask and gun stepped out of the office his doubletake spun tony around in midsentence if either one of you fuckin move im gonna blow your fuckin heart right through your fuckin spine harper growled his gun held in both hands was pointed at tonys chest lay down on the floor on your backs heads toward each other top of your head toward the top of his head arms stretched out so they overlap what the fuck lay on the fuckin floor harper screamed and the pistol began to shake and jerk and anna could see him chewing on the nylon mask if he was acting he was terrific if he wasnt he was crazy lay down you mother fuckers or ill saliva and anger seemed to choke him and he gnashed at the nylon and suddenly his teeth broke through and he ran three steps toward tony the gun poking out at tonys forehead and tony screamed back no no no and the two men got shakily down on the floor lying on their backs arms stretched over their heads harper gun fixed on tonys head fished a pair of open handcuffs out of his pocket and dropped them on tonys face put them on i want to hear them snap shut tony put them on the tall man was next thread em through tonys then snap em im just a lawyer yeah yeah yeah you fuckin scum you fuckin lawyers you fuckin lay there the language had been stolen from tarpatkin but had a drugfired sound to it a crazy emotional edge harper stepped to the door and pushed it shutslammed it then he bent over the men patted them down found a cell phone in tonys coat pocket tossed it aside to tony you got a dealer working the westwood area he was selling wizards down to the shamrock hotel last week he was a street thug anna thought he was doing it perfectly maybe too perfectly he moved to one side put his foot on the lawyers chest im gonna give you the convincer im gonna shoot your lawyer here free of charge just to show you that im serious shoot him right in the fuckin brain so youre attached to a dead man you can explain to the cops later you fuckin creep he was shouting again and the lawyer was screaming no no no trying to sit up but pinned by his hands over his head and the weight of tony on the cuffs then harper looking down at the lawyer stepped back far enough that tony couldnt see him looked at the frantic lawyer put one finger over his lips pointed the gun at the floor beside the lawyers head and fired once the lawyer jerked forward convulsing with the muzzle blast then fell back understood instantly he went limp and silent now you believe me harper screamed youll fuckin kill me anyway tony screamed back so fuck you not before i peel your fuckin skin off with a potato peeler i seen in your kitchen harper said tony twisted and harper kicked him in the chest and tony shouted stan goddamn are you dead stan goddammit and harper kicked him again and anna out of sight tried to wave him off but he ignored her he had the gun pointing at tonys head and he was shouting again all right mother fucker i dont have the patience to skin you alive so im gonna kill you now good fuckin bye tony was thrashing against stans dead weight and harper pointed the gun and tony screamed john maran at the marshall hotel on pico for christs sake harpers voice went suddenly soft and somehow more threatening you better be telling me the truth he said if youre not i wont be coming back what tony was confused get on your feet lawyer harper kicked the lawyer once and the tall man rolled over started to blubber tony shouted you asshole whynt you say something the lawyer stooping over him pulled down by the short play of the cuffs shouted back you crazy fuck they were gonna kill us i saved our lives you bullshit tony tried to get up but harper pushed him down stay down and to the lawyer drag him over to the basement stairs as the lawyer dragged tony toward the stairs anna noticed the cell phone picked it up put in her pocket in the basement harper put them on either side of a steel support pole and threaded the cuffs through like i said if theres no john maran at the marshall hotel on pico i aint coming back the lawyer had followed this thought but tony hadnt so fuck you tony said tony the lawyer said fuck you too you fuckin snotty yale asshole the lawyer took a deep breath and said look im trying not to wring your fat little neck tony tony was amazed whatd you say i said im trying not to wring your fat little neck you dumb shit what hes saying is if he leaves us here whatre we gonna do chew our arms off like rats we wont break these handcuff chains or this pipe tony finally caught it looked once around the blank walls of the basement and turned to harper hey man is maran right after a moment of judgment no ask for rik maran you ask for john maran and you wont get him better be right harper said they went up the stairs anna first and at the top they peeled off the stockings when harper started past her to the door she set her feet and hit him in the solar plexus as hard as she could harpers abdomen wasnt his toughest part he half caved in and took an involuntary step back eyes wide and wheezed jesus anna you sonofabitch you scared my brains out anna whispered harshly not even knowing why she was whispering i didnt know what you were gonna do you should have told me ahead of time i was afraid you wouldnt go along oh bullshitwhat havent i gone along with well anyway we got the name he said trying to straighten up he got going again and led the way out the back across the patio and down the hill and when they got to the car he avoided her eyes but said again we got the name yeah weve had four names weve been on a name safari all week and we havent gotten anything but a chain letter she snarled at him over the top of the car we havent found out anything he got in the car and she climbed in still furious and pulled the safety belt down and snapped herself in and sat with the palms of her hands flat on her thighs you gotta pretty mean punch dont patronize me she spat back dont try to humor me just shut up they eased out of the driveway down the hill the ocean looked as green and lazy as ever as though it didnt know she thought that creek was coughing up lung tissue halfway into town harper broke the unpleasant silence to say weve got to find a phone book somewhere and figure out where this hotel is anna took out her cell phone punched the speed dial for louis louis was apparently sitting next to the phone he snapped it up halfway through the first ring hed been to see creek he didnt want to think about it i know anna said is the laptop handy yeah punch up the marshall hotel on pico and route us there from the pch up in malibu and give me the number just a sec he took more than a second but less than a minute and anna repeated his directions to harper then she dug in her pocket pulled out tonys cell phone when you talk to this rik maran tell him that a guy is bringing a box for him that youre at the courthouse waiting for tony to get out is the only reason youre answering the phone use the voice you used with tony and the lawyer what she repeated it as she punched the number for the marshall hotel into her own phone when the clerk at the hotel answered she said you have a mr rik maran as a guest id like to speak to him just a moment maran came on ten seconds later his voice dry reedy like he might have spent a childhood in oklahoma a long time ago this is rik call tony now on his cellular anna said and punched off a minute later tonys phone rang and harper picked it up he aint here whos this okay were at the courthouse we got a big problem but i aint got time to talk about it theres a guy coming over hes got a box for ya i cant talk this fuckin things a radio man harper punched out without waiting for a reply anna said i dont know what im doing if i had any brains id bail out of this now this whole thing is not right were running in the wrong direction we dont have any other direction harper said this is what weve got a few seconds later he added youre pretty smart this phone thing thinking of it like that the marshall hotel was one of the older buildings on pico a fourstory hollow cube with a brick front and stucco sides outdoor walkways on the inside of the cube and windows that looked like holes in an ibm punch card the bottom floor had a small diner a checkin desk and an open courtyard with an aboveground pool and a patio with a scattering of tables on the patio anna went in first wearing her sunglasses and a scarf as a babushka walked through to the courtyard and took an empty table where she could see the desk a waiter came over and she said a menu and a white wine anything good harper followed a minute later carrying a briefcase he stopped at the desk exchanged a few words with the deskman shook his head and walked out to the patio and took a chair near the pool on the other side of a clump of palm maran came out a few seconds later looked around spotted harper and his briefcase and went that way anna watched him and dug into her memory maran was sandyhaired or blond but the hair was cut so tightly to his head that she couldnt tell his face was skeletal his body wraithlike his gestures tired almost languid he looked like one of the late hard selfportraits of vincent van gogh and she thought aids maybe but he moved smoothly enough he wasnt shaky as shed expect if he were dying shed never seen him before she was quite certain of that she took out her cell phone and called tonys number heard it ring thirty feet away harper answered and she said i dont know himive never seen him okay stay where you are well be right back wherere you going she asked alarmed but hed rung off a moment later on the other side of the patio maran and harper headed toward the hotel she had only a moment to think about it but something in the way harper moved brought her out of her chair she took just a second to drop a twenty on the table to keep the waiter off her back and followed them they stepped inside an elevator and as the doors closed anna stopped watched the indicator light the light stopped on three she turned the corner started down toward a gift shop swerved into a stairwell and started running ten seconds later she stood at the door on the third floor pushed carefully through listened and heard a door shut down the hallway but where exactly the doors on the hall were identical the hallway carpet unexpectedly thick sounddeadening she walked slowly down the hall listening took a small notebook out of her purse and a pen if somebody came along shed stop and write in it as though she were making a note but there was nobody in the hall nothing but silence and the smell of old tobacco smoke and then an impact not a sound exactly more of a feel then a sound muffled anguished and another impact up ahead somewhere she hurried down the hall now but as quietly as she could listening where was it coming from she passed a door a possibility listened another impact a groan no somewhere ahead the next room another impact an animal sound a wounded animal across the hall now another she pressed her ear to the door and with the next impact she could feel it she tried the knob locked hit the door with her fist jake jake jaaake her voice rising shed scream it if she had to the knob turned under her hand and jake was there on the other side a dazed crazy look in his eyes he held what appeared to be a broken chair leg one hand was covered with blood and there were spatters of blood on his golf shirt ah she said involuntarily she put a hand on his chest and pushed and he stepped back and she went into the room maran was on the floor face up bleeding from the nose he was conscious but just barely there was no blood at all on his upper body but his legs looked wrong he looked like a paraplegic whose legs had withered anna shut the door and said whatd you do hit him harper said he seemed confused uncertain of where he was is he gonna die she looked toward the phone no i just he drifted away and she caught his arm and squeezed what jake broke his legs he said he looked at the chair leg in his hand a lot so lets get out of here anna said maran was trying to roll but there was no leverage in his hips and legs and he flailed weakly futilely he tried to turn himself with his arms and he moaned again call an ambulance harper said we can do that outside she said and she pushed harper toward the door harper dropped the chair leg anna said god wait a minute carried the leg to the bathroom and quickly carefully rubbed it down with a towel then dropped it in the bathtub and turned the hot water on it now she said harper followed her dumbly through the door down the stairs out past the gift shop she stopped him at a bank of phones dialled and said theres a man hurt really bad in room threethirtythree at the marshall hotel on pico hurt really bad better get an ambulance here fast on the street she could taste the bile at the back of her throat that the guy she asked she looked up at him his eyes clearing a bit and then at the blood splatters on his shirt he sold the stuff to jacob and his friends he didnt know jacob but he described the whole bunch of them jason he had no idea who jason was maybe he was lying anna said no christ he was bragging about it i asked him if hed seen the kid who tried to fly off the shamrock and he was laughing about it in the elevator you know what he told me he sold to the kids because thats my market thats what he said like he was some kind of toycompany executive ah god thats my market for christs sake that was in his roomthats when i hit him in the face he was still smiling when he went down jake i feel like i should have strangled the miserable little motherfucker harper said bitterly as they got to the car he looked back up the street i wish id killed him so whyd you want the ambulance he looked at her shook his head because im fucked up chapter back on the street moving quickly harper still shaky you drive he said tossing her the keys im not functioning too well all right she opened the car climbed in adjusted the seat as she pulled away from the curb she heard the siren there was usually a siren somewhere in the l a background but this one was closing in as they pulled away she saw the flashing lights a few blocks down pico headed toward the hotel ambulance anna said she looked at harper if that makes you any happier i dunno they spent the next five minutes in a ragged silence harper staring out the passenger window away from her she took the time to think working over the logic of a connection between harpers son a highschool kid from the southeast burbs and jason a street kid from hollywood and ucla where was the connection and it would have to be a massive coincidence the lightbulb went on ive given you a hard time about this connection between your son and jason she said harper turned toward her he was still off track almost uninterested i couldnt see how there could be a connection but i let you do all the thinking about it i had too much other stuff to worry about has to be a connection he said the paper was torn and it matchedi saw the two ends i put them together there isa connection she said its been staring us in the face what now he turned to her when your son jumped jason was right there almost underneath him i didnt see it because i was in the hotel but jason was close a few yards away he was hanging out before your son jumped he was planning to ride with us all night but right afterwards he couldnt wait to get away from us like something had happened in that few minutes like he got some drugs harper thought about it then closed his eyes and said goddammit and then weve got to look at the tape youve seen it i saw it a halfdozen times before ellen called and said it was jacob the tape was all over the tv i didnt know just some jerk flying off a building im sorry anna said aware of the hollowness of the sentiment this was what she did look im gonna call louis i never really looked at the raw tape i was busy selling while louis did the editing i looked at jasons at the time but didnt see anything unusual so where does louis live she slowed looked at him carefully you sure you want to look at this stuff i have to if theres something on the tape it means i mean thered be no realconnection so my problem wouldnt have any connection with yours or you he smiled just faintly then leaned a little closer and patted her on the leg just once wevegot a connection now whatevers on the tape youre not sliding away that easily louis apartment was a nerds nightmareor maybe a dreama jumble of dominos pizza boxes empty fritos bags a fat blue plastic garbage can marked aluminum only with a backboard behind it halffull of diet coke cans a projection tv sat in the middle of the front room showing a severed power cord sticking out from beneath it like a rats tail the longest wall was dominated by industrial gray steel racks full of stereo computer and telephone equipment all of which seemed hooked together louis met them at the door wearing a ketchupstained tshirt gym shorts and a stunned look hed been up all night he said working and had just gotten to sleep when anna called i got the tape set he said he kicked through some litter in the front room you guys want some fritos i got some somewhere i got coffee going coffee anna said wash the cups i already did he said unconvincingly he was back a minute later with the coffee saw the cut cord on the projection tv and said oh shit i forgot about that ill have to put it up on a monitor what happened to the cord harper asked i needed a plug last night louis said i mean it was convenient and its easy enough to put back on if youd rather see it on the big screen monitors fine probably better anna said to harper youre sure you want to watch im sure louis pulled the drapes to sharpen up the monitor and started the tape he caught the last few minutes of the animal rights hassle the guy knocked over by the pig then a few random spacing shots inside the truck then suddenly the bouncing run across the patio of the hotel anna caught a glimpse of herself running toward the entrance and then the lens steadied swung up and fixed on jacob they could see his face a confused smile the boys head bobbing as the camera tried to orient itself aw jesus harper said involuntarily turning away closing his eyes get out of here anna said naw he turned back transfixed as jason zoomed in on jacobs face the camera hung there staying with the face suddenly pulling back to get some perspective then closing in again getting tight catching expressions professional anna thought very very good at one moment jacob looked as though he might be dreaming at the next moment he seemed confused or happy he reached out once and anna thought here it comes but he leaned back seemed startled to find a wall behind him and anna blurted involuntarily no no harper stared the kid started talking maybe back to the window hed climbed out of the camera view pulled back yes he was talking to the window he looked down at the pool then back at the window a pale schoolboy face appeared at the window then a girls face then the boy again and the kid looked at the pool again he thinks he can make the pool harper said the camera closed in on his face and suddenly jacob shook his head said something and the first faint wrinkle of fear crossed his face he turned to the window and one hand went out touching the wall behind him he took a step back to the window but his right leg had to pass his left and there was nothing out there and suddenly he was leaning over empty space he was falling and at the last possible instant he tried to jump to propel himself out toward the pool jason stayed tight the face and the trailing body so close the feet almost behind the head as jason stayed with it stop anna shouted louis cut the tape looked at her back it up rerun in slow motion look at his right hand in slow motion jacob almost seemed to be swimming in the air and at one point a white almost formless shadow seemed to pass out of his right hand it stayed in view of the camera only for an instant but it was coming at jason possibly passing over his head thats the paper anna said you can hardly see anything harper said shakily theres something there anna said positively to louis lets see creeks stuff creek had been further away going for a longer perspectivebut the paper coming out was clearer the paper itself was no longer than a dollar bill and only half as wide and it fluttered twisted and landed behind jasons leg jason stayed with the body for five seconds zooming close and creek was still on the scene when jason turned almost stumbled looked down looked up and around then stopped to pick something up thats it harper said he stood and turned away from the television and said theres no connection none weve been chasing a wild goose goddammit im dumb goddammit god louis said we shouldve looked no connection i didnt see how there could be no connection i thought jacob had to be part of something bigger that it couldnt be that simple that he just took some bad shit and flew off a ledge the words were coming in a bitter torrent he was myson if he was dead it had to be important instead its just this fucking everyday ratshit life no reason no plot nothing important hes just fucking dead ah god jake what can i do i thought i wanted to kill the guys involved and it turns out nobody really even knew what they were doing so i break a guys legs fuck it he said lets go see creek creek was dopey but awake he smiled a lopsided smile and mumbled something hes much better glass said almost domestic anna thought he still looked cavedin they sat for a while anna and pam talking at creek like he was a child harper sat with his elbows on his knees staring at the floor anna wasnt sure how much creek understood of what they were saying and she was as worried about harper as she was about creek when creek drifted off to sleep they left in the hall harper said im sorta impressed by pam shes really taking care of him how long had she known him couple of days creek makes an impression anna said grudgingly she didnt want to but she was starting to like glass brittle as she was harper said what next anna shrugged well i dont know he picked up her tone and said listen im sticking with you no way youre gonna get rid of me you really dont have any obligation yes i do no you dont look if you dont know what im talking about then youve really got your head up your ass he snarled at her she thought about that a minute and then said we go to bjs and start tracking the sex story but thats later onit doesnt get started until late until then i dont know im numb so am i the tape god jake im so sorry yeah i wonder if you dont mind could you drive me somewhere anywhere she said i want to hit some golf balls what he didnt look at her just bobbed his head yeah thats what i want to do chapter anna drove to a range east of pasadena a dusty place on the side of a mountain where harper said you can hit from real grass thats important essential he said the parking lot was up the hillside from the range itself and they walked down a flight of stairs to the small clubhouse the owner was a highschool friend of harpers happy to see him this is larry harper said to anna larry this is anna pleased to make your acquaintance larry said his eyes shifting from anna to jake with some private amusement he wouldnt take money for the range balls offered as many as harper wanted to hit do you want to hit a few harper asked anna no ill get a coffee and sit and watch there were a dozen golfers at the range banging luminescent yellow balls down three hundred yards of sorry grass and desert rut a fiftyfootwide strip of longer slightly healthier turf made up the teeing area larry got a plastic chair and a cup of coffee for anna and she settled in as harper began hitting the balls he hit a six iron for fifteen minutes one ball after another like an automaton his swing seemingly slow almost lazy easy as it seemed the balls rocketed away in long soft leftcurving parabolas as she watched him she realized he was emptying his head or trying to when he failed the golf balls though their flight still looked perfect to her unknowing eye were followed with muttered imprecations anna got up once for a fresh coffee larry was leaning on the counter watching harper hit he called her maam and then said he looks sorta sad you two had some problems anna said his son died last week larry seemed to contract aw man hes pretty messed up i knew something was wrong he looked out toward harper and said hes got the prettiest swing i ever saw outside the pros but he looks tight today ten minutes after harper started hitting larry turned on the lights harper stayed with the six iron for a while then switched to a fairway wood when he finished with that he put it away grinned quickly at anna and said could you run an errand for me sure in the trunk of my carpush this trunk button on the keytheres a shoe box with a pair of brown golf shoes be right back anna said she headed out to the parking lot climbing the stairs whistling tunelessly as she went harper was hitting balls again a louder crack now and she turned to look back saw the balls bounding into the net at the end of the range he was hitting them hard now working at it she walked up to the car punched the trunk key as she walked up and saw the lid pop open and the light come on there was no presentiment no intuition no sixth sense she never saw the man or even suspected his presence she was looking in the trunk of the car when he said anna and the hair rose on the back of her neck he was ten feet away moving toward her quickly soundlessly dressed all in black she couldnt see his face and again for an instant thought he was black until she realized nylon mask but even then the softness and reasonableness of the voice lulled her ever so slightly she knew but she didnt believe get away she said stepping sideways anna we need get the fuck away she said the fear rising in her voice she lifted one hand fingers spread in front of her face to fend him off with the other hand she felt behind her along the side of the car as she moved backward anna its all right she turned to run got two steps but he grabbed her arm and she twisted violently and tried to scream but he pulled her close pulled hard and the breath seemed to leave her the scream died in her throat anna we need some time his voice was harsher than it had been before a huskiness that seemed plainly sexual ive got my car she could hear the words but couldnt process them she slashed at him with the fingernails of her right hand caught him across his face tried to kick at him and he hit her hit her with an open hand on the side of the head the blow knocked her off her feet in the narrow space between the two cars again she tried to scream but nothing happened the man was standing over her anna he said anna anna come on anna she scrambled to get away but he was pushing her down into the gravel she kicked straight out caught an ankle and he fell on top of her swearing catching his weight on one hand she tried to get up get free but he was clinging to her shirt she was overwhelmed by her impressions of the man he was strong but his stomach was soft hed eaten onions and not too long before hed perfumed himself with something he was sweating and he had an erection as she tried to crawl forward between the cars he was pressing his hips into her butt and she felt him distinctly she twisted and hit him in the face with one fist she could see the wet spot on the nylon stocking where his mouth was and just the barest flash of eyes but nothing else he was like a dark psychotic snowman she was still struggling for air as she got her hands on the front tires of the two cars and pushed back and up got her feet beneath her he chanted anna anna trying to pin her over the car he could have beaten her unconsciousshe was afraid hed do thatbut for some reason hed only hit her once he seemed to be making an effort not to hurt her badly and that allowed her to resist though never quite escape as they continued the violent scram in the space between the carsit seemed to have gone on forever but actually couldnt have been more than a few secondsand her breath began to come and she tried again to scream but the sound came out as a groan or a cry not loud enough to be heard below oh no anna you dont do that oh no he was right on top of her his face riding up over her right shoulder she turned quickly almost as though to kiss him but instead she bit and caught a fiftycentsized circle of flesh below his cheekbones and bit down hard he shrieked and pulled back but she was hooked in like a leech and her head came up with his and she bit harder felt her teeth cutting through tissue and suddenly she was gone she felt odd floating and realized that she was lying on the ground she could smell the gravel and the dry earth beneath it feel the gravel chips pressing into her cheeks but she didnt know how shed gotten there his voice seemed far away and she pumped her legs once trying to get under a car but he was riding her again one hand pulling at the zipper on her pants and she could again feel his erection grinding into her you goddamn bitch he hit her on the head you bitch you bit me dont she groaned dont do that he was thrusting at her now a hard heavy pumping and she could feel his breath coming harshly into her neck as he continued to grope for the zipper she bore down on his hand trying to grind it into the gravel and he tried to turn her as he did she snapped at him with her teeth again he pulled back and when he lifted away his face lifted his chest high enough to get a full breath she finally screamed high piercing loud her attacker froze then clouted her again and again then half stood dizzy hurt she tried to crawl thought she heard somebody shout from below hey and they were coming running she crawled away from him trying to stand and screamed again and he said see you later he kicked her in the back and she pitched forward onto her face catching herself with her hands gravel biting into her when he did that kicked her he turned but she rolled and the anger had her by the throat now and she went after him as he ran across the parking lot toward the hillside he saw her coming and said get away and slowed to hit her she dove under his arm and grabbed his leg in a football tackle but he didnt go down like football players on tv instead he took the impact then hit her again kicked her free and ran there were more people coming now men running up the hill her attacker was headed toward the hillside brush and she was on her hands and knees and then on her feet running blind with the anger no fear at all she caught him again as he tried to climb and he said jesus christ and hit her again clumsily she was faster than he was but couldnt fight the longer reach and heavier weight but if she could just hold on until harper got there she tried for his eyes and he hit her one last time this time catching the side of her nose and she fell back down the hill too stunned to get up but she tried hearing him above her tried to get her feet going she was still trying when harper arrived three or four men with him two of them carrying golf irons oh my god anna she felt no fear at all barely heard him but there was fear in his voice he picked her up and said oh my god shes bleeding bad larry we gotta get her to a hospital but she was waving him off she wasnt hurt though she had an odd stinging or burning sensation just above her hairline and her face was numb and part of her back no no no let me go she tried to tell them they had to get him get up the hill were going to the hospital whered he go it was the guy did you get his number he confused her for a minute then she understood they thought thered been a car she shook her head and pointed at the hill he ran that way larry call the cops we got him on foot larry started back toward the stairway but said not for long basket drives over there and theres an overlook bet thats where hes parked harper shouted at him larry call the fuckin cops tell them and as he put her in the passenger seat and pulled the buckle over her he asked wheres the hospital somebody one of the other golfers an older man with a short steel colored crewcut and aviator glasses said ill ride along i can point you get in im all right anna protested feebly bullshit harper had piled in the drivers side the steelhaired man in the back and she realized that harper was frantic hang on the hospital was two minutes away harper insisted on carrying her inside and as they came through the emergency room doors a nurse behind the counter took one look and ran around and grabbed a gurney and pushed it toward them harper put her on it the sheets stiff and starched beneath her and the woman started asking questions and then she drifted away she could hear them talking a noisy hash of words then another woman was there in a suit looking down at her face she closed her eyescouldnt seem to help herselfand then she was rolling along a corridor around a turn to the left more voices all women now and something cool touched her face wet anna womans voice she opened her eyes she was looking at a light on the ceiling she tried to pull herself back together yeah im here she said how do you feel not so bad she actually grinned i think i could walk out of here but im tired ill bet anna turned her head and saw the woman she had an absorbent gauze pad in her hand and it was soaked with blood is that from me the woman looked down at the pad and said yesyouve got a scalp cut not bad but they bleed like crazy youll need some stitches and youve got some smaller cuts on one of your arms the doctor shined a light in her eyes gently moved her head her neck compressed her ribs had her remove her blouse and jeans found small cuts scuffs and bruises on her arms her side one leg i think youre okay the doctor said conversationally i better put a few stitches on that scalp cut though go ahead the doctor used a topical anesthetic but the stitches still hurt nice that youve got dark hairtheyll be completely invisible the doctor said your face was covered with blood when you came in like a mask your friend thought you were dying he was pretty freaked out anna said despite the stitching she yawned apologized and said i dont know whats wrong with me your system is closing down youll need some sleep with the adrenaline and the wrestling around the blows you had about two weeks wear and tear in two minutes youll sleep for a while then she asked the gentleman who brought you in he wasnt involved in any way was he anna was startled no no he was actually hitting golf balls and i went out to the parking lot to get something some shoes actually and this other guy was waiting youre sure you can tell me i know what youre getting at anna said this guy hes okay all right the doctor dropped her hands to her lap all doneexcept the part where you pay they were at the hospital for two hours when it appeared that anna would be all right harper sent the elderly golfer back to the range in a cab then sat next to the bed where they put her two uniformed cops came by spoke to her for a few moments then an la county detective showed up the detective took her through the attack then said uh could you uh stand up she stood up and he turned her by the shoulder and said yeah what she tried to look over her shoulder were going to have to take your jeans he said he seemed embarrassed the guy uh ejaculated on you ah god anna said the doctor said ill get you some scrubs im sorry the detective said but we can get a dna tracewe might even get lucky and get a cold id fat chance harper said the detective shrugged its been done the doctor got her some green scrub pants and anna gave her jeans to the detective who put them in a plastic bag pasadenas got some guys going over the parking lot he said if we could get you back there for just a few minutes wed appreciate it can i go anna asked the doctor yesbut youll be sore tomorrow the doctor warned take some ibuprofen tonight and as soon as you get up in the morning the owner of the driving range met them in the lot where hed been talking to a halfdozen cops things were happening now anna thought the story was getting larger but the range owner was thinking lawsuit he was a worried man anna showed him a small smile dont worry about it she said we brought the trouble to you im sorry im sorry he said yeah yeah anna walked the cops through the lot showed them where the straggle took place where the guy ran the scrub pants flapped around her ankles as she walked the cops traced the flight path in the dark up the hill through brash and shrubs found a few scuff marks near the scenic overlook well check the houses around see if anybody saw a car one of the cops said i wouldnt be too hopeful youre lucky said another one if hed just wanted to take you home he couldve hit you with a sap dumped you in the trunk of his car and nobody wouldve known what happened but he tried to talk to you its love said the first cop saved by love anna slept on the way home drifting in and out when they pulled up outside her house harper got out his gun at his side he looked around the yard then came back and opened the car door led her to the house waited while she unlocked the door then led the way inside he checked the ground floor the doors the windows then the second floor should be okay he said but the guys tracking us he picked us up somewhere along the way and followed us right out to the range if we stay here well be sitting ducks unless it was just the pasadena neighborhood pervert you dont believe that he said no he knew my name she left harper downstairs moving furniture the better to repel boarders and went upstairs and looked at herself in the big bathroom mirror scuffed up she thought beat up she shivered thinking about it and about the mans sweat on her about the semen on her pants she pulled off her blouse and bra slipped out of the scrub pants wadded them threw them toward the waste basket and then growled after them she surprised herself with the growl a harsh guttural snarl the guy had been controlling her life for a week had gone after people shed known people she loved had come after her she looked at herself again in the mirror a slender darkhaired beatup elf in a pair of blue jockeys for her the guy was just trying to corner her control her possess her she stretched stuck out an arm twisted hurt a little bit but not that much looked at herself in the mirror again and suddenly the anger came back and she tottered with it put her hands on the counter and closed her eyes trying to keep her balance she snarled again she wanted to kill something let the feeling ebb brushed her teeth stood in the shower for ten minutes steaming out then pulled on a robe and went back down the stairs harper was sprawled on the couch looking at the tv which he hadnt bothered to turn on he was barefoot tired hey jake she said yeah we were gonna go to bjs tonight were never gonna get there he said shaking his head were cursed tomorrow she said he nodded howre you feeling i gotta get some sleep im wrecked so go to bed i got it covered down here i wanted to tell you when you told me this afternoon that if i didnt know why you were hanging around i must have my head up my ass yeah maybe i do sometimes she said im nervous about relationship stuff but before the driving range thing i was sort of planning to take you upstairs tonight he thought about that for a second and a pleasedlook crossed his face that would have been nice im still gonna do it if youre around she said but todaytoday was a little too much i know i willbe around back upstairs she crawled under the quilt her mother made and before she drifted away thought about jake she liked him a lot she even liked watching him hit golf balls on the darker side she thought about the scene in louis living room when they looked at the tape what did she do for a living what was she becoming and why wasnt she more frightened she wasfrightenedbut above that she was angry and in some dark way interested my god she thought this is a good story gotta get right on it she was supposed to be a musician a classical pianistbut whatever anyone might think about the night crew it was apparent from the jacob tapes that they were very very good at what they did watched a man dying never lost the frame and she ran the crew she was better on the street she thought than she was at the piano then she was gone asleep a killer back in the dark drapes of her dreams and with it a hard little diamond of anger she was gonna get him chapter the twofaced man was covered with bloodhis own bloodrunning down his face and arms he licked at it and the blood was both sweet and salty on his tongue but his face was on fire the wounds hurt but didnt really matter what mattered was the failure the explosion of his dreams anna didnt want him and hed run like a chicken hed felt real fear anna had come after him like a madwoman and he thought for a moment that shed pull him down if the others had gotten there they would have lynched him the humiliation hurt worse than the bitealthough the bite hurt badly enough he gagged in pain pressed the palm of his hand to his cheek still he would heal but the memory of thrashing up the hill being chased by this small woman that memory wouldnt go away hed remember that forever hed gone to her expecting recognition hed eliminated the others hadnt that proven something didnt that give him some rights hed expected resistance but then he thought shed see the fire feel the steel and shed come with him shed slept with other men he didnt like it but he accepted it he also knew that the others didnt love her they simply used her jason obrien sean macallister her driver creek users takers hed goneto her virtually begged her he flashed back to the sex hed bent her over the car had been plucking at her pants and suddenly from the friction of the contact the excitement hed ejaculated he remembered that without pleasure because he also remembered running frantically across the parking lot his penis protruding from his pants wobbling around like a crazedcomic compass pointer leading him into the brush hed managed to tuck himself back inside before he hit the thorn trees or hed really have been hurt had she seen that were she and her bodyguard off somewhere laughing about it he closed his eyes of course they were he could feel it and quick as that love turned to hate as it had with his teacher mrs garner as it had with a kitten that scratched he d have to get her now he d have to erase her the inner and outer faces agreed she didnt want him okay first hed show her what fear was hed frighten her worse than she had frightened him he licked at the blood on his arm then hed cut her to pieces anna batory was a dead woman walking chapter one of the dreams something unpleasant woke her the diamond of anger was there like a pebble in her shoe unlike a pebble she cherished it nurtured it willed it to grow the clock glowed at her in the neardark six in the morning she rolled over tried to sleep failed giving up she swiveled to drop her feet on the floorand needles of pain shot through her shoulders and ribs she said ooo silently rolled her arms then cautiously stood up her legs hurt especially along the inside of her thighs and she could feel the strain in her butt where the big muscles connected to her pelvis in her shoulders and in her ribs her head itched not thinking she reached up to scratch and felt the stitches jeez the guy had done a number on her she went to the bathroom read the label on an ibuprofen that warned against taking more than two took four steamed herself out in the shower again and as an afterthoughta harper thoughtshaved her legs the hot water felt good and as it poured down on her neck and back she thought about what had happened so far jacob was connected to jason only through coincidence jasons dealer hadnt sold to jacob harper and was apparently hostile to the people who had so what did that leave the whitehaired man the whitehaired man whod run from them at the hospital was out of keeping with last nights attack and the attack on creekso much so that she nearly dismissed him as part of the problem she didnt know what was going on there but the whitehaired man simply did not fit last nights attacker had been young and strong younger than she was she thought he liked cologne and though he was stronger than she was he wasnt nearly as strong jake what else hed been coming to court her could that be right hed tried to talk to her she finished showering tiptoed around the bedroom getting dressed found her running shoes and a pair of socks and carried them downstairs she wouldnt be running but the shoes were quiet she went to the front door and saw that harper had piled coke cans next to it she unstacked them quietly unlocked the door looked out spotted the paper reached out and grabbed it relocked the door feeling virtuous she ate cold cereal with milk read comics pulled on a pair of socks got a yellow legal pad and a no pencil from her office sat at the kitchen table and tried to untangle the maze whitehaired guy dead end courting her he mustve met her he expected her to know himbut maybe not by name or face maybe he expected only a kind of cosmic connection something he said hinted at that that they were fated together and that fit with the killings and the attack on creek if anna was at the center of a sex triangle a threeway or even fourway maybe hed conclude that he had to eliminate his competitors he mustve heard the storywhich meant that anyone who knew all of themjason sean creek and herselfwas a possibility and that was not many people on the other hand anyone who knew them at all knew that she wasnt sleeping with either jason or sean the idea was ludicrous they might suspect creek because they worked so closely together but creek was the last one attacked why because he was the most dangerous the hardest to get at huh they really needed to get to bjs she was still struggling with the list when harper bumbled out of the guest room unshaven wearing last nights pants and a tshirt how are you he asked creaky she said im gonna get cleaned up then we gotta run up to my place so i can get some clothes all right and i want to get up in the hills and try out the gun its been a while he looked at her for a moment then said best thing you could do is go back to your dads place for a visit this guy is freaking out hell be dead meat in two weeks whether youre here or not if i believed that i might go but im looking at the cops and im not seeing much so im gonna stay he sighed scratched his prickly face all right you can shoot out back of my place really didnt sound like the valley and it wasnt he lived on a dirt road off mulholland highway halfway down a hill a few miles west of topanga anna laughed when she saw the place a rambling collection of whitestucco blocks with deep green eaves and redtiled roof something that a skilled hippie might have put together in the sixties what he asked when she laughed his eyes crinkled amused at the sound of her its great she said how much land twenty acres she was amazed how can you afford it bought it fifteen years ago he said built a few pieces at a time you built it amazed again yup took some classes at the votech on blockwork made friends with a guy who had some heavy equipment helped him build his place he stopped in a gravel patch in front of the garage as they got out a car passed on the road at the bottom of the hill honked twice and harper waved widowlady neighbor he said hmm anna said attractive rich blonde and got the big you know ears exactly the word i was groping for yeah grope she said the house was cool inside and a little dim after the glare of the sun on the semidesert it was bachelorneat the neatness of a man whod lived alone for a long time and learned to take care of a house not precise not tidy but most things in their own places less a couple of socks next to the couch a couple of beer cans on a table next to a couch that faced an oversized television gotta get some clothes he fished a halfdozen golf shirts out of a drier plugged in an iron theres a gully out back if you want to take a look he said take some beer cans out watch out for snakes shed brought a box of cartridges with her and with the pistol in her jacket pocket and a halfdozen empty beer cans in a sack crunched through the short dry weeds behind the house fifty yards out to the mouth of the gully she found a spot where she could prop the cans against the dirt gullywall put them down and backed off about eight paces all right she said she had the gun out barrel down and she said one and the gun was up the heel of her right hand cupped in her left and she fired a single shot the gun bucked and the muzzle blast was like a slap on the side of the head her ears rang like a distant phone damn forgot her earmuffs but the slug had bitten into the dirt four inches from the target can not too bad she looked around finally walked back to the house and got some kleenex ripped off enough to make marblesized wads and pushed them into her ears as she walked back out the kleenex helped and now she started running through the routine shed been taught in her gun classes two shots onetwo then three onetwothree at twenty feet shed hit the target can with one shot out of every four or five that was fine the cans were just aiming points hearts while she missed with the other shots she was always closeinside a mans chest she moved closer and the number of hits went up eventually she was shooting from six feet hitting the cans almost every time she didnt see harper coming but she felt him turned took one of the kleenex wads out of her ears and said bout done youre not bad he said he was wearing a fresh blue golf shirt and faded jeans always had guns around she said out in the country want to try nope but let me see a quick twotap she nodded put the wad of paper back in her ear and did a quick two one of the cans spinning away up the gully but its much easier when youre shooting at a target nothings moving youre not frightened youve got no handicaps yeah yeah they told us all thatand they also said you gotta do what you can go ahead and do another doubletap he said moving up behind her he put his hand flat against her shoulder blade dont push i might shoot myself in the foot she said and ive only got one round left so shoot the one round and dont worryim a highly trained veteran of police combat he said i know what im doing all right she said doubtfully say when take it slow make an aimed shot whenever youre ready okay she squared herself to the target ready yeah she focused on the cans then lifted the gun as she did she tightened her legs expecting a push or a pull instead he slipped both hands around her catching her with a lifting motion just under her breasts and at the same time kissed her on the neck anna felt like she was coming out of her shoesliked itand at the same time focused on the target and squeezed off the shot jesus harper groaned reeling back hands over his ears i think you blew my eardrums out thats what you get she said primly she dumped the spent shells how much longer are you going to do this im done she said i could use a beer as they walked back to the house he said i dont want to seem impolite you know but hanging around you for the last couple of days yeah anna im getting fairly desperate his voice was convincing i think we can fix that she said and she looked around at the hillside the house the perfect blue sky and its such a nice day for it and they did fix it and more than once but the second time they made love as harper began to lose himself in her anna looked up at the ceiling and saw the holes the bullets had punched on the gullywall and instead of thinking of the man with her then she thought of the man last night and she thought again gonna get you chapter harper was driving down the narrow canyon road through the night occasional snapshots of the la lights ahead of them he was not happy with the trip he wanted to spend the evening at his house but anna was going hunting with or without him bjs that was the only time jason and macallister were hooked into me so the guy mustve been at the party no harper said shaking his head you dont know how many times they told that story whats the point of telling it if nobody sees the woman its no big deal being in a threeway anymore you can get one for fifty bucks down on the strip really he pretended to perk up she ignored it so i figure what happened is i show up at the party ask around for him hes a little unhappy when i blow him offhe was really a mess but he thought he could still do it he needed the moneyand so he starts spreading the story with his pal whoever it is saw me and heard the story had to be doesnt have to be she sighed okay not technically but thats all ive got and im going with it the party box was running hard anna led the way up the narrow smokefilled stairway the buzzcut hulk at the door looking past her at harper when harper looked up at him he stepped out of sight into the party room and a moment later stepped back out anna realized that a warning was now rippling through the roomharper had been taken for a cop the hulk was a redneck a southern kid with a layer of hard fat in his face and under his eat more spamtshirt he nodded vaguely at anna and said to harper with a thin sarcastic edge were checking ids officer harper smiled a cop smile at him and said im proud of you have you got a warrant harper opened his mouth but anna cut in hes not a cop not anymore the hulk was doubtful so whats he want he dont fit here hes taking care of me anna said do you know jason obrien and sean macallister a spark of interest lit in the hulks eyes i heard theyre dead thats right now the guy who killed them is coming after me were trying to find out who it is the hulks forehead wrinkled as he thought about it and then he said you know whod know trip whatshisface he hung with the guy hang on one second he stepped out of sight again and a moment later was back come on he said harper looked at anna and showed a quarterinch of a smile hed caught the warning move and now the cancellation the party room was actually four rooms a bar area a large tiled dance room and two smaller rooms at the sides with rickety plastic lawn tables and chairs all four rooms stank of tobacco smoke and an edge of something sharper crack anna thought no grass this club was a little harder than a pothead might want the population dressed in black both male and female harper with his blue shirt and sport coat looked like hed just arrived from iowa the hulk led them to the second room spotted a thin man in a black mock turtle with oval goldrimmed glasses and held up a finger the man tipped his head and the hulk led them over this is a tv lady used to work with jason obrien anna the man said he smiled quickly a click onandoff showing a couple of pointy canine teeth he looked at harper whos your attractive friend jake harper harper said and stuck out his hand the man took it warily but jake shook cheerfully and said is it trip yes trip he had a drawl a very faint cultured hint of new orleans i heard about jason and sean not the details you dont seem surprised anna said do your friends get killed a lot from time to time trip said with faint amusement anna nodded okay i came up here one night about three weeks ago to pick jason up but he was too messed up to work she said but that night he started a rumor that he and macallister and i were in a threeway we think whoever killed them heard the rumor were wondering who was here that i might know or might know me trip pursed his lips then said well i suppose ninety percent of the people here are in film one way or another writers or actors or directors or trying to be and youre actually doing some media so i dont know maybe several people knew you or of you anna shook her head i didnt see anybody i knew let me think trip turned slightly away and closed his eyes and then waited and after a few seconds opened them and turned slightly back to her and said were you in a threeway no trip let his eyes drift to harper too bad theyre kinda fun i keep telling her harper said i even got the other woman shut up anna snapped to trip somebody who mustve been tight with macallister and jason both macallister did some work in porno acting work jason mightve taken the pictures i dont knowbut both were friends with the guy who produces them dick harnett bunny films theyre out in burbank thats it actually no you know who else used to hang with them china lake who china lake the actress she

drawled letting the new orleans out again look downstairs in the ladies restroom darkhaired girl shaved around the ears the womens restroom was a sewer four metal booths on an uneven concrete floor everything a little damp the stink of urine and vomit in the air china was alone staring at herself in a cracked mirror her eyes underlined with gray rings of exhaustion her shoulders not much more than bare bone anna thought she might be nineteen china she turned her head and looked first at anna then at harper with little interest that harper should be in a womans restroom didnt seem worthy of comment or even notice yeah my name is anna batory i used to work with jason obrien before he got killed i heard he was dead and sean she said she turned back to the mirror you got anything good on you without waiting for an answer to harper are you a cop no he shook his head were looking for whoever killed jason theyre coming after anna here really you got anything good on you anna shook her head were looking for a guy who might have hung out with jason and macallister pretty big guy about like jake she nodded at jake and a little out of shape not real fat just sort of fleshy could be pretty weird thats everybody i know china said except what most of them are skinny you sure you dont have anything good on you you look like you do like you got money they talked for another two minutes a woman came in glanced at harper said nothing just went on to a booth and closed the door harper looked at anna faintly embarrassed looked at china whod gone back to her mirror and shook his head nothing here all right anna said she held a card out to china and when the woman didnt take it slipped it into a pocket in chinas small leather purse if you hear anything or think of anybody call me there might be something good in it china brightened you got something good great lead harper said as they left the club now what bunny films anna its ten oclock at night so we bang on a doormaybe therell be somebody around what else are we gonna do i could come up with something behind them in the club a man leaned in the door of the womens restroom and said arent you china lake china turned and said hey you got anything good on you the man shrugged and unconsciously reached up to touch his cheekbone probably he said i got a little of everything you do china brightened the circles seeming to fade from beneath her eyes she looked almost young enough to be her age ive been waiting for you chapter on the way out sunset toward burbank anna spotted a redhaired woman in a leather biker jacket and skinny jeans leaning on a window hands in her jeans pocket smoking a cigarette stop pull over anna said by that woman harper pulled over whats going on how do you roll the window the window rolled down and anna yelled hey jenny its anna the woman had been watching the car as it slowed and now she smiled flipped her cigarette up the street and said anna whereve you been working come on get in anna turned around in the front seat popped the lock on the back door well get something to eat or something the woman nodded and said nice wheels as she slipped into the back seat and anna said jenny norden jake harper jakes a lawyer jennys with lutheran social services harpers eyebrows went up youre pulling my leg norden grinned at him and said nope im a bornagainer annas friends harper said as he pulled away from the curb i cant believe youre sleeping with a lawyer norden said tongueincheek who says i am anna asked i do norden said youve got that really clearskin look whats

said you know what the lawyer said when he stepped in a cow pie oh my god im melting harper said you know the difference between a rooster and a lawyer a rooster clucks defiance norden said and harper said all right shes a lawyer i told you that said anna then she laughed and her laugh made harper laugh and he asked what and anna said i just got the clucks joke if you loved me you wouldnt laugh

suggested that she says shes staying so im staying thats stupid norden said she leaned forward and pointed through the windshield see the place with the moon in the window lets go in there the gibbous moon was run by a pair of gentle aging hippies who knew norden the place smelled of steamed vegetables olive oil and coffee the counterman called norden by name they found a booth ordered coffee dick harnett was the producer of legitimate tv shows back in the sixties but he was a sex freak and he started making some porno when that was hip back around the deep throatdays norden said then feminism came in and porno wasnt hip anymore and nobody legit would touch him he was scratching around for a while but then video came along and you know he knew how to do that and he saw what was going to happen he was one of the first big time videoporn distributors so hes rich no no after a while it got so every college kid in la was making a porno film with his girlfriend amateur tapes the bottoms sort of fallen out of the market i get the impression that most of those guys are on hard times hes got this bunny films yeah pretending he has something to do with playboy hes had a dozen companies probably hes getting old nowhes still a freak though thats the word a sleazedog anna said norden blew gently on her coffee then nodded yeah and the thing is theres always been violence around his

social services as a lawyer i met some street kids girls and decided that i liked the mission work better than the law work i still do some law and youve still held onto the religious aspect even after seeing all the stuff on the street oh absolutely norden said nodding her face serious i accept jesus christ as my savior and i believe that he will return soon and judge us and lead those who deserve it to eternal life harper checked the mirror again and decided she wasnt joking then anna hung up the portable and said louis cant find a home address therere five richard harnetts with unlisted phones in the two counties and theyre scattered all over the place weve still got his office address harper said lets take a look and over his shoulder he said to norden can we drop you somewhere heck no i wouldnt miss this for anything on the way to burbank harper made a quick turn down an alley accelerated and anna said what as they whipped past the backs of a row of small stores just checking harper said watching his mirror we know he was tracking us they came out of the alley crossed a street and went right back into the continuation of the alley at the end harper took a left onto a deserted residential street then a quick right all right he said bunny films was on the second floor of a shabby fifties concreteandbrick lowrise office building with a narrow parking lot wrapped around the building there was one car in the lot but it carried an air of abandonment no lights showed in the building come back tomorrow harper said lets not rush off anna said pull around behind the building i want to check that door felonies are a bad thing harper said im sure counselor norden would agree i just want to look at the door anna said maybe somebodys around theyd let us in ah man harper said but when anna asked who climbed over that fence and got shot at who broke into that house who he said okay okay and pulled around back and into a parking space with a reserved for building tenant sign norden and anna got out and norden said got shot at while harper waited in the car engine running weve had a couple of problems anna said the door was locked they could see the steel tongue between the door and the frame not very far in there norden said stooping to peer at the lock its sort of tilted up i bet if you stuck a screwdriver or a tire iron in there you could pry the door right open back in a minute anna said at the car she said hey jake pop the trunk for a minute why i want to look at your golf shoes pop the trunk damn it anna but he popped the trunk and the tool kit was there in the trunk lid just as she remembered from the last time shed been in the trunk a few seconds before shed been attacked in the parking lot she turned the hand screw on the toolbox cover the cover dropped open she selected a screwdriver closed the trunk and walked back to the door what do you think she asked norden norden cast a quick look around a stream of cars was passing on the street a halfdozen teenagers were lounging around a picnic table at a fosters freeze a hundred feet down the street norden said dont make any big moves and do it quick anna struck the end of the screwdriver in the gap between the door and the frame put her weight against it and when the tongue pulled out of the lock norden jerked the door open talk about irresponsible norden said looking at the door im surprised the junkies havent carried off the furniture probably scared to harper said hed killed the engine and walked up behind them were right out in the open probably nine people calling the cops right now door was open norden said yeah right screwdriver marks all over it and weve still got the screwdriver harper pulled the door tight against the frame took the screwdriver from anna pried the frame and door apart again and popped the lock tongue back into place when i was in uniform wed rattle doors but wed never try to get inside if the doors were locked he said no bunny films was listed on the directory but they found a harnett enterprises on a row of painted steel mailboxes next to the front entrance the number indicated an office on the second floor they skipped the small elevator and climbed a dark smokescented stairway found a light switch for the second floor and followed a narrow hallway to the end the office had only a number but no other identification an empty nameplate holder was screwed to the wall next to the door well shit harper said maybe he moved maybe he just doesnt want people to know where he is anna said if this is his office theres gotta be something inside with his home address harper looked up and down the hall shook his head put his back against the wall opposite the door his foot next to the doorknob and pushed the lock ripped out of the door and they were in if the cops come were busted he said flipping on the lights lets make it quick and for christs sake dont touch anything with your fingertips if you can help it harnetts office was one large room with a desk in the center filing cabinets around the edge and a small sofa and easy chair combination on a faded persian carpet in front of the only window the window looked over the parking lot and from there over a fence into a residential back yard something in the back yard may have interested harnett because a pair of x binoculars sat on the windowsill a door led off to the right it was unlocked and when anna pulled it open she found a closet with a raincoat a box of shuts a suit in a plastic wrapper several rolls of christmas giftwrapping paper a shoeshine kit in a cardboard box and two empty suitcases the main surface of his lshaped desk was a heap of business paperenvelopes faxes trade magazines clippingsthat flowed across and in and out of two in and out boxes the short leg of the l held a gateway p tower computer and a vivitron monitor with cables to a hewlettpackard laser printer a short butcherblock table held a panasonic fax machine and a canon copier a largescreen tv sat in a wooden cabinet in the corner and the lights of two different videotape players glowed from beneath it the desk telephone had five buttons busy guy anna said a cup on his desk held a spray of yellow dixon pencils like a bouquet and anna took them out and handed them to harper and norden move stuff with these anna and harper used the pencils to probe the paper on the desk and go through the rolodex while norden explored the file cabinets at one point she said hmm looked around found a box with a halfdozen reams of laser paper still in it dumped the paper on the floor and carried the box to the file whatre you doing harper asked all kinds of correspondence norden said dumping paper into the box interesting stuff i might be able to use it anna said look at this shed gone back to the closet as harper continued working through the desk with the pencils and pulled out the two suitcases they were empty but they both had trip labels on them home addresses she said even phone numbers as anna copied the address norden opened a file cabinet full of videotapes and another one stacked with skin magazines and a few old reels of mm film look at all this shit norden said think of how many women are in this lets go anna said we got what we need been here too long harper said im taking the rolodex too norden said what a jerk she threw the rolodex into the box full of correspondence and followed harper to the door anna stopped then turned around cmon harper said one minute anna went back picked up a sheet of paper from the laser printer went to the cabinet full of videotapes and started dumping piles of them on the floor then she chose a tape with one of the more elaborate labels stuck it into the tape player used harnetts remote controls to turn on the tv and the player whatre you doing shhh the tape started with a womana porn consumers idea of a classy businesswoman in a suit with long shoulderlength hair and a skirt that ended a quarterinch below her hipsapproaching the stoop of a new york brownstone from the look of it the plot would be thin anna fastforwarded for ten seconds or so getting the woman on her knees giving head to a man with what appeared to be a hair transplant on his chest all right she said just checking she ran the tape back to the start let it run and said lets goand leave f the lights on and the door open and lets leave the door open downstairs what was that all about harper asked when they were back in the car well we wanted a look at harnett anna said now well get a look she punched a number into her cell phone and said i want to report a burglary in progress in burbank yes right now when she finished she hung up and said okay so now the copsll come theyll find the breakin and the tape going so theyll stay a while and now we call harnett harper said exactly better let me harper said if hes the guy hell know your voice harnett answered on the third ring sounding sleepy harper said mr harnett this is james t peterson with the cleaning company mr harnett theres been a big breakin at your office we called the police but i think you better get up here harnett arrived in a yearold buick the back end of the car making a tshirt frowny face at them as it bounced over the curb into the parking lot norden said here we go a cop was standing by a squad car talking on a radio when harnett got out of his car the cop held a hand up to slow him down anna harper and norden were sitting on a concrete picnic table at the fosters freeze down the street licking chocolatedipped soft vanilla cones harnett caught anna halfway through a lick and she almost choked i know him ive seen him she said excited harnetts white hair stood up in a mane as though hed been running his hands through it he was a heavyset man with a rounded chin that once might have been square wearing rumpled khaki chinos and a nylon windbreaker that club on sunset the topless polynesian one where they had the harp player who was shot by her girlfriend yeah the loball norden said its closed yeah but we were there to look at the shooting he did an interview with somebody else and i grabbed him and we did a couple of minutes he was pretty good he wouldnt give us his name thats why it didnt ring a bell i remember him saying hed rather not give his name i thought he might have done tv white hair said harper yeah but hes kind of fat that guy in the parking lothe was soft but he wasnt fat exactly the cop slammed his car door and led harriett into the building and out of sight how long ago anna looked at norden mustve been what a year since the shooting norden nodded about that the guys who ran the place were always in trouble with the cops and the shooting was the last straw i think they were open for a couple more months and then they were out theres another place there now anna said well when he comes out im gonna let him see me see how he reacts harper frowned if hes the guy hes nuts but therere cops all over the place whats he gonna do the phone rang in her pocket and she fumbled it out and if hes the guy itll freak him out hell show us something she pushed the button on the phone and a womans voice squeaked anna batory yes im dying what she looked at the phone who is this china lake the voice seemed distant weak im dying what she was sputtering and harper and norden were looking at her curiously then a mans voice rougher familiar shes dying anna and its your fault anna closed her eyes and squeezed the phone nono harper alarmed said what its him chapter listen to her the mans voice was like a snakes a hiss of pleasure jake had bolted from the car was running down the street toward the cop car at harrietts building then the woman in annas ear anna he stabbed me and less certainly it doesnt hurt much but i cant move where are you shes around thats where the man said i saw you tonight what are you doingare you looking for me if youre looking for me ill tell you what thats not a good idea ill cut the top off your goddamn head off and eat your brains the voice was right the voice was the man in the parking lot the man whod shot creek anna listened so hard it hurt listened for anything in the background that might help her other voices nothing but the hiss of the phone anna are you there im here she said youre not very talkative i amlooking for you you asshole and this better be a rotten joke or what he laughed whatre you going to do ill kill you anna said oh youll kill me you hear that china shes going to kill me here you wanna talk chinas voice was a whisper i cant see im getting really cold let her go anna screamed let her go no shes gonna die the man said casually you know why because i needed a woman especially after what you did the other night you cut the shit out of me anna im all fucked up and just off the phone youre gonna die arent you china look at the blood already and back to the phone shes dying its draining right out of her i cut her legs its really purple the blood youd think itd be redder you fucker anna shouted and without thinking she threw the phone like a baseball and it bounced across the blacktop shedding its battery flipping and bouncing along norden said what anna whatd he say but anna was already running after the phone she scooped it up and the battery jammed the battery back in said hello pushed the send button said hello hello oh jesus nobody there she stood there with the phone in her hand looked at norden then turned around to look down the street at harnetts building a cop hurried out of the building followed by harper as they scrambled to the cop car harper turned to look toward her anna spread her hands a gesture that said gone cant be right anna moaned she was kneeling on the front seat of the bmw while harper cranked it back down toward sunset wyatt would meet them way out of his jurisdiction bringing along a couple of la homicide cops bjs was still open people in black climbing the stairs toward the party room anna tore through the main floor peering at tables eyes followed as she checked each one and a bartender said hey and finally she caught a waitress and asked have you seen china lake if shes here shes probably back in one of the bathrooms thats where she usually is the woman smirked anna burst into the womens restroom and two women standing by the counter spun to look at her one still with a touch of powder cocaine at her nose christ one of the stalls was closed and anna banged on the door china is that you no go away a womans voice shrill not china anna went back out saw harper striding toward her norden in his wake she went on down the hall and pushed into the mens room a guy was standing at a urinal and anna said have you seen china lake the guy tried to shrug then said whats that damn it she went back into the hall and harper caught her and said nothing no shes not upstairs harper said he put both hands on his head trying to think and a bouncer came up behind him and said you guys got a problem yeah anna said have you seen china lake or seen her with anybody whats the problem we think a fruitcake grabbed her she could be in serious trouble harper said he was using his cop voice and the bouncer said you know she was here an hour ago i think i saw her going out she was alone lets go ask larry he led them back through the club to the front and the stairs leading up to the party room the doorman at the top looked down and the bouncer yelled hey larry you seen china she left did she leave with anyone you see anyone she was by herself far as i know anna asked did you see a guy in here with a bandage on his face right by his eye or maybe a big bruise he shook his head nobody here like that you think you could have missed it no way thing like that a guys probably a troublemaker we keep our eye out for troublemakers the outside door opened behind them and wyatt came through followed by two men in suits the bouncer spotted them and said shit and looked up the stairs at larry and made a quick throatcutting sign larry stepped out of sight shes not here wyatt asked coming up anna shook her head no shes gone could be a joke harper said louis wouldnt anna looked at him as though he were crazy and said no louis wouldnt jesus jake this is the guy youre sure wyatt asked im sure i knew the voice anna said had you heard it beforeother than at the parking lot when he jumped you wyatt asked anna held her hands to her temples as harper had so hard to think so little time or no time at all i think i dont know im getting confused but when he was talking to me in the parking lot god it seemed familiar not like everyday familiar but i knew the voice face to face or on the phone asked one of the la cops the phone she hadnt thought of that god i dont know i talk to a hundred people every night running around i dont know harper chipped in the guy on the door didnt see anyone with a bite on his face says he would have seen it all right wyatt said he seemed weary almost too tired to deal with it lets see if anybody here saw china leave with someone we got a couple of cars coming thats all anna asked thats all we can do can you think of anything else wyatt asked im outa here she stepped toward the door but wyatt caught her arm look we finally got something going on thiswere pulling together a multidepartment task force to track this guy he said were gonna need you we need to set you up where we can watch you i think its too late for that anna said he turned some kind of corner with that phone call hes gotta know youll be all over him now we still need to talk with you ill call you id really appreciate it if youd tell me if you shake anything out of these people she said gesturing up the stairs and china if you hear anything wyatt looked at harper jake can you control her a little shes gonna wind up dead jake said ill try you wouldnt hold anything back on us jake shook his head no were not playing games we just want somebody to get him i dont think theres anything well we thought for a while that he might be a little older whitehaired but thats gone up in smoke anna thinks hes young wyatt turned to anna whose eyes seemed to have unfocused staring at a spot on the other side of wyatts face wyatt said anna anna her eyes snapped back and a small uncertain smile crinkled her face yeah i heard you hes young im sure of it forget white hair that was a wildgoose chase and to jake lets go jakes eyebrows went up but he nodded and said to wyatt talk to you tomorrow norden was waiting out on the sidewalk she didnt like cops and now she was leaning against a fire hydrant smoking watching the light bars on the cop cars we all done she asked yeah for tonight anna said drop me at my place i want to get harnetts files out of the car norden said they dropped her at an apartment off la brea waited until i she was inside then jake turned to anna and said what i was that about the whitehaired guy and the wildgoose chase harnett was a pretty hot possibility an hour ago he might not be the killer but hes involved somewhere anna shook her head and said aw he might have known jason or something just a coincidence but hes not the whitehaired man i know who the whitehaired man is jake did a comic doubletake yeah well speak up its wyatt what he grinned expecting a punchline yeah an older guy with white hair you were talking about it and i was looking at him and all of a sudden i realized it washim we were thinking the whitehaired guy was after creek or me but reallyit was wyatt checking up on pam glass and what was happening with her and creek and he didnt want us to know it thats why he took off hes hung up on pam and he didnt want pam to know he was hanging around harper thought it over for a few seconds then sighed are you positive ninetynine percent next time we see wyatt take a good look at him hes the guy harper nodded all right christ we commit a felony we break into somebodys office and fuck him up and hes an innocent bystander not especially innocent anna said but we do have a few felonies behind us harper said yeah we do and if were not very careful theyre gonna start catching up with us he fed the car into a uturn and started back toward the hills anna sat up that night took her gun out of her pocket and spun the cylinder dumped the shells dryfired it at the tv when the tv was on reloaded looked at it waited for something not knowing what jake sat up with her for an hour or two then went to bed youve got to get some sleep he said how he looked at her shrugged if you decide to go out wake me up i want to come along if hes identified me he could know were out here so weve got to take it easy okay he pointed a finger at her i swear to god if you leave without waking me up ill kick your ass the dawn came slowly first a false lightening then a darkness again then the real dawn a great unhappy light like an old piece of newsprint being pushed over the mountains to the east anna was sitting in an easy chair maybe asleep the gun in her lap when jake came out and called her anna her eyes either opened or were already openshe didnt know it didnt seem like her mind had ever stopped yeah jesus did you get any sleep at all i dont know she said she felt wooden she pushed herself out of the chair went out to the kitchen with harper trailing behind coffee im gonna try to get a couple more hours why dont you come in and lay down jake jeez give me ten minutes to put you to sleep just come on in she followed him back to the bedroom pulled off her shirt and jeans and bra pulled on one of his tshirts and lay down he snuggled behind her said close your eyes jake just close them okay ten minutes she could feel his arm around her waist the tops of his thighs on the bottom of hers she opened her eyes briefly with difficulty to look at the clock and saw the glint of the gun on the nightstand and closed her eyes again the phone woke her she startled upright felt jakes arm come off her looked at the clock shed been down for four hours her mouth tasted like old features taken off a tar road jake was saying yah aw man where all right when he hung up she rolled over on her back and looked at him caught his eyes trying to look away china yeah shes dead they found her body out in glendale that was wyatt and what shes pretty cut up anna jumped out of bed lets get over there anna i need to see this she insisted why he asked exasperated because so get dressed because she was storing it up because she was holding on to these crimes all these insults squeezing them into herself she drove jake was so reluctant that she finally got the keys and climbed into the front seat and he caught up and piled into the passenger side and she took them over the hills and east into glendale on the way she called wyatt got switched around and was finally left with a promise that hed call her he did five minutes later where are you on the way i dont think you should i can identify her anna said i saw her twelve hours ago are you there she asked on the way see you there and she rang off before he could object there was a cluster of vehicles with light bars a halfdozen men looking down a highway embankment something she saw every night now harsher in the light of day wyatt hadnt arrived yetshe didnt recognize any of the cops at the scene they waved her on down the road but she stopped and when the cop came up she said were supposed to meet detective wyatt here from santa monica hes on the task force i talked to china last night the woman you think is down there he wanted me to see if i could identify her okay just pull up to the head of the line she drove up past the last car and turned to harper are you coming she asked yeah you better leave the gun in the car though theyll spot it and take it away from you good thought she took the gun out of her jacket pocket and pushed it under the front seat lets go china was halfway down the embankment wrapped in the dress shed been wearing the night before shed landed on her face apparently but the gravel on the embankment hadnt done any real damage itd cut but there was no blood to run the cuts looked like scratches in beeswax anna and harper dropped carefully down the embankment escorted by a young uniformed cop who watched their faces as they went down down past the foot with a sockwhat used to be called an ankletand the foot without one with the thighs impolitely apart unguarded by underwear the trails of dark pubic hair down to the face that had bitten into the gravel yeah anna said and harper said goddammit anna said to the young cop thats china lake shes an actress was do you know next of kin the young cop asked no but i could find out anything you could get wed appreciate yeah she never looked back at the body but she held the image of chinas face to her heart squeezing it filing the memories with the hate do you want to wait for wyatt harper asked as they got back to the top of the embankment what for anna asked bitterly the guy couldnt find his butt with both hands and a searchlight not fair harper said as he followed anna back to the car fuck fair she said all right princess so now what we gotta go back to my place so i can get my car i dont want you ferrying me all over the place anna im happy to i know i know but i want my car she said and she added im sorry jake but china the midday traffic wasnt too bad and they made it back to annas in a half hour she backed the toyota out of the garage as harper waited in the street then followed him out up the san diego over the hills to his house whey they got there she said you know i forgot something im gonna go away for a while i better come with you nope im doing this on my owndont worry ill be okay she took in his face softened and said listen i just want to drive around a while by myself and get my head straight and see creek at the hospital ill be careful ive got this she patted the pistol in her pocket goddammit anna you betterbe careful he took her shoulders and kissed her insistently she let herself relax into the kiss held it for a moment then pushed him away hold that thought she said ill be back he came out to watch her go and just before she did she ran the window down and said he might have tracked us out hereso be careful yourself its all private property and people are pretty insistent about that hed have a hard time sneaking in during the day anyway harper said but ill watch anna went back out the way she came watching the rearview mirror she had cars behind her from time to time but nothing that looked consistent she continued back into town to her house went in gathered a few clothes stuck them in a leather satchel and carried the satchel out to the car anna whats happening a voice from the sky and she looked up hobie come on up were having margaritas aw im on my way to see creek how is he she could just see the top half of hobies moon face past the shingles on a dormer better i guess they said he had to sit still for a few days but one of these days hell be up thats great listen this jerk this killer the cops think he might be tracking me if you or jim see anyone around take down some tag numbers huh im carrying my cell phone all the time youve got the number give it to me again she gave him the number and started out again down the oneway street that took her out of the canal district and out to the hospital watched the rearview mirror nothing that seemed furtive nothing that seemed consistent but anna read thriller novels and thought she could probably trail somebody all over la without being spotted you stay ten cars back with traffic the way it was and youd never be spotted of course once he saw which way she was going he might figure that she was heading for the hospital there wasnt much onstreet parking hed figure her for the ramp she worked it out and when the hospital came up she turned in at the ramp found a place on the third floor put her pistol in her main pocket her trigger finger wrapped around the front of the trigger guard so she wouldnt accidentally fire it checked the mirrors got out and walked selfconsciously to the hospital entrance she saw no one who seemed out of place who seemed to be watching who seemed at all interested in her except creek when she walked into his room creek was on his feet like a bear in a dressing gown trailing plastic lines that went to a saline bottle hung from a threewheeled pole pam glass sat in a chair by the window knitting creek turned as anna came in and grinned and she said my god what are you doing out of bed and looked at glass for an answer im getting better creek said but his voice was a croak and his face still seemed gray the doctor told him to glass said answering anna theyre sure thats okay anna asked glass they think its great glass said as long as he doesnt overdo it overdo is his middle name anna said they discussed it for another fifteen seconds anna and glass talking to each other checking creek like he was a defective car until creek said hey am i the village idiot or something youre not that responsible anna said then she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him on the cheek jeez im glad to see you up wheres harper creek asked hes supposed to be watching you i had to get away for a little whileim being careful anna said to glass have you heard the latest glass nodded the actress brutal they added a halfdozen guys to the task force and theres gonna be some news about it anna recoiled i wont come into it will i glass grinned cant stand the heat huh you know how it is a couple of days and somethingll leak yeah jeez anna pulled at her lip staring at creek you get back into bed why i feel okay cause i want to take pam away for a few minutes and i dont want you dropping dead while were gone youd rather have me laying dead in bed yeah as a matter of fact then it wouldnt be my fault for not telling you to lay down creek shook his head not following the logic but sat on the bed and finally pulled his legs up stay there glass said arf arf creek said like the family dog stay fido in the hall glass said smiling but intent ive been wanting to talk to you about creek yes right now if you crooked your finger hed come running i want to know if youre going to crook anna shook her head im not sure youre right about thatbut anyway creek and i i dont know we went past that point or i did and i think he did but maybe he hasnt figured it out yet why didnt you know he came along at the wrong time and by the time i was you know ready for something it was too late wed been sort of brotherlysisterly for too long he never tried to they were both fumbling for words as though they were creating a special creek vocabulary develop anything not directly creek looks like a bear and hes been to jail and the marines and all thatbut hes sensitive he usually knows what im thinking before i do and if you guys last hell get that way with you he already is a little anna nodded grinned and poked glass on the arm hes a good deal glass blew hair out of her face and her shoulders drooped as if her blood pressure had just dropped fifty points and she said you needed something from me i just needed to talk to you about your partner huh i think hes the guy we saw up here that we chased i think he was trying to check on you the other womans eyes defocused for a few seconds then she nodded briskly and said yeah damn so ill talk to him glass said then she grinned ruefully and said men really do come from another planet you know anna was ready when she went back into the parking garage but nothing happened nothing the garage was so silent that no television movie in history could have resisted the moment the killer and anna would be there toe to toe and anna would kill him or something she was barely prepared for nothing at all in the car she went back to her house parked nosein to the garage left the engine running hobie called down offers still open and she yelled thanks hobie but im out of here she sat in the house for a moment then walked through the kitchen and checked the lock on the canalside door and then went back through the house and out locked the front and drove back out she thought this way if the killer was watching her he wouldnt watch from within the canal area the road through the district was oneway and narrow and nobody could wait on it without being noticed hed watch either the entrance or the exit and pick her up coming or going all right let him pick her up she touched the gun in her pocket when she told him on the phone that she was going to kill him it wasnt idle chatter if she could get him in the right place shed do it but shed have to handle it carefully she liked jake a lot liked everything about himor at least thought she could straighten out the parts of him that werent quite right a snip here a tuck there and hed be presentable but she liked his looks his attitude the way he lived but she didnt quite understand deep in her heart why he hadnt killed the dealer in the hotel she would have so if she was going to stir this killer out of his muck jake couldnt know chapter harper was sitting in a lawn chair in front of his house a hardcover book by his heel in an attitude of waiting he pushed himself out of the chair when anna pulled up and sauntered around the car long time he said did you get your head straight about some things she said she stood on her tiptoes gave him a peck on the lips feeling guilty for not telling him that she was trolling for the killer more guiltythis was oddbecause he smelled kind of good she said creeks walking around excellent harper nice guy seemed genuinely pleased listen ive had a few thoughts lets go around back ive been itching to fire the gun again his eyebrows went up your violent streak is showing she grinned at him ive just been carrying it everywhere and i dont know ive just got the urge to pull the trigger harper got the earmuffs and a couple of coke cans and they walked side by side out to the gully we didnt spend enough time with catwell jasons friend at kinkos he said i figured out this much either its a coincidence that this killer shows up the day after jason is killed or he waited for her to fill in the blank but she couldnt think of anything or what or he said its not a coincidence gosh youre just like einstein he held up a finger his face serious listen i dont think its a coincidence maybe it isive got some ideas about that toobut i dont think so so lets take them one at a time go ahead if its not a coincidence then the killer fixed on you between the time you picked up jason and the time jason ran off okay she was amused by his lawyerly dissection in that time you only did two things he said you went to the animal rights raid and you went to where jacob was so you probably picked up the guy at one of those places weve assumed it was with jacob because of the drugs we were probably wrong anna frowned took the pistol out of her jacket pocket flicked out the cylinder spun it once looking at the little undimpled primers we talked to two guys really at the animal rights raid she said snapping the cylinder shut one of them was wearing a mask but he had this voice i was thinking maybe someday he could go on tv jesus this guyit could be him i mean he was a little strange his attitude i didnt pay much attention because we run into lots of strange people all right harper said where do we look him up i dont knowjason was the contact but i could find out harper was absently juggling the empty coke cans okay but before we get too enthusiastic you said there were two guys at the animal rights raid yeah she nodded thinking about it the other one he was just a kid kind of wimpy harper found a dirt ledge for the cans and set them up i saw him on tvyou mean the kid who tried to fight them off not a violent type like me anna said he was crying about getting a bloody nose doesnt sound like our guy harper agreed he pointed at her plastic muffs pull down your earmuffs youre too young to lose your hearing harper stuck his fingers in his ears and anna pulled down the earmuffs and pointed the gun at one of the cans then a thought struck her and she pulled the muffs back and said i just thought of something else yeah he took his fingers out of his ears creek noticed that there was only one guy on the raid all the rest were women and they were i dont know kind of busty creek said it looked like a harem so maybe the guys a freak god she pulled the muffs down again and harper stuck his fingers back in his ears and anna pointed the pistol at the first can jerked the trigger she missed by two feet settle down she said aloud she relaxed brought the pistol up fired again and the can flipped up the dirt wall and clattered back down again a neat hole punched in the center of the white cforcoke anna pulled the muffs up and said i just thought of something else he had this pig and it knocked him down i saw that harper said he mustve been humiliated yeah she pulled the muffs back down emptied the gun she hit the cans twice more and the rest of the shots were bunched around them you aint going to the olympics harper said as she shucked the empty shells out but theyd all hit between the nipples thats all i need she said reloading she stopped with a shell still in the palm of her hand and said you said if it wasnt a coincidence all of this startingyou said you had some ideas about that too one thing at a time harper said she pushed the last shell home lets go find this guy louis found him running down names on the letterhead press release his name is steven judge he and two or three more of them live at what they call the full heart sanctuary ranch and its not far from where you are louis said its up in ventura just on the other side of the santa susanas half an hour harper said when anna told him he glanced at his watch weve got time the countryside of southern california was rarely empty not this close to l a and the coast but the full heart ranch was on a gravel road up a washedout dirt canyon about as isolated a place as could be found the sign at the entrance to the canyon was neat and businesslike a metal plaque that said full heart ranch and below that in smaller letters animal sanctuary a hundred feet up the trail was another sign this one resembling the signs in national forests yellow burntin letters on brownpainted boards welcome please register at the ranch house do not leave your car before registeringsome of our animals are sensitive to the scent of humans probably got tigers out there harper said and when they say humans they mean meat probably anna said the canyon was a tangle of brush with an occasional glimpse of trails leading through it they crossed a low ridge on the way up and saw the ranch house just below them in a bowl a halfdozen outbuildings surrounded the main house and three cars faced the front of it pretty nice spread harper said the way this kid looked the way he actedhe might have some money anna said you think he owns the place anna shrugged he was the boss that night they parked the car stepped out and looked around they could hear an odd goatlike sound and they both stepped off to the right to look past the house a tall fuzzyheaded animal looked at them over the top of a high board fence pursed its lips made the noise again a camel a llama anna said a door banged and a woman in jeans a western shirt and cowboy boots came out onto the ranch house porch she looked like a ranch woman in her early forties with wide shoulders a round moon face deeply tanned with a scattering of freckles her sandy hair was pulled back in a ponytail can i help you yeah hi anna said we were just looking at your llama whered you get him we found him the woman said pleasantly he was rather badly abused or rather neglected the former owner had ideas about breeding llamas when it didnt work out he just turned him out and left him in the desert he wouldve died if one of our members hadnt found him terrific anna said cheerfully harper followed her as she walked up on the porch my name is anna batory and this is my friend jake harper we filmed the raid at the ucla medical center and steve mentioned the possibility of doing another piece is he around the woman shook her head and said steven and then said im sorry you missed him but he should have told you that he wouldnt be around he wont be back for another two weeks where is he anna asked can i call him sureor i think so hes up in oregon at the cut canyon ranch he went up there the day after the raid to help organize it and

desk i dont know i dont seem to have it god ive got to do something about this desk think itd be on directory assistance ann asked should be daly said no problem anna said she took her cell phone out

pottery she dialed directory assistance asked for a new listing for cut canyon ranch got the number and punched it in cut canyon another woman is steve judge there yes somewhere can i tell him whos

steve is active with the group but he avoids bureaucratic entanglements so to speak hes a little she looked at the other woman what is he laurie laurie never looked away from the screen hippie she said ah at that moment judge came on the phone yeah steve judge the voice wasnt the killershigher than she remembered not squeaky but nasal rather than full anna looked at harper and shook her head as she said this is anna batory i stopped by the ranch to see if we might put together another piece on this animal thing oh judge said then you know i wasnt too happy about the way the raid thing came out i think it made me look foolish with the pig and all wellthat happens the stations cut the tape the way they want we didnt have anything to do with that anna said okay i guess im willing to give it another shot judge said were just finishing things up here i was going to head back tonight when do you want to get together couple days next week anna said now in no rush but judge rambled on eager to make another movie the neatest things weve got right now is a vet whos made a specialty out of fixing bird wings he said were gonna start rehabilitating raptors you know hawks eagles you cant just fix them up and let them go you have to rehab the wings people shoot these poor birds she let him go throwing in a couple of questions about the raid until she was sure it was really him when she was sure she looked at harper and shook her head damn it i thought he was a possibility anna said as they went down the road from the ranch the afternoon was sliding into the evening might still becould be something tricky going on i suppose anna said but she yawned and shook her head the morningwhen she crunched down that highway cut and looked at china lakeseemed a lifetime back she yawned and said lets go see creek fuckin vinyl cowboy boots harper said you show me a woman who wears vinyl cowboy boots and ill show you a woman whose he trailed off glanced at anna and then concentrated on the road ahead whose what anna demanded never mind harper said anna took the phone out of her pocket and tried it still out of range waitll we get over the hill harper suggested two minutes two minutes and they were back in range she had a message waiting but called louis and asked him to locate the other kid at the animal raid then she punched in the message and got wyatts voice weve got a proposition for you he said call me wyatt she said to harper hes got a proposition wyatt was in the office things are gonna get out of control pretty soon he said his voice tinny in the little phone we havent had an oj case or anything else for the media assholes excuse me anna said uh sorry anyway this whole thing is gonna leak two days three days maximum he said so one of the task force guys came up with a proposition weve got a couple of undercover guys who are pretty good with video cameras they do a lot of surveillance so you check one of these guys out and then you go out on the street with him he could fill in for your friend creek and we put a net around you huh not bad let me talk to jake about it thered be a chance we could spot the guy wyatt said wed have an undercover video van covering you and even if nothing happens we could analyze every face in every crowd every place you go if hes tracking you we could spot him let me talk to jake okay but we want to go tonightfour hours from now harper was adamant no no fuckin way theyre so desperate theyre willing to turn you into a bullseye when you were working homicide did you ever use a civilian as a decoy only once or twice and it didnt do any good harper said and the situations were really limited we werent out roaming around trying to find a psycho did you have a relationship with either of those women were they women yeah they were women and of course not i didnt mess with people in investigations so you used them anna said do you think your change in attitude might have something to do with the fact that were working on a relationship she was so silky with the question that harper glanced all her and said shut up and a moment later youre stupid anna laughed and said i hope creeks awake creek was awake eating a bowl of raspberry jello and arguing with pam glass who looked more tired than creek when anna and harper walked in glass said god am i glad to see you this nitwit is talking about going home in the morning creek was sitting up in bed still plugged into the saline drip he tried to look well im feeling a hell of a lot better he said in an unnaturally chipper voice what do the doctors say harper asked if he keeps improving maybe three days glass said thats the minimum hes talking about how his insurance runs out i offered to help him but he wont take help creek looked embarrassed and anna put a hand on her hip and said i bought the insurance creek it aint runnin out so i thought it might run out glasss eyes narrowed you were lying to me thats what i thought creek mumbled glass dropped in a chair i dont even know why i hang around this place she said wearily jeez pam take it easy now creek was worried glass looked at anna and said anything you pal wyatt wants her to be a target in some stupid decoy operation harper said decoy now she was interested how would it work anna explained and glass nodded could work thats bullshit said creek he looked at harper you cant go along with this of course not i already told her how stupid it is anna was looking at glass you think it could work the other woman nodded those guys are good id go for it now it was creeks turn to be angry pam goddammit you dont know what youre doing this guys a psycho if we thought he was going to shoot her with a sniper rifle then id be against it glass said but he seems to want to get his hands on her these guys wholl be with hertheyre tough guys he wont take anna away from them anna told creek and glass about the abortive trip to the full heart ranch and her talk with steve judge i hadnt thought of that guy but now that you bring him uptheres something about him i think he needs a closer look creek said hes in oregon anna said that could be some bullshit they pulled creek said i dont think so she said anna looked at harper remembering their conversation while they were shooting you said you had a couple ideas one of them is the other kid but whats the one you didnt want to talk about the coincidence harper shrugged not much really he said then could i have a little talk with creek alone anna looked from harper to creek and said whats this about creek shrugged looking curiously at harper and harper said if i wanted you to know id just go ahead and askso if you dont mind go talk to pam in the hall anna and glass let harper ease them through the door and shut the door behind himself they dont even know each other anna said two minutes later the door opened harper looked out and said you better come back in anna and glass filed back in and creek smiled at anna tentatively the smile flickering like a bad fluorescent bulb what anna demanded jake uh brought something up he didnt want to talk to you about it unless i thought there was something to talk about so sothere might be so what is it creek looked at harper shrugged looked back at anna and said clark nope nope no way no way anna said she waved her arms like a home plate umpire calling a runner safe it wouldnt its not clark wouldnt probably not creek said but clark is strange you know that yourself ive never met anyone as driven as he was every time you two guys got into trouble it was because he was freaking out with work who knows what happened to him since you last saw himhe mightve cracked not clark anna said stubbornly yeah youve heard his voice creek said are you sure it wasnt clarks you say its familiar she opened her mouth to say no it wasnt clarksbut then she thought maybeit is the voice was a middle baritone and clarks was close to that and she hadnt heard clarks voice for years she closed her eyes listened to clark talk the same she opened her eyes no she said its not the same bullshit said creek because creek could read her mind you dont know anna was furious with creek for talking about clark he didnt understand what clark had been going through when the trouble started the stress the politics of the music business and where they could push an ambitious person especially when that person was young confused exhausted and then she thought to herself really is that really what you think about clark shed never really gotten over their relationship even admitted it to herself not because she couldnt but because of the indefinite way it had ended i love you but jake came out of the kitchen carrying a plate of toast and jelly they were at annas house anna changing into her work clothes you dont go wandering off through the crowdcreek said you ran all the way up and down through that hotel when jacob died i dont want you getting away from the escorts yeah yeah she said distracted he put the plate down and caught her around the waist and said hey listen to me well work out this clark business laterbut for now we gotta keep your ass alive he squeezed her butt but she wiggled away are you still pissed harper asked oh im not pissed wait a minute yeah i am pissed at creek creek is trying to take care of you harper said he pushed the plate toward her and she took a piece of jelly toast i was thinkingi was hopingthat id never have to deal with the clark thing anna said to him maybe itd just fade away it sorta was but i dont know maybe it wasnt are you still in love with him no i dont think so but i wasin love with him and there was never any endpoint i couldnt ever say well thats over with now i can do something else i needed an endpoint we havent known each other very long but i never would have seen you this way harper said his face intently serious i wouldve thought that when you broke off with somebody thatd be it and youd never think about him again oh no she said as serious as he with a real relationship id think about it forever ill think about you forever no matter what happens really really she said forever louis showed up a half hour later leading a rattylooking darkhaired man unshaven with a heavy shock of black hair that fell down over his oval face he wore a green army field jacket from the sixties with a faded name tag that said ward jimmy coughlin he said shaking annas hand and peering at harper youre jake harper yeah harper said he reached out and touched the name tag on coughlins jacket whos ward fuck if i know coughlin said cheerfully he looked around the living room we ready you know what youre doing anna asked sure no problem he said i used to pretend i was a news guy and shoot riots and raids and shit let me get my jacket anna said coughlin drove not fast but expertly using all three rearview mirrors there were three tracking cars he said one in front and two behind louis sat in the back in his regular chair monitoring the radios when anna looked out the passenger side window she could almost pretend that this past week hadnt happened which way coughlin asked lets sort of loaf up the pch and then catch sunset where it comes down and go back east anna said play it by ear coughlin nodded took a small hand radio out of his pocket and relayed the route to the tracking cars you do this much anna asked not exactly like this but you knowlike this he said dopers mostly little of this little of that he said some dope doing a little more vice lately been backing up some of the gang guys you like it anna asked sure its fun he said and she had to smile he was a cheerful guy despite his ratlike exterior then i couldnt help noticing that youre carrying a gun yup she nodded you got a permit he asked are you kidding maybe you should give it to methe gun he said maybe not anna said i could take it he suggested cop takes gun from woman stalked by serial killer who brutally murdered movie actress she looked over her shoulder at louis could we get that on the air are you kidding louis said i could sell it everywhere but itd sound better if we said cop takes gun from woman stalked by serial killer who brutally murdered movie actress while gangs run wild with assault rifles in southcentral that isan improvement anna said itd do okay louis said but if you could get him to rough you up a little bit wed get more than we got for the jumper how about it anna said turning back to coughlin and batting her eyes do you carry a club or a sap or anything could you push me around a little i mean i kind of like it louis said cop takes gun from beautiful woman stalked by serial killer who brutally murdered glamorous drugabusing actress abuses her with baton while gangs ran wild with assault rifles in southcentraland she likes it coughlin hunched over the steering wheel and shook his head sadly christ this could be a long night he said chapter they took the pacific coast highway north as far as sunset sunset back east they narrowly missed hitting a mercedes benz e that came rocketing out of a beverly hills side street and crossed sunrise without slowing rich junkies coughlin muttered eat that speed and cant handle it fire back in bel air louis said he had his headphones on any good anna asked turning to look at him hed belted himself into his office chair doesnt sound like much louis said as he punched numbers into a scanner but i think ive heard the name jimmy james jones i dont know anna said it rings a bell preacher coughlin said he used to have a tv show anna nodded thats right good to louis anything about women or people hurt nope mostly smoke jimmy james jones called in the report himself and hes still in the house coughlin glanced at her expectantly but anna said keep going how do you decide coughlin asked after a while sunrise rolled along outside the windows a shabbier section near hollywood a few men and women strolling along the streets cars playing games along the curbs how do you know what to go to magic anna said im serious he said he jabbed at the brake a woman with a shopping cart looked for a moment as though she might lurch into the street so am i anna said i dont know how to decide you just go on the sound of it like what like the fire that could be something if jimmy james jones was just a little more famousnot much more just a little bitwed go over if there were people hurt wed think about it but the thing is all the local stations are so sensitive to anything with a celebrity that theyve probably got their trucks rolling right now so even if it turned out to be good we might not sell much because everybody would have it louis only mentioned it because were close enough that we could probably get there first first isnt always enough coughlin said no anna said shaking her head sometimes its enoughbut not always when the story is minor then its absolutely necessary or if the story has one crucial moment then youve got to be there for that moment like we shot this kid a week ago the kid who fell off the building harpers kid yeah we didnt know jake then anyway its not really much of a story but the event was spectacular its something nobody ever seeswe were just there by accident there was no way for anybody else to make up for our film they had to have it with the jimmy james jones fire story all they need is a shot of some fire trucks and hoses and a comment from jones you can be really late and get all that coughlin nodded so how do you know whereto go when nothings going on i fish get a feeling some nights just have a quiet feeling in one place so you decide to go somewhere else like i think we ought to check up the valley tonight we havent been there in a while up the hollywood yeah the hollywood to mission hills back on the san diego maybe jump off at ventura if anythings going on they were coming up on mission hills when louis blurted okay we got a holdup at a starbucks and a guys down where are we have we crossed mission yet two minutes to mission anna said get off go east louis said he was punching numbers into the laptop okay three blocks east right side we should see it they got one guy down and one of the clerks threw a pot of boiling coffee on the holdup guy hes still in the street he might be blind hes still armed cops on the way could be good anna said to coughlin but we gotta hurry i am hurrying he said im doing seventy i mean hurry anna said she took the pistol out of her pocket popped the lock box with the nagra took the tape recorder out and put the gun in the box and relocked it when she turned back they were hurtling down an offramp toward a stoplight and she stretched out over the dashboard looking to the left and said nothing coming nothing coming forget the light go coughlin took it sedately through the curve and anna said damn it you gotta drive jesus coughlin said but he floored it and the truck took off three blocks ahead there were people in the street thats gotta be it she said louis was fumbling with the main camera and said to coughlin all right the cameras all set just pull the trigger yeah yeah louis reached over the seat and put the headset over the top of coughlins head pull it down over your ears right therepull right up on that curb anna shouted put two wheels up get up there fuckin people are nuts coughlin said but he put two wheels on the curb stood on the brake and anna was out the door a man was lying on the street with his hands on his face moaning bleeding from the face a revolver on the sidewalk ten feet away a toughlooking teenager in a letter jacket was standing over him sirens began screaming in coughlin was out with the camera but not moving fast enough anna screamed at him on the headset this way move move run for christs sake coughlin broke into a trot the camera bouncing on his shoulder and anna pointed at the man on the street and the teenager what happened what happened tell the camera what happened guy come running out of the store and ran right into that door and cracked his head open the teenager told coughlins camera he had the gun and people were inside yelling to get out of the way he shot somebody so i kicked the gun over there and he tried to get up and i set him down again anna allowed a seconds space as coughlin panned from the man on the street to the teenager and back and anna said whats your name where do you come from what were you doing here as the teenager started talking again she ran inside the store another man was on the floor and a halfdozen starbucks counterpeople were gathered around him she said coughlin get in here right now get the scene on the floor hurry goddammit the cops are almost here the cops werethere coughlin trotted into the store and began walking sideways working around the group on the floor and one of the counterwomen stood up and pointed a finger at him and said get out of here thats not allowed thats not allowed anna shouted at the woman look at the guy hes bleeding help him and the woman looked back down and then grabbed a napkin holder and dropped onto her knees and pulled out a fourinch loaf of napkins and handed it to another woman who was apparently trying to staunch a wound coughlin was looking past the camera and anna shouted keep running for christs sake three cops hurried in the door one spotted the camera and waved it away and coughlin took it down again anna said okay come this way come toward me toward the side door as they went she asked the crowd of coffeedrinkers did anyone see this any witnesses two or three nodded and she said wed like to get statements outside if anyone has time will this be in the newspaper tomorrow somebody asked maybe tv anna said a paramedic truck arrived as they did the interviews and coughlin moved away again to catch the wounded man being carried out the shooter with the burned face was cuffed and put in another ambulance and then there was nothing but a crowd of gawkers and the flashing lights on the cop car this way back to the truck anna told coughlin hurry im running my ass off he snarled she shook her head still not moving fast enough she said coughlin caught up with her halfway to the truck pulled the headset off and said whats the rush cops might give us a hard time especially if the starbucks people complain might want to look at the tape we gotta get out of here before they start thinking about it he nodded and hurried along with her louis took the camera and coughlin jumped into the drivers seat kind of a rush he said starting the truck yeah but you gotta move anna said you were way too slow hey im a beginner he said he took the truck out into the street as louis popped the tape out of the camera i did all right for a beginner she shrugged then smiled yeah i guess for a guy who doesnt know the rules but next time rules number one and two drive fast then run yes maam he laughed a little giddy then how come nobody else showed up no competition anna shrugged cause this didnt amount to anything the victim wasnt even killedthough getting the shooter was a little different i hope you shot the gun on the street yeah yeah anyway theres no way this would make the papers much less tv news just on what happened routine holdup shooting we might have a couple of good images so maybe itll make itnot because it means anything but because the images are good i hope i got some coughlin said nervously looking over his shoulder at louis i just kept pulling the trigger you did okay louis said from the back of the truck he had the tape up on a monitor its not great but its usable anna watched as louis rolled through it then turned to coughlin a couple of things you move too fast from one subject to the next you show the guy on the ground the shooter and the gun but only for a couple of seconds each time you have to dwell on them for a moment remember we can always cut but we cant get more same with the wounded guy inside you gotta stay on him hes the interest and the women working on him but mostly the wounded guy i was thinking i should help coughlin said no anna said you cant think that way if you ride with us youre making the movie not acting in it youre an eye thats cold coughlin said thats the way it is said anna a couple of minutes later coughlin took the radio out of his pocket pushed the transmit button and asked anything he listened then said to anna nothing anna got out her phone and started dialling tv stations two kids motorheads from a valley technical school were chasing each other down the ventura when one lost it and rolled his rebuilt charger off the freeway and down an embankment they started that way but when anna got an exact location from louis she called it off if we get up there were trapped in traffic she said not worth the time the kids dead coughlin said yeah but we cant get in and out and thats the main thing anna said a chase started on the santa monica the highway patrol running after a porsche anna pointed them down the san diego as louis monitored the chase hes probably gonna have to make a decision when he gets to the san diego she said either north or south if he comes this way we might have a shot a nine twentyeight means theres some money could be a movie tiein but the porsche went straight on dropped onto the pch and suddenly pulled over and gave it up nothing later on they headed for a truck fire broke off before they got there arrived too late at a shooting incident found nobody hurt and cops everywhere coughlin checked again and the trailing cars had not spotted anyone tracking them waste of time anna said pulling on her lower lip were wasting time got to be a little patient coughlin said very late they were rolling south on sepulveda looking for any movement at all when louis said body found where mmm its over a fence must be pretty high because they can see it but they cant get to it no address yet okay coughlin was concentrating on the driving louis worked the radios and anna let her mind drift all evening shed felt herself drifting away from the immediacy of the truck out of it the problem was clark were they done certainly or probably but all those years ago when they were working their music together she playing it clark composing when they were going to concerts together and clubs toying with rock n roll when clark was putting together the jump rope concerto the first work to bring him notice in the years they were doing that she had woven a mental web around them a cocoon to hold themand when suddenly it began to come apart shed never dealt with it shed fantasized instead of pulling all the strands back together and now she thought this perfect house shed built in venice with all the homely touches from the midwest was this a nest for clark is that where the energy had come from because hed like it nohed love it shed been obsessive about it all the small touches the quilts the rag carpets on the wooden floors the folk art the pottery was that what shed been doing building for a man whod engineered a break that had hurt her worse than anything since the death of her mother bellagio louis said anna frowned missing it what the body was found off bellagio over a fence she asked sitting up yeah get an address she snapped to coughlin if its over a fence it could be the bel air country club get up on the freeway lets go the body was on the golf course but so were the cops and they couldnt get close coughlin edged the truck up to a cop car and the cop said get the fuck out of here hey im just trying didnt you hear me dummy get the fuck out of here the cop said he was young with a pale nordic face untouched by any apparent emotion other than irritation all right but i gotta go up there to turn around hey you aint coming through here the cop said just back it up i cant back it up back the fuckin truck up or ill have your ass out here on the street wiseguy coughlin backed the truck up muttering under his breath anna and louis watched in amusement and when they finally got turned louis said fuckin pigs coughlin looked up into the mirror and said i shoulda kicked his ass they would have thumped you like a tub of apple juice anna said coughlin continued on down the street paused at the corner snarled little fuckin nazi rat and then you gotta put up with this all the time all the time anna said the cops see the dish on the roof and its open season you cause us a lot of trouble coughlin said no we dont anna said you cause yourself a lot of trouble like your little nazi back there he could have been polite instead he treats us like dirt so why should we be nice shit coughlin put the truck into a driveway backed up turned around anna said whatre you doing going back louis and anna sat in silence as coughlin took the truck back up the road then slowed as he came to the cop car blocking access to the body the young cop saw them coming put his hands on his hips shook his head and then jabbed a finger at the curb coughlin pulled over and rolled the window down are you deaf or stupid the cop asked looking up at coughlin coughlin stuck an id card out the window im a sergeant with the los angeles police department working an undercover detail is what i am and what i feel like doing is coming out there and kicking your ass up around your neck you little prick he said but i cant because id be breakin cover so what im gonna do instead is im gonna call my buddy down in personnel and see if we can fuck with your records see if we need anybody directing traffic around sewer projects about sixteen hours a day he went on for a while while the young cop opened and shut his mouth like a dying fish then coughlin threw the truck into reverse backed into a drive and headed out again feel better anna asked much then first time ive ever done anything like that you oughta do it more often anna said good for everybodys souls shed liked him before now she liked him better after a while she said you might be able to make a living at this yeah maybe you got the first part of the attitude but that was it for the night the following cars waited at both ends of dell watching cars and for people on foot coughlin walked her down to her house where a light showed in the window harper came to the door anything nothing coughlin said all quiet here harper said anna said it was absolutely flat no feeling of anything i think the guy has backed off no hes fixed on you he cant help himself hes hanging around but he knows were here too hell try to figure something out nobodyll get in or out of here coughlin said weve got vans at both ends night vision gear the whole works just gotta wait harper said when coughlin was gone harper asked do you want something to eat i usually have soup or something light anna said something to get the buzz off got chicken noodle soup in the kitchen he said go wash your face ill get it they sat at the table eating the soup and soda crackers and she talked about the night with coughlin and as they talked she felt looser and easier and suddenly was enjoying herself the time of the early morning coming down had always been one of her favorites sharing it suddenly seemed to make it even better then harper said seriously im not very romantic that had nothing to do with the night she said cautiously what i dont know how to talk about thisi didnt know how to talk about it with my wife but i he seemed embarrassed i sort of hunger for you we could probably think of a way to take the edge off she said lightly instinctively deflecting him im not talking about sex or i am but not only sex he said he looked around the kitchen im just right now eating soup having the best time ive had in fifteen years and i just dont want it to stop thats pretty romantic she said he flushed and then she did sitting with the soup and then harper said eat your soup i am well hurry before she went to sleep harper a weighty lump on the other side of the bed anna was suddenly suffused with a sense of sadness and fear shed missed this but she was also afraid of it afraid that it would end afraid that it wouldnt end afraid that she could lose control harper got up in the morning anna made a few noises at him as he crept out of the bedroom then went back to sleep the phone rang just after one and she crawled across the bed to pick it up creek howd it go last night okay she said you dont have to hurry and heal up anymore this cop is a great cameraman there was a second of silence and she said jesus creek that was a joke pretty fuckin funny he said god you get shot a little and people start having to be sensitive around you whatre you doing another second of silence i was thinking about clark again and if you say hes not the guy then i believe you ninetynine percent im serious but since weve got people being killed youve gotta check the other one percent im not talking to the cops about clark she said i understand that he said youve got to get harper to checkpam will help shes got a badge harpers a lawyer they could find out all kinds of stuff and itd all be in the family that way she thought about it for a few seconds then said he didnt do it i believe you he said but ill talk to jake she said harper was on the tiny strip of canalside lawn with a golf club making slowmotion swings anna looked out over the sink saw him and when he turned waved and he twirled the club like a baton and headed for the door morning he said or good afternoon want to run she asked love to but id probably have a heart attack he said well im gonna go down to the beach and run no youre not he said i am too no he shook his head if ive got to run you downand i couldand carry you back to the house i will youre not going to run on the beach i couldnt keep up with you and thats something he may have been watching you do if you want to run someplace else ill take you there she put her hands on her hips now youre messing with me damn right he said what do you want for breakfast she ran on the beach but not on venice beach harper drove her to santa monica parked on the bluff across from an art deco hotel and they walked down an access stairway across the highway and onto the beach a few hundred yards from where jason had been found i didnt see any cops following anna said thats good harper said but theyre there she ran most of a mile north turned ran back past him to the pier then back the beach was nearly empty and harper could see her all the way and she could see everyone around her not the same she said when she got back she was barely breathing hard i felt like i was wearing a leash gonna have to do for a while he said he mussed her hair kissed her on the lips and put her in the car the feeling of being on a leash had been unpleasant the feeling of being squired about was not were not trying to run your life harper said were just taking care for a few more days did you think about clark she asked shed told him about creeks phone call ill talk to pamthere are a few checks we could get done right away through the cops without talking to wyatt see if he had any problems with the police back east i can get credit reports see if i can find a guy to look around harvard thatll take forever not with computerswell have most of the paper in an hour or two he said getting a guy to look around harvardwe could hear something tomorrow if i can find the right guy i dont want him to know about it anna said he wont feel a thing harper said still ah god up to you on the way back she decided go ahead with the calls on clarkbut you know what i want to see him lets see if we can find him today we oughta get some paper on him first so you said itd take a couple of hours so do it well go look at him tonight what about going out with coughlin im thinking about putting him off hes a good guy but i dont think its gonna work wyatt seems to maybe wyatts not thinking about him as much as i am anna said if you put yourself in his shoes why would he follow me on the job therere cops everywhere i go there are two guys with me everywhere i go id more expect him to try my place or your place follow us when were alone like at the driving range or at the beach this morning except that weve got escorts she said unless unless what unless hes lost interest i just cant understand this thing why hed be so interested in me harper looked at her you dont understand because your mind isnt fucked and his is maybe hes still got enough control to lay back just long enough to loosen you up and get you thinking that you can go out on your own again and when you do hell be there yeah the thought scared her but the fear wasnt blinding because when he found hershed have found him chapter anna called wyatt to tell him that she wouldnt be going out with coughlin that night wyatt wasnt in but she left a voicemail and added that shed be at the hospital visiting creek pam glass was already at the hospital and anna called to ask her about an fbi check on clark i could do it in a few minutes from here id need his full name and date of birth she said anna gave her the information get it as quick as you can im coming down to see creek ill have it by the time you get here glass said we have a new room by the way anna took the new room number and when she got off the line harper said do you think youll be okay on your own youve got the escort out there ill be fine she said wherere you going ive gotta make it down to the office sign some paychecks make some calls back to boston remember yeah ill go easy anna never saw her shadow on the way to the hospital she knew they were there because shed called to tell them she was leaving which car they were or van or truck she could never decide inside the hospital ramp she saw no one but she kept her hand on the pistol in her jacket pocket as she walked to the entrance paranoid she thought as she went through the doors creek was outside the new room walking down the corridor in a flimsy white hospital gown anna caught him just outside his room and put her hand through the slit in the back of the gown and squeezed his butt creek jumped then limped into the hospital room while anna followed laughing goddamn sexual harassment from the boss creek told glass who was reading the style section of the la times and im hurt be brave glass said like hed never grabbed a butt anna said i do it in a spirit of tenderness and multiculturalism creek said indignantly anna watching him in amusement suspected that he was actually offended she momentarily considered an apology then decided that hed have to live with it no apologies creek sputtered id never just sneak up on and then his eyes went past anna and she turned wyatt wearing his raincoat stepped into the room hello hey i came to see if i can change your mind he said to anna his eyes drifted toward glass who was sitting on a chair next to creeks bed her bare feet curled beneath her looking frankly domestic i dont think so wyatt brought his eyes back to anna and they squared off i cant order you to go because youre a civilian wyatt said grimly patient but the shit is gonna hit the fan pretty soon when the media get this when the word about china lake gets out theyre liable to drive this guy out of sight weve gotta work everything we can while we can its not working anna said flatly if he comes after me it wont be on the job he doesnt have to come after you wyatt insisted all he has to do is cruise you and if we keep you out of sight except when youre workinghes gonna cruise you hes gonna want to see you we ran a dozen cars last night and got nothing anna said but hell come they went on for a few more minutes wyatt pressing anna resisting until glass said if you saw me in the truck i could be anna anna and wyatt both turned toward her and she uncurled her legs and stood up were about the same size and weight and our hair colors the same she said i could get a pair of wire rims at woolworths and take the lenses out im not doing anything now except listening to creek pissing and moaning anna looked at her then at wyatt then back at glass tilted her head if youre willing thats a possibility wyatt was sceptical but finally agreed if thats the only way we can do it damn it though whatre you gonna do anna anna smiled just a turn of the lips jake and i have been trying to spend a little time together in peace and quiet oh wyatt nodded behind him creek rolled his eyes when wyatt had gone to call the task force leader anna asked glass whatd you get on clark glass shook her head nothing he had his drivers license suspended for three speeding tickets in three months thats it yeah i knew it anna said hes out of it hes not out of it creek insisted creek lets see what jake gets creek said they talked for a few more minutes then wyatt returned its all set but pam has gotta get to your place without being noticed ill drive her anna said she can leave her car here in the hospital ramp all right coughlin will be there at nine he looked at glass you be careful glass kissed creek goodbye and she and anna left together glass carrying the remnants of the newspaper anna caught their reflection in the elevator doors as they waited side by side with the slight blurring in the stainless steel they could have been mistaken for each other glass was perhaps an inch taller anna had just slightly wider shoulders both had short efficient haircuts so what if the guy came for her and they took him down and she wasnt even there to see it anna touched the gun in her jacket pocket then shook her head no they wouldnt take him that way id hate to deal with this guy one on one glass was saying most guys you can manipulate but you get a guy like this have you ever gotten tangled up with a guy whos nuts no they got in the elevator and pushed a button when i was on the street we got a call about a guy in a halfway house hed done some time on some sex offenses mostly exhibitionism most of it aimed at little girls glass said anyway he was drunk out on the street flashing everybody who came by when we got there we couldnt find him hed walked off he wasnt supposed to be dangerous or anything so me and my partner split up trying to find him i walked down to this ice cream shop and stopped to ask some people at a bus stop and he came out of the shop behind me and saw the uniform and freaked out and came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me and picked me up off the ground and started squeezing jeez yeah he was huge strong i felt like an egg i felt like he could crush me i couldnt move my arms i just kept trying to talk to him but he was nuts he had a mind like a little mean kid having a temper tantrum i couldnt get him to put me down and the more i struggled the tighter he squeezed until i couldnt breathe howd you get loose my partner came along called for backup and started whacking the guy with his baton but the guy kept turning in circles and squeezing me and then the backup arrived and the three guys got us all down on the ground and pried his arms off i was black and blue my ribs looked like the american flag where his arms were great big stripes the elevator door opened and anna said its a weird thing men and muscles its like they think about it all the time what makes me mad is that some wimpy little jerk who never lifts anything heavier than a fork can whack me around because hed got fifty pounds on me and hes twice as strong and hes not even trying its all hormones yeah but thats why god made us smarter anna said thats true glass conceded glass lay in the back seat of annas car reading the comics as anna drove back home harpers bmw was squeezed into a tight space in front of the house and anna had to maneuvre the car to get it into the garage they went inside and found harper at the kitchen table eating a bowl of golden crisp with milk what he asked anna gave him a quick rundown and he looked at glass put on the right clothes at night itll work keep moving though anything at all on clark mmm harper said he quickly finished the cereal and carried the bowl to the sink just a little thing he wont find out no no ive got a friend in a law firm there theyve got a researcher on staff she walked over and talked around the music department she said she was checking on a mortgage history so whatd she find anna asked impatiently the little thing theres a rumor of a sexual harassment complaint made by a graduate studenta woman graduate studentin a composition seminar apparently nothing was ever filed no legal action but there was something just a rumor anna said dismissively no there was something harper said we cant really find out what unless we ask more directly and hed most likely hear about it anna shook her head then dont glass glanced at harper then said anna this is a little more important than your feelings or his remember china lake i remember china lake but clark didnt do it one of his students has a recital tonight hell be there eight oclock at schoenberg hall harper said yeah annas eyebrow went up we could pick him up after the recital harper said his voice casual find out what he does with his evenings and wed have time to stop by kinkos first and talk to catwell again anna said we could do that harper said coughlin would pick glass up at the regular nightcrew starting time ten oclock if they left any earlier they thought the stalker would miss them glass said when we go out tonight if we dont find anybody tailing us well probably cruise just long enough to seem legitimate then come back here like i was picking up something then go back out again give him another chance to pick us up if we still dont get anything well be back around midnight so youre gonna lay low until then harper asked i gotta get some sleep glass said she yawned watching creek is tiring keep the doors locked harper said the guys been here at least twice anna snuck out to harpers car after dark and curled up on the back seat out of sight i dont have much faith in this catwell thing harper said over the seat we just have to keep talking anna said the cops keep saying that i know the guy sooner or later ill pick him out i probably should have already bob catwell was not at kinkos an unconsciously beautiful young blonde woman told them that catwell had rented a room in some frat house up on the hill down in the basement you have to walk around the side on this gravel tracklike thing and you see this door like his room used to be the coal bin or something she drew a sketch on a piece of copy paper and anna thanked her and they headed out do you think she knows how beautiful she is harper asked on the way to the car somewhere down in her brain she knows that she gets special treatment anna said unless shes particularly stupid and she didnt seem to be the frat house was built on the side of a hill with a narrow rutted drive leading around back harper found a parking place and they walked back and down the drive eight or nine feet of old pouredconcrete foundation was exposed along the back side the only window was boarded over with a sheet of plywood but they could see light through a hairline crack at one edge and at the door they could smell the burning dope you could get high standing outside harper said he turned the knob and pushed the door unexpectedly popped open and he stepped through anna at his elbow catwell was sprawled on a battered green sofa in front of a seventies color television watching ren and stimpy reruns he sat up scared when they burst in dropped the joint he was smoking recognized them then scrambled to get the joint out of the couch what the fuck do you want did you get the fuck out of here gotta talk anna said stepping around harper catwell finally found the joint and then stood there looking at it not sure what to do with it give me that anna said he handed it to her and she took a hit exhaled and handed it back now were all criminals together huh so relax and we gotta talk catwell uncertain hit on the joint himself a last time then pinched it out like a dopers bowling alley in here harper said waving at a layer of smoke that hung twothirds of the way to the ceiling you dont like it get lost catwell said both of you shut up anna said to catwell listen we need to talk again we need to know more about what jason was doing not who he bought the dope from just in general that guy still chasing you catwells eyes were glassy and his speech a little slow but he seemed to be tracking he killed another woman anna said wherere the fucking cops catwell asked out chasing hippies theyre looking anna said we need to know who jason was talking to anything you know especially the night before he died did you see him that night no i didnt i knew he was going out with you though hed been talking about setting the whole thing up the raid catwell said he dropped on the couch again looked at the dead joint in his hand you know i miss that dickhead i keep thinking i oughta go see him about something but then i remember hes gone i know how it is harper said soberly you knew he was setting up raid coverage anna said you know who he was talking to about it just those guys over there catwell said the animal guy and that other surfer asshole we know the animal guy anna said hes up in oregon whos the surfer you know you had him on tv the pig guy the guy knocked down by the pig i mustve seen it fifty times catwell said gesturing at the television anna was confused wait a minutehe was the animal guy right steve now catwell was confused no no the other guy he was setting it up with the animal guy the guy who took care of the animals harper and anna looked at each other then anna got down on her knees so she could look catwell squarely in the face youre telling me that the whole thing was set upboth sides that the animal rights raiders and the kid inside the building were all set up by jason sure catwell nodded then looked from anna to harper and back with just a touch of amusement i thought you knew that the whole thing was like a fuckin movie the guy in the building is the guy who left the door unlocked so the animal people could get in anna said shit and stood up catwell continued i dont know if the raider people knew who left the door open cause jase was being pretty quiet about the whole thing i just knew because we were dopin buddies but he sort of went over and told the surfer asshole about the animal up there and the labs and told them he could get them in then he fixed it for the guy inside to leave the door open and for that guy to fight with them it looked pretty real on tvthey were pretty rough so maybe the raider guys didnt know why do you keep calling the surfer guy an asshole harper asked catwell shrugged you know hes one of those fuckin blond shorthair ohwow surfsup pussyhounds with big fuckin white teeth and never had to work in his whole fuckin life he looked at the dead joint again how come guys like him dont get killed anna shrugged way of the world but what about the other kid the one who took care of the animals what about him i dont know hes in theater or something theater i thought he was some kind of science geek catwell shook his head theater is what jason said they talked for a few more minutes but catwell had nothing more he lit up again as they were leaving and harper said you oughta lock the door i will catwell said in the squeaky topofthemouth speech of a man holding his breath soon as i can afford a lock outside on the driveway anna said the whole thing was a setup christ id hate to have that get around screw you with the tv people i dont knowi mean it was good tape so theyd probably use it anyway but it sorta makes us look like chumps what do you think about this kid who set us up i dont know i talked to him for a couple of minutes came onto him a little bit you know just to cheer him up anna said they were walking up the hill toward the street they could hear rock music from one of the frat houses and a man laughing god he seemed real he didnt seem like he seemed like a nerd is what im saying not like somebody whod be out trying to physically intimidate people you said this guy was strong but kind of soft she nodded yeah i just dont see him as being strong but i dont know he could be i mean he completely sucked me in and if hes really in theater he probably is in some kind of shape she thought about it then said lets run him down find out what about clark harper asked what time is it she couldnt see her watch in the dark time to go if were gonna catch him harper said we oughta be there now anna took the cell phone out of her jacket its not clark and now that this kid has come up i think we should concentrate on him ill talk to louis see if he can track the kid down how long will it take i dont know but louis can usually find people hes got all the phone directories and he can get into utility records the utilities have just about everybody except maybe some students and illegals they came to the end of the driveway so why dont we go catch clark while louis looks for the kid she nodded reluctantly it only made sense all right she said wheres the car harper pointed the key down the street and pushed a button and the car flashed its parking lights at them whats his name harper asked as they walked toward it the kid anna shrugged i dont remember the names never stick for more than a day or two strange business batory strange times harper chapter the twofaced man was dressed in a light lycra fulllength windsurfers suit pitchblack from the neckline to the black nike gym shoes with a nylon stocking over his head he was a shadow he moved slowly carefully letting his body feel the way through the dark he had a bum bag wrapped around his ribs a rope wrapped around his waist and the pistol under his arm moving like a snake sliding the last few inches toward the unsuspecting mouse annas house showed a light in a side window but it was the kind of toodim light that people left when they were gonea light in a hallway somewhere not a reading light or a tv light or a work light a waiting light he closed on the back porch hed been there before but this time she wasnt home there was no one inside to hear him unless the cops had set something up unlikely but possible and the possibility added to the intensity of the approach he sat in the shadow of the porch for five minutes listening and he heard voices coming down from above with a little music that he couldnt place old music the kind you hear late at night when youre driving out in the desert people on a porch he thought in the next house he measured the unexcited voices then slowly carefully unhooked the bum bag unzipped it took out the screwdriver and the roll of duct tape he knew from the last time where the lock was he planned to break out the glass again but more carefully hed hold the pieces in place with the tape rather than letting them fall inside but when he got to his knees on the porch he found a piece of plywood covering the window he tested it with the screwdriver the plywood moved huh more pressureand when he pried hard enough he could feel the wood give he dropped the duct tape and worked the screwdriver around the perimeter of the plywood plug after a minute the top and left edges were free he worked on the bottom edge then pushed his hand through the slot and it opened like a little door he stopped to listen again then reached inside he had to stretch to go in all the way to his shoulder but the deadbolt was there and he flipped the handle the door opened easily inside he listened again then pressed the plywood window plug roughly into place he used the penlight to navigate across the kitchen followed the light down the hall around the little office then up the stairs to the bedroom the bedroom smelled of her her perfume or just her body he listened then probed the bedroom went through the chest of drawers through the closets looked at photographs in a grass basket dug through a trunk through a jewelry smelled her perfume dabbed some of it on his throat stretched out on her bed turned his face into her pillow hated her but still loved her too he thought he was still there on the bed when she got back felt a finger of panic then remembered the closet crept into it made himself small in the back with the shoes behind the hanging lengths of the hippie dresses took the gun out placed the long cool length of it against his face heard voices she was with a man the bodyguard hed wait until he was gone and take her end her and if the bodyguard stayed he worked it out take the bodyguard first no warning just step up and do it then her he tried to control his breathing but found it difficult hate sex death darkness the odor of chanel the silken feel of her dresses on his face he waited chapter louis found the kids namecharles mckinley an address was listed in the university directory but when louis called it the phone had been disconnected student louis said to anna we need an address anna said when she got off the phone she said to harper weve got to go after this kid this little stunt he pulled theres something in here a couple of different personalities or something it wont hurt to take a look at clark while were waiting harper said if louis says the kids not in the directory then itll take a while to find him anna shook her head but said i guess harper made sense but the gloom was on her she dreaded the idea of spying on clark harper pulled away from the curb and headed down the hill into the campus silent knowing that she was working through it she stared out the window at the passing landscape and wondered why the idea of surveillance worried her so much she turned the question in her mind until she arrived at the nexus if we get back together ill have to tell him and if i tell him ill be admitting that i thought he might be this killer but only if we get back together and we wont but if we do the thoughts tumbled over each other always running into the paradox we wont but if we do a barefoot man in a ragged winter coat the kind people wore in minnesota stood on the corner by the shell station and held up a cardboard sign handlettered with magic marker will work for drugs he laughed crazily drunkenlyor maybe somebody had dropped some acid on himat the passing cars harper guided the bmw past him wordlessly glancing at anna from time to time thats where the trouble started anna said looking at the gas station as they went by what thats where we picked up the woman who took us into the animal rights thing we were right down there at the medical center maybe the kids up there mckinley harper suggested you want to run in weve still got a little time she thought about it for a second anything seemed preferable to looking for clark sure ill waittake the gun harper said anna ran up to the front of the building while harper idled at the curb the building was locked but she could see a security guard inside she banged on the door and the guard got up reluctantly and walked toward her cracked the door can i help you im trying to find charles mckinley he works up in the animal labs hes not here tonight the guard said talking through the crack hes been off since last week cause of the animal rights thing yup hes been all over the tv he was on the today show even great anna nodded does anybody know where he lives i couldnt tell you if i did know the guard said but i dont anyway got a phone number i dont think so i could look i guess thanks id appreciate it the guard pulled the door closed and went back to his desk rummaged around for a while and came back shaking his head nothing there best thing to do is call tomorrow morning somebody might know buthes a student nothing harper asked hes not there they drove the next two blocks in silence dumped the car in a parking garage and walked toward the music building i hate this anna said she felt like she was plodding through paste wheres he most likely to come out she thought about it and again got caught in the memories playing with clark exploring the building playing every instrument they could find they spent several nights in the place even made love on a library table when neither one of them would back off the dare right out the front she said reluctantly he used to always try to park in the number two parking structure its just down the block so lets find a place to sit harper said he was being stubborn about it he could have offered to break it off to concentrate on the kid he could have accepted annas argument that she knew clark well enough to vouch for him but instead harper moved her along pulling her into it schoenberg hall was a low white building on the south side of a grassy sunken square called dickson plaza anna found a spot on the steps on the north side of the plaza where they could see the main entrance to the building she said i wish i had that joint thatd keep you sharp harper said dropping down beside her i dont need sharp she looked at her watch should be ending ten minutes went by then the door opened and a woman walked out a minute later a couple another minute and a stream of people pushed out of the building chatting and laughing as they headed down the walk lot of people mustve been pretty good anna said no clark if its really his student theyre probably hanging around until everyone leaves talking about it is that fun a good time she let the question hang for a second then said mostly it can be pretty terrible but even when its terrible its kind of fun you know people mess up if theyre your friends you pretend it was nothing if theyre your enemies you tell everybody that you feel sorry for them and you still think its possible that they can recover stab them in the back did you ever mess up sure everyone does but if you do it with confidence keep on counting you can get away with it you can get away with a lot when youre playing alone or with a good group thats part of the fun too a secret that nobody knows except the players never played music harper said cant even whistle everybody can whistle anna said she whistled the first few notes of yankee doodle nope cant do that i can make a noise but she touched his sleeve there he is thats clark clark was walking with a woman who was carrying a cello case and anna said halfjoking but her voice fierce oh christ a cello what harper asked he was whispering though clark and the woman were seventyfive yards away cello players are supposed to be you know sexy all those hours with a big vibrating instrument between their knees hmm yeah its gotta be bullshit why i dont know the other couple walked past still seventyfive or eighty yards away and harper said walk behind mehell recognize your walk if he sees you anna looked after clark and realized that she would recognize him from the back anywhere just by the walk how had harper known that okay they followed clark and the woman around the end of the building and anna said theyre headed for structure two you sure theres nothing else over there unless theyre walking somewhere i cant see them walking far with that cello run and get the car harper said tossing her the keys ill meet you outside the structure and runand keep the goddamn gun handy anna grabbed the keys and turned and ran before he finished the sentence the parking structure theyd used was four hundred yards away and took her a couple of minutes to reach but since it was further from the music building she didnt have to contend with other people getting out of the recital she ran up the stairs to the second level where theyd parked stopped and listened heard a car somewhere in the structure she ran toward the car popping the car door with the automatic key as she came up to the car door she was seized with the fantasy that somebody was looming behind her she saw nothing at all but she climbed frantically into the car and hit the electric lock button the locks snapped down and she twisted looking out the windows nothing nobody her heart was beating so hard she thought she could hear it but a minute later she paid the parking fee and was on her way no other cars in sight harper was waiting at the other structure he flagged her down and she stopped and crawled into the passenger seat as he got in on the drivers side what she asked womans got a dodge van they talked for a couple of more minutes then he headed up to the next floor the van just got out a minute ago she didnt want to ask but did anyway did he kiss her goodnight no harper didnt smile at the question just shook his head christ youre hung up on this guy and i shoulda said yes i dont know what i am i think i might be goofy anna said then when i saw him the first time at the gas station he had a volvo station wagon you remember yeah because its about what id have expected as she said it a darkblue volvo wagon nosed out of the structure then turned left and drove past them here we go clark led them down to wilshire and then to santa monica right on santa monica toward the pacific he lives the other way harper said mmm clark was in a hurry slicing in and out of traffic harper let him get several cars ahead if he sees us running like he is hell watch us harper said i hope he doesnt just bust a light or well be stuck they stayed with him all the way into santa monica into another parking structure harper got in line behind him for a parking ticket as anna slumped in the passenger seat then followed him up the structure continuing on when clark found a space harper took two more turns then pulled in stay behind me again until we know where he is harper said how far are we other side of the structure half a floor lower harper said he may already be going down the stairs they ran to the stairs and harper eased the door open they heard a door bang and harper said shit well have to take a chance come on no ill wait hereyou call me harper nodded and ran down the stairs opened the door then called up hes out here hurry anna ran down to him and followed through the door and suddenly found themselves in santa monica place a threestory shopping center in a crowd of people hes a hundred feet up there harper said anna stepped half out from behind him saw clarks head and shoulders his hair wasthinning she thought but he moved well like hed been taking care of himself he was wearing a tan linen jacket and jeans harper said come on weve got to stay close or well lose him oh jesus jake she clutched at his arm god he cant see me if he does youre with me on a date harper said one of those things aw but she went down past the rows of shops to an escalator and watched as clark headed down go slow anna said they waited until clark was off at the bottom stand behind me harper said hes headed for the food court anna peeking out from behind harpers shoulders saw clark disappear around a corner into the food court lets go harper said and he started walking down the escalator hopped off at the bottom and hurried to the last spot theyd seen clark anna dodged along behind trying to stay in his shadow when they turned the corner clark was gone whered he go jake asked quietly anna scanned the crowd i dont know harper led her to one side he was right here look for the jacket no jacket christ harper turned around where in the hell did he go they couldnt find him he had absolutely vanished finally anna said lets get out of here i dont want him popping up in my face thatd screw us harper nodded all right and do you think he spotted us i dont think so he seemed to be in a big hurry so where the hell did he go into one of the concession stands i dont know i just hope he wasnt watching usi hope he didnt see us i knew we shouldnt have done this harper stopped her anna we should do everything every tiny possibility we oughta give clarks name to the cops and let them check him out no end of story clarks car was still where hed left it we could wait harper said glancing at his watch the shopping center closes in ten minutes theres a space we could watch from anna once reluctant was now curious whered he gone she didnt want to watch him only to know hed walked into the shopping center and disappeared maybe hed gotten inside and started jogging down toward the end or pulled off his jacket and theyd missed him in scanning the crowd maybe hed spotted them and was hiding because he didnt want to meet her face to face lets waitfor a while ill call louis they waited for more than an hour slumped in the car talking in a desultory way louis still hadnt found anything on mckinley after an hour harper called an end to it its after ten lets go on back to your place see if anything turned up all right but goddammit jake were stuck chapter the lights were on in the living room and anna called pam hello but glass had gone got the house all to ourselves my little potato dumpling harper said snagging her around the waist anna twisted in his hands to face him said potato dumpling my ass and he said no definitely not your ass and she stood on her tiptoes to kiss him but now harper was looking past her toward the kitchen and he said whats that in the kitchen his voice carried a chill and anna turned again and looked toward the kitchen she didnt see anything until he said on the floor a stain spread across the floor as though somebody had spilled hot grape jam and left it to coagulate anna caught harpers chill and pulled away and stepped toward the kitchen careful he said catching her and she felt in her jacket pocket for the gun they moved to the edge of the kitchen and anna reached inside and flipped on the light the stain was the size of a large human hand liquid purple blood harper said dont go in we might need crime scene oh jesus look at the window harper looked at the window by the door the plywood plug had been forced in and only partly pushed back in place hes got her anna said she grabbed harpers jacket sleeve hes got her jake he thought she was me gotta call wyatt and gimme the gun harper grunted harper started going through the house opening doors checking everything anna trailing behind as they went anna ran through the phones memory found wyatts home number pushed the call button wyatt answered sleepily what this is anna have you seen pam wyatt was instantly alert picking up the vibration in her voice no what happened we came home expecting to meet her here but she wasnt here but it looks like somebody broke in through the back and theres blood on the kitchen floor oh jesus christ you stay right there stay there and he was gone anna punched in creeks number at the hospital creek was awake but hadnt seen pam whats happening anna anna explained and creek groaned goddammit i cant move im wired in here im gonna get no anna shouted you stay there maybe shell turn up we gotta have somebody there thats where shell come two minutes later a minivan screeched to a stop outside and five seconds after that a second one two plainclothes cops climbed out of each milled for a second then started for the door harper and anna met them on the front porch youre sure its blood the first man asked pretty sure harper said she left here a half hour ago ten minutes after they got back the cop said he looked at anna she was driving your car we figured it was all rightactually we thought it was you another cop was kneeling in the kitchen he sniffed the stain on the floor and looked back at them its blood and theres the window anna said shed gone to the garage door opened it the garage was empty maybe shes okay maybe she went out for something anna said but she didnt believe it she simply wanted someone else to believe harper looked at her and shook his head he didnt get in here one of the other cops said defensively we watched every goddamned car that came in here and the only one that turned down the street was that korean guy he didnt come in a car anna said he took my car and theres no other car out here he snuck in how we were watching people on the street and how in the hell are you gonna sneak around in this place all the houses are jammed assholetoelbow and everybodys nervous about burglars and theres no place to sneak from they were still arguing when wyatt arrived he was wearing suit pants and a jacket over a striped pajama shirt and carried a rumpled dress shirt and tie in his fist he listened for two minutes then said to anna i thought about this on the way over its gotta be somebody on the inside somebody here in venice probably on your street inside gotta be he said he ticked off the points he killed a guy who claimed to be having a romance with you okay that could come from simply following you around but then he came here and he just vanished then he went after your friend creek right down the street and he got away again he went into his house harper said wyatt nodded that would explain a lot harper said anna was thinking furiously god knows there were enough strange and troubled people in venice that was almost a qualification to owning a home there but who so you mean the whole thing was a coincidence harper asked that because it happened on the night my son died and everything else the animal raid and everything we just made it up wyatt nodded its possibleor maybe he was following her that night and something he saw set him off harper said so have your guys check the logs and find out who came out of here after anna they worked through it but anna kept hearing harpers word coincidence none of it felt like coincidence the flow of her life had turned the night of jasons death that felt like the beginning of something to think that it had all started before thenmaybe long before then in the mind of one of her neighborsjust didnt fit didnt feel right she stood up and said to harper im gonna run next door and talk to hobie and jim theyre up on the roof half the time maybe they saw something in fact with everybody here i bet theyre out on the roof now she went out the back door looked up hobie jim you guys up there a second later hobies voice floated down whats going on trouble can you come down be right thereout the back door anna met them in the dark space between their two houses explained what had happened jim whistled and said i heard the garage door go up and down but that was about it hobie said i didnt even hear that i think you were making popcorn jim said im sorry anna jesus i hope the guy doesnt do anything nuts anna turned back to the house as she walked along the canal just before she got to the steps on the back stoop she unconsciously lifted her foot over a heavy formedconcrete flowerpot shed cracked her foot on it thirty times had always sworn to move it someday and suddenly realized it was gone nothing there people were fucking with her house and annas phone rang she took it out of her pocket and was about to click it on then stopped looked at harper its him he wants me to hear her die dont answer harper said urgently he turned to wyatt and said are you still set up on her phone yeah you gotta get this one anna said i think hes calling like he called with china lake maybe jesus they stared at the phone until the tone stopped wyatt began setting up a neighborhood search and at the same time sealing the area off harper took anna aside and said we gotta tell them about clark not yet lets find the kid jake it cant be clark that sounds like wishful thinking whered he go tonight whyd he disappear we dont know that he did we probably just missed him wyatt thinks weve made most of this upjust put stuff together and come up with fantasy thats what weve done with clark i still think lets concentrate on mckinley please she was begging him we dont even know where he is anna harper said in exasperation anna held up a hand got an idea she said i should have thought of this before she took the phone out and scrolled through to the witch and pushed the button the witch answered on the first ring this is anna anna said whatya got a question you know that kid that got in the fight with the animal activists nosebleed and all yeah but talk faster im on a deadline you had him on a couple of talk shows shit he was on today what do you mean a couple talk shows all right all right but the day after the raid you shot extra stuff on him i need his address where he lives and a phone number anna i dont have any time i need the fuckin numbers anna shouted hey listen anna said urgently now quieter get somebody to dig the address and numbers up and ill give you a lead on a story thats better than the jumper a freebie and believe me if you knew what it was youd kill your mother for it im not joking ill feed it to you in the next couple of days after a moment of silence anything to do with china lake anna hesitated then said everything to do with china lake and shes just the start the witch screeched this kid is in the china lake killing no no for christs sake he didnt have anything to do with it thats a different story but ive got an inside thing on china lakea serial killer thing anna said if you get mckinleys address or phone number back to me ill tip you the other story so whats happening with mckinley the witch asked suspiciously hes fucking with me anna said the miserable little shit im gonna crucify him that sounds promising the witch said ill have somebody look around right now anna said this is serious im calling a couple more stations the first one who gives me the address and phone number ill give them the china lake story you know you can be a major pain in the ass yeah but a fairly cheap pain considering what i deliver so call me back hold on just hold on im gonna put the phone down ill be right back anna held on harper said what maybe something anna said the witch was back you got a pencil wyatt nearing panic was sealing venice anna with mckinleys phone number and louis tracking the address told him they were going to look for a kid theyd interviewed the night of jasons murder youve got to stay in touch wyatt said anxiously well call you if we need you if you get one ring then one ring then one ring on your phone you know fifteen seconds apart answer the third one okay anna said and they were gone mckinley lived in a bleak cinderblock apartment in culver city the parking lot was beginning to break up with weeds growing through it in patches harper parked in a handicapped spot and they took an exterior walkway up the concrete corners in the stairwell smelled of urine the walkway had steel railings and wheelless bike frames were chained to the railings in front of half the doors students anna said it was threethirtyseven harper asked yeah the door faced a narrow innercourtyard with a halfdozen concrete picnic tables scattered down its length a halfdozen studentage men sat at one of the tables smoking listening to music on a boom box talking in spanish mckinleys room was dark the door locked cant kick it harper said quietly too many people too much noise lets see if we can find a manager anna said the manager had a firstfloor apartment facing the parking lot a darkeyed woman answered the door spoke to them in a language that anna thought might be farsi then waved her hands in a gesture that said wait went back into the apartment and shouted something returning to the door she made a come in gesture pointed to the back and said another word i think she means somebodys in the bathroom harper said the woman smiled and pointed a finger up batroom yes anna nodded looked aroundand spotted the key board behind the open door the woman was walking toward the back of the apartment again and anna said to harper block me outim gonna see if i can grab a key what theres a key board behind the door harper stepped sideways and anna pushed the door closed a few inches behind it she could see the room numbers under wire pegs most with keys hanging from them then a toilet flushed in the back and the woman called something out to them harper said thank you thank you and anna still eclipsed by his body pushed the door another few inches the peg held two keys can i try for it she muttered shes looking right at us harper said turning to her hold on harper walked toward the woman talking we wanted to talk to one of your renters the woman said something else jabbing her finger at the back anna watched and as harper got close to her with the woman looking up at him he stepped cleanly between them and anna lifted the key dropped it stepped on it stood with her hands crossed in front of her as harper and the woman stood jabbering at each other then a mans voice said hello and both harper and the woman turned toward the back anna stooped and picked the key up and put it in her jacket pocket she stepped away from the door and the key board harper told the manager that he and anna were friends of mckinleys from ucla but werent sure they had the right apartment complex yes yes he is here apartment threethirtyseven the manager said bobbing his head he has been much on the television yes you see him on the television hes a hero yes anna smiling bobbing her head yes a hero outside get the key got it hope they dont notice wed have to be pretty unluckysome of the apartments have two or three keys some dont have any hope the key works hope we dont find a body dont even think it the key worked they stepped inside and anna flipped on the lights hello charles chuck they were in the living room with a tv set a love seat an unmatched easy chair with a missing leg replaced by a paperback novel an adjoining kitchen dining area was off to the right and another door went to the left anna stepped quickly over to the door a bedroom a knot of sheets on a futon but no blankets the place smelled of cool ranch doritos lets get through it quick anna said you look for a rolodex or address book or anything ill just see what hes got got a phone number harper said a minute later its on a refrigerator magnet i think he uses it okay we can get it to louis anna had instinctively gone to the bedroom mckinley didnt have a chest of drawers and had built a group of shelves with bricks and unpainted pine boards tshirts underwear and jeans were stacked on the shelves a small closet held a couple of jackets some oxford cloth shirts two pairs of athletic shoes one pair of wornout loafers and dustbunnies the size of softballs the futon was on a frame she picked up the head end of it looked underneath a shoebox she pulled the shoebox out opened the lid and found a halfdozen videotapes all commercial all pornographic what harper asked sticking his head in the door porno anna said a couple of bondage tapes that might indicate a fantasy thing with capturing people yeah well probably a hundred thousand guys have bondage tapes and not all the tapes are bondage all right but something to keep in mind she put the box back harper said i hate going through a guys stuff like this id hate to have somebody do it to me you have a box of porno tapes no but ive got letters and pictures of old friends nothing that i wouldnt show anyone but i wouldnt want somebody just trashing through it interesting though anna said get to see what people are really like probably why youre good at your job harper said he headed back to the kitchen and a moment later said hes got an answering machine anna had found nothing at all run it back the messages were all routine most of them were from the same woman the last one timestamped at six oclock that evening was male molly said bring some diet pepsi thats all the lees ever drink find a molly anna asked theres an address book harper walked to the kitchen counter picked up a plastic address book with a bank advertisement on the cover he found a molly on the first page with a phone number he checked and it was the same phone number as the one on the refrigerator magnet lets go look anna said whatre we gonna do if we find him harper asked weve already lost the first guy we tried to follow screw it we dont have any time lets brace him ill know the voice louis turned the phone number into a name and address and the address was a small apartment three blocks from the university upscale harper said the apartment had inner and outer doors the inner doors locked but a row of mailboxes showed one m oneill on the second floor anna picked up the house phone and buzzed the apartment a woman answered and anna said is this molly yes my name is anna batory im looking for charles mckinley and i was hoping he might he here just a minute mckinley came down surprised to see her pushed open the inner door so they could go inside howd you find me his voice was a baritone without the gravel of the voice on the phone but the gravel anna thought could be the product of sexual excitement or aggression weve got a really serious problem anna said the kid didnt hear her instead he babbled on his hands jumping around awkwardly nerdlike god you cant believe the tv shows ive been on he said his fair skin was going pink with excitement i had a couple of agents calling me shut up charles anna snapped he stopped what no more bullshit we know you set up the whole show with jason and the animal rights people that the whole thing was a fake mckinley seemed to pull inside himself and the nerd positively disappeared shoot he said then he shrugged and grinned at her and said good run while it lasted harper was off to one side and anna glanced at him he shook his head a quick onesided horizontal move but she read in the shake what she was thinking not this guy you know jasons dead what he was startled and again it seemed real enough what are you studying anna asked suddenly are you in theater or something like that yeah he said thats how i met jason what happened to him christ i was supposed to call him but i couldnt ever get him because he was already dead anna said murdered the same night as the raid we thought you might know something about it what he looked quickly at harper you cant are you the police the copsll be coming around harper said but the guy who did the killing is stalking anna here were trying to get a name and your name came up my name howd my name come up because whoever is stalking anna probably picked her out that nightand the only thing she did that night was the raid and a suicide and i didnt talk to anyone at the suicide anna said well im not doing iti mean ive been in new york new york yeah i was on the today show i didnt get back until this morning thats what were doing tonight were celebrating celebrating what well you know he gestured meaning im a hero theyve had all these animal rights people on and all these other weirdos and so now they decided to get me on ive been on like six shows he was murdered how was he murdered listen your friend molly can you buzz her ask her to come down how many people are up there six no seven ask them to come down mckinley went to the mailbox pushed the call button and molly answered uh molly could you and the guys come down here somethings come up yeah well tell you when you get down right now anna was thinking furiously howd you set us up whose idea was it mckinley shrugged jasons i guess id seen him around and mentioned id gotten a job feeding the animals up there at night and he already knew steve judge with the animal rights group i mentioned feeding the animals and like the next day he was back with this idea so it was you and steve and jason anna said and sarah sarah yeah you know the bee she was the brains of the group steve was basically the jock who carried shit around for them mckinley had a few more details about the raid if you think somebody was stalking you you oughta look at that guard everybody calls him speedy hes a goofy sucker the guard at the medical center yeah the one with the crew cut hes some kind of nazi anna shook her head didnt even see him a stairway door popped open and a woman with deep blue hair stepped into the lobby six more people three women three men all in their early twenties trailed behind whats going on the bluehaired woman asked charles can tell you anna said we have a very serious situation a womans been kidnapped and all we need to know is if charles has been here for a while since eight oclock say they all looked from charles to anna then back to charles and then all simultaneously nodded since seven bluehair said since ten after seven i remember i was putting the roast in lets go anna said to harper outside anna said were running out of time i dont know why he hasnt called back hell be calling lets find the bee maybe she can tell us she was frantic wanted to scream she wanted to run somewhere do something anna this is just like when i was chasing shadows on jacob were finding people but not the guy weve got to stop running long enough to think and when i think about it i think wyatt might be right hes in my neighborhood something like that thats a possibility he keeps coming to your house fuckin with you fucking with my house anna said she looked at her watch hed had pam for at least a couple of hours now the other thing is clark yeah thats the other thing he said chapter clarks apartment was in westwood six blocks from the music building halfway there anna said urgently weve got no time for this no time we should have made time harper said they were halfway to clarks apartment complex and what else can we do i mean we could still call wyatt and have the cops do it no anna fell back in her seat looked out the window if the cops got close to clark theyd tear him apart because clark was oddhe was a composer of classical music probably the least likely job in america and he actually made money at it and he had attitudes that had driven even his friends crazy arrogant conceited charming angry not violent not that shed ever seen when he got angry he got sullen a cool withdrawing anger not a hot platethrowing tantrum hed never tear her house up on the other hand her house wasnt really torn up just the broken window and the guy had to break a window if he wanted to get in the house the destruction wasnt wanton except for the pot what had he done with that pot anna shook her head pushed her glasses back up her nose she was losing it she was five minutes from a confrontation she dreaded as much as anything she could think of and she was worried about a flowerpot jake she grabbed his arm jake we gotta go back to my place now exasperated anna were two minutes away jake forget it we gotta go back why something happened to my flowerpot the pot had been there earlier in the day she didnt remember seeing it but she would have missed it it was simply part of the landscape harper trailed anna through the house past the crimescene cops wyatt was on the telephone said something then put a hand over the receiver find him yeah its not him anna said anything here wyatt shook his head and returned to the phone at the back door anna flipped on the porch light and went out to look at the spot where the pot had been its too big to carry anyplace she said it probably weighs fifty pounds i cant see anything harper said scuffing around in the grass ill get a flashlight anna said she went inside got a flashlight out of a kitchen drawer and went back out the depression where the pot had stood was a clear ring of raw dirt in the grass going down to the canal and two feet toward the canal a lump of dirt that had probably been inside the pot anna pointed the light over the sea wall into the murky canal water the stuff looked like it might have come out of a radiator a funny green with gray depths to it but down there in the water was something something that bobbed up and down up and down something with a round end a head she stepped back shivered turned and went up on the porch hey you guys she yelled you better come out here she thought of pam in the water anchored by the pot swallowed please dont let it be please one of the crimescene cops came to the door what anna pointed the light into the water theres something that shouldnt be here we cant tell what it is the cop walked out on the porch followed by a second one and then wyatt jostling past them anna said somebody moved a big flowerpot and maybe put it over the side i wyatt looked into the water oh christ he said softly the first cop looked down into the water then dropped face down onto the seawall reached into the water couldnt quite touch whatever it is ill have to get in he said ill wreck my suit put in for it wyatt said fuck it the cop peeled off his jacket shirt and pants put his shoes back on and slipped over the side in his underwear cold he said then he reached down into the murk and just as quickly pulled his hand back what is it anna said she could barely breathe not a body he said i dont know wyatt exhaled glanced at anna below the cop reached carefully through the water again then said plastic and lifted the thing came out of the water and anna said kayak we were looking at the end of a kayak harper a goddamned kayak thats how he got in and out wyatt shit hes not from here but somebody must have seen him putting it in up by and anna looked at harper and said steve judge what she grabbed him by the shirt both hands her face six inches from his remember out at the ranch the woman whats her name daly she said steve judge was up in oregon running rivers but he was in oregon harper said whats this wyatt asked anna took a minute to explain and wyatt said gotta check it he lives in pasadena anna said weve got an address she found an address in her book pulled the page and handed it to wyatt long shot wyatt muttered as he hurried back into the house another car arrived out front and as they moved back inside anna called information got the number for the full heart ranch dialed it no answer dialed again still nothing if steves the guy we oughta go out to the ranch anna told harper let the cops do it harper said and its really a long shot what send a deputy who doesnt know whats going on hed get lost out there at night the cops can surround his house in pasadena no problem but if steves the guy and hes up at the ranch hed see them coming a million miles away anna said we know the road we can go out there and park by the gate and walk in anna thats crazy well whatre we gonna do she shouted at him hes got pam hes gonna kill her we cant just hang around here with two hundred cops hes not gonna be here whoever he is harper looked at her and the cops working in the house and all the lights and cars and said ill need a gun we can stop at my place its on the way they took the san diego over the hill moving fast anna said the name of the ranch in oregon was it cut river canyon dont remember that sounds good anna punched in the information number for oregon got an operator i dont show a cut river canyon but i show a cut canyon thats it anna muttered the number to herself as she redialed the phone rang eight times anna muttering cmon cmon and on the ninth ring was answered by an irritated woman who snapped hello yes my name is anna batory from los angeles i talked to someone at the cut canyon ranch who connected me to a man named steven judge are you the woman who connected me yes do you know what time it is steven isnt here anna interrupted maam somebody in los angeles has murdered at least three people in the last week and now has kidnapped a woman and this is somehow tied to me the police say he is stalking me mr judges name has come up a couple of times in the course of the investigation but if he was really up at cut canyon when i called then he cant have anything to do with it there was a long hesitation and then the woman asked are you with the police i can have the office in charge of the l a county serialmurder task force call you in five minutes if you have something to say anna said another pause and this isnt a joke we didnt receive anything like this information before you mean from mr judge yes from steve the stalking i mean he suggested it might be somewhat the other way around thats why we maam im going to have lieutenant wyatt from the santa monica police departmenthes the head of the task force for this series of crimesim going to have him call you in the next five minutes please tell him everything you know how do i know this isnt some kind of of arrangement that hes a policeman if you would like you could call the santa monica police department on your own ill give you the area code you can get the number from informationand they will transfer you to lieutenant wyatt oh god okay ill call santa monica wait five minutes anna said ive got to tell lieutenant wyatt that youll be calling anna gave the woman the area code for santa monica rang off said to harper i think hes the one all right steve judge and punched in the santa monica police department number a woman answered and anna told her that she needed to speak to wyatt immediately and spent a minute filling the woman in she rang off again and harper said ive got a bad feeling about this she said jake i know you do but hes probably in pasadena anyway this is just something that we can cover better than the cops could if the cops even decide to go up to the ranch itll take them three or four hours to get a swat team over there trying to talk to ventura trying to figure out where it is and how to get there theyll have to get maps and all that stuff theres no way pamll get out alive hes nuts hes itching to kill her theres no way theyll even find him until its too late and if he gets out wheres the evidence that he was even there thered be some prints in your car his behavior but that wont get pam out the phone rang in her lap and she picked it up ready to switch it on already hearing wyatts voice when harper swatted it out of her hand no no he said urgently what if its him but there was no second ring then five seconds later it rang again she didnt wait for the third time but said hello wyatt said you were supposed to wait for the third ring no time anna said whats happening where are you were running up to ventura to check on something just in case anna said listen a womans going to call you from a place called cut canyon ranch up in oregon she explained the circumstances and wyatt said you think they did something weird with the call its not weird if youre wired right anna said you just push a button no big deal but if they were faking it then theres a lot better chance that hes the guy all right ill talk to her are you heading for pasadena were on the way but were still getting people together good luck and gimme your number wyatt dictated a number anna rang off and said to harper still getting people together damn damn damn theres no time for that anna sat in the car while harper ran inside his house he was back a minute later carrying a short rifle fumbling with a box of shells gimme anna said you drive ill load you know how i can figure it out just feed them in the bottom theres a release just in front of the trigger guard think its enough gun anna asked looking at the magazine mechanism its an old ruger fortyfour harper said itll do the job they slewed out the end of his driveway jake driving with both hands as anna fed the short fat shells into the rifle the rifle was short with a smooth walnut stock comfortable and then the phone rang once twice three times not wyatt anna passed it to jake who listened said shes not here yeah but she just left it in the car who is this well probably about a half hour im on my way to pick her up okay message from pam do you have a number okay yeah half an hour you know give or take he rang off looked at anna and nodded message from pam that was him yeah no number shoot call wyatt tell him see if they got a record of it anna nodded but asked how long to the ranch do you think he glanced at the car clock then said half an hour maybe got to be a few minutes faster than that anna said he nodded and anna took the phone to call wyatt but as she was about to punch in the number it rang again give it to me harper said anna handed it to him hello hello he shook his head clicked off handed it back check up call he said he was calling to see if the phone was busy to see if we turned right around to call somebody no dummy anna said crazy as a loon but not stupid harper said drive faster anna said she sat with the gun upright the butt of the little gun resting on the seat between her thighs looking out the window most likely a wildgoose chase harper said most likely she said she waited another minute then tapped wyatts phone number in yeah we just got a call from the guy within the last minute or so if youre doing a trace nothings working but ill check he said the woman from oregon called you were set up he was somewhere down here when you called for him all right were building a picture and he fits anna said bettern that i just talked jesus watch out wyatt broke away speaking to somebody else just missed a goddamn truck by about an inch he said talking to anna again listen a woman named daly called about three minutes after the oregon woman wanted to know what was going on she said you screwed them on that animal rights protest and you might be out to frame judge for some reason bullshit yeah i know anyway i asked her when shed last seen him and she said she saw him this morning and i asked if he showed any signs of injury from a fight his cheek anna said remembering the fight in the parking lot exactly wyatt said she said there was something wrong with his cheek and she looked at it and he got madshe said there was a bruise covered with makeup he told her hed been bitten by a cat that he supposedly was trying to pick up goddamn hes the guy anna said he looks good and were getting some people together up in ventura heading out to that ranch well be ready in a couple of hours right anna said she pulled her face back from the phone and started rubbing her hand across the mouthpiece were on the way there now if you dont get something from pasadena anna youre breaking up cant hear you anna said blocking most of what she said with her fingers cant she punched the end button she would not be told at this point to wait for a few hours what harper asked hes the guy anna said but he might not be at the ranch oh hes there anna said hes there all right i can smell him she bared her teeth and harper stared at her for a second then jerked his eyes back to the dark road anna felt like she did on those nights when she and the crew were really operating when everything was turning in their favor like the night of the raid and jacobs leap she was on and she could feel the attraction of the ranch the ranch was pulling her in chapter the night was so deep that it seemed like a piece of black velvet had been folded over the car the only relief came from the darkwalled tunnel carved out by the bmws high beams anna punched louis number into the phone at the same time saying id like to talk to daly i wonder if she knows where judge is she would have told wyatt harper said louis number got no response at all now they wereout of range i thought those fuckin towers were everywhere theyre building one on the hill over my house harper said not everywhere anna said harper slowed at a gravel intersection and they peered up at a road sign right anna said two miles harper didnt hesitate at the ranch gate he passed it by still climbing the gravel road over a rise down the side of a canyon up the rise on the other side around a turn he pulled over against the mountainside killed the engine five tenths of a mile he said five or sixminute jog lets go anna said popping her door theres a flash in the glove box he said his voice was tight edgy better get it give me the rifle anna handed him the ruger and found the flash a black aluminium cylinder about the length and diameter of a fat mans cigar on the road anna found she could cup her fist around the flash and project a needlethin beam of light enough to keep them on the gravel as their eyes adjusted moonlight began to show anna turned looking for the moon and finally below a break in the hillside found it lurking in the trees above them a quartercrescent therell be more light up on top she whispered as they jogged harper grunted then put up a hand touching her chest coming up he said anna slowed felt the slope of the road easing beneath her feet the drive had started up from a short flat stretch they should be close there she said the galvanized gate was a gray shadow in the darker brush around it let me check it she shined the needle of light on the post side of the gate sliding down the metal joint between the hinges nothing all right harper asked just a minute she checked the opening side and found the contact no its alarmed she said harper came up squatted looked at the light anna aimed it at the patch of ceramic insulator set in the post weve got one like it on the farm she whispered theres a magnet in the gate and a needle in the post when you move the gate the needle goes with the magnet and hits a contact and that sets off the buzzer inside cant even climb over nope thatll push the gate down lets look at the fence the barbedwire fence showed a single strand of electric wire running along the top bottom should be okay anna said lets find a low spot where we can squeeze under they found a spot fifty feet down the road the desert brush ripping at their jackets as they slid under the wire anna stood pulling pieces of dead brush from her hair you okay harper whispered yeah lets go they jogged the first couple of hundred feet up the hill but harper was enough out of shape that he caught her arm and told her to slow down impatiently she walked ahead of him urging him along the hill seemed to go on forever gently sinuous always climbing after ten minutes they topped the first rise and saw the orange glow of a yard light harper caught her arm and said stop for a minute weve got to talk they squatted beside the road looking slightly down at the ranch yard the house was ahead and to the right with an open yard further to the right a light showed in what they knew was the office window along with the blue glow of a computer monitor or television another light showed behind that but from the same window adding a slightly warmer glow there was no movement in the window with the light and the light had the stillness of an empty room to the far left of the house they could just see the hulk of the barn between the barn and the house two buildingsa garage anna thought and what must once have been a machine shed a hundred yards behind the house were two long graywhite structures almost too far out to recognize but anna thought that they must once have been chicken coops directly behind the house a hundred feet back the beginning of the corral complex as anna squatted by the road picking out the main features of the ranch she could smell the broken brush beside the road and the dirt beneath their feet like wisconsin on a dry summers night but with the special peppery pungency of the desert dont see your car harper said maybe he ditched it in town wherever he unloaded the kayak but then hed have to transfer pam yeah unless he killed her at your place and left her in the car harper said it thoughtlessly but the image of pam curled in the trunk of the toyota struck anna with a vivid force and she groaned a soft exhalation what god if shes dead lets cross behind the barn check the outbuildings harper whispered thatll give us cover coming up to the house all right they slid to the left staying close to the underbrush as they moved into the opening around the house once away from the driveway the land opened up into sparse pasture dotted with clumps of brush anna used little squirts of light to guide them past the house to the barn around the barn to the back and then crouching with harpers rifle hovering over her head into the barn itself the barn was empty but redolent with the odor of horse manure and hay they checked the ground floor found a range of horsekeeping equipment and stacks of feed supplement on a line of pallets all right harper said machine shed they went out the back of the barn again around the side crept across a short open space to the machine shed knelt by a window listening after a minute anna put her head up peeked through the window could see nothing at all squeezed the flash caught a quick glimpse of red i think its there the car she breathed in harpers ear something red in there jesus they slid to the front corner of the shed like the garage the shed was old probably preworld war ii and the sliding doors hung from rusty overhead tracks harper reached around the corner and gave one of the doors a shove and it moved a few inches he pushed again and got another foot we can get in move slow stay low he said he went around the corner and anna followed watching the window in the house when she was inside the garage harper slowly pushed the garage door back in place anna turned wrapped her fist around the head of the flashlight and turned it on the beam caught the fender of her toyota played down the side thats it she said thats mine she played the beam across the back onto the plates yeah thats mine she said kill the light anna killed the light and they both moved toward the car harper touched a window opened the passenger door slowly carefully felt in front and in the back nothing can you pop the trunk yeah well have to go around anna scuttled around the car felt up the door to the window the window was down three or four inches enough to get her arm through the gap she stretched into the car trying to reach the dome light whatre you doing harper whispered if you open this door an inch the light comes on anna said im trying to shut it off she fumbled with the switch said i think thats it and tried the door no light the trunkopener lever was just in front of the seat and she pulled it heard the trunk pop and crawled behind the car harper was pushing the trunk lid up and anna shone the flash into it the trunk was empty but harper ran his fingers the width of it once twice then stopped pressed and lifted his fingers toward anna they were black in the light he pulled them back sniffed and he said blood not much so she probably was alive when he took her out of here how do you know why take her out if shes dead anna nodded and crawled toward a window facing the house so hes here now what i was afraid whats that anna looked to the right saw the splash of light off the brush beside the house car coming up the hill she said anna heard the slide of the rifle as harper jacked a shell into the chamber she fumbled the pistol from her pocket as the lights grew brighter on the trees ten seconds later a pickup pulled into the yard and a woman hopped out and stormed toward the porch they could see her face when she first opened the truck door and her figure as she hurried under the yard light to the porch thats daly harper said jeez do you think she knows anna asked she looks mad about something the woman fumbled at the door unlocking it then pushed inside and flicked on a light she slammed the door behind her but before she did they heard her shout steve wonder what happened harper asked i dont know but if hes still in the house and we want to move up this is the time if hes in there it sounds like hell have his hands full anna said they crawled back out through the garage door circled back around the barn into the darkness of the brush and came up behind the house near the corrals an animal made a spitting sound as they passed what the hell was that harper whispered i dont know i hope it doesnt bite they stopped at the side of the corral and looked across the intervening fifty feet at the house gonna have to decide something harper said whatevers in the corral probably the llama i dont think theyre dangerous anna said im gonna roll through there and work my way up to the gate if i dont see anything im gonna make a run across the yardyou get ready with the rifle maybe i oughta make the ran no youve got the rifle ive just got this thing anna said holding up the pistol at fifty feet i might not be able to hit the house as she said it she slipped under the lowest rail of the corral whatever was in the corral stayed at the back she could here it stomping nervously maybe the llama maybe a pony as she moved to the gate taking a breath she glanced back at the spot where shed left jake and stuck one leg through the gate baaaaazzzzzzzz the buzzer sounded like the end of the world as loud as a jet plane fifteen feet overhead in a halfsecond she knew exactly what had happened the gate was alarmed just like the gate at the bottom of the hill a light beam or movement sensor was probably buried in the gatepost out beyond the gate itself so an animal inside the corral couldnt set it offbut shed put her leg right through it shed been so occupied with the thought of closing on the house that she hadnt thought to look and she didnt stop to think when the buzzer went instead she scrambled sideways across the corral to the far corner holding tight to the pistol the buzzing went on for three or four seconds and then just as abruptly stopped for another twenty seconds nothing moved inside the house and anna watching the back door began to relax anna jakes stage whisper cut through the dead silence she turned her head to answer when the back door banged open and what looked like a drank staggered onto the back porch twisting turning in the dim light anna the voice she knew it this time anna i know youre out there anna straining toward the turning figure finally made it out not one person but two a man with his arm around a womans neck the woman struggling against him and when her struggles became too violent he would lever her off the ground until she stopped anna judge was screaming her name anna said nothing maybe hed decide that an animal had set off the alarm maybe hed come out where they could get at him but at the moment the womans body blocked any possibility of a shot are you out there i know youre out there the straggle on the porch started again and anna lifted the pistol and aimed it took it down again no way anna he was bawling into the night then you think im fucking around think again huh think again anna he moved back toward the door reached inside and clicked on a yellow porch light i know youre out there you like to make movies make a movie of this he suddenly kicked the straggling womans legs from beneath her and she went down at the same moment he let go of his grip on her neck she landed on one thigh and her hand twisted head down the man pointed his hand at her head and there was a sudden crack and an arrow of flame and the woman flattened shot in the head anna not thinking only reacting thrust her pistol at the door and fired and a halfsecond later jake opened up but the man was already back through the door anna though was rolling under the bottom bar of the corral on her feet running at the porch firing a second time at the dark rectangle of the open door in the back of her head she could hear jake screaming anna anna no anna but at the same instant she was through the door to her left the back of the man turning to look at her just as he went through an internal doorway steve judge but strangely different than the animal rights raider she remembered he seemed older thinner harsher wilder with a long black pistol in one hand but he was reeling away from the gunfire and in the halfsecond he was visible to anna she managed to get the gun down and fire another shot wildly but in his direction he screamed then a second later fired back the bullet burying itself in the wall to annas left belatedly she went down now holding the pistol out in front of her and from behind harper was suddenly there with the rifle he knelt beside her and she saw that he was feeding fresh shells into the magazine hes through there anna said in a harsh whisper hes running lets take him for christs sake rush him in a dark house hed take both of us we gotta no what we gotta do is look at the woman on the porch anna turned her head jeezi thought she was dead he shot her in the head i didnt have time to look but lots of times people dont die keep the gun on the door anna said ill go look is he still inside i didnt hear the front door go i think so harper braced the rifle against the wall as anna slithered toward the door just before she got to the doorstep judge screamed from the front anna im gonna cut your friends belly open you wanna hear it anna stopped glanced at harper harper shrugged got halfway to his feet and whispered yell something at him a threat anything anna screamed you motherfucker if you hurt pam ill cut your balls off i promise ill cut your balls as she screamed harper pushed to his feet did a quick tiptoe across the door hesitated just an instant at the far door where anna had last seen judge he looked back then burst through the door out of sight anna was four steps behind him but the dark room ahead was suddenly lit by a half dozen muzzle blasts the crashing of furniture harper screaming another shot and the banging of the front door then anna was through into the dark chaos of the office pushing the gun in front of her moving and stumbling over a body christ harper you hurt yeah im shot in the hip he groaned not bad but it hurts like a sonofabitch where is he outside yeah i heard the door hes gone how about pam i dont know i dont know if he had her i believed him well if he had her he didnt take her with him because he went out of here in a hurry christ we were six feet apart i just couldnt get the gun around there was light coming into the room from the back from the room theyd just rushed through anna said move around into the light stay behind the desk i gotta look and see how bad it is and at that moment someone groaned from the other side of the room the groan was hurt enough harsh enough that the hair stood up on annas harper whispered pam anna groped in her pocket and found the flashlight had stayed with her through the wild scramble across the yard and into the house she wrapped her fist around it and shot the needle of light across the room she passed over glasss body the first time then wondered about the shadow in the corner and came back to it yes a body not a shadow anna left harper creeping across the office carpet got to glass rolled her couldnt see put her head close to the other womans ear and said pamthis is anna how bad are you glass muttered something unintelligible anna looked around trying to think what to do had to get her to some light finally afraid that she might be hurting her worse she tugged and pulled glass across the carpet glass remained inert sometimes mumbling to herself how bad harper whispered i dont know we need light pull that desk around anna managed to move one of the desks enough to provide cover from the only window that judge could see through and turned on a light pam glass had been terribly beaten her nose was broken her teeth were broken one cheekbone was wrong her lips were twice as big as they should be and the color of fresh liver aw jesus anna said but she could do nothing about it let me look at your hip she said to harper harper rolled showed her a bullet hole passing through his jeans in his thigh just below his butt there was no exit wound not much blood she whispered yeah i dont think its too bad but jesus my leg just doesnt want to work he said im gonna go look at daly can you cover me and for just a tiny sliver of a second she thought how odd it was to be using the language of television cop shows cover me what did she know about cover ill go out on the porch yeah turn off the light first and we gotta try the phones daly first anna hit the light waited for a second then went through the door on her stomach while harper sat in the door scanning the dark ready to fire at any sign of a muzzle blast but the woman was dead anna knew it the moment that she touched her she was already going cold and had the peculiar stillness of those whod gone on but she grabbed the womans shirt and pulled her back through the door alive harper whispered as they pulled back no i dont think so anna slumped against a wall and harper touched the woman no shes gone lets get back to pam lets get the phone glasss breath was short harsh irregular as anna knelt over her she blew a blood bubble which burst on her bloodcrusted lips anna said shes in trouble jake weve got to get her to a hospital harper was already crawling across the office he groped on top of the desk found a phone pulled it down listened said shit what dead he mustve pulled wires somewhere probably outside the house weve got to get her out of here anna said urgently we cant wait jakei think shes dying chapter they sat for a moment huddled over glass watching her breathe thinking anna asked finally can you walk i dont know harper looked around found a blind spot where he couldnt be seen pushed himself up on the wall tested the leg and nearly collapsed maybebut not very far i could hop pretty fast forget it anna said then heres what we do weve got to get him talking to us anything just get him talking then well know about where he is which side of the house then ill sneak out the other side with your car keys once im away from the house in the dark hell never find me and he doesnt know where your car is once im in the car ill come crashing up hereill get as close to the back porch as i can without wrecking it thats five feet youll have to cross can you carry pam that far anna he was staring at her unhappy anna i can carry her but jesus thats crazy can you think of anything else he looked down at the linoleum thinking a few seconds later he said if we can figure out where the phone goes out and where he is if theyre different i might be able to patch the wires do you know anything about telephones no but if hes just cut the wires i dont know if you can just put them back together anna said even if we find out where he is and you can get out he could move if youre just lying out there on the ground messing with wires youd be dead if i ran it doesnt matter what he does once im out of here he cant catch me christ he ran his hand through his hair moved groaned and if we mess with the wires and the phones still dont work well have lost the timeand we dont have any time she touched pam looking across her at harper harper broke his eyes away for a moment then shook his head grinned put his hand on top of her head and mussed her hair dont worry about wrecking the car he said fuck the car put it right on the porch okay let me get my back against the wall with pam if he tries to come in ill light the motherfucker up anna nodded grinned back at him squeezed his good leg its the only way lets see if we can get him talking anna started crawling to a window on the back of the house knocking it out with a chair the shattering of the glass should attract his attention if he was still out there she sat on her heels like a dog baying at the moon and shouted steve what do you want what do you want nothing jake had moved to the hallway between the back room and the office he called softly nothing here steve anna shouted where are you what do you want are you still there the voice not far away im still here and a second later a shot not the pistol any more a loud crack and plaster flew from the wall overhead shit harper yelped hes got a rifle a big one always gotta be killing something around here putting them out of their misery the voice shouted he was over toward the garage or maybe the barn anna thought what do you want i want you dead the voice answered but i want to mess with you for a while another shot this time into the office anna crawled past harper who said weve gotta get better protection sooner of later hell think about shooting lower onto the floor and then were in trouble those goddamn slugs are going halfway through the house maybe all the way anna said okay and crawled into the office the desks were wooden not much help there was another door off to the left and she went that way what do you think now about messing with my head what do you think now judge screamed still from the direction of the garage we werent messing with you harper shouted back how were we messing with you youre always messing with me all of you judge screamed back anna crawled through the door and found herself in the bathroomand in the corner was a castiron bathtub just what you might hope for in an old ranch house she crawled back through the office jaketheres a big old iron tub in the bathroom thatd help harper said lets see if we can move her judge was still screaming at them all the time all my life you fuckers lets see what you think about it now ive got the big gun what the hell is he talking about harper panted he trailed his leg behind him as they moved glass across the office floor and into the bathroom wincing every time he had to pull his leg forward i dont know anna said hes nuts let me do this harper said he was on one knee beside glass and picked her up gently and lifted her over the side of the tub she opened one eye and said car shes awake harper grunted were trying to get you out of here anna said she crawled to the door and shouted at judge the cops are coming if you get out of here now maybe youve got a chance if the cops were coming they would have been here judge screamed back if i take you down i walk ill drag you out in the desert somewhere with a shovel anna turned away said to harper im going out the side of the back room and harper said goddamn anna anna yell something at him harper pushed himself up from behind the bathtub and as anna crawled down the hall to the back room shouted shut the fuck up you fuckin moron crack a slug pounded through the side wall of the back room but much lower this time anna was sprayed with splinters of lath and plaster the bullet missed by three feet anna yeah im okay the windows on the side of the back room were doublehung with slide latches she turned the latch on the first one struggled to lift the window got it up there was a screen on the outside with hooks inside she unhooked it and pushed it open harper was shouting the women are both still alive in here if you stop now youll just go to treatment crack something wooden exploded in the office is he in the same place anna called back to harper i think so came from the same direction im gone anna boosted herself over the window ledge and dropped to the ground there was a stretch of open yard in front of her before she got into the brush she took a breath and sprinted across it keeping the house between her and the spot they thought judge might be she passed a bush slowed turned dropped to her belly light poured from the house and she could hear harper yelling but could not make out what he was saying and she heard judge shouting back from the other side she had the gun and she thought if i take him now but if she tried and lost shed be dead and so would harper and glass she moved back a bit into the brush turned on the flashlight and let the needle of light lead her toward the driveway the moon was higher now and if she didnt look straight at it she could see that lighter strip that marked the rut coming up from the road she turned off the flashlight better to let her eyes adjust a minute passed and another as she patiently moved toward the track she couldnt afford to blunder into a tree or twist an ankle then judge spoke hey close by the hair rose on her neck he was not within an arms length but within fifty feet she thought she couldnt hear him breathing but she could hear the snap of twigs beneath his feet he said it again hey the gun was in her jacket pocket she slumped onto the ground eased her jacket up over her face in the dark with her dark hair if she could keep her face covered shed be nearly invisible she used to play war with her brothers running around the house on a summers night with guns made out of splintered boards if you were dressed right you could hide in a radish patch no radishes up here then a thump and the sound of a mans feet pounding on the hard earth running sprinting but just a few feet again close byto the right twenty feet did the shadow move she pointed the pistol at the shadow the shadow was gray man shaped was it moving it seemed to be moving toward her hey anna not the shadow judge screamed at the house and now he was off to her left coming up on the window shed crawled through would he step into the yard how long a shot would it be and she thought time but if she could take him out she pivoted on her spot waiting then crack and she saw the muzzle flash from the rifle seventyfive feet away back in the brush jude was apparently moving around the house if she moved on him while he was sitting still hed hear her there was too much dry brush she bit her lip thinking then turned down the road the ground was rising beneath her and she felt vulnerable slinking along was he right there behind her then the road began to fall she stopped drew back into the brush and looked back toward the farmhouse nothing moving nothing crack she didnt see the flash but it sounded as though it came from the back the way judge had been going anna started down the slope in a hurry and when the yard light dropped out of sight she turned the flashlight on again gave it full play out in front and ran down the hill never in her life had her legs seemed shorter the distances longer twice she thought she saw the gate ahead and passed the spot with no gate in sight the third time it was the gate what about the alarm no help for it shed have to trip it to get the car in anyway to save time she pulled the gate open as she went through then turned and ran up the dark road toward the car she was breathing hard when she got to it fumbled for the key found it pushed the unlock button when she was still fifty feet downhill the taillights blinked and the interior lights came on and a few seconds later she was cranking the engine over lights on going back up the hill yes the lights might push judge back might confuse him get him running they wouldnt have long she swung through the gate and started up the dark lane scanning the sides of the road had to keep moving fast if he was planning to ambush her along the way he might be only five feet from the car when she passed she kept her foot down and the car bounded up the ruts throwing her around in the seat no seat belt she might not have time to get it off at the top of the rise she hit the high beams caught the ranchhouse full in her headlights no sign of judge nothing moving except herself in the car and the car was moving fasttoo fast she skidded around the side of the ranch straightened it out spotted the back porch hammered the car right to the edge of the porch flicked open the door jake she screamed jake nobody there she leaned out the door to scream again and saved herself crack and the passenger side window exploded showering her with splinters of glass crack the back window went out the gunfire was coming from out in the darkness back toward the buildings she thought might have been chicken houses she jammed the car into park and threw herself across the porch through the door into the house crawled frantically to the bathroom harper was there groaning bleeding hit me he moaned got me from the side and he looked at her ah jesus what happened to you youre bleeding anna halfrose to look in the mirror she had several small cuts on her face apparently from the window glass as soon as she saw them they started to burn but they werent bad she thought she dropped back down to harper let me see where youre hit let me see he rolled to show her the slug had hit him in the pelvic bone and angled down to come out the inside of his thigh a purple stream of blood flowed from the lower part of the wound which hed partially stopped with a sock lord anna dug into her coat found the hermиs scarf she kept stuffed in the inside pocket flipped it into a coil and bound the sock to the wound fuckin killin me harper said crack apparent miss we got to find some way out anna said frantically the car is right outside the door but hes shooting it to pieces i dont know if i could make it out anyway harper moaned do you think you could ran for it i can probably hold him off a while longer he just got me with a lucky shot if you could run to someplace where the phone would work god anna trying to think she looked over the rim of the tub at glass who now had both eyes open glass recognized her tried to speak her broken lips working but nothing came out crack another miss how do you miss a house let me go look at the car she said to harper and she scrambled back out into the hallway through the back room the car was still there engine running crack missed again she frowned wondering what he was doing he wasnt shooting at the car she looked back toward the room where harper was hidden decided shed have to go if he could hold them off for ten minutes like he said she might be able to get back she decided and scrambled back to tell harper crackand the house lights went all at once coming for ya now anna the voice screamed come on in anna shouted back the cops will be here in five minutes and then were gonna kill you you hear that in five minutes youre gonna die think about it steviefive minutes no more steve just a piece of trash theyre gonna throw in a hole and nobodyll care not even your parents your parentsll be embarrassed to be related to you crack thats right piss him off harper said and she could hear the grin in his voice and that pissed her off she was bleeding herself she had the blood of two people dying on her hands and one of those persons was trying to laugh goddamn you jake she hissed what keep your mouth shut no matter what you hear keep your mouth shut and stay here dont move dont come to help me okay number two you shoot the next thing that comes through the bathroom door if i decide to come through ill tell you otherwise just shoot it down whatre you going to do im gonna kill this sonofabitch how i dont know she said her voice deadly but im going to she moved out of the bathroom into the office groping her way in the dark she could hear the car engine running in the backgroundand then suddenly it stopped and the voice i killed the guy didnt i get the fuck away from here anna screamed get away from me he wasnt coming inhe was staying outside and the next time he spoke his voice came through a window in the back i dont see anybody i dont see anyone then from another window maybe the bathroom window where is everybody everybody else dead anna pushed further into the office room found shelter behind a desk couldnt see much when it came to it she thought it might be whoever saw the other person first fiftyfifty but he knewthe place and she didnt and now he was around in front hey anna come on out get away from here she screamed the cops are coming you were trying to run away from me werent you you went down and got the car and you were all gonna run out of here but something happened and i know what it was i hit the guy i killed him hes dead isnt he this is a thirtyoughtsix makes a big hole his voice was working around to the side now coming through a shotout window behind her she needed a set a movie set and a scene im coming in anna im coming in bet you cant guess where she moved to a corner of the room pulled her knees up to her chin she called softly jake can you hear me jake can you hear me are you there hes not there the voice said jakes dead hes a dead motherfucker anna what do you want from me what do you want tell me she screamed all i wanted was the goddamn time of day but you couldnt even give me the time of day youd fuck all those other people but you wouldnt even talk to me and you were like you were perfect you and me wouldve been perfect but you wouldnt even talk i didnt even know you anna shouted his voice came from a different window pitched lower i wanted to talk at the raid you saw me at the raid i was leading the raid but you wouldnt even talk to me then pause then the voice from another window you saw me lead it you wouldnt even talk to the leader i set the whole fucking thing upafter that night at the club when i first saw you so you could judge me in action and you wouldnt even talk you just made fun of me with that pig which is dead by the way i cut that pigs throat god it bled it bled about a gallon he was circling the house speaking from one window then the next then skipping a window from the back now i was really disappointed he said and then at that golf place when id set everything up just you and me and you did it again you humiliated meyou humiliated me what made you think you could get away with that and now youre going to pay anna just like that pig anna whispered harshly jake you gotta help me jake i lost my glasses jake i cant see wheres the gun jake she heard him coming she took her glasses off and put them in her pocket and the world around her went soft she pulled her knees up tight to her face hunched her shoulders pulled herself further back into the darkest corner of the room heard his footfalls go away she cried just go away havent you done enough no now he was inside close but she still couldnt see him she tried to pull back even further pull her knees higher go away she moaned please just let me alone look at me anna ive got a gun i cant see she cried i cant see anything my glasses a brilliant light cut across her face just for an instant and was gone aw little girl cant see go away he was coming in now like a rat to a cheese she was holding her breath waiting for a blow the wait unbearable here i am anna he was right there on his hands and knees only six feet away she could see his face in a fuzzy way the blond hair the square chin the eyes a little too close together he had the pistol in one hand the muzzle pointing roughly toward her face the butt of the rifle was on the floor and he was leaning on it were gonna have some fun we could have had some fun for a long time if youd come away from your bodyguard in that parking lot but you had to do this the tip of the barrel touched one cheek which seemed to be turning black do what she whimpered fuckin bite me he said he moved closer his hand still at the cheek so its payback time anna steve is gonna have lots of fun close enough have fun with this anna said and the way she said it startled him she could see well enough to identify the flinch the sudden clutching fear and then she opened her knees the pistol was there of course between her thighs and pointing at the middle of his throat he had just enough time to say dont anna shot him and sat for three full seconds in dazed blinded silence steve judge slumped in front of her he hadnt jerked back or been thrown back hed simply gone straight down she fumbled her glasses out of her pocket pushed them back on her nose tried to stand up jake she called weakly anna he was close she took the flash from her pocket and shined it back toward the bathroom harper was propped in the doorway the rifle in his hand a long trail of blood behind him his face as pale as parchment i killed him anna said at that moment judge stood up his eyes were crazy and half of his neck seemed to be missing but he had one hand clasped to the wound and he pushed up and pivoted toward her his eyes crazy his mouth open the white teeth straining at her anna stepped back thrust the pistol out and fired into his chest from six inches one two three and judge went down again harper behind her was shouting no more anna but anna stepped over judge and fired two more shots into his head this time he didnt move asshole anna snarled she was still pulling the trigger the clicks echoing in the suddenly silent shambles anna carried pam to harpers car brushed glass fragments off the seat and put her down harper was too heavy he crawled dazed to the porch and anna turned the halfwrecked vehicle around until she could get him in the passenger side and wedge the door closed something was wrong with the door but it seemed to hold her scalp was bleeding badly every time she put her right hand to her ear it came away with a palm full of blood she pointed the car down the drive and took it out as easily as she could theyd come in and out the same way each time and that was the way she knew there might have been a faster way to get an ambulance out to them but she didnt have time to look she tried the phone after five minutes no connection she tried again at seven or eight minutes without luck at ten minutes she got my god everybodys shot she babbled as she guided the car to the side of the road she knew about where she was gave enough direction that an ambulance could find them she called wyatt told him he was still shouting questions when she dropped the phone chapter anna batory was waiting at the dock when they came in on the lost dog creek and glass with another couple a pair of gay and ferociously competitive endodontists creek cut the outboard when they were fifty feet from the berth reached over the side released the transom lock and pulled the motor out of the water the boats momentum carried it gracefully on and then creek pushed the tiller over and it turned slowed slowed more and glass stepped over the rail onto the finger pier dropped the bow line over a cleat and snubbed the boat off anna stood up brushed off her butt howd it go glass was bubbling it was amazing these things there was a boat i mean spit it out creek laughed some of those boats were as big as locomotives and they were this close glass said spreading her hands a foot apart one guy got hit in a turn and he called this other guy an asshole and theyre gonna fight when they get back the beating barely showed on her anymore when shed gone into the hospital the doctors were afraid that her brain had been permanently damaged as it was shed been almost herself in a week and out of the hospital in two at four weeks the bruising had faded and the cuts were healed she looked like somebody had scrubbed parts of her face with a brillo pad and her nose wasnt as straight as it once had been but she no longer looked like she might die she still had headaches though the doctors said they might continue for a while maybe a long while on the other hand they might stop any day now or something like that creek a month later was almost as good as new was beginning to talk about the whole episode as a myth that might have happened to someone else as a good story to be embroidered upon on slow nights in the truck anna was the only one who still hurt the cuts on her face had all been minor the cut in her scalp had been deeper and had done something to the hair follicles a thin knifeedge line of hair was growing out white the doctors said it would probably never be black again but it might or something but her main problem was harper after shed shot judge shed turned and in the light of judges flash had seen harper crawling toward her trying to help her answering her cries for help when it had turned out that anna had been mousetrapping judgewhen shed emptied the pistol into judges headsomething had changed he loved her he said but he wasnt coming around she could feel him avoiding her she pushed tried to talk and only once got him going after a twomartini dinner and he talked about her face when shed fired the last shots into judge anna realized that she frightened him she didnt want to but she did the endodontists helped clean up the boat and said goodbye are we going for beer anna asked glass god i hope so my throat is full of dust whens he gonna let you drive anna asked mmm ive got no definite commitment but im thinking to myself probably in the beer can races next week behind her creek rolled his eyes and glass said creek what i felt your eyes rolling aw jesus christ creek said they went down the street to a diner and found another two dozen racers around the bar and in the dining room anna ordered a cheeseburger and a diet coke creek and glass got beers after a while creek and anna began talking about the next night they would be back on the street in twentyfour hours what we gotta start doing is we gotta start looking for more feature stuff theres no good reason we couldnt set up a feature every day just to get the cameras rolling creek said oh bullshit creek you know that half the time we cant sell cause we havent been concentrating on the angles you gotta have the right angle on this kind of thing i think somebodys calling me glass said after a while she picked up her second beer and headed for another table of boat racers was greeted with a chorus of heys she gets along with them anna said watching her because shes a macho freak creek said you oughta see her out there on the foredeck shes like a machine with the pole going endforend she never loses track shes gonna be a good spinnaker guy what does she think about your gay endodontist pals ah she was sort of suspicious you know shes sort of a phobe but those guys are so fuckin mean that she couldnt help liking them creek laughed and looked so basically happy that anna laughed with him and said god creek youre gonna start checking out strollers next thing nah he said looking after glass then he turned back to anna and dropped his voice whats with jake aw man anna said the smile died on her face no tears but her chin trembled and she pushed her glasses up her nose its just god i dont know you still in love with him i dont even know if i ever was she said i could have been i think but we never had a chance aw hell straighten out he took a pull at his corona but his eyes never left annas she shook her head you know what creek hes not coming back hes just not im sorry anna man theres only been two guys in my whole life that i ever felt quite like that about she said she tried a smile at least i know i can still feel like that about a guy mmm creek looked away out the window at the marina and the forest of masts waiting for the sea later that night with glass asleep in his bed creek sat in his cluttered living room reading sherlock holmes and the red demon he turned the last page sighed put the book down and his feet up thought about a beer rejected the thought finally got a sweatshirt let himself out quietly not to disturb glass he took his ford pickup out of the marina caught the san diego for a couple of stops exited on wilshire loafed down past ucla the apartment complex was just past westwood one of the glittering glass towers on the south side of the street the night crew knew most of the bigger complexesrich people died in them on a regular basis but even if he hadnt known where it was through the night crew he would have gone directly to it anyway hed cruise the place a dozen times in the past week unable to make himself stop this time he did stop walked across the parking structure in the crisp night air apartment the place had double doors and just inside a row of brass mailboxes he found looked at it for a long ten seconds shook his head pressed the buzzer five seconds later a mans voice baritone not unlike judges voice who is it my names creek he said is this clark yes ive come to see you about a woman creek said
