chapter one she wasnt sure why she was doing it diana studied the cloud formations spreading beneath her and tried to reason out if the trip she was making had been impulse on her part or calculated though she was scheduled to land in less than thirty minutes she still wasnt certain it had been nearly twenty years since shed last seen her brother when diana thought of him she thought of him as a remote exciting casually affectionate teenager diana had loved him with all the singleminded intensity that a sixyearold girl can have for a sixteenyearold boy her image of him was frozen in the past a dark rangy youth with sharp good looks and cool green eyes she remembered an arrogant sort of pride and selfsufficiency hed been a loner even at six diana had understood that justin blade had gone his own way with a mild humourless smile she leaned back in the soft comfort of her firstclass seat justin had certainly gone his own way twenty years before when their parents had died he had comforted her diana supposed but shed been too bewildered to understand she had thought her parents had left because shed made a fuss about going to school if she behaved and was quiet and attentive in class her parents would come back then aunt adelaide had come and justin had gone for months she had thought hed gone to heaven too tired of her tears and questions her aunt had taken her east to a different world a different life not once in the span of two decades had justin contacted her so now hes married diana mused perhaps because she still saw him as an intense rather brooding teenager she couldnt picture justin as a husband serena macgregor diana ran the name over in her mind odd that she should find herself with a sisterinlaw when she barely felt that she had a brother oh she knew of the hyannis port macgregors aunt adelaide wouldnt have considered dianas education complete if she hadnt been made aware of the background of one of the countrys leading families particularly when they lived close enough to boston to be considered neighbours after all monied dynasties were the only royalty america claimed daniel macgregor was the patriarch a fullblooded scot and financial wizard anna macgregor his wife was a highly respected surgeon alan the oldest son was a united states senator earmarked for bigger things caine macgregor here diana stopped her mental list though he was barely thirty shed heard his name bandied about the hallowed halls of harvard law school both she and caine had chosen law and shed slaved over the books studied under the same professors and walked the same corridors at length shed passed the same bar hed graduated the year before shed entered and had already begun what looked to be a brilliant career once when diana had been a freshman shed overheard two female upperclassmen talking about caine macgregor and she remembered with a smirk they hadnt been discussing his mind obviously the inestimable macgregor hadnt spent all his time sweating over his books then there was serena from all accounts she was brilliant it seemed to be in the macgregor genes shed graduated from smith with honours diana recalled then had spent the next few years collecting degrees she seemed an odd match for the justin blade diana remembered for a moment diana considered whether she would have attended their wedding if shed been in the country yes she decided she would have been too curious not to after all it was primarily curiosity that had her travelling to atlantic city now then again she thought ruefully it would have been difficult to refuse the invitation serena had sent her without being childishly rude if there were two things aunt adelaide had taught her they were never to be childish or rude at least not to those considered your peers diana pushed her aunts quaint double standards to the back of her mind and unfolded serenas letter dear diana i was terribly disappointed that you were in paris last fall and unable to attend the wedding id often requested a sister but my parents wouldnt oblige me now that i have one its frustrating not to be able to enjoy her justin speaks of you but its not the same as meeting you face to face especially since his memories are of a little girl after all these years i can think of nothing hed like better than to meet the woman youve become taking a page out of his book im sending you an airline ticket please use it and be our guest at the comanche for as long as you like you and justin have a lifetime to catch up on and i have a sister to meet rena diana arched a brow as she refolded the letter warm open friendly she mused not the sort of woman she would have paired up with justin with a quiet laugh diana leaned back she didnt even know a man named justin blade if there was a part of her that longed to know him shed buried it long ago shed had to in order to survive in her aunts world even now if her aunt were to discover she was planning on spending time with justin at a gambling hotel the woman would be horrified and diana added the lecture on where and with whom a lady is seen would begin she gave her attention to the clouds again it hardly mattered she mused she would meet her brother and his wife satisfy her curiosity then leave the little girl who had idolized unquestioningly didnt exist any longer she had her own life her own career theyd both been stagnant for too long it was a new year diana reminded herself the perfect time for beginnings she probably wont show caine thought as he walked toward the terminal since diana blade hadnt responded to serenas letter he didnt understand why his sister was so certain shed be on the plane he was less certain why he had allowed himself to be drafted as chauffeur rena would have come if things hadnt gotten so busy at the hotel he reminded himself and since the hell theyd been through only a few months before caine found himself willing to indulge his sisters whims otherwise he mused hed be spending his week off skiing in colourado instead of walking a northern beach in january a gust of wind blew down the collar of his coat as he reached for the door at the terminal entrance a blonde wrapped in red fox passed through pausing long enough to run her gaze up caines body and over his face before her eyes met his caine took the brief speculative look with a halfamused smile and waited for her to move by he had a lean somewhat pale face with sharp strong bones offset by eyes that edged toward violet at a casual glance he might be deemed a scholar a longer one might reveal the recklessness that was far removed from academia because he was hatless the wind tossed his burnished gold hair around his face the smile added charm to what were intense almost wolfish features he was a man aware of his looks and comfortable with them caine moved through the terminal in a quick rangy stride looking neither right nor left hed spent enough time in airports to ignore the sounds and crowds with a brief glance at the monitor he checked the gate for the incoming flight from boston then settled down to wait for a woman he didnt expect when the arrival was announced caine sat back in the black plastic chair and lit a cigarette hed wait until the last passenger had deplaned then go back to the hotel serena would be satisfied and hed have an afternoon workout in the gym since completing his term as states attorney and resuming his private practice caine hadnt had time for an hours relaxation much less a weeks when he relaxed he believed in doing it as thoroughly as he worked the next seven days he told himself were going to be dedicated to doing nothing he wouldnt think of the chaos of his office the cases he was going to have to turn down because there simply werent enough hours in the day or the reams of paperwork caine knew her the minute he saw her the high slashing cheekbones were so much like justins as was the smooth almost copper complexion the indian heritage they shared was perhaps even more apparent in the sister her eyes werent the light unexpected green of her brother but a rich dark brown camel eyes caine thought as he rose luxuriously lashed and heavy lidded so that they appeared sleepy the nose was straight and aristocratic the mouth passionate or stubborn he mused it wasnt a face a man could easily categorize beautiful appealing sexy but it wasnt one hed easily forget caine knew hed already memorized it feature by feature as she shifted her flight bag to her other arm dianas thick raven hair swung not quite brushing her shoulders she wore it loose and nearly straight so that the tips just curved under with a fringe of bangs over her forehead the style suited her easy but cleverly and meticulously cut as was the deceptively simple burgundy suit unnoticed caine let his eyes trail up taking in the slender welldisciplined body narrowhipped slim waist strong swimmers shoulders she walked like a dancer confident smoothly rhythmic so that when he stepped in front of her diana paused in midstride without any show of awkwardness unlike the woman in the red fox she scanned his face briefly and with no show of interest excuse me the words were perfectly polite and left the unmistakable impression that he was in her way interesting caine mused and didnt bother to smile diana blade dianas left brow disappeared under the fringe of bangs yes im caine macgregor renas brother keeping his eyes on her face caine held out a hand so this is the deadly macgregor diana mused accepting the hand he offered how do you do shed expected a smooth palm and was surprised to find her hand clasped against hard callused skin a faint prickling of pleasure crept up her arm diana acknowledged it broke contact then forgot it rena would have come herself caine went on still studying her face minutely but there were a few minor emergencies at the hotel because he was a man who could be diplomatic or blunt depending on his mood caine spoke as he started to take the flight bag from her shoulder i didnt expect you to come no diana kept her hand on the strap of the bag refusing to relinquish possession and your sister caine considered engaging in a brief tugofwar over the bag something about those large sleepy eyes made him want to annoy her with a shrug he dropped his hand she was certain youd come rena believes everyone has strong family feelings because she does the fleeting smile softened his features before he took her arm lets go get your bags diana allowed him to lead her down the wide crowded corridor while behind the deceptively lazy eyes her mind was active and sharply alert you dont like me do you mr macgregor caines brows lifted and fell but he didnt even glance at her i dont know you but since were in the position of being family so to speak why dont we bypass the formalities during the short speech she had another clue why he was so successful in his field his voice was gold rich mellow gold with a hint of steel beneath all right she agreed tell me caine if you werent expecting me how did you know who i was your bone structure and colouring are very much like justins are they she murmured as they stopped in front of the conveyor belt caine studied her again with the same thorough unapologetic intensity as before her scent was something he couldnt quite identify wild rather man floral and very french he wondered if it suited her as well as the smartly cut wool suit the family resemblance is there he commented but i think it would be less apparent if you stood side by side thats something ive had little opportunity to do diana returned dryly and indicated her bags with a gesture of her hand used to servants caine concluded as he hefted the two leather cases but selfreliant he added remembering their silent battle over the flight bag im sure justin will be pleased to see you after so many years possibly you seem very fond of him ive known him for ten years he was my friend before he became my brotherinlaw she wanted to ask what justin was like but swallowed the question diana had her own opinion if she were to change it it wouldnt be through caines influence or anyone elses youre staying at the comanche for a week as they stepped out into the frigid january air diana automatically stuck her ungloved hands in her coat pockets the sky was a cold hard blue the street slick and grimy with melted snow isnt it an odd time of year to be vacationing at the beach for some the wind whipped his hair into his eyes but he didnt seem to notice then again a great many people come for the gambling weather doesnt matter when youre inside a casino because the top of her head was level with his shoulder diana tilted her face back to see his is that what you come for not particularly he looked down and discovered the sun brought out the faintest hint of gold in her eyes i enjoy an occasional game but renas the gambler in the family then she and justin must be well suited caine set down her bags and slowly drew the keys out of his pocket ill let you decide that for yourself without speaking he loaded her cases in the trunk then unlocked the car diana caine put his hand on her arm before she could slide in shed never known her name could sound like that soft and smooth and vaguely exotic when she turned large puzzled eyes to his he brushed at her bangs in a gesture that was completely natural to him because his touch surprised her as much as it disconcerted diana said nothing things arent always as they seem caine said quietly i dont understand you for a moment they merely stood in the windy parking lot with the thunder of planes and smell of fumes diana thought she could almost feel the texture of his hard palm through the thickness of her coat his eyes she thought were oddly gentle in such a strongly featured face briefly she forgot his reputation as a demon in the courtroom and the bedroom she found herself wanting to reach out to him for help advice comfort before she was fully aware she needed any you have a beautiful face caine murmured do you have any compassion diana drew her brows together id like to think so then give him a chance the puzzled vulnerable look dropped away to be replaced by something cool and guarded it was a look though she didnt know it that her brother could adopt at a moments notice some might consider my coming a sign of good faith some might caine agreed then walked around to slide into the drivers seat but you dont diana let the door shut with a peevish snap if i had to guess id say you came primarily out of curiosity it must be gratifying to be right so often he flashed her a grin powerful and quickly gone she almost wondered if shed imagined it yeah the jaguar roared to life when he twisted the key for the sake of our kin why dont we try to be friends how was paris idle conversation she decided turn off the brain and give all the standard meaningless answers diana leaned back shed enjoy the ride one of her secret weaknesses was for fast wellconstructed cars it was chilly she began theres a little café off the rue du four caine remembered as he maneuvered the jag through airport traffic the best soufflés on either side of the atlantic henris he sent her a curious look yes you know it yes with a hint of a smile diana turned her attention back to the window henris was a noisy little hole in the wall aunt adelaide would have starved before she stepped over the threshold diana loved it and always made a point of slipping away for an hour or two when she was in paris to enjoy a meal and the company strange that it would also be a favourite of caine macgregors do you get to paris often no not anymore my aunt will be living there now ive been helping her settle into her apartment youre living in boston what part ive just moved into a house on charles street the inevitable small world caine murmured it seems were neighbours what do you do in boston flicking back the hair that fell across her cheek diana turned to study him the same thing you do caine lifted a brow as he twisted his head to look back at her you remember professor whiteman im sure she continued he speaks very highly of you caines grin was quick and off centre do the students still call him bones behind his back of course with a laugh caine shook his head so harvard law it appears we have more in common than we bargained for family alma mater career are you practicing im with barclay stevens and fitz mmm very prestigious he shot her a look and staid for the first time dianas features relaxed into a smile it was both wry and stunning i get all the fascinating cases just last week i represented a councilmans son who has a habit of ignoring the posted speed limit you can work your way up in fifteen or twenty years ive other plans diana murmured by the time she was thirty she calculated shed be ready for the break after four years with a respected conservative firm shed have the experience and the backing necessary to start her own practice a small elegant office a competent secretary and then which are she brought herself back to the present she wasnt a woman to lay all her cards on the table i want to specialize in criminal law she said simply why a thirst for justice human rights laughing she swung her face back to his and i love a good fight caine acknowledged this with a thoughtful nod perhaps she wasnt as polished and proper as the trim suit indicated he should have gotten a hint of who she was from her choice of scent are you any good a secondyear law student could handle what im doing at the moment her chin angled as she rested her elbow on the back of the seat im much better than that and i intend to be the best an admirable ambition caine commented as he swung off the strip toward the comanche ive already earmarked that spot for myself diana gave him a long cool look well have to see who gets there first wont we for an answer caine only smiled diana thought she could see something of the demon in him now a hint of that volatile dangerous energy that had already propelled him far up the ladder without speaking she stepped out of her side of the car she wasnt intimidated by wolfish grins or challenging eyes if there was one area where diana was completely confident it was law caine macgregor would be hearing her name over the years she was certain hed remember what shed said ms blades bags are in the trunk caine told the doorman as he handed over a folded bill and his keys im sure renad like to see you right away he went on as he took dianas arm again unless youd rather go to your own rooms first no rena not justin she noticed she felt the quick jumpiness in her stomach again and struggled to ignore it good then well go right up so diana glanced around taking in the understated elegance of the lobby this is justins he only owns half of this comanche caine corrected as they stepped into the elevator rena bought in as a full partner late last summer i see is that how they met no when he laughed she turned her head to eye him curiously its a complicated family joke im sure rena will tell you about it though perhaps youd have to meet my father to completely understand he gave her a long look then twisted the ends of her hair around his fingers on second thought id better see that you dont meet him or im likely to find myself in a similar situation he kept his eyes on hers stirred by the wildly seductive scent she wore was that mouth as passionate as it looked he wondered you really are very beautiful diana he murmured it was the way he said her name diana told herself that caused that odd almost uncomfortable prickling along her skin he was an expert at making women uncomfortable she remembered and making them enjoy it she gave him a steady look from halfclosed eyes you left quite a reputation behind you at harvard caine she said mildly not all of it in the lecture halls is that so apparently amused he gave her hair a quick tug before he released it youll have to tell me about it sometime some things are best left unsaid when the doors opened diana stepped out then glanced over her shoulder though ive often wondered if the incident in the law library was based on fact hmm rubbing a hand over his chin he joined her suppose i plead the fifth on that counsellor coward oh yeah he started to stick the key serena had given him into the lock of the penthouse door then stopped are they still talking about that diana struggled with a smile as she studied his face he wasnt particularly embarrassed she mused more curious its become the stuff legends are made of she told him champagne and passion between massachusetts criminal law and divorce proceedings caine gave a shrug as he turned the lock it was beer actually these things get blown out of proportion with time he gave her a very charming smile you dont believe everything you hear do you diana paused long enough to return the smile yes with this she pushed open the unlocked door and stepped inside diana didnt know what shed been expecting whatever it had been it had little to do with the warm elegance of her brothers suite muted tones accented with bold slashes of colour large expanses of glass with a panoramic view of the atlantic small exquisite carvings pastel sketches low inviting furniture snuggled into plush carpeting was this her brothers taste she wondered suddenly feeling more remote from him than ever or was it serenas who was this man who shared parents and a heritage with her why was she here looking opening herself to emotions shed locked out most of her life they needed to stay locked out she told herself frantically that was survival in a moments panic diana turned toward the door but found herself face to face with caine whom are you going to run from he asked as he lifted his hands to her arms justin or yourself diana stiffened this isnt any of your concern no he agreed but his eyes dropped of their own accord to her mouth she was tense muscles tight what would it be like he wondered to loosen her to get beyond that finely drawn wall of control and elegance hed always preferred more flamboyant women women who knew how to laugh and to love without undercurrents but this after all would just be a test it wasnt as if there were a chance of involvement there was a moments temptation to satisfy his curiosity bring her those few inches closer and taste the fact that her response could fall anywhere between fury and passion only made it the more difficult to resist diana felt the need come unexpectedly and uninvited to be held driven possessed somehow she knew he could bring her to that thered be no unanswered questions no uncertainties only floods of pleasure and passion mindless no thought no reason no justifications she could find that heady forbidden world if only she reached for it and for him for a moment she swayed between temptation and rationality that thin razors edge understood by all lovers it would be so easy a faint mechanical rumble snapped her back diana turned her head toward the doors of an elevator she hadnt even noticed without speaking caine slid his hands up to her shoulders and slipped her coat off as they opened diana watched a woman walk through small and blond and striking in a simple violet sheath that matched her eyes diana serena walked to her enveloping her in a hard unselfconscious hug im so glad you came serena slid her hands down until they gripped her sisterinlaws oh youre lovely she said with a wide welcoming smile and so like justin isnt she caine mmm standing back he watched the meeting as he lit a cigarette a bit overawed by the greeting diana retreated a step serena i want to thank you for the invitation its the last formal one youll get serena told her were family now caine how about a drink diana what would you like diana glanced from brother to sister and lifted her shoulders a little vermouth nervous and unwilling to settle she wandered to the window the hotels beautiful serena caine tells me you and justin are partners in this one and the one were rebuilding in malta i havent wormed my way into the others as yet i will accepting the glass caine handed her serena took a seat on the sofa it turns out diana and i are neighbours caine crossed the room with another glass and offered it to diana really that strange moment had passed diana told herself and it had been nerves not needs she thought as she took the drink from caine then their eyes met their fingers brushed she wasnt as certain as she wanted to be yes deliberately she turned away from caine to face his sister its quite a coincidence came smiled slowly as he let his gaze sweep up dianas back even more of a coincidence he drawled as he walked back to the bar we have the same profession youre a lawyer serena watched dianas eyes follow caine it appears my brother doesnt waste any time she mused then sipped thoughtfully at her drink yes i was at harvard a few years behind caine diana switched her drink to her other hand and wished she hadnt asked for it but his presence was still felt she added serena threw back her head and laughed oh i dont doubt it in most cases you should take stories with a grain of salt in caines she trailed off sending him a provocative smile i always wonder just how much was left out your faith in me is touching caine murmured theyre close diana mused theyve shared years and know dozens of foolish things about each other she stared down into her drink what am i doing here serena she began i want you to know i appreciate the invitation but i wonder diana stopped and fortified herself with a sip of vermouth i wonder if justins any more comfortable about this than i am he doesnt know youre coming when dianas eyes shot up serena went on quickly i wasnt certain you would diana i didnt want him to be hurt if you refused would he be diana murmured then lifted her glass again you dont know him serena returned i do the cool quiet look diana sent her was so like justins that serenas heart twisted diana i think i have some idea how you must feel setting her drink on the table she rose please dont shut him out hes at the sound of the elevator serena broke off damn it i need a few more minutes she glanced at diana to see her sisterinlaw standing stiff and silent serena cast one helpless look at caine and got a shrug for an answer diana watched the doors slide open there you are justin strode directly to his wife you disappeared justin serena found her words muffled against his mouth hes so tall diana thought numbly confident successful her mind went on as she could do nothing more than stare at him how much was left of the moody intense boy shed known was this her brother hed lifted her on his shoulders once so that she could see over the crowd when a circus had come to town dear god why should she remember that now justin serena began breathlessly when her mouth was free we have company he spared caine a brief glance then gathered serena closer go away caine i want to make love to your sister justin with a half laugh serena pressed her hands against his chest when she glanced toward the window justin followed her eyes oh smiling he ran his hand down his wifes hair but didnt release her i didnt realize caine had brought a friend he doesnt even know me diana thought as her hands tightened on the glass were strangers wed pass each other on the street at a loss she stared back at him struggling for words that wouldnt come slowly justins eyes narrowed serena felt his hand tighten on her hair then release gradually until he was no longer holding her diana in her name was recognition and incredulity dryeyed she stood perfectly still her knuckles were white against the glass justin he crossed to her searching her face the clock was spinning backward and forward so quickly it left him shaken and disoriented he wanted to reach out touch her but didnt know how shed been so small when hed left her and pudgy with baby fat now she was a tall slender woman with his fathers eyes his face was as expressionless as hers as they studied each other you cut your pigtails he murmured and felt foolish several years ago diana called on every lesson in deportment aunt adelaide had ever drummed into her you look well justin she said with a polite smile whatever overture he might have made was smothered by that one impersonal sentence and you he said with a nod hows your aunt aunt adelaides fine shes living in paris now your hotels very impressive thank you he gave her a wry smile as he slipped his hands into his pockets i hope youll stay with us for a while for a week the ache in her hand told her to loosen her grip on the glass diana concentrated on doing so while his eyes stayed steady on hers i havent congratulated you on your marriage justin i hope youre happy yes i am finding the stilted conversation unbearable serena stepped forward please sit down diana if you dont mind id like to unpack settle in a bit of course justin spoke before serena could protest youll join us for dinner tonight id be glad to ill show you to your rooms caine drained the rest of his drink then set it down thank you diana crossed toward the door pausing long enough to give serena a brief smile ill see you tonight then there was faint but unmistakable disapproval in the violet eyes yes please let us know if theres anything you need does eight oclock suit you ill be ready without looking back diana walked through the door caine already held open neither spoke as they moved down the hallway in a few minutes diana thought frantically she could untense her muscles unstrap her emotions silently caine drew the door key out of his pocket and slipped it into the lock diana walked through then turned intending to give him a brief thankyou he closed the door behind him sit down if you dont mind id really like to why dont you finish that drink glancing down diana saw that she still held the glass with a shrug she turned away as if studying the room very nice she said without having the vaguest idea what she was looking at i appreciate you showing me to my room caine now i really have to unpack sit down diana im not leaving while youre churned up this way im not churned up her voice was too sharp in defence she took another swallow of vermouth i am tired though so if you dont mind i was watching you firmly caine took her by the shoulders and pushed her into a chair if youd stood in there another five minutes youd have keeled over thats ridiculous diana set the glass on the table beside her with a click is it he took her hand between both of his rubbing absently as he watched her face your hands are like ice you can lie with your eyes diana not with your hands couldnt you have given him something no the word wavered and she sucked in her breath to steady it i dont have anything to give him snatching her hand away she rose please leave me alone they were close now so close she could see the fractional lift of his brow stubborn caine murmured and absently traced the shape of her mouth with his thumb i thought as much when i saw you get off the plane diana with a sigh caine brushed the hair away from her cheeks she felt everything slip out of focus youre hurting yourself by binding your feelings up this way you dont know anything about my feelings her voice was low and unsteady as she fought to keep tears from misting her vision she wasnt going to cry not in front of him or anyone there was nothing absolutely nothing to cry about this is none of your business my feelings are none of your business she choked on a sob and pressed her hand to her mouth leave me alone she demanded but found herself cradled against his chest when youve finished he murmured and held her the wordless unquestioning comfort was more than she could resist clinging diana let her emotions break loose in a storm of weeping chapter two the water was slate grey with jagged crests of whitecaps it was angry noisy and fascinating diana could smell the sea and the promise of snow as she walked across it the sand was brittle with cold crunching quietly underfoot she had her coat buttoned high against the wind but lifted her face to it enjoying its slapping fingers and the solitude she revelled in the solitude that could be found on a winters beach just past dawn so much of her life had been crowded with people shed never been alone in her aunts house on beacon hill diana tossed back her hair and smiled ruefully shed never been allowed to be alone beneath adelaides fussing and lectures on deportment had been the fear that blade blood comanche blood would prove too strong and too wild to be controlled diana had controlled it because there was nowhere else for her to go at first diana had done everything she was told allowed herself to be moulded into the quiet little lady her aunt had wanted everyone else had left her and diana had lived with the daily fear that she would be left again shed learned to control the fear but shed never been able to alleviate it it was the ability to control her emotions that had become her most successful defence against adelaides criticisms and her own insecurity even as a child diana had understood that her aunt had taken her in because of a sense of duty there was no love between them despite the fact that the young girl had thirsted desperately for love diana had been the offspring of adelaides half sister a darkhaired goldenskinned girl born of their fathers second marriage to a woman of mixed blood comanche blood and the half sister whom adelaide had accepted out of duty had compounded their fathers lack of judgment by marrying a blade blood had called to blood adelaide had often said when she spoke of what she considered her half sisters betrayal of their name and heritage with diana shed been ruthlessly determined to correct her familys previous errors the comanche strain was to be ignored more it was to be erased adelaide demanded perfection she was a grandeau diana was to be a mirror of her own values opinions and wishes the child learned to be cautious to be obedient and to question only in her head the wrong question voiced aloud could be met with tightlipped impatience or worse another lecture on deportment diana had accepted then had excelled in her studies in music in poise theyd been an escape that had fulfilled her quest to learn and her need to belong her calmly determined will to succeed had begun as a way of surviving over the years the cool elegant demeanour shed adopted had become second nature if there were moments when shed longed for something more something exciting unfathomable shed suppressed the needs shed come to believe that if she played by the rules if she followed the steps carefully shed win in the end so her rebellions had been very discreet and her dreams meticulously subdued still adelaide would have been appalled to know that her niece enjoyed restaurants that didnt have a fourstar rating and movies that didnt have strict cultural significance and sports cars diana mused with a quiet laugh steamed crabs and beer stopping she slipped her hands into her pockets and looked out to sea and wild winter beaches she reflected is that why justin seems to have settled here diana wondered as she turned to face the back of the hotel does he find himself drawn to the cold passion of a winter sea was the heritage they shared stronger than the years of separation the years when he had gone his own way to gamble and win and she had submitted and quietly rebelled shaking her head diana continued to walk she knew nothing of the man whod sat across from her at dinner the night before he was smooth and sophisticated with something like thunder just beneath the surface theyd had little to say to each other even when serenas eyes had pleaded with her diana could find nothing more than meaningless cocktail talk what did a woman like serena macgregor know of her feelings diana thought with quick resentment shed grown up surrounded by family love shed had a place and a lineage she didnt have to ignore just watching how easy she was with caine caine diana thought with a sigh it was impossible to pin down what she thought about him what she felt about him she hadnt been prepared for the sensitivity hed shown her when shed fallen apart or more his insight in knowing how close shed been to the edge yet he like justin had a certain polish that seemed like a thin glaze over something very dangerous when her weeping had run its course she hadnt felt safe in his arms though hed done no more than stroke her hair as if shed been a child he threatened to ignite some spark in her like the reluctant flame that comes from rubbing two sticks together with steady endless patience a forest fire can be started that way diana reminded herself she wasnt about to have her life interrupted by one youre up early diana whirled to find caine behind her he was dressed more casually now in a leather bomber jacket jeans and sneakers it occurred to her that he should be freezing but he seemed perfectly comfortable as he scanned her face i wanted to watch the sun rise over the water she began then glanced up at the thick lead clouds i didnt have much luck this morning lets walk his hand closed over hers before she could answer do you like the beach diana relaxed he wasnt going to badger her about justin or the strained dinner they had shared the night before ive never been much of a summer beach person she began but i never knew how appealing it could be this time of year do you come often no not really luckily both alan and i were here a few months ago when rena was kidnapped but what diana stopped her fingers tightening on his caines eyes came to hers dark and curious didnt you know no i i suppose i was in europe what happened long story caine began to walk again and was quiet so long diana thought hed refuse to tell her thered been a bomb threat in justins vegas hotel when he went out to handle things there was another threat handwritten addressed to him he didnt like the feel of it when he came back he tried to convince rena to leave but with a quick grin he glanced out to sea shes another stubborn woman justin was downstairs talking to the police about a second threat when the guy got to her the grin was gone as though it had never been and a look of barely controlled fury took its place he held her for almost twentyfour hours handcuffed to the bed he wanted justin to pay two million in ransom good god diana thought about the small violeteyed woman and shuddered its the only time in all the years ive known justin that ive seen him so close to losing it caine remembered the look of cold fury was still in his eyes but his voice was calm he didnt eat sleep he just sat by the phone and waited it wasnt until the boy let him talk to rena that we finally had a clue to who he was in some ways that was worse why this time caine stopped and looked down at her she wouldnt know he thought perhaps it was time she did when justin was eighteen he was in a fight in a bar the man who started it didnt care to be drinking in the same place as an indian the rich dark eyes frosted over i see he pulled a knife during the struggle justin was ripped open about six inches along the ribs caine saw her pale but he continued in the same tone the man was killed with his own knife and justin was charged with murder diana felt a sudden wave of nausea and fought it off justin was on trial he was acquitted once the witnesses from the bar were subpoenaed and under oath but he spent a few grim months in a cell my aunt never told me diana turned away to face the sea she never said a word you would have been around eight i dont imagine youd have been a great deal of help to him she could have been diana said silently thinking of her aunts comfortable income her influential connections and i should have been told god he was only a boy squeezing her eyes shut she struggled to clear her mind and listen go on it turned out that the boy who had rena was the son of the man justin had killed his mother had drummed it into his head that justin had murdered his father and had been freed because the courts had felt sorry for him he had no intention of hurting rena only justin the sea seemed louder somehow more violent so justin paid the ransom he was prepared to but it wasnt necessary rena phoned just as he was leaving to make the final arrangements shed knocked the kid out with a skillet and cuffed him to the bed stunned and amused despite herself diana turned back she did caine acknowledged her smile with one of his own shes tougher than she looks shaking her head diana began to walk again and what about the boy his trial comes up later this month renas paying his legal fees her eyes whipped up to his in them was a mixture of anger and admiration does justin know that of course she digested this in silence walking again im not sure i could be so forgiving justins more resigned than agreeable caine commented and when we had rena back safe it was hard to refuse her anything my first reaction was to get the kid locked up for the next fifty years diana tilted her head to study his face i doubt hed have much of a chance if you could prosecute ive read some of your trial transcripts you go for the jugular counsellor its cleaner he said simply why didnt you run for states attorney again politics has too many walls he sent her an offcentre grin i imagine youve run into a few with barclay stevens and fitz barclay is the epitome of the dry sterneyed attorney dickens would have loved him my dear miss blade she began in a whispery thin voice please try to remember your position a member of our firm never raises her voice or challenges a judge in the courtroom only on the golf course diana added in a mutter still grinning caine swung an arm around her shoulders and do you challenge judges miss blade frequently if aunt adelaide wasnt bosom buddies with barclays wife id have been out on my ear by now as it is im a glorified law clerk so why are you still there i have a deep supply of patience his arm felt warm and friendly over her shoulder without thinking diana moved closer aunt adelaide wasnt thrilled about my choosing law in the first place but she was instrumental in my securing a position at barclays that rankled diana swallowed the light trace of bitterness her voice was low and even when she continued in her way she was pleased that i was working for an old friend and a prestigious firm if i hang in long enough they might just give me something other than traffic afraid of her instead of being insulted diana laughed the fear had been gone for years even the memory was vague aunt adelaide i hope ive got more spine than that no she tossed her face up to the wind i owe her do you caine murmured half to himself my father has a saying he mused aloud theres no fee for family he doesnt know aunt adelaide diana remarked dryly oh look at the gulls she pointed skyward as a pair of them swooped overhead and out to sea one flew close enough to touch when i stood out on my balcony this morning i wonder why they make such a lonely sound when they seem perfectly content when she shivered caine tightened his arm around her cold yes but she smiled up at him i like it his breath was cool against her face showing itself in a thin white mist that was quickly snatched by the wind diana was so entranced by his eyes that she hardly noticed that the arm around her shoulders had shifted drawing her closer then they were face to face and her arms had slipped up his back over the cold smooth leather her heartbeat was a dull thud that might have belonged to someone else she heard the wind echo off the water and surround them as if they were on some lonely northern island with one hand he cupped the back of her neck with cool strong fingers diana felt the cold wet drops land on her face before she saw the flakes its snowing yeah caine lowered his lips to within a whisper of hers then hesitated he heard her quiet shudder of breath before she banished the distance softly slowly his mouth roamed over hers it was a cool lazy seduction at odds with the biting wind and racing snow he drew her closer gradually until her body fit tightly against his she could feel those hard seeking fingers run up and down the nape of her neck teasing her mind with images of what they could do to her body while she was distracted by them his mouth became more greedy pulling response from her before she was aware of the demand her hands hooked around his shoulders and locked tight her passion seemed to rise like the wind but it was hot sultry as he took his lips on a long mesmerizing journey over her face she heard the thick echo of crashing waves then nothing but the whisper of her own name as he traced her ear with his tongue diana pressed herself against him searching and finding his roaming mouth with her own there was no teasing this time no subtle greed now it was all flash all fire neither of them was aware of the cold any longer as they demanded everything the other possessed diana felt all of her small inner secrets slipping away from her exposed even as she felt herself being filled again with needs that were as much caines as her own and the needs were deeper and more complex than anything shed ever known not just a hunger for the taste of a mouth not just a desire for the hard strong feel of a mans arms it was a longing for a match a mate in her stirred the oldest most primitive need to be completed physically and the oldest most basic need to be fulfilled emotionally as if she felt herself drowning she clutched at him but was suddenly unsure if he were anchor or lifeline the will to survive smothered the yearning for pleasure and she palled away breathing jerkily diana stared at him while the wind whipped her hair and snow into her eyes well caines breath puffed out in a long stream that was unexpected when he reached up to touch her cheek she backed out of range his brows lifted and fell as he stuck his hands in his pockets a bit late to throw up walls now diana the foundations already crumbled not walls caine she said calmer now just basic common sense im not your passioninthebookstacks type something flashed in his eyes but she couldnt be certain if it was annoyance or amusement the statute of limitations on that misdemeanour must have run out by now i have my doubts that youre rehabilitated diana returned mildly god forbid before she could avoid him caine reached out to gather her tossing hair in one hand diana with a laugh he brushed snowflakes from her cheek you belong in the desert or someplace steamy with a white sun wearing exotic clothes that would suit that face of yours she held herself very still to combat the desire to feel his skin against hers again im very well suited to a new england courtroom she retorted yes the smile remained in his eyes i think you are or part of you is perhaps thats why youre beginning to fascinate me im not interested in fascinating you caine she met his eyes levelly and with the quick wish that she could knock the gleam out of them i am interested in going back in before i freeze ill walk you back he said with such apparently boundless amiability that diana wanted to deck him that isnt necessary she began as her hand was clasped by his i suppose i could walk ten paces behind or ten paces in front as she let out a frustrated breath caine grinned down at her youre not angry because we exchanged a friendly kiss after all were family there was nothing friendly or familial about it diana muttered no he lifted her hand to his lips then lightly nipped at her knuckle maybe we should try again no diana said firmly and tried to ignore the thrill racing up her arm all right he said a bit too agreeably for her taste lets have some breakfast im not hungry a good thing youre not under oath he murmured you must have eaten all of three bites last night well he continued before she could think of a comment have some coffee while i eat im starving well talk shop he held up a hand anticipating her protest if it makes you feel any better ill even put it on my expense account with a reluctant laugh she climbed the beach steps with him it sounds to me as though you didnt get out of politics soon enough you havent the eyes of a cynic he commented no he was climbing the steps quickly now so she had to jog to keep up theyre more like a camels careful its getting slick a camel not certain whether to be amused or insulted diana stopped near the top of the steps now thats a terribly romantic statement you want romance before she knew what he was doing caine had swept her up in his arms to carry her toward the back entrance laughing diana pushed snowcoated hair out of her eyes put me down you idiot it worked for clark gable vivien leigh didnt call him an idiot they were inside at the time diana pointed out if you slip on this snow and drop me im going to sue some romantic you are caine complained as he pushed the door open with his back whatever happened to women who liked to be swept off their feet they got dropped diana said flatly caine will you put me down she tried wriggling but he only tightened his grip and kept walking youre not carrying me into the dining room no for him it was a direct challenge and he accepted it with a grin she was light and carried the scent of snow her eyes held an indignant laughter that appealed to him caine decided then and there to put that expression on her face more often she had a mouth that was meant to smile and he had an urge to show her just how little effort fun could be caine diana lowered her voice as she caught a few interested glances stop this nonsense people are staring its all right im used to it twisting his head he kissed her briefly your mouths very tempting in a pout as she made a frustrated sound in her throat caine stopped to give the dining room hostess a smile table for two of course mr macgregor her eyes swept up to diana for only a moment right this way diana clicked her teeth shut as he carried her around tables scattered with breakfast customers she watched a middleaged woman tug on her husbands sleeve and point your waitress will be right with you the hostess told caine as she stopped by a comer table enjoy your breakfast thanks with a great deal of style he deposited diana in a chair then sat opposite her you diana began in a low voice are going to pay for that it was worth it caine unzipped his coat and shrugged out of it hed already decided she needed to be hit with the unexpected from time to time in his opinion shed been pampered sheltered and restricted as a macgregor he thought they were all one and the same absently he combed his fingers through his hair scattering already melting snow are you sure you wont have something more than coffee love quite sure watching him she began unbuttoning her coat do you always get away with the outrageous mostly are you always so beautiful in the morning dont waste your charm diana slipped out of her coat to reveal a pumpkincoloured angora sweater its all right i have more while diana gave a disgusted sigh he smiled at their waitress who returned his smile and offered them menus ill have the pancakes he told her immediately with a side order of bacon crisp and eggs over easy the lady only wants coffee is that a normal breakfast for you diana asked when the waitress bustled off caine leaned back observing shed already forgotten to pretend she was angry i enjoy eating when i get the chance there are days when im lucky to get more than a few gallons of coffee and a driedout sandwich is your private caseload as heavy as it was when you were states attorney heavy enough and i dont have a staff of assistants he watched as she added a miserly drop of cream to her coffee thats one of the things i wanted to break away from no law clerk she had hands made for rings he thought but wore none caine had to force his attention back to her question not at the moment my secretary is disorganized untidy and addicted to soap operas diana gave him a mild smile as she lifted her cup she must have other virtues caine laid his elbows on the table and leaned toward her shes fiftyseven sturdy as a rock and a hell of a typist i stand chastised diana murmured still id think with your reputation and background youd have one of the slickest firms in boston i leave that for barclay stevens and fitz dont you like to get your hands dirty occasionally diana yes with a sigh she set down her cup again yes damn it id work for nothing if i could dig my teeth into something that wasnt cut straight out of a textbook traffic violations and property settlements she muttered im not going to get anything else if i dont stick with the establishment for a while longer the world of law wouldnt give me a standing ovation if i opened an office tomorrow is that what you want standing ovations i like to win the sleepy eyes became suddenly intense i intend to make a career out of it why do you do it i have a talent for arguing for a moment he frowned down at his coffee the law has a lot of shades doesnt it caine lifted his eyes and locked them on hers not all of them equal justice its a very thin rope we walk and balance is crucial i like to win too and when i do i like to know i was right havent you ever defended someone you knew was guilty everyones entitled to legal counsel and representation thats the law this time caine lifted his coffee drinking it black strong and hot youre obliged to give them your best and hope that justice is the winner in the final analysis it isnt always the systems lousy and only works part of the time shrugging he drank again its better than not at all interested diana studied him with more care youre not what i expected you to be and what was that more hardline maybe a young more fiery version of barclay quoting precedents a little latin for effect claiming that the law is carved in granite ah an idiot diana burst into quick spontaneous laughter he found it warm and wild like her scent you dont do that enough diana let yourself enjoy without thinking it through he explained my training even as she said it it surprised her just what doors was he opening she thought with a frown before she had a chance to check the locks are you going to clarify that no she shook her head quickly then glanced up heres your breakfast im fascinated to see if you can really eat it all secrets caine thought as the waitress arranged the plates perhaps it was her underlying mystique that had her crowding his mind there seemed to be so many layers to her and he couldnt resist the temptation to peel each one off to see what was underneath then there was the vulnerability it wasnt often you found a strong woman with that soft vulnerable edge the combination with those unmistakable hints of passion was very appealing her manner her speech her style shouted lady with a capital l but there were those bedroom eyes and that wicked promising scent he remembered her hot unrestrained mouth on his and found he wanted her taste again and to feel the skin she kept hidden beneath the discreetly sophisticated clothes hed always found women enjoyable puzzles to be solved in this case he could pick up the challenge play the game and do her the favour of showing her that life wasnt as full of boundaries and rules as she thought yes he mused diana blade was likely to keep him occupied and entertained for quite a while want a bite he said quietly and offered a forkful of fluffy pancakes afraid youve overdone it he only smiled and moved the fork closer to her mouth with a shrug diana allowed him to feed her oh she closed her eyes a moment its good more caine took a bite himself before offering her another food like other solutions to hunger can be habitforming with her eyes on his she accepted the second bite then leaned back im watching my intake at the moment oh here you are serena swept up to the table pressing a kiss to her brothers cheek then dianas isnt that disgusting she demanded gesturing to caines plate and he never gains an ounce did you sleep well yes diana found herself at a loss in the presence of such easy kinship and offered a cautious smile my rooms are lovely want some breakfast caine asked his sister going to share yours no well i havent got time anyway serena made a face at him as he continued to eat i was hoping you could stop by the office a little later diana have you made plans for the day no not yet you might want to take advantage of the health club or the casino id love to show you around thank you give me an hour serena shot caine a look only believe half of what he tells you she advised then was off again your sister diana trailed off then with a quick wondering laugh accepted the slice of bacon caine offered shes not what i expected either do you always have a picture in your head before you meet someone yes i suppose doesnt everyone caine merely moved his shoulders and continued to eat what did you expect rena to be like sturdier for one thing diana chewed the bacon absently as she considered she seems so fragile until you really look and see the strength in her face and i guess i was looking for someone more obviously intellectual glossier shes not the sort of woman i would have pictured justin married to though i had difficulty picturing him married at all it could be caine said quietly that hes not what you think either her eyes lifted at that instantly cool and remote no i dont know him do i it was difficult not to be annoyed at how easily she could slip into her armour caine sliced through his eggs and continued mildly its never easy to know anyone unless you want to it isnt wise to lecture on a subject you know nothing about she retorted you had a tidy little childhood didnt you caine the futility began to rise in her and with it anger mother father sister brother you knew exactly who you were and where you belonged youve no right to analyze or disapprove of my feelings when you have no way of comprehending them caine leaned back and lit a cigarette is that what i was doing do you think its easy to erase twenty years of neglect of disinterest she tossed back i needed him once i dont need him now then why did you come to exorcise those last lingering ghosts she shoved the coffee cup aside i wanted to see him as a man so id stop remembering him as a boy when i leave i wont think of him at all caine eyed her through a thin mist of smoke you cant pretend youre ice and steel with me diana i was with you yesterday after you saw justin thats over you arent pleased i caught you being human are you when she started to rise he gripped her wrist making no effort to keep his strong fingers gentle if you want to be a winner diana you have to stop running away im not running her pulse was beginning to pound the polish had vanished and she had her first clear view of the man beneath strong threatening exciting youve been running since you stepped off that plane he corrected and likely long before that youre hurt and confused and too damn stubborn to admit it even to yourself what i am she said between her teeth is none of your business the macgregors take their family very seriously his eyes had narrowed their colour only more dramatic when seen through slits when my sister married your brother you became my business i dont want your brotherly advice he smiled and his grip gentled abruptly i dont feel brotherly toward you diana his thumb brushed across her knuckles in a long slow sweep i think we both know better than that he could switch his mood with more speed than she rising diana gave him a coldly furious look id rather you felt nothing toward me caine took a lazy drag on his cigarette too late he murmured then smiled at her again the scots are a pragmatic race but im beginning to believe in fate diana picked up her coat and meticulously folded it over her arm in the language of the ute comanche means enemies she lifted large angry eyes to his and for the first time he saw the full power of her heritage in her face were not easily subdued turning she walked away in her controlled dancers step with a smile caine crushed out his cigarette he was beginning to think it would be a very interesting battle chapter three the comanche diana discovered over the next few days was as slickly run a hotel as any her aunt would have patronized the food the service the ambience all catered to the wealthy and the successful it became obvious that though justin might have started his career as a penniless teenager he had made the most of the time in between she told herself she could respect him for that even cautiously admire him without involving herself she wasnt willing to take the risk of looking closely diana had never considered herself a gambler justin was invariably polite when they met but if she had been more openminded she might have seen he was as cautious as she despite herself diana learned more about him the ingrained integrity she would never have associated with a gambler the shrewd sharp brain he had honed on the streets the flashes of vulnerability only serena could bring out in him her brother was a man she discovered who would have held her interest and affection if it hadnt been for the years she couldnt erase of caine she saw little deliberately he had in a very short space of time been witness to too many of her private emotions she could almost accept that hed been there to comfort her when she had wept because he was sensitive and kind but those few moments on the windy beach played in her head too often that kind of passion the depth and suddenness of it held its own special danger she could remember it too easily feel it again too effortlessly if he could stir her by a look or the mere speaking of her name when they were in a room full of people diana was well aware of what would happen if they were alone she made certain it wasnt an issue then there was the anger how easily he strained her temper diana had always been pleased with her ability to control or channel her more violent emotions shed had years of practice concealing fury and frustration from her aunt in order to avoid the inevitable lecture somehow caine could bring her to the boiling point with a casual sentence it wouldnt pay to dwell on it diana told herself as she finished dressing they might run into each other in boston occasionally but that was her turf his too she reminded herself with a shrug she ran a hand over the hip of her grey flannel slacks in any case boston would be professional ground she knew exactly who she was and where she was going shed never been a woman ruled by mood she reminded herself she was much too disciplined for that once she was back in boston back to work she wouldnt be so susceptible to these wide emotional swings she didnt want them she told herself almost violently she didnt know how to deal with them what she wanted what she intended to have again was the calm order shed maintained for herself as long as she was here she felt like something was tearing at her ripping at her threatening her justin and all those memories all those emotions he brought back to her she didnt want to remember or to feel what shed once felt caine was widening an opening she hadnt been aware existed he was playing on vulnerabilities she shouldnt have on passions she didnt want when she was near him she needed needed what she couldnt afford to need on a long breath she fought back the rage and the confusion she could still control it she told herself she would control it and when she was back in boston she would go on with her life just as she had before absently she adjusted the cowl collar of her dark rose sweater she was glad she had come now that she had seen justin face to face she would stop wondering about him and that part of her life would be at rest shed also grown to love serena quickly it wasnt characteristic of her diana admitted she had learned to be very careful about sharing her affections they had always been too easily tapped and she felt too easily rejected for the first time in her life diana knew the pleasure of having someone who could be both family and friend swinging her purse over her shoulder she left the suite shed stop by her sisterinlaws office before she went for a walk on the beach caine invariably went out early and diana had timed her own outings around his there was no point she concluded in tempting fate as she made her way through the casino diana was again impressed by the smart informal decor no glitter or chunky chandeliers from what serena had told her the casino like the rest of the hotel reflected justins taste it was a far cry from the tiny house with a rickety porch they had shared in nevada but then theyd both come a long way from there diana mused she thought of her aunts house on beacon hill with its strict undisturbed elegance polished antiques and gleaming georgian silver softvoiced servants she gave a last glance around the casino silver slot machines and green baize tables croupiers in crisply cut tuxedos the faint wisp of expensive whiskey and tobacco yes theyd both come a long way from a little box house with a parched yellow lawn yet perhaps shed been happier there than at any other time in her life immersed in her own thoughts diana entered the reception area and nearly walked headlong into her brother diana justin took her arm to steady her then dropped his hand to his side she was so lovely he thought and the fleeting polite smile she gave him tied his stomach into knots he wouldnt reach her hed known it in the first instant but seeing her made it more difficult to accept the loss hed lived with all of his adult life good morning justin i thought id stop in to see rena if shes not busy how cool his eyes are she thought and how odd that that one mark of their white heritage should make him seem so wholly indian shes just going over the scheduling when she continued to stare he lifted a brow is something wrong diana i just remembered that story about the settler one of mothers ancestors captured her brow creased as she tried to recall a story told to a child so many years before she ended up staying with him freely isnt it strange that because of her green eyes come out at least once in every generation you have our fathers eyes justin murmured dark secret eyes because she felt herself softening diana straightened her spine i dont remember him she said flatly she thought she heard him sigh but there was no change in his expression tell serena ill be back in a couple of hours i have a meeting aching with guilt afraid of rejection diana held herself very still justin he turned back but she noticed his hand remained on the doorknob i didnt know about the trial about your being in prison im sorry it was a long time ago he said simply you were only a child i stopped being a child when you left me without waiting for his response she turned and went into serenas office diana smiling serena set aside the stack of papers in front of her please tell me youre dying to be entertained so i can get out from under this mountain of paperwork i was afraid id interrupt you there are days i pray for interruptions serena countered then her brows drew together whats wrong diana nothing turning diana faced the twoway glass and looked into the casino id never be able to work with this here id always feel i was in the middle of a party its just a matter of concentrating on two levels justin asked me to tell you hed be out for a couple of hours so thats it serena thought and rose crossing the room she placed her hands on dianas shoulders diana talk to me just because i love justin doesnt mean i wont understand how you feel i shouldnt have come on a long breath diana shook her head i keep finding myself going back remembering things id forgotten for years rena i didnt know id still love him it hurts loving someone has its disadvantages serena gave dianas shoulders a squeeze but if you love justin and give yourself some time i resent him every bit as much diana countered as she turned around maybe more i resent him for every day of all those years i did without him diana dont you see he did without you as well his choice i never had one the emotions began to push at her so that she swung away to pace the room he turned me over to my aunt and went his own way you were six he was sixteen frustrated serena tried to balance her loyalties what did you expect him to do he never wrote never phoned or visited not once as the words shed held inside for years tumbled out diana whirled back i was so sure that if i did everything i was told hed come for me those first few years i was the picture of the model child i minded my manners and studied my lessons and waited but he never came while i was waiting for him he never gave me a thought thats not true serena said heatedly you dont understand no you dont understand diana fired back you dont know what its like to lose everything that belonged to you and have to live on someone elses charity to know every mouthful of food you ate every stitch of clothing on your back had a price who do you think you owe for the food and the clothes diana serena asked evenly oh i know whom i owe diana retorted she never let me forget it in her own discreet way aunt adelaide doesnt believe in generosity without strings generosity serena crossed the room as her temper snapped she doesnt know any more about generosity than you do perhaps not diana agreed with a faint nod but she gave me everything ive ever had justin paid for it all the words came out on a crest of temper she couldnt control he sent her a check every month from the time she took you in until you graduated from harvard the checks might have been small in the beginning serena continued coldly he was living on little more than his wits then and dodging social workers but they got larger hes always been very good at what he does she took his money and you on his word that hed stay out of your life he paid diana with a great deal more than money she seemed to be frozen diana was afraid to move for fear that she would crack and scatter into a dozen irretrievable pieces he paid her her voice was very quiet very disciplined justin sent aunt adelaide money for me he had nothing else to give you damn it diana youre a lawyer what would have happened to you if he hadnt arranged for your aunt to take you in foster homes she thought dully an orphanage on the reservation she could have taken him in too serena gave her a long steady look would she diana pressed her fingers to her eyes she didnt know when the headache had begun but it was pounding mercilessly no with a sigh she dropped them again no later when i was older he could have contacted me he thought you were happy and certainly better off in boston than you would have been trailing around the country with him justin chose his own life its true but he did what he thought was best for you the only way he knew how why didnt he tell me what do you think he wants your gratitude serena demanded impatiently cant you see what kind of a man he is she dragged a hand through her hair he wont thank me for telling you i wouldnt have she added in a calmer tone if you hadnt said you still loved him as her temper cooled serena noted the wide distressed eyes the pale cheeks me frozen expression without question she reached out diana no diana held up a hand to hold her off her voice was frigid her body stiff youve told me the truth serena met her eyes levelly ive no reason to lie a brittle laugh escaped but perhaps she wouldnt have bothered to suppress it how odd when it seems everyone else has all of my life let me take you upstairs fix you a drink no gathering what remained of her selfcontrol diana walked to the door i appreciate you telling me rena she said coolly as she turned the knob it was something i needed to know as the door shut quietly serena dropped into the chair behind her desk oh god she thought rubbing her hand across her forehead how could i have done that with so little compassion remembering the stricken look on dianas face she started to rise then stopped herself no diana needed some time and serena didnt think it would be she diana would want to see in any case catching her bottom lip between her teeth she lifted the phone page caine macgregor please even after an hour had passed diana hadnt found her control her mind ran in circles chased by her emotions everything she had believed was false everything she had was owed to someone shed paid back with cold resentment the only thing that was clear to her now was that she would have to face justin once more and she would have to leave it was easier to prepare for the latter taking out her suitcases diana began to pack slowly very meticulously making the simple chore occupy her mind if she chose she could make it last for the better part of the afternoon perhaps by then the headache would be gone and the sickness deep in her stomach would have eased perhaps by then she wouldnt feel so utterly lost at first she ignored the knocking at her door then when it continued she reluctantly went to answer caine diana stood in the opening showing clearly he wasnt welcome diana he said in the same tone as he scanned her face seeing that her eyes were composed and dry he moved forward until she was forced to give way im busy at the moment dont let me stop you he said agreeably as he wandered to the window ive always liked the view from this room by all means enjoy it then turning on her heel she walked back into the bedroom while she battled annoyance diana continued to pack change your plans caine asked as he leaned against the doorjamb obviously diana folded a sweater and carefully laid it in the suitcase rena must have told you about our talk this morning she said shed upset you diana found it more difficult to keep her hands relaxed as she folded a blouse youve known all along she said dispassionately you knew that justin was responsible for my room and board and education rena talked to me about it after shed written you justin never mentioned it coming into the room caine idly lifted the sleeve of a silk dress shed spread on the bed why are you running diana im not running she tossed the blouse shed been attempting to fold into the suitcase youre packing he pointed out the words are not synonymous diana turned away from him again to give her attention to her packing im sure justinll be more comfortable when im gone why diana threw a tangle of clothes into the first case and slammed the lid back off caine her emotions were fighting to get out he observed and wondered why she felt they had to be suppressed healthier to let them out he thought perhaps it was one more thing he could teach her whom are you angry with im not angry turning to the closet diana dragged clothes off hangers it was all lies incensed she slammed the closet door shut and stood facing him with her hands full of clothes all those years she made me feel as though i depended on her good nature her sense of family obligation she tucked me into pinafores and patentleather shoes when i wanted to be barefoot i wore them because i was terrified of her because i owed her and all the time it was justin her hands gripped at the clothes as frustration overwhelmed her she wouldnt speak of him she insisted i forget the first six years of my life as if theyd never existed i was comanche diana said with sudden fierceness but she allowed me no reminders of it she took my heritage my birthright and still i felt i owed her i learned about my blood in books and museums and had to struggle all my life to remember who i was to remember in secret i paid her and while my brother was alone in prison i was taking ballet classes and eating off sevres caine took a step toward her watching the tears well up and be forced back doesnt it matter that it was what he wanted no diana tossed the clothes aside so that some landed on the bed and others fell to the floor i spent most of my life resenting him and catering to a woman who could never accept me for what i was now i dont even know what that is i thought i paid her for my education by dating the kind of men she approved of by taking the kind of job she could accept balance the scales first then do what you want with a laugh she dragged both hands through her hair but it wasnt her and i dont know who i am anymore is it this she held up a white silk blouse tailored trim elegant i thought i knew where i belonged crumpling the blouse into a ball she hurled it to the floor i know nothing he waited a moment while she stared at it breath heaving why should where the money came from make so much difference it doesnt to someone whos always felt entitled to it caine grabbed her arms and gave her an impatient shake youre being a fool you found out your aunt wasnt completely honest with you and that your brother hadnt forgotten you why does that change who or what you are cant you see i was reared on a lie so now you know the truth he countered what are you going to do with it the fingers that gripped the front of his shirt relaxed abruptly as the anger drained out of her oh god caine ive been so hateful to him so cold the more i wanted to reach out the more i made myself back away he kissed her lightly a quick almost brotherly gesture you wont next time no backing out of his arms she stooped to pick up the clothes that lay on the floor as if it were a symbol she left the crumpled blouse where shed thrown it im going to see him as soon as ive pulled myself together with her back to him diana began to smooth out the skirts and dresses shed wrinkled you seem to be making a habit of being around when i fall apart i dont think i like it im not certain i do either he murmured then found himself turning her to face him vulnerabilitys difficult to resist he ran a thumb down her cheekbone following the movement with his eyes she was soft in the way of a woman but with an underlying toughness he thought she hadnt even begun to tap they were only two of the layers he was determined to explore dont diana whispered the word as his eyes came back to hers in them she saw both desire and decision i make a habit of touching what i mean to have diana he ran both hands up her cheeks combing his fingers through her hair until her face was unframed you stir something in me he told her before his mouth reached hers she could have stopped it as her arms drew him closer diana knew she could have pulled away and ordered him from her room she still had the strength to do it but his lips were so clever so tempting they whispered at hers nibbling kisses promises of endless delight as his hands slid beneath her sweater up the smooth skin of her back he knew how to pleasure a woman perhaps the largest part of his appeal was that caine wanted to give pleasure as much as receive it he knew all the tricks the slow subtle moves of seduction but now with her pliant in his arms her mouth growing hungrier on his he forgot them her scent was clouding his mind until he was crushing her against him with too much need for finesse she was luring him and it was he who was seduced before he knew the rules had changed he heard a moan low with longing and dimly realized the sound had been pulled from him his hands were in her hair again fingers grasping unaware of their strength as he drew in all the hot honeyed tastes of her mouth and she met him fire for fire touch for touch diana knew nothing beyond the tide of sensation the taste and feel of him dominated everything and still wasnt enough her tongue met his again and again deeper intimacy hotter passion but she only hungered for more for the first time she fully understood the power and allure of greed his hands ran down her body lingering at the sides of her breasts before they continued on over her waist and hips he moulded her like a sculptor learning the life and feel in his clay and somehow she knew he understood her body as clearly as if she had been naked caine tore his mouth from hers to stare down at her with eyes dark and fiercely intense it seemed this time hed been hit with the unexpected aching desire when hed have chosen careless carefree passion i want you his breath came fast as he smothered her lips again now diana right now it was his anger that excited her and that made her break free i turning away she pushed her hands through her hair im not ready for this not with you damn it diana churning with needs he spun her around no she shoved at him gaining a few inches of distance i dont know whats going on inside of me right now everythings happening too fast but i know i wont be one of caine macgregors women his eyes narrowed but he made no move toward her you dont stop putting people into slots do you im going to put my life back together caine im not going to let you complicate it complicate it he repeated with soft deadly control all right diana you do what you have to do he stepped toward her then but still didnt touch her but boston isnt such a big town and this case is a long way from closed though her throat was dry she spoke evenly is that a threat counsellor he smiled then slowly its a promise cupping her chin he gave her a hard brief kiss then turned and left the room diana didnt let out her breath until she heard the door close behind him this was all she needed she thought as she looked at her tangle of halfpacked clothes hed only gotten to her because her emotions were so confused and close to the surface if there was one thing shed learned to do over the years it was to hold her own with men in the courtroom and the bedroom caine macgregor would have been no different if he hadnt been there when shed already been vulnerable she wouldnt think of it now diana closed her eyes and waited for her system to calm if they were to meet again in boston shed be more steady on her feet now she had to face herself and her brother and twenty years of deceit before she could weaken diana hurried out of the suite and down the hall toward the penthouse he might not be back yet she thought as she lifted her hand to knock if hes not she told herself ill go down to his office and wait it has to be now her hand hesitated and nearly dropped i have to do it now straightening her shoulders diana knocked then held her breath justin opened it barechested a shirt slung over his shoulder and his hair still damp from a shower diana were you looking for serena no i her eyes were drawn to the jagged white scar along his ribs painfully she swallowed may i come in of course after closing the door he watched her fingers lace and unlace as she walked to the centre of the room would you like some coffee a drink no no nothing she gripped her fingers together again and let them fall in front of her you go ahead sit down diana no i her voice trailed off and she shook her head helplessly no what is it it would be easier if she didnt have to look at him she thought easier if she could be a coward and turn away as she said the words diana kept her eyes on his i want to apologize justin lifted a brow as he started to slip on his shirt what for for everything i havent done or said since i came here he watched her as he buttoned his shirt but his eyes told her nothing he knew how to keep his thoughts to himself she realized that was why he was a gambler and a success at it you have nothing to apologize for diana justin his name came out in a plea as she stepped toward him stopping herself diana turned away a moment im not doing this well strange i make my living stringing the right words together but i just cant find them diana you dont have to do this he wanted to touch her but thinking shed only stiffen he slipped his hands into his pockets i dont expect you to feel anything gathering her courage again she faced him i owe you she said quietly instantly his eyes were remote and unfathomable you owe me nothing everything she corrected justin you should have told me she said with sudden passion i had a right to know to know what he countered coolly stop it she demanded and grabbed his shirtfront with both hands he thought as he looked down at her that there was more of the girl he remembered than hed realized here was the verve and the fire lifting a brow he studied her stubborn furious face you always were a brat he murmured perhaps if you calm down you might tell me whats on your mind stop treating me as though i were still six years old she demanded as her fingers tightened on his shirt it amused him to hear her shout and wiped away the image of the cool sophisticate who had walked back into his life a few days before stop behaving as though you were he advised thereve been things youve wanted to say to me since i walked into this room and found you here say them now diana took a deep breath shed wanted to apologize not to shout and accuse but the control shed practiced so scrupulously for so many years was lost all those years i resented you even tried to hate you for forgetting me i think i understand that he said steadily no shaking her head she dug her fingers into his shirt in frustration tears began to gather and spill but she didnt wipe them away because she didnt feel them how could you when i could never tell you i lost everything so quickly justin lost everyone her voice trembled but she couldnt steady it i thought at first all of you had left because i was too much trouble he made a soft sound and touched her for the first time a hand absently passed through her hair as he had done from time to time so many years before i didnt know how to make you understand you were so small i understand now diana began justin she broke on the word fighting off a sob she had to say it all even if he turned away after she was done everything you did for me was necessary he cut her off and was no longer touching her no more no less justin please she didnt know how to ask for love if she had one lingering fear it was to try and to fail while he watched she struggled for words i want to thank you she managed youve every right to be angry but theres nothing ive done you have to thank me for she bit down on her lip to stop the trembling you felt obligated she murmured no he touched her again just the tips of her hair i loved you her lips parted but there was no sound he was offering her love he wouldnt accept gratitude she wouldnt give him tears instead diana reached for his hand be my friend justin felt something unknot in his stomach slowly he brought her hand to his lips then spreading her fingers he placed her palm to his were blood little sister ive always loved you from today were friends from today she agreed and curled her fingers around his chapter four it was bitterly cold in defence diana had the car heater turned up full as she fought her way through sluggish boston traffic oncoming headlights glared off her windshield so that she kept her eyes narrowed and tried not to remember that her ankles were freezing by the time her car warmed up she thought fatalistically shed already be inside the restaurant she considered it a wise move on her part to meet matt fairman for dinner as assistant district attorney he had his ear to the ground in her current professional position she didnt think it prudent to refuse the offer of a casual dinner date even when shed rather be home huddled in a warm robe drinking tea and watching an old movie diana didnt feel she could afford to offend anyone with marts kind of connections or to pass up the opportunity to make a few points on her own behalf in any case she was confident she could handle him on a personal level she always had and he was nice enough she mused shivering inside her coat if you overlooked the fact that his mind worked on two levels the law and women matt was a good lawyer she reminded herself she thought but couldnt be sure that her feet were beginning to thaw pushing this aside she concentrated on matt besides being a good lawyer and a shrewd politician matt had the inside story on every important case being tried or pending in the boston area he was also a gossip if diana wanted it known that she was now out on her own shed do better with a few words in marts ear than a fullpage ad in the boston globe shed resigned from barclay stevens and fitz the week she had returned from atlantic city it had been her way of making a stand against her aunts manipulating diana knew she was taking a chance both financially and professionally and in the two weeks following the break shed had her share of small panic attacks barclay was security not only a steady paycheck but a steady stream well at least a trickle of cases but barclay had been her aunts choice she considered the abrupt termination her first real step toward independence she didnt regret the decision or the twinges of doubt about the future on a bad day she pictured herself sharing office space with another struggling lawyer waiting for the phone to ring hoping to defend someone over a speeding ticket on a good day diana told herself that she was going to fight her way up the ladder rung by rung if diana had a regret it was that shed had so little time with justin once theyd made peace but she had felt it was essential that she get back to boston and sort out her professional life resigning from barclay had to be done while the heat of anger the sting of betrayal was still fresh before diana had thought shed reasoned it out too well it was too easy to be nervous to think of all the consequences instead she convinced herself that she was in a hurry to start carving out a place and a name for herself and she discovered she was in a hurry to start exploring diana blade all the parts of herself she had tucked away for so many years thered been another reason for her leaving atlantic city a few days ahead of schedule caine macgregor diana acknowledged the fact that she had wanted to put some distance between them particularly after that last emotional interlude before she had spoken to justin caine was getting to her a man like caine made an art out of getting to women she mused smooth one minute roughedged and arrogant the next it was a hard combination to resist and she was certain he knew it his reputation with women had been well circulated since his college days circumstances or perhaps fate had dictated that she had heard of his exploits through her years at harvard and then through their mutual associates in boston diana had already known too much of caine macgregor before theyd ever come face to face but itd been then that the problem had jelled if it had been simply a physical attraction diana felt she could have handled it well enough she was used to practicing selfdenial and an affair with caine was out of the question they had too many ties both in business and now in family he was by choice and reputation a womanizer she was by choice and reputation cautious but it was more than desire he kept reaching inside her and stirring emotions she couldnt define she wasnt ready to define them so diana approached the problem logically first by admitting there was one then by removing herself from it now she considered it solved because it was past launching her own practice would take all her time and energy for months to come the prospect unnerved her excited her though shed yet to find suitable office space and her list of clients was still pitifully short shed been alone before she reminded herself alone and without resources this time there wouldnt be an aunt adelaide to trade security for obedience this time shed make her own decisions her own mistakes her own triumphs she knew exactly what she wanted work challenge success all she needed was the chance to find it when diana found a parking space quickly in the crowded lot she considered it an omen things were going to work out according to plan because she refused to allow it to happen any other way the cold bit through her coat as she hurried across the lot a hard icy rain had begun to fall making the asphalt treacherous and oddly beautiful in the glow of streetlamps she ignored her freezing legs by imagining herself already sitting near the fire in the lounge a glass of white wine the soothing notes from the piano the scent of burning wood the rush of warm air as she opened the door brought out a sigh of pure appreciation after checking her coat diana approached the maitre d diana blade has mr fairman arrived yet the maitre d glanced quickly at the list on his podium not as yet ms blade when he does would you tell him im waiting in the lounge diana moved toward the large comfortable room where sofas and armchairs were scattered around a huge stone fireplace the flames were high fed by thick oak logs that burned with a sweet forest smell the lighting was soft just flickering into the shadowy corners while the hum of conversation and laughter lent an atmosphere of a large family party diana spotted an empty chair and though it was farther from the fire than she might have liked she settled down to wait id like to take off my shoes she mused and curl up right here for the next hour just watching the fire one day ill have a house of my own she decided and a room something like this no tidy little parlour like the one on beacon hill with its sedate wellbehaved fire id lie on the floor and listen to it roaring watch the shadows and lights dance on the ceiling with a sigh she snuggled deeper into the chair im getting sentimental she decided with a glance at her watch considering the weather and traffic there was plenty of time for a drink before matt joined her even as diana scanned the room for a waiter one wheeled a small table beside her chair diana glanced at the bottle of champagne as he drew the cork an excellent year she thought with a twinge of regret im sorry youve made a mistake i didnt order that the gentleman would like to buy you a drink ms blade really diana turned her head as the waiter filled a glass when she saw him she felt a flare of excitement she couldnt quite convince herself was annoyance he had after all told her boston wasnt such a big town hello caine diana taking her hand he lifted it to his lips watching her eyes over it may i join you it seems only fair she gestured toward the champagne and two glasses it occurred to her that he looked every bit the smooth sophisticated attorney in the slategrey suit then she remembered how natural he had looked in the short leather jacket and jeans it wouldnt be wise to forget the less genteel side of him how are you she asked lifting one of the glasses im fine he sat back studying her over the rim of his glass he remembered her dress as one she had thrown onto the bed in a rage it was thin turquoise silk and glowed against her skin her choice of colours he mused was very much like her choice of scent vibrant and daring diana lifted a brow as he continued to stare at her in silence are you here alone mmhmm sipping she allowed the champagne to linger on her tongue for a moment cold and dry the icy rain outside was already forgotten im meeting matt fairman i suppose you know him yes caine returned with a hint of a smile i know him thinking about working for the da now youve resigned from barclay no i trailing off she narrowed her eyes how did you know i resigned i asked he answered simply what are your plans diana frowned at him a moment then deliberately relaxed i plan to open my own firm when as soon as i take care of a few details have you located an office yet thats one of the details with a frown she ran a finger around the rim of her glass she didnt want to discuss her problems with caine certainly not her doubts diana shrugged as though it were indeed only a detail rather than her entire life teetering in the balance it isnt quite as easy as i anticipated if i want a good location and reasonable rent absently she touched her damp finger to her tongue i have three possibilities to check out tomorrow her unconsciously provocative gesture was arousing caine felt something warm moving through him but checked it thered be other times he promised himself other places i might know of some office space youd be interested in really as she shifted toward him her hair swung to her cheek to be quickly tossed back its on the other side of the river within a couple of t stops from the courthouse he drank noting that the silk clung nicely draping down from snug shoulders hed been wondering for weeks what those strong shoulders would feel like under his hands the trouble was hed also been wondering how she was doing on her own back in boston now that shed learned about her aunt and justin hed wondered particularly after hed heard shed resigned her position the concern he felt worried caine a great deal more man the desire a twostory brownstone he continued its been remodelled to accommodate a reception area conference rooms offices it sounds wonderful i cant think why the agent im going through hasnt mentioned it unless diana thought as she lifted her champagne again it was a matter of the rent being as wonderful as his description she wasnt going to touch the trust fund her aunt had set up for her her aunt she corrected silently or justin in any case she wasnt going to touch a penny she hadnt earned on her own how did you happen to hear of it she asked him i know the landlord caine remarked as he poured more champagne for both of them diana caught something in the tone and studied him thoughtfully you are the landlord very quick he toasted her ignoring the humour in his eyes she sat back crossing her legs if you own such a marvellous building why arent you using it yourself i am that colour suits you very well diana she drummed her fingers lightly on the arm of her chair why should i be interested in your office my caseloads packed he told her so briskly businesslike it took her a moment to make the transition im going to have to turn away some clients for the simple reason that i wont be able to give them my best in terms of time and energy she lifted a hand palm up so interested her brows drew together as she took a deep breath in your clients in making them your clients he countered interested she thought shed stand on her head in a snowdrift for the chance at a few choice cases diana resisted the urge to kiss his feet she had to be practical i appreciate it caine but im not interested in forming a partnership at this time neither am i confused she shook her head then what are you i happen to have some space in my building you could rent i have some cases im going to have to refuse or refer i prefer to refer them as yet he hadnt completely worked out why he wanted to refer them to her she was family thats what he told himself he let the stem of the glass twist between his fingers its a simple matter of supply and demand diana was silent for a long moment caine knew that though her eyes had that heavylidded sleepy look she was thinking carefully he almost smiled he rather liked the way she plotted her way from point a to point b by god she was even more beautiful than hed remembered and it had barely been two weeks hed resisted the urge to call her until tonight when hed finally accepted he wasnt going to get her out of his head still hed told himself he was just checking on her one family member to another her answering service had told him where to find her hed come on impulse with the offer hed just made her already forming in his brain if she accepted hed have the advantage and the disadvantage of being around her every day that was business he reminded himself once theyd settled that hed begin on the nights if she was indeed going to begin a discovering of diana blade he wanted to be around for it caine she began bringing her eyes back to his its very tempting but id like to ask you a question sure why settling back he lit a cigarette ive given you the professional one we might add that you and i are inlaws in a manner of speaking your family obligations again she said flatly i prefer the word loyalty he countered her face cleared with a look of surprised consideration before she smiled at him so do i think about it reaching in his jacket pocket he drew out a business card heres the address come by tomorrow and take a look she couldnt afford to turn her nose up at a readymade solution thank you i will diana reached for the card and found her hand caught in his their eyes met his confident hers wary i like the way you look in silk he murmured drinking champagne with just a touch of firelight in your eyes his thumb skimmed over her knuckles and the buzz of conversation around them vanished ive thought about you diana as his voice deepened intimately she felt a thick enervating flow of desire her hand went limp in his ive thought about the way you look he said quietly the way you smell taste the way you feel pressed against me dont the word was a whisper the whisper desire itself dont do this i want to make love to you for hours until your bodys weak and your minds full of me only me dont she said again and pulled her hand free diana sat back quickly her breathing unsteady how could he make her feel as though shed been ravaged with just words her body was throbbing as though his hands already knew it he knew it she reminded herself it was a skill he had one hed honed to perfection this wont work she managed at length no seeing her struggle against need gave him a small thrill of power and of pleasure on the contrary diana its going to work very well diana picked up her champagne again and drank steadier she brought her eyes back to his i need office space and i need clients she took a deep breath wondering if her pulse would ever slow to a normal rate again i also need an atmosphere of professionalism the offer was and is strictly professional counsellor he told her with a fresh gleam of humour in his eyes whether you take it or not has nothing to do with other aspects of our relationship nor will it change whats going to happen between us cant you get it through your head i dont want any relationship with you she tossed back i dont intend for anything to happen between us then it shouldnt matter if we work in the same building should it with another smile caine set his card on the table beside her i find it difficult to believe youre afraid of me diana you strike me as a very strongwilled woman her eyes chilled im not afraid of you caine good he said amiably then ill see you tomorrow fairmans just walked in so ill get out of your way rising he brushed her cheek with a friendly kiss enjoy your evening love annoyed diana watched him walk off damn the man for stirring her up snatching his card from the table she ripped it in two the hell with him she told herself he could take his office and his clients and jump in the boston harbour afraid a tiny voice asked her with a sound of frustration diana opened her purse and dropped the pieces of his card inside no she wasnt afraid and she wasnt going to cut off her professional nose because caine macgregor could drain a woman with a few soft words shed go to his office diana vowed and drank the rest of her champagne in one impulsive swallow and if the accommodations suited her shed grab them no one was going to stop her from getting where she was going not even herself in the morning diana checked out two of the addresses given to her by the rental agent the first was a positive no the second a definite maybe instead of going to the third on her list she found herself steering toward the address on caines business card shed treat it exactly as she had treated the other potential offices diana reminded herself she would be objective consider the space and location the rent and the condition of the building she couldnt afford to let the fact that it was caines building influence her one way or the other with any luck caine would be out of the office and his secretary would show her around the decision diana thought would come more easily without him there she loved it the moment she saw it the building was rather narrow old and beautifully preserved it had the quiet elegance found in boston snuggled in the midst of steelandglass skyscrapers there were patches of snow on the lawn but the tiny parking area beside it was scraped clean pale grey smoke puffed out of the chimney as she started up the flagstone walk diana glanced around there was a naked oak standing sentinel in the yard a long trim hedge separating yard from sidewalk the courthouse was less than a mile away so far diana reflected its too good to be true the door was thick and carved beside it was a discreet brass plaque caine macgregor attorney at law it wasnt difficult for her to imagine a similar plaque below it with her name scrolled back up diana she warned herself you havent even seen the inside yet still as she opened the door she remembered caines comment a few weeks before about fate the reception area was done in rose and ivory duncan phyfe tables flanked a carved arm settee diana caught the scent of fresh flowers from the mix of blooms in a thin cutglass vase the floor was hardwood gleaming and bare except for a faded aubusson carpet the mantelpiece was pink grained marble topped by a long oval minor below it a fire crackled eagerly style diana thought instantly caine macgregor had style behind a satinwood desk a roundfaced middleaged woman had a phone tucked between her shoulder and ear as she pounded the keys of a typewriter the surface of the desk was buried under stacks of files scraps of paper and legal pads she gave diana a wide smile then hardly breaking rhythm gestured toward the settee mr macgregors schedule is filled through next wednesday she said into the phone in a surprisingly girlish voice i can give you an appointment thursday afternoon she stopped typing long enough to dig a thick date book out from under the wreckage of her desk onefifteen she continued shuffling more papers until she found the stub of a pencil yes mrs patterson thats his first free slot onefifteen on thursday then yes ill get back to you if he has a cancellation she scribbled in the book pushed it aside then began typing again with a faint lift of brow at the procedure diana slipped out of her coat and laid it on the arm of the settee yes ill be sure to tell him goodbye mrs patterson the secretary paused in her typing long enough to replace the receiver and smile at diana good afternoon may i help you im diana blade oh yes the woman cut into dianas explanation and rose revealing that the rest of her body was as round as her face mr macgregor said you might be dropping by today im lucy robinson how do you do diana found her hand taken for a firm brisk shake you seem to be very busy diana began perhaps it would be better if i made an appointment nonsense lucy gave her a maternal pat on the arm mr macgregors with a client but he gave me orders to show you around ill take you upstairs youll want to see your office first before diana could explain that it wasnt her office yet lucy was moving into the hall toward a staircase shed left her typewriter on diana noticed and wondered if she should mention it mrs robinson now you just call me lucy were not formal here its more like family family diana thought with something like a sigh there seemed to be no getting away from it the staircase rose uncarpeted and without a curve the mahogany rail gleamed like satin thinking of the desk in the reception room diana decided the housekeeping wasnt lucys province the woman glided up the stairs like a ship in full sail a hairpin was dangling from the knot at the back of her neck theres a conference room downstairs and a small kitchen lucy was saying therere plenty of times we dont get out of here for lunch so its handy can you cook ahnot very well too bad lucy paused at the top of the stairs neither caine nor i are anything to rave about in the kitchen she gave diana a long look that was as friendly as it was assessing he didnt tell me you were so pretty youre a connection of his arent you diana took a moment to work out the conversation i suppose you could say so my brother married his sister knew it was something like that lucy said with a nod caines office is through there used to be the master bedroom yours is just down the hall here with a glance at the door they passed diana continued down the hall its a lovely house she commented caine doesnt seem to have made too many changes in the structure to turn it into offices only took a couple of walls out lucy agreed he said hed had enough of working in four dull walls and brown carpeting i say when a body spends most of their day in a place it ought to be comfortable mmmm diana thought about her cubbyhole at barclay stevens and fitz the carpet had been brown there too she remembered have you worked for caine long i worked for him when he was states attorney lucy told her when he asked me if i wanted to work for him in his private practice i packed up my desk and went here you are lucy pushed open a door then stepped back to let diana enter it was too perfect diana thought as she walked into the empty room small but not cramped with two sashed windows that faced east her heels echoed on the wood floor bouncing to the high ceiling as she crossed to a neat white marble hearth the wallpaper was silk faded a bit but still beautiful she could easily see the room furnished with a trim federal desk a few comfortable chairs perhaps a small victorian love seat with a low table she could have a shelf on the north wall for her law books if she wanted to begin her practice with style she would never find anything more appropriate im surprised caine hasnt found a use for this room diana thought aloud oh he had it furnished for a while hed stay here instead of going home when he was working late lucy discovered the pin trailing onto her neck and shoved it back into place then he decided it was getting too easy to spend his life here caines dedicated but hes not obsessed i see the law librarys up here lucy went on thats where he had the walls taken out theres a powder room downstairs and a full bath on this floor it has the original porcelain taps oops theres my phone you just prowl around before diana could say a word she was bustling back down the hall lucy diana decided was nothing like the sharp young secretary she had shared with two other attorneys at barclay there everything had been done with quiet unshakable efficiency and the building had had all the charm of a tomb an aristocratic tomb diana reflected but a crypt was a crypt this she thought as she glanced at the faded wallpaper again was much more to her taste clients could relax here assured of a personal touch what few clients she could claim she added with a rueful smile still the location and the atmosphere would add to her caseload as much as her skill would when you were selling something it paid to sell it with flair mulling over the angles diana went back into the hall and wandered surely the mahogany wainscoting was the original she reflected no one panelled in mahogany any longer opening a door at random she found caines law library barclays was no more extensive she thought with a quick flash of professional interest a long table dominated the centre of the room on which a few books were stacked going to one that was left open diana saw it was marked state v sylvan murder one diana mused recalling the case from her studies at harvard it had been a volatile splashy affair in the late seventies national publicity packed courtrooms and a long emotional trial just what she wondered was caine working on that he was digging for precedents here intrigued she bent over the book and began to read when caine came to the doorway ten minutes later she was engrossed he didnt speak for a moment realizing that it was the first time he had seen her completely selfabsorbed there was the faintest line of concentration between her brows and her lips were slightly parted shed rested both palms on the table as shed leaned over so that the jacket of her suit a deep vivid red this time fit snugly over her back her hair was tucked behind her ear revealing round flutededged earrings of etched gold he could picture her in court in that outfit or at an elegant formal tea he knew when he stepped closer that her scent would be there making hundreds of dark promises cautious he dipped his hands into his pockets and remained where he was interesting reading dianas head jerked up at his voice but she straightened slowly state versus sylvan she tapped the open book with a finger a fascinating case the defence pulled everything but a rabbit out of its hat over the threemonth trial olearys a hell of a defence attorney if a bit flashy for some tastes leaning against the jamb he studied her the light coming in the window at her back slanted across the hands that still rested on the table still after two appeals he lost she pointed out his client was guilty the prosecution put together a very carefully structured case diana ran a fingertip down the opened book do you have a similar one or is this just casual reading he smiled for the first time virginia day he said then waited for her reaction the sleepy look in her eyes was replaced by quick interest youre defending her thats right diana knew the story from scraps in the news and speculation from other attorneys a society murder unfaithful husband jealous wife a small deadly revolver you dont pick easy ones do you he only gave her a shrug for an answer lucy tells me she showed you the office yes i saw evidence of her untidiness and disorganization diana began with a faint smile as well as an almost terrifying efficiency the only thing i didnt catch was her addiction to soaps she has a tape machine at home with a timer diana laughed turning toward him fully youre joking no unless youve got the better part of an hour i wouldnt ask her about any plots with a chuckle she crossed toward him your building is very impressive caine im forced to admit its better than anything else ive looked at forced to he countered discovering hed been right about her scent id half hoped that it would be totally unsuitable so that i wouldnt have to make a decision did you buy the furniture yourself yes ive a weakness for auctions and antique shops and then i dont trust anyone elses judgment when it comes to something i have to live with very sensible my aunt had her home redecorated professionally every three years it never reflected anything tell me diana steepled her fingers pressing them against her bottom lip a moment if i dont take the office space will you lease it out anyway not necessarily again he found it almost sinful that such hands should be unadorned im not willing to spend so much time in the same place with someone im not sure is compatible her brow lifted in amusement and you think you and i are compatible i think you and i will deal with each other well enough diana why dont we go into the office and sit down as they started up the hall caine glanced at her i can have lucy bring up some coffee if youd like no im fine and she has more than enough to do his office was large but craftily dominated by an antique oak desk like lucys it was loaded with files and pads but it reflected a scrupulous organization that hers lacked obviously he hadnt been exaggerating about his workload the fire was lit here too burning greedily as though hed just added fresh logs from the woodbox beside it rather than black framed degrees caine had hung a pair of vivid watercolours that picked up the faded tints in the wallpaper diana took one long look around before she chose a sheridan chair very nice she commented as he took the chair next to her i wont keep you caine according to lucy your schedules full through next week i think i can squeeze in a few minutes drawing out a cigarette he allowed his shoulders to relax against the back of the chair hed just spent an hour with a hysterical client who was too close to jumping bail for comfort it had taken caine threequarters of that time to calm him down since you dont find the accommodations unsuitable it seems you have that decision to make after all yes diana felt the warmth from the fire reach out to her and sighed id like to take it caine of course theres the matter of terms blowing out a stream of smoke he named an amount that was within her budget but stiff enough to absolve her feelings of accepting charity lucys agreeable to taking on your work until youre settled then itll be between you and her if you want to continue that way or hire your own secretary diana digested this with a nod then took the next steps all right i think we can come to an agreement as to the matter of your referring clients to me im not sure im comfortable with that why not he countered werent you hoping for a little quick advertisement by having dinner with fairman last night diana glared at him a moment smouldered then settled back i dont particularly like the way you put it but yes thats a bit different from what youre talking about if you dont want them ill send them to someone else he said simply at the moment there are two id like to take but simply cant the day case alone is going to require hundreds of hours she itched to ask for details but made herself wait why would you refer them to me you dont know if im any good or not on the contrary i checked you out you what he smiled briefly at her indignation you wouldnt expect me to recommend clients to an attorney unless i knew they were competent would you you cant have it both ways diana she let out a frustrated breath shed certainly backed herself into that corner no all right what two cases am i considering the first is a rape charge the kids nineteen hothead bad reputation he claims the girl was willing several times in fact then theyd had a blowup the next thing he knew he was being booked the second is a divorce case the wifes the plaintiff when she came in here her left eye was swollen closed and she was going to require extensive dental surgery wifebeating diana said with a surge of disgust apparently according to her its been going on for some time but shes reached her threshold hes countersuing her on desertion charges he has the power because he has the money and as yet shes reluctant to charge him formally with battery its going to be a mess never let it be said youre tossing me anything simple she murmured id like to talk to them both next week good youll draw up the contract for the lease then ill have it ready for you monday ill let you get back to work with a smile she rose it appears ill have to buy myself a desk diana saved the moment of excitement of anticipation for later when she was alone thank you caine she added extending her hand i do appreciate you giving me first shot at this ill take the gratitude now you might not feel so amenable after youve talked to these two people standing he accepted her hand business concluded he stated now lifting a finger caine toyed with the wide bow of her blouse have dinner with me tonight how easily his voice could take on that soft ultimate tone she thought feeling her blood heat in instant response i think it would be much wiser if we concentrated on the business caine at the appropriate time he murmured she had a preference for silk he mused as he ran a fingertip over the knot in the bow soft materials flashy colours my mind begins to move toward other things on cold windy friday nights theres a little place in the back bay where the fish is fresh and the cheese isnt in a corner theres a table the light barely reaches you can smell the candle wax and never see anyone you know he gently traced the line of her earlobe idly fingering the gold she wore there id like to take you drink wine hear you laugh then later id take you home and light the fire slowly his eyes skimmed over her face lingering on each feature yes hed like to do all those things and watch the changes in those features the softening the opening and the yielding he was going to do those things he vowed as something knotted in his stomach he understood women didnt he and what they looked for in a lover id make love to you until the fire was only embers hed stepped closer but she hadnt noticed her unsteady breath feathered over his lips he painted a picture with his words that she could see much too clearly hed be a terrifying lover the kind women longed for even knowing they might not survive the experience and she wanted him more than she had known she could ever want a man wanted him knowing she would just be one more woman on his list it was this that had her backing away no but the denial wasnt as strong as she would have wished that isnt what i want it is he corrected caine pulled her into his arms and kissed her with an anger his quiet words had hidden deeper and deeper he drove her ripping response from her exploiting the panicked excitement that had her clinging even while she told herself to pull away with one hand he gripped her hair drawing her head back so that he could have his fill of her he thought of what separated her skin from his hands thin wool and fragile silk the struggle built rapidly almost painfully to concentrate on her mouth alone and prevent his hands from pulling aside the trim tailored suit to find her the days that he had gone without touching her crowded in on him pushing him far beyond gentleness he knew what it was to want a woman but not to want one with a force that bordered on violence it wasnt his way yet he pulled her closer and ravaged her mouth seemed fused to his ignoring her mental commands to break free part of her a part that seemed to be growing stronger was driving her to submit and more to demand wild passionate thoughts spun in her head threatening to unleash something that might never be completely tamed again it was tempting so tempting to let it free to let it sweep her wherever the current ran then with a sound that was as much from fear as anger diana yanked out of his arms no she said again and her voice rose with the words im telling you this is not what i want caines eyes lit with something closer to fury than desire but his voice was calm enough he wasnt used to having his desire mixed with anger and struggled to find his normal balance it is he repeated but i can wait a bit longer for you to admit it youll have a long wait she snapped thensnatched up her purse with a hand that wasnt steady you have the papers ready monday and ill have a check if you cant handle things that way then well forget it caine said nothing as she stormed out didnt flinch as the sound of the slamming door vibrated through the room a log broke apart and fell with a shower of sparks he needed a moment to get a firm grip on his temper he hadnt meant to lose it indeed he had promised himself he wouldnt hed been in tense courtrooms with the opposing attorney baiting him hed sat in grim conference rooms at the state penitentiary with clients cursing him and hed had perfect control diana could obliterate it with a word a look something unexpected was happening he wasnt precisely certain what it was if he were smart caine mused as his brain started to clear again hed do exactly as she demanded they could be colleagues discuss current cases dissect points of law and complain about judges but he wasnt smart caine decided waiting for the need that clawed in his stomach to ease he was going to have her and it wasnt going to be as long a wait as she thought chapter five why would anyone be hammering in the middle of the night diana asked herself as she pulled the covers over her head the sound of thudding continued to come through loud and clear she buried her face under her pillow as she promised herself she was going to lodge a complaint with the management it took less than thirty seconds for her to realize she had to give up or suffocate surfacing diana gave a disgusted sigh and opened her eyes seventhirty she thought groggily as she glanced at the clock not the middle of the night but close enough on a saturday morning and it wasnt hammering she realized but someone knocking on her door muttering curses under her breath she rose and tugged on a robe all right she shouted belting the robe as she went im coming diana pulled open the door so that it hit the security chain with a thud hi caine grinned through the crack did i wake you after one fulminating glare diana slammed the door in his face there was a moments consideration then she unlatched the chain hed just start pounding again what do you want she demanded as she yanked the door open its nice to see you too caine brushed a brief kiss over her lips before he walked by her clamping her teeth together diana shut the door and leaned back against it do you know what time it is sure its seven thirtyfive he announced after checking his watch got any coffee no diana tightened the belt of her robe with a jerk its seven thirtyfive on saturday morning she added meaningfully mmhmm he agreed in an absent murmur as he poked around the room it was far from finished diana was being very particular in furnishing what she considered her first real home the first at least that no one could take away from her there was an oriental rug shed bargained for in a secondhand store an elegant rococo sofa that had taken a huge bite out of her savings and a french provincial coffee table she had refinished herself in the basement of the apartment building her one good painting had been bought only that fall in paris caine slipped his hands into the pockets of his jeans as he studied these and the few other pieces shed chosen they were like her classy individual and carefully placed i like it he said at length youre putting a lot of yourself into this place shall i tell you just what your approval means to me diana asked not bothering to smother a yawn hmm touchy this morning he murmured giving her a brief glance three times on the brief trip from his place to hers hed asked himself what the hell he was doing hed gotten three different answers so hed stopped asking why dont i make that coffee youre not staying diana began as he headed for the kitchen ill be glad to no problem caine be patient she ordered herself dont lose your temper i was sleeping some people like to sleep late on saturdays throws your whole system off he told her as he began to root through cupboards thats why so many people have to drag themselves out of bed on mondays he found a can of coffee and began to measure it out then just as theyre getting the hang of it again around comes saturday and they blow it thats very profound im sure she said as sarcastically as her groggy brain would allow i dont mind dragging myself out of bed on mondays maybe i even like dragging myself out of bed on mondays she ran a frustrated hand through her sleeptumbled hair seventhirty in the morning was a perfect time to lose your temper diana concluded what the hell are you doing here making coffee unless youre hungry caine sent her an easy amiable grin id fix breakfast but about the best i can do is scramble eggs no i dont want any breakfast diana retorted rudely then rubbed her fingers over her eyes i cant believe im standing here having this ridiculous conversation itll make more sense after youve had your coffee after switching the pot on caine turned back to her she was even lovelier now he thought with her hair mussed and the faint flush of sleep still in her cheeks her mouth would be warm and soft i think ive already told you once that youre beautiful in the mornings oh sure she muttered on a frustrated breath really he cupped her chin in his hand as she continued to glare at him it probably has something to do with your skin with his thumb he traced just under her jawline there was sweetness there and strength he couldnt resist trying to draw out both tell me do you use some mystical indian potion i dont know any mystical indian potions she managed as his thumb swept slowly back and forth and your coffees ready is it caine turned and poured a cup are you having any i might as well since its obvious im not getting any more sleep gracelessly she pulled open the refrigerator and found the milk smiling at her back caine took his cup into the living room hed have to remember saturday mornings the next time he wanted to have her at a disadvantage we have nearly the same view he told her my apartments only about a block away isnt that handy fate he countered as he took a seat on the sofa and made himself at home fantastic isnt it one day very soon im going to tell you what you can do with that fate of yours she took the seat beside him resting her elbow on the arm of the sofa and her head on her open palm letting her lashes lower she yawned again not bothering to conceal a grin caine settled back lucy has the draft of the lease agreement she should have it ready early monday afternoon fine i intend to do some shopping today with luck i can have a few things delivered early in the week the coffee was hot and no better than she made herself diana resented knowing shed be fully awake before shed half finished it good idea ill go with you where shopping i appreciate the offer but its not necessary im sure you have other things to do not really then he laughed leaning over to tug on her hair why is it i find it irresistible when you tell me to go to hell so politely she gave him a long cool stare i have absolutely no idea i like spending time with you diana at ease caine sat back again but his eyes never left hers why do you have such a difficult time accepting that i dont that is i do but hes doing it to me again she realized and frowned into her coffee theres three reasons he continued settling back were family were associates caine paused watching her continue to frown in consideration and im attracted to you he said simply not just that rather fascinating face but to all the quirks in your mind i dont have a quirky mind she objected then rose stuffing her hands in her pockets she paced to the window she could accept the associates she was trying to accept the family without completely understanding it but you confuse me with a sudden passion that surprised them both diana whirled back i dont want to be confused i want to know exactly what im doing why im doing it how im doing it when im around you for too long theres all these blank spots in my head she gestured then dropped her hand again damn it caine i cant afford to have you popping up and making me forget things every time i start to work them out intrigued by the abrupt burst of temper he watched her calmly then took a slow sip of coffee have you ever considered letting things work themselves out no she shook her head i let my life drift for too many years not anymore in other words he set down his coffee and rose eyeing her thoughtfully because of a set of circumstances you couldnt avoid youre going to shut yourself off from whatever feelings or desires you have for me because they dont suit your current plans yes all right knowing nothing was coming out as she wanted it to diana pulled a hand through her hair all right she repeated with a nod thats close enough thats a very weak case counsellor caine commented as he walked to her i could poke all sorts of interesting holes in it im not interested in your crossexamination she began we could settle out of court caine suggested moving closer then theres your reputation she added deliberately stepping back youve hardly kept a low profile in your pursuit of women youll never get a conviction on circumstantial evidence and hearsay he lifted his hands to her shoulders massaging gently youve got to build your case on something stronger or softly he brushed one cheek then the other with his lips you might try trusting me she felt the weakness creeping into her and forced herself to concentrate i might also try jumping out the window either way i risk a few broken bones wishing he had some defence against vulnerability caine drew away hed meant what hed said he wanted her to trust him even though he wasnt sure he could trust himself you want promises guarantees i cant give them to you diana then again he added you cant give them to me either its easier for you she began but he stopped her with a shake of his head why i dont know she let out a long weary breath it just seems it should be he clamped down on the need to just gather her into his arms until shed forgotten she had doubts forgotten to be logical with an effort he kept his hands gentle he wasnt certain what his own motivations were perhaps hed never had to dissect them before he knew he wanted to introduce her to new things excitement fun passions the knight beating down the walls for the captured princess caine thought ruefully in any case he could work out the reasons tomorrow look get dressed spend the day with me the circumstances when we met werent the best why dont we take a little time and see what else we can come up with im not sure i want to know what else we can come up with she muttered did justin really get all the gambling blood diana his eyes were so appealing when he smiled she felt herself weakening again i dont know i used to think so whats a lawyer but a gambler figuring odds on the law caine countered the tension was easing out of her shoulders so he resisted the need to do any more than keep his hands light and friendly the problem might be im not thinking like a lawyer at the moment then relaxing fully she smiled if i were i could probably cite several precedents that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that i should toss you out the door and go back to bed caine considered this a moment then gave a sober nod we could probably argue that particular point of law for several hours undoubtedly diana ill be perfectly honest still smiling he twisted a lock of her hair around his finger if you dont get dressed soon im going to satisfy my curiosity and find out just what you have on under that robe she lifted a brow is that so of course we could negotiate caine rah the lapel through his thumb and forefinger but i feel obligated to warn you im fully prepared to move on this point in the very near future since you put it that way im going to take a shower fine ill just finish off the coffee caine watched her walk away letting his eyes roam down to where the robe swung across her hips diana just what do you have on under that robe she sent him a bland look over her shoulders its nothing she said nothing at all i thought as much caine murmured as the door shut behind her laughing diana pushed open the door of the shop i cant believe you did that i just cant believe it caine followed her in shutting out the cold it was a simple matter of truth he said mildly i did see that identical lamp downtown twenty dollars cheaper but did you have to tell that woman in front of the shopkeeper caine shrugged hed be wiser to keep his prices competitive he was about to have apoplexy diana remembered with another smothered chuckle id have died of embarrassment if i hadnt been concentrating so hard on not laughing ill never be able to go in there again i wouldnt until he lowers his prices shaking back her hair she narrowed her eyes to study him theres a great deal more scot in you than shows on the surface thanks lets look around diana began to browse through the antique shop toying with a collection of pewter loitering near a display of cut glass its really your fault that weve been shopping for over an hour and ive bought nothing i rather liked that corner chair she mused we can go back if you dont find anything you like better look here hed found a set of duelling pistols in a display case highland pistols caine reflected as he crouched down for a closer look yes he was sure of it noting the brass stock the butt was designed as a rams horn and there was celtic strapwork inlaid with silver eighteenth century he calculated seeing that the locks of both pistols were on the right his father would love them do you collect that sort of thing diana asked intrigued enough to stoop beside him mmm my father theyre exquisite arent they caine twisted his head giving diana as concentrated a look as hed given the pistols not many women would look at a weapon in that way she moved her shoulders theyre part of life arent they and youll remember my people were warriors she met his eyes now as yours were with a half smile she gave her attention to the guns again of course you wouldnt find a comanche with elegant pistols like these do you know what make they are theyre scottish he murmured finding himself more fascinated by her than ever that figures rising diana gave him an arch look and i suppose youll buy them and ill end up going home emptyhanded she noticed a clerk coming their way while youre haggling over the price im going to look around she left him to stroll toward the other end of the shop who would have thought shed enjoy spending her saturday poking through stores who would have thought shed begin to think of caine macgregor as both a pleasant companion and a friend shaking her head diana ran a finger over the surface of a highboy the more she was around him the easier it became to be herself there was no need to be diana blade of beacon hill oh she was tired of that socially correct polite woman yet twenty years of training had left its mark how long would it be before she wasnt surprised to hear herself shouting a lady never raises her voice diana gave a wistful sigh shed worked hard to be a lady her aunts conception of a lady all the strict little rules had been drummed into her head even when she had questioned them diana had obeyed them rebelling sporadically and she admitted discreetly those secret jaunts she had taken had been her safety valve keeping passions and emotions under control you cant change a way of life overnight diana reminded herself but she was making progress perhaps her drive to succeed in her profession was another expression of the same rebellion she couldnt wouldnt be some threepiecesuited attorney who only drew up contracts and wills she wanted more than that in court she could let some of her passion slip through there it was accepted even considered eloquent with words she could fight for what she believed the law had always fascinated her it was broad and narrow succinct and nebulous yet she had always found it solid despite its infinite angles she needed to succeed with it wanted the excitement the pressure and the glory of criminal law her mind came full circle back to caine she wanted him too diana would admit it for a moment while he was a safe distance away he made her feel need whether she wanted to or not that sharp sweet pleasure he could bring tempted her more each time perhaps that was one of the reasons she fought against it it was frightening not to have a choice diana knew that better than most shed known desire before and pleasure but shed always remained clearheaded not with caine and thats why she promised herself shed be careful very careful she glanced back to see him examining one of the pistols strange that the old beautiful weapon would look so right in his hands there was something of the aristocracy about him part scholar part wolf diana gave a quick shake of her head at the thought she was becoming fanciful yet studying him she thought she could see it there was the intelligence in his eyes and the danger there was that lean celtic face with a mouth that promised to be fierce or gentle depending on his whim a century ago he would have fought his duels with the pistols instead of words she realized and he would have won just as consistently there was something not quite civilized under the polish his wealth and upbringing had given him diana recognized it because it was as true for herself as for caine the combination might equal something more savage than either of them bargained for caine held the gun at arms length testing its weight his eyes shifted and locked on hers cool dangerous as the look held diana felt the needs building experienced the violent now familiar tugofwar between intellect and emotion the battle seemed longer this time with the result less certain by the time her intellect took control again she was shaken and weak just as if his mouth had been on hers with her body at last knowing the pleasure of his hands be very careful diana reminded herself and turned away again still idly browsing she examined a small upholstered chair a ladys chair she mused with its pale blue brocade still in excellent shape it had possibilities she thought as she turned over its discreet price tag after noting the amount diana decided it had definite possibilities as she straightened to look for a clerk she saw the desk that was it perfect with a low pleased sigh she began to examine it trim elegant cherry the desk had both the size and the lines shed hoped to find the border of the top was carved with cockleshells frivolous enough to make her smile as she ran a fingertip over them a far cry from the twentiethcentury pine that was barclays standard for his staff on the drawers were ornate brass pulls and inside the scent of cherrywood lingered mine she thought quickly possessively already diana could see it facing the fireplace in her office hopefully laden with files you found it i see beaming diana grabbed caines arm its wonderful isnt it exactly what i pictured her grip tightened as her other hand came to his ive got to have it he found it rather sweet that the practical diana blade would lose her head over a piece of furniture lacing his fingers with hers caine glanced down at the price tag on the comer of the desk then back into her excited eyes try not to look so eager he told her dryly here comes the clerk but i trust me bending his head he gave her a quick kiss sure its pretty love he began in a different tone but you have to be practical came may i be of some assistance caine turned a friendly smile on the clerk who had shown him the pistols the lady likes the desk he gave a fractional shake of his head but an exquisite piece the clerk began turning to diana he hadnt been selling for over ten years without knowing whom to play to just look at this carving no one does work like this anymore its exactly what ive been looking for she beamed at him all goodwill he could already see her writing out the check diana caine slipped his arm around her shoulder squeezing a bit harder than necessary before she could protest he brushed a kiss over her temple were going to need several other pieces remember the desk is very nice but so was the other one we looked at she opened her mouth to tell him impatiently that they hadnt looked at any other then caught the gleam in his eyes well yes but i do like this one diana trailed off struck with inspiration and that chair there she went on pointing at the little blue brocade another excellent choice madam the clerk began to think it would be a wonderful morning after all so right for a lady as the desk is diana sighed letting her finger run lovingly over the desk surface he better know what hes doing she thought grimly and shot a look at caine with a smile he patted her shoulder but youll need a chair for the desk as well and the right lamp youd almost be able to buy both of these with the difference in price between this desk and the other youre right it took effort but diana gave the clerk an apologetic smile im furnishing my office you see and there are so many things i need i understand perfectly he began to wonder if he would lose the sale of the pistols as well the pistols the desk two chairs and a lamp we like to place the right furniture with the right people he told her rather pompously why dont you let me speak to the manager im sure we could come to an agreement in terms well caine pinched her arm to prevent her from agreeing too quickly diana barely restrained herself from jabbing him with her elbow it wont hurt to listen darling she said in sweet tones that werent reflected in her eyes i suppose youre right caine gave her a smile as he met the killing look well just look at those lamps over there while youre talking to your supervisor he told the clerk if you lose that desk for me diana said under her breath as the clerk hurried toward the rear of the store ill murder you im going to save you ten percent he said easily and youre going to buy me lunch came stopped in front of a slim brass lamp with a fluted frosted shade theyll be more inclined to negotiate if they think they have to sell both of us what do you think of this he asked running a hand down the base of the lamp it goes nicely with the desk yes its lovely she toyed with the delicate shade then looked up at him you enjoy haggling dont you its in the blood my father makes his living at it and very well too diana murmured i warn you she added im going to have that desk whether he bargains or not did you want the chair too or were you making it up yes i want it diana laughed despite herself im not as devious as you stick around youll learn well the clerk came up behind them glowing with triumph i think we can come to very amicable terms fifteen minutes later diana was outside flushed with cold and pleasure how did you know hed take off ten percent experience caine claimed simply as he took her hand i can see im going to shop with an entirely different outlook from now on she tossed her hair back and grinned at him thank you for the lamp it was sweet of you to buy it for me and i suppose the pistols will go to your father mmm he has a birthday coming up you havent bought a thing for yourself she pointed out isnt there anything you want yes turning he gathered her into his arms pressing his mouth to hers the sidewalk was busy with shoppers who made their way around them with raised brows or muffled laughter diana noticed nothing the air was sharp with winter stinging her cheeks and ruffling her hair she never felt it two women stopped to stare a moment one of them sighed and said isnt that lovely diana didnt hear her hands had gone to his face and through the thin leather of her gloves she could feel the line of bone the shape of jaw a wolf she thought again you never know when theyll spring priceless caine murmured drawing her away on a long audible breath diana glanced around you enjoy having people stare dont you laughing he clasped her hands again and began to walk it really wasnt an issue how about lunch she searched for annoyance but couldnt find it i suppose i owe you that you certainly do theres a place around the corner charleys diana exclaimed surprised as caine pulled her toward the door great chilli yes i know i didnt discover it until i was in college they shared too many tastes diana thought uncomfortably as they went inside to join the warmth and the noise seeing her frown caine ran a hand through her windblown hair dont you like it here yes ive always liked it here she shook her head quickly pushing away the discomfort i was thinking of something else with the mood dispelled she gave him a smile how do you like your chilli hot laughing diana shrugged out of her coat so do i so it stops just short of cauterizing my vocal chords the atmosphere was pure victoriana with its giltedged portraits and long brassrailed bar shed stopped in from time to time during her college years knowing she wouldnt run into her aunt or any of adelaides closer friends they preferred the subdued elegance of the ritz cafe as she took her seat across from caine a group at the bar began to sing lustily how about some wine reaching across the table he took her hands itll warm you up mmm something red and heavy she allowed her hands to stay in his as he ordered shed enjoy his company the closeness for the afternoon monday morning was soon enough to get back to business tell me about your family she asked abruptly the macgregors have an almost mythical reputation in boston caine chuckled as he traced a finger over the back of her hand i suppose youll have to meet the rest of them yourself to be certain how much was fact and how much was fiction my fathers a huge redheaded scot whod probably still fight a campbell to the death he can drink a fifth of whiskey without blinking an eye but he hides his cigars from my mother he calls each one of us regularly to nag for our mothers sake he claims about our not increasing the macgregor line your mother longs to bounce a grandchild on her knee caine quoted with a perfect scottish burr diana laughed as the wine was brought to the table and what does your mother think about it my mother is a very relaxed kind of person almost a negative of my father he blusters she comments and in their own ways theyre both amazingly efficient unconsciously he began to toy with the thin gold bracelet she wore on her wrist diana acknowledged then tried to ignore as she had once before the pleasure of having his hard fingers brush against her skin ive only seen her lose that inherent serenity of hers a couple of times caine continued half to himself once i happened to be in the hospital when she lost a patient id always thought she was strictly professional almost cold about her work after that i realized she simply never brought it home with her then when rena was kidnapped seeing the change in his eyes diana tightened her fingers on his that must have been hell for all of you those hours of waiting not knowing if she was all right yeah caine shook off the lingering anger and lifted his glass then theres alan hes more like my mother very calm patient even after growing up with him im always surprised when he loses his temper you forget he has one until it rips out and knocks you down diana let the wine run warm through her system as she watched him did you fight with him often enough he said with a nod more with rena i suppose were closer in temperament and he murmured reminiscently she has a hell of a right cross diana caught the hint of pride in his voice and stared you didnt box with her did you caine grinned at the astonishment in her tone as he poured more wine there were times i wanted to do more than just defend myself and by god there were times she deserved to be knocked cold his grin widened as diana continued to stare at him with a mixture of horror and fascination no i never slugged her but that was mostly because she was nearly four years younger and quite a bit smaller i really didnt consider rena as a girl until she was about fourteen and that he murmured was quite a surprise he loves them all diana mused and it seems so easy for him you had a happy childhood she commented then looked down at her wine i was jealous about that before you know it was strange when i went to talk to justin the angrier i got the less distance there seemed to be between us with a wondering laugh she shook her head then when i wasnt angry any longer the distance was gone i was furious with you too she added looking up again for interfering and for being right i really detested you for being right its a bad habit of mine he said as their chilli was served i cant seem to break it she gave an unladylike snort and lifted her fork im beginning to think id like to come up against you in court odd ive had that thought myself it would be he decided after his first bite an interesting match he sent her a slow wolfish smile hows your chilli excellent diana kept her eyes level with his as she ate tell me counsellor are you so sure youd win i rarely lose ah the perry mason syndrome when he laughed diana found herself more pleased with the sound than she should have been it was too easy to forget her own rules when she was around him thoughtfully she lifted her wine and studied its warm red hue perhaps its too bad i didnt go for a position with the da after all she continued if i were working for the state wed be bound to cross swords sooner or later we will anyway he murmured though perhaps not in court perhaps she agreed as she felt the little tingles of excitement begin she fought them down honest enough to admit them too wary to allow them freedom but i wouldnt be too sure about winning it could be caine said slowly that when the verdict comes in well both have won a hung jury he smiled again then brought her hand to his lips the kiss was light and confident justice chapter six after spending an evening going over the police report and all the background notes caine had given her on chad rutledge diana was no longer sure caine was doing her a favour with the referral it was a messy case with several strikes against her potential client hed been anything but a model of cooperation when hed been picked up in fact diana remembered as she glanced through the file again hed taken a swing at one of the arresting officers chad had denied the rape charges then had claimed hed been intimate with beth howard the alleged victim repeatedly over a sixmonth period she denied anything but the most passing acquaintance even before the medical reports had confirmed it he had admitted to having sex with her the night of the alleged rape when beths mother had brought her to the hospital for the examination the girl had been bruised and hysterical chads knuckles had been raw yet caine seemed to believe his story with a sigh diana closed the file then rubbed the bridge of her nose shed form her own opinion theyd be bringing chad to the conference room any minute glancing around at the dingy green walls diana thought that the frivolous saturday morning shed had with caine only a few days before was lightyears away this part of her job had little to do with choosing the right desk the heavy door with its tiny thick window opened diana had her first look at chad rutledge ill be right outside miss blade the guard told her as chad dropped down in a chair at the side of the table thank you she dismissed him without a look giving her attention to her client he looked younger than in his mug shots but he had the same toughly handsome face and thick black hair she glanced at his eyes they stared straight ahead sulky disinterested then she looked at his hands they clenched and unclenched slowly as though he were working out a pain you can lie with your eyes but not with your hands remembering caines words diana sat back the boy was scared to death im diana blade she said briskly her own nerves she discovered werent as steady as she might have liked ill be taking over your case if thats agreeable with you chad shrugged and said nothing mr macgregor spoke with you and with your mother before but his workload doesnt permit him to give your case the proper time and attention it requires to insure you of the best possible defence what kind of jobs a woman going to do defending a guy for rape chad asked the wall he faced youll get the best defence i can give you regardless of your sex or mine diana returned evenly you told mr macgregor your story now id like you to tell me chad hooked an elbow carefully over the back of the wooden chair got a cigarette babe no he swore halfheartedly and pulled one bent unfiltered cigarette out of his shirt pocket at least he passed me to a looker for the first time chad turned and faced her fully there was challenge in his eyes as he skimmed them over her lingering deliberately on the swell of her breast diana waited until his gaze came back to hers why dont we cut the crap and get down to business the leer turned into a look of surprise then annoyance look youve got the police report in that file there what else do you want with a quick nervous jerk he lit a match then drew greedily on his cigarette tell me what happened on january tenth diana drew a pad and pen out of her briefcase then waited youre wasting my time chad she said at length and your mothers money he shot her a furious look then blew out a stream of smoke on january tenth i got up had a shower got dressed had breakfast and went to work ignoring his belligerence diana began to take notes youre a mechanic at maynes garage thats right he sent her a lewd grin want a tuneup she could read the expression on his face by his tone and didnt bother to look up were you at the garage all day yeah he gave another shrug at her lack of reaction we had a mercedes in for an overhaul i do the foreign jobs i see what time did you get off six chad shifted in his chair as he pulled in more smoke whered you go i went home and had some dinner then then i went out cruising you know he smiled at her again showing a slightly crooked front tooth checking out the ladies how long did you cruise couple hours chad drew hard on the cigarette so that the tip glowed red then i raped beth howard diana continued to write without breaking rhythm though she felt the jolt down to the soles of her feet youve decided to change your plea he slumped back in the chair but his left hand was balled into a fist i figure im not going to get by with the bull i was passing before all right tell me about it she glanced up when he remained silent tell me about the rape chad you get off hearing about things like that did you pick her up in your car yeah the cigarette was no more than a fingertip in width when he finally snuffed it out she was walking home from the movies and i offered her a lift wed gone to high school together she recognized me so she got in we talked for a while just a lot of bull about what wed been doing since graduation drove around i liked the way she looked you know so i gave her some story about needing to pick something up at the garage she went with you to the garage without protest his tongue flicked out quickly to moisten his lips there was already a sheen of sweat above them i told her i had to pick up some tools you know when we got there i jumped on her and she resisted yeah i had to knock her around a little he put his hand to his pocket and found another mashed cigarette diana saw that his fingers were trembling and then then i ripped off her clothes and raped her he exploded what the hell do you want all the graphic details what was she wearing he dragged a hand through his hair a pink sweater he muttered grey cords youre quite sure of that yeah yeah im sure of it a pink sweater with this little white collar and grey cords and you ripped them off of her diana persisted still writing tore them yeah i said i did setting down her pen diana met his eyes directly her clothes werent torn chad i said i tore them i oughta know what the hell i did he wiped at the dampness on his lips with the back of his hand then moistened them again i was there lady you werent beth howards clothes werent damaged when she arrived at the hospital his hand was shaking visibly now she changed them thats all no she didnt diana said quietly because you never ripped them just as you never raped her why are you trying to convince me that you did chad put his elbows on the table pressing the heels of his hands against his eyes god i cant do anything right diana studied the top of his head and listened to the sound of his laboured breathing as it filled the tiny room you didnt put the bruises on her face either did you slowly without uncovering his eyes he shook his head i wouldnt hurt beth youre in love with her yeah aint it a hell of a mess start again diana ordered this time try the truth with a sigh chad lowered his hands and began he and beth had gone through high school together each hardly aware of the others existence theyd run in different crowds hed been busy promoting his tough guy image shed been head cheerleader then one day six months before she had brought her car into maynes for repairs and everything had happened at once theyd started dating her father had disapproved and ordered her to break it off theyd continued to see each other secretly it was like a game you know chad laughed shakily as he tugged his hand through his hair again even my friends didnt know hers either shed say she was going to the library or the movies or shopping and wed snatch some time together if she could get away for a couple hours at night wed go to the garage seal up inside and talk make love i was saving up so that we could get married what happened the night you were arrested we had a fight beth said she didnt want to go on that way anymore she didnt care if we didnt have enough money or anywhere to live she wanted to get married right away she wouldnt listen she started crying and i started yelling slammed my fist into the damn wall he looked down at it as if he still expected to see the bruise then she got in her car and drove off i went out and had a few beers before i went home then the cops came god i was so scared at first everything came pouring out why do you think shes accusing you of rape i know why his eyes werent challenging now but helpless she smuggled a note to me through my mother when beth got home that night she was still upset her father got on her and while they were arguing she told him everything he went nuts slapped her around called her names scared the hell out of her she says he threatened to kill both of us unless she did exactly as he said beths scared enough to believe he means it chad let out a long breath as his hands began to work again anyway by the time her mother got home beth was hysterical her old man told the story and called the cops while her mother took her to the hospital wheres the letter i got rid of it chad shook his head at dianas expression my mom doesnt know what was in it either cause it was sealed i dont think shed have done it if she hadnt thought maybe somethingd been going on between me and beth for a while if she writes you again i want you to keep the letter look i dont want her hurt anymore when they first picked me up i was scared you know but i was mad too i thought shed done it to punish me he shook his head again straightening his shoulders ill take my chances on a few years in prison you like your cell chad diana demanded pushing aside her notes to lean forward this is a picnic compared to the state penitentiary his mouth trembled as he swallowed ill make out all right theyve got real rapists in there she said coldly murderers men whod snap you in two without giving it a second thought and how do you think beths going to feel knowing youre locked up in there and why shell be okay a new trickle of sweat ran down the side of his face it wont be for that long you want to risk twenty years of your life you want her father to get away with setting you up grow up she ordered impatiently this isnt a game anymore youre going to go on trial for rape the maximum sentence is life chad blanched and said nothing but diana could see the jerky workings of his throat youre going to have to sit in that witness chair and so is beth and youre going to have to tell the court exactly what happened that night if you lie the two of you face perjury charges if i plead guilty diana swooped the pad into her briefcase if you want to play hero because your girlfriends afraid of her father get yourself another lawyer i dont defend idiots she started to rise but chads hand shot out to take her arm i just dont want to hurt her shes awful scared shes been hurt diana said flatly and shell keep right on being scared until she tells the truth or maybe you dont believe she really loves you his fingers tightened on her arm but diana didnt flinch after a moment they relaxed tell me what i have to do a portion of the tension in her shoulders eased all right when diana walked into the office an hour later she was drained lucy glanced up took one long look then stopped typing you look like you could use some coffee diana gave her a weary smile it shows yep why dont i put some on and before she could finish the sentence the phone rang thats all right lucy take care of the phone ill go fix some as she walked back toward the kitchen diana slipped out of her coat she could still see chads pale frightened face see his hand reach to his pocket for a cigarette after he had no more left and what was beth howard feeling diana wondered tossing her coat aside as she turned to the stove if i could get to her she began then let out a frustrated breath that was the last thing the da or her father would permit chad was going to have to wait for his day in court rubbing at the ache at the back of her neck diana stared out the window over the sink the coffee forgotten with any luck she could get the truth out of beth howard during the preliminaries but if the girl was that frightened of her father if she wasnt in love with chad but merely playing games with a sigh diana watched a bird peck at the lawn in search of food so many its when a boys life was at stake rough morning caine asked from the doorway diana turned yeah god she was glad to see him she realized glad to know here was someone she could talk to who would understand some of what she was feeling busy caine thought of the brief upstairs on his desk but shook his head i could use some coffee he slipped two mugs from their hooks and poured you saw chad rutledge this morning oh caine that poor kid diana dropped into a chair at the small table while he added milk to one of the mugs he walked in doing an imitation of early brando some tough street hood with fingers that trembled she added in a murmur give you a hard time caine set her coffee down as he sat across from her he tried at first with a sigh she dragged her hair back from her face holding it there a moment before she let her hand fall again then he told me hed raped beth howard caines mug paused on its way to his lips what he gave me a full confession she began warming both her hands on the side of the mug very casual like it was something hed decided to do because he was a little bored the more he talked the more his hands trembled sipping slowly caine shook his head it doesnt follow i didnt think so either diana tried to drink but found her stomach was still tied in knots i pressed him for details and thats where he fell apart he tried to convince me hed lured her to the garage where he works then knocked her around and raped her caines frown deepened that jives with the girls story chad said hed ripped her clothes off torn them her clothes werent torn diana gave him a thin smile exactly it was all some smoke screen hed dreamed up so that he could protect her caine leaned back and drew out a cigarette tell me diana began relaying the conversation exactly point by point as she spoke caine said nothing but watched the play of emotion on her face she was fighting not to get personally involved he concluded but it was already too late if everything chad says is true he mused when shed finished the girlll fall apart on the stand i believe him he wanted to plead guilty and keep her out of it caines look sharpened what did you do i bullied him out of it diana allowed her eyes to close for a moment i dont know how the trial will affect him or the girl if it gets that far ive got a list of their close friends chad seems to think he and beth kept their relationship secret but the chances are something slipped to someone over the last six months theyre so young pushing back her hair diana rose to pace to the window again oh god caine i was so hard on him the princess had stepped beyond the castle walls he thought hed wanted her to even pushed her to yet now seeing the raw emotion in her eyes he had conflicting needs to draw her further out and to urge her back to safety when the shell cracked and opened there was always pain he spoke carefully trying to fit back into the role of colleague diana you know we cant always treat clients with kid gloves its no less than his life at stake i know she laid her forehead on the glass a moment it isnt easy to realize all at once that you can be cruel that you can calmly sit there and whip somebody down with words he was pale swearing shaking i didnt give him a dram of sympathy you gave him exactly what he needed caine had risen without her hearing but he didnt approach her this time he wasnt completely sure how now youre tearing yourself apart because you did what you had to do his motherll give him sympathy you have to give him the best defence whatever it takes i know the bird was still there bobbing along the grass determined to find what it was looking for even if it means ripping up that girl on the stand its her father id like to get a hold of she muttered even when it all comes out falsifying a police report hes not likely to get much more than a slap on the wrist and a suspended sentence and that nineteenyearold boys sitting in a cell terrified firmly caine suppressed the need to soothe and comfort hes not justin diana she let out a long shaky breath im that transparent at the moment it was hard not to make the comparison lifting her hands she hugged her arms as if seeking something solid he had that same tough oddly attractive insolence that i remember in justin as a teenager and when i thought about him waiting in that cell it was too easy to see how it had been for justin and i wondered she gave a small laugh i wondered if this could be another quirk of that fate of yours youre going to lose your objectivity diana his voice was tough and unsympathetic as the struggle went on inside him to be brother lover friend youve got no business in a courtroom without it i know that the words snapped out of her she turned away with her jaw tensed and one hand balled into a fist objectivity she thought still unable to take those deep cleansing breaths that always kept her calm she had no objectivity at the moment but too many comparisons and too many regrets she wanted to be held soothed and didnt dare ask because she needed to stand on her own i have to get it out of my system before i go back and see chad again the words were low and tense but they were the words hed wanted to hear automatically caine placed a hand on her shoulder when the muscles there only tightened more he increased his grip he would have dealt with his sister the same way thats what he told himself as he turned her around wordlessly he gathered her close and though her arms came around him she didnt cling he knew she was looking for support but not for answers the answers she would find for herself in that moment he discovered hed never wanted her more not just a warm soft body against his not just a mouth for tasting he wanted her thoughts feelings he wanted to share what she was and feed back to her himself so that there were no more boundaries and barriers no more doubts and while the tenderness enveloped him his hands were gentle on her hair sensing something diana lifted her head his eyes met hers briefly but she couldnt read them hed never looked at her that way before was there a question in them she wondered what was he asking her then his lips touched hers this had nothing to do with the other kisses they had shared it might have been the first his mouth was so soft and careful she thought dimly careful as though he werent so sure of himself it ran through her head that he was kissing her as though hed never kissed anyone before this man who had known so many women his hands didnt press her closer but rested lightly on her back as though he would release her at the least movement diana was very still whatever magic this was whatever reasons there were for it she wanted it to go on yet it wasnt desire she felt it was nothing so simple when he drew her away they stared at each other each as perplexed each as moved as the other what was that for diana managed after a moment caine dropped his arms slowly and stepped away from her im not sure he murmured shaken he walked back to the table and lifted his coffee what the hells going on he asked himself then drained the mug are you all right now he asked her as he turned back around yes no she said silently but nearly managed a smile i think ill go up and try to work out chads defence mrs walkers coming in tomorrow morning when he gave her a blank look she added the divorce case you referred to me oh yeah caine stared into his empty mug and wondered what was happening to his mind theyve hooked up your phone good diana remained at the window not certain what she should do well ill go on up then she said but still didnt move diana caine looked over at her not sure what he was going to say feeling ridiculous he gave a half laugh and shook his head must be something in the coffee he muttered listen do you have anything else tomorrow besides walker ah no no appointments i have paperwork ive got to drive up to salem and see someone about the day case why dont you come with me he continued before shed worked out an answer its a nice drive you can clear your head and draft out your work while im tied up yes i suppose i could she considered all right she agreed on impulse id like that i might not have too many free afternoons good well leave as soon as youre done with mrs walker they stood for a moment in a silence diana found unaccountably awkward it was strange she thought that two people who had no trouble with words should suddenly have such a strained conversation i should be done by tenthirty or eleven she searched for something else to say but found her mind a blank well ill go up then caine nodded as he walked back to the coffeepot when he heard her footsteps drift away he set his filled mug back down untasted what the hell is all this he wondered again passing a frustrated hand through his hair when hed asked her to accompany him the following day hed felt like a gangly teenager asking for a date with a half laugh caine went back to the table no hed never felt that lack of confidence as a teenager hed never felt it at all not with women after lighting a cigarette he stared at the glowing tip for several minutes hed always been sure of his ground when it came to the opposite sex enjoying women was part of it not just as bed partners but as companions that part of his life had always run smoothly it was his firm intention that it continue to run smoothly he knew without conceit that he didnt have to spend an evening alone unless he chose to then why had he been spending so many alone lately and when he added thoughtfully was the last time he had thought of any other woman but diana letting out a long breath caine began to sift the problem around in his mind pull it apart dissect it he owed part of his success in his field to a synthesis of intellect and emotion it had been that way since hed been a boy the quick unexpected bursts of temper or passion the long quiet contemplations he enjoyed puzzles or the slow meticulous solving of them at the moment however he wasnt enjoying this one uncomfortable that was the first feeling he was able to clearly define thinking about diana was making him uncomfortable but why he found her good company enjoyed the flavour of their sparring matches and he wanted her came drew hard on the cigarette thinking of the sharp turbulent passion he felt from her when he held her when her mouth was avid on his desire didnt make him uncomfortable hed promised himself hed be her lover sooner or later and he always kept his promises it hadnt been desire moments ago he reflected caine knew all the angles of that emotion neither had it been the brotherly type of affection hed swung back to from time to time it was diana who didnt fit into any category he told himself she wasnt the easy sophisticate he was normally attracted to nor was she the younger cousin he could show a good time annoyed with himself he rose and paced to the window the light was thin winter white if she was making him uncomfortable why had he asked her to drive to salem with him because he needed to be with her even as the answer ran through his mind caine made his thoughts back up and play again need he repeated slowly now that was a dangerous word want was safer and more understandable but that hadnt been the answer that had sprung into his mind very slowly caine walked back to the stove and lifted his cooling coffee he drank forcing himself to keep his mind blank for a moment he thought of nothing but the faintly bitter taste of the coffee saw nothing but the aged exposed brick along the west wall in the distance he heard the phone ring on lucys desk then the quick rattle of the wind against the window behind him good god he thought still staring straight ahead was he in love with her no that was ridiculous love wasnt a word he used because love had repercussions in an angry gesture he dumped the remaining coffee down the sink a man didnt go for over thirty years then suddenly without giving it a second thought jump off a bridge unless unless hed woken one morning and discovered hed lost his mind hed been working too hard caine decided too many late nights poring over other peoples problems searching for answers what he needed was an evening with a compatible woman then eight hours sleep tomorrow he promised himself hed be thinking clearly again tomorrow he remembered as he headed out of the kitchen diana would still be there swearing quietly caine walked up the stairs chapter seven diana would have enjoyed the ride more if she hadnt had the feeling something wasnt quite right caine was friendly enough the conversation didnt lag or fall into awkward silences yet she would have sworn there was something just under the surface of the camaraderie because it wasnt something she could define diana told herself she was imagining it perhaps allowing herself to assign to caine an echo of her own feelings there had been a tension in her since the previous day one she attributed at least in part to her meeting with chad rutledge it worried diana that she couldnt shake it an attorney a good one had to find that balance between callousness and emotional entanglement the balance was as crucial for the client as it was for the attorney diana knew it intellectually but realized that the scales in this case were already tilting to one side she could only comfort herself that the more involved she became in the technical points of the case the less tendency she would have to compare chad with justin for now she would do exactly as caine had suggested clear her head and enjoy the ride you didnt mention whom youre going to see in salem diana began he had to force himself to gather his thoughts to control the tension he was feeling like diana he told himself it was the case that had him tight nothing personal personal relationships never made his stomach knot hed been telling himself that since the previous evening greataunt agatha diana let out an irrepressible sound of mirth you dont have to make something up she said dryly you could simply tell me to mind my own business virginia days greataunt agatha caine said specifically tossing her a grin discuss the case he told himself it might help him shake the feeling that hed pried open a door for diana then stepped into quicksand shes reputed to be a very formidable lady and one who knows ginnie better than anyone else unfortunately she was iceskating a couple of weeks ago and broke her hip im going to see her at the hospital greataunt agatha iceskates apparently how old is she sixtyeight hmmm what are you looking for caine pushed the jaguar forward in a burst of speed passing a pickup before he answered what was he looking for he wondered even a few days before he wouldve been able to answer that with a shrug and a glib remark the case he thought with an annoyed shake of his head keep your mind on the case the prosecutions going for murder one the first thing i want to establish is that ginnie carried that pistol with her habitually if im going to prove selfdefence i have to get it into the jurys head early that ginnie went to laura simmonss apartment to confront her husband with his current mistress but not to kill his current mistress diana repeated apparently he had quite a number the detective report ginnie paid for a few months back indicates that dr francis day was a very busy man he didnt do all his operating at boston general caine punched in the car lighter if i can get the report into evidence it should make the jury more sympathetic then again it gives ginnie even more of a motive so youre right back to the gun caine nodded as he touched the lighter to the end of his cigarette the conversation was easing the tightness at the base of his neck not quicksand he thought now he mightve stepped into a puddle and gotten his feet wet but he wasnt being sucked in according to ginnie she never left the house without it she has a fixation about being robbed not surprising as she also has a penchant for wearing several thousand dollars worth of jewellery at a time yes and ginnie day hasnt endeared herself to the press or the public over the last few years diana remembered she comes across as a spoiled selfish child with more money than class true enough caine agreed but i can be grateful you wont be on the jury i suppose im feeling a bit impatient with her type at the moment diana mused shifting in her seat to face him irene walker she said flatly shed be the antithesis of virginia day howd it go this morning the bruises on her face havent faded yet diana began frowning at his profile ive never met a woman with less of a conception of her own worth its as if she felt she deserved to be beaten with an impatient sound diana tried to push away the frustration she felt at least the friend shes staying with has convinced her to press formal charges against her husband but trailing off diana gave a quick shake of her head i have a feeling irene walker is like a sponge simply soaking up the emotions of the people shes with shes convinced herself or her husbands convinced her that shes a nonentity without him ive recommended that she go into counselling the divorce and her husbands trial arent going to be easy for her she let out a huff of breath that was as much astonishment as bewilderment she still wears her wedding ring taking it off would be the final break wouldnt it he countered for a woman like irene walker do you know theyve only been married four years and she cant remember the number of times hes beaten her dianas eyes were hard and sharp for a moment im going to love getting him on the stand as i recall there were two witnesses to the last beating youd have him cold thats exactly the way i want it im hoping to get on the docket quickly while mrs walker still sees the bruises when she looks in the mirror i think shes a woman who forgets too easily caine glanced down at the briefcase next to her feet is that what youre going to work on today im going to draft out interrogatories i want to slap them on him right away between the divorce and the battery trial im going to see that he gets nothing but trouble going for the jugular she smiled then someone told me once it was cleaner tell me diana ran a fingertip over the back of the leather seat how long have you had this car the car he shot her a questioning look at the abrupt change of subject yes id love to buy a new one myself the questioning look became a grin oh she was definitely opening up he mused breaking out a jag one day diana arched a brow or do you think theyre reserved only for former states attorneys i suppose i pictured you in a mercedes stately and elegant diana narrowed her eyes are you trying to insult me certainly not caine replied gravely can you drive a stickshift you are trying to insult me without comment caine pulled over to the shoulder of the road curiously diana watched him get out round the hood and open the passenger door you drive awhile me he struggled with a grin at the halfincredulous halfexcited look in her eyes perhaps this most of all was what he couldnt resist when the sophistication and intelligence were replaced by pure simple pleasure if youre thinking about buying a car you should get the feel of it first unless he added slowly you cant drive a fivespeed i can drive anything diana stated as she climbed out fine caine settled back in the passenger seat as diana switched places ill tell you when to turn off diana gripped the wheel with one hand and put the car into first under her palm she could feel the light vibration of power the promise of speed after glancing in the rearview mirror she shot back onto the highway oh its wonderful she cried immediately a check on the speedometer had her easing off the gas and tempting she added with a quick laugh im afraid id end up defending myself in traffic court if i had one of these ive always found its just a matter of knowing you can press your foot down and go faster than anything else on the road caine commented yes knowing you can so that you dont tossing back her hair she laughed again and passed a slower stream of traffic as the speedometer hovered just above fiftyfive it would hardly be seemly for a public servant to zip down the road at ninety miles an hour but it feels wonderful knowing you could diana shifted into fifth and kept the speed steady is that why you bought it i like things with style he murmured studying her profile if they have enough power to challenge underneath the gloss the hands on the wheel were confident capable caine could picture her driving down an empty stretch of road on a summer night the windows open her hair flying you fascinate me diana she sent him a quick grin why because i can drive a jag without running into the median strip because you have style caine countered take the next turnoff while diana settled into a corner of a waiting room to work caine walked down the hospital corridor to agatha grants room he found her in solitary splendour pink lace bed jacket white hair perfectly coiffed thin cheeks tinted outrageously with a bumper crop of magazines littering the bed they ranged from gossip glossies to popular mechanics as caine entered agatha set down the sports magazine shed been thumbing through to eye him appreciatively about time they let someone with looks in here she said in a raspy voice come in and sit down honey caines grin was spontaneous as he walked to the bedside mrs grant im caine macgregor ah ginnies lawyer agatha nodded as she gestured to a chair the girl always did have an eye for a goodlooking face looks like its got her in a hell of a mess this time caine took another pile of magazines from the chair before he sat im hoping youll be able to help me with ginnies defence mrs grant i appreciate you seeing me like this so soon after your accident agatha snorted and waved the words away ill be up and around long before these doctors think she told him then gave a rueful smile maybe i wont be doing figureeights too soon okay honey tell me what you want to know you know that ginnie has been charged with murdering francis day when agatha gave a brisk unemotional nod caine continued its alleged that she went to laura simmonss apartment knowing her husband was there and that ms simmons was his mistress the last of many agatha added caustically caine only lifted a brow at the comment and continued ms simmons left ginnie alone with day at his request when she returned to the apartment twenty minutes later day was dead and ginnie was sitting on the couch with the pistol still in her hand hed been shot twice at close range ms simmons became hysterical rushed to a neighbours and called the police ginnie killed him agatha pushed at the magazines with gnarled redtipped fingers theres little doubt of it yes she admits to that however she claims that day became abusive when they were alone at first she says they shouted at each other something that had been habitual in their marriage for some time then she threatened to drag him through a messy divorce with all the trimmings correspondents detective reports something he wanted to avoid as he was next in line as chief of surgery at boston general agatha gave a low mirthless chuckle yes he would have hated that ginnies franny guarded his reputation as a distinguished dedicated man of medicine it wouldnt have done for it to come out publicly that he was a lecher caine made a quiet sound that might have been agreement or speculation shes a tough one he concluded noting agathas composed painted face during the argument caine went on he lost control slapped her by this time they were screaming at each other she claims he went wild knocked her to the floor and picked up a lamp he told her he was going to kill her when he came toward her ginnie took the gun out of her purse and shot agatha nodded over the explanation then levelled a hard look at caine do you believe her caine returned the look for several seconds before he spoke i believe that virginia day shot her husband in a moment of panic and in her own defence ginnies a hardheaded girl agatha said with a sigh spoiled we all spoiled her and she has a mean temper explodes easily without thinking of the consequences but shes not coldblooded agatha added with another level look she would not could not systematically plan to kill in order to prove that caine returned the first thing i have to establish is why she had a gun when she went to confront her husband the girl wouldnt step out of the door without that pistol with a sound of disgust agatha shifted against the pillows ugly little thing id ask her what the hell she thought she was going to do with it and shed laugh aunt aggie shed say if anyone tries to mug me theyre in for a surprise agatha let out another impatient sound stupid girl had to glitter diamonds emeralds shed think nothing of walking in the back bay or dashing around manhattan dripping with jewellery as long as she had that damn pistol you often saw her with the pistol in her possession i might be staying with her for a few days stop by her room before we went out somewhere id see her put the thing in her bag once at a party i saw it there when she went in her purse for a compact i gave her hell about it agatha added for all the good it did then youd swear in court under oath that virginia day habitually carried a twentytwo pistol in her possession and that on numerous occasions you saw her with the gun and discussed it with her honey id lie in hells face for her agatha gave him a thin icy smile never could stand that twotiming jerk she married mrs grant relax she told him with something like a cackle in this case i can swear to it without risking my mortal soul if ginnie hadnt had the pistol with her that night id have wondered what was going on good caine allowed himself to relax and we might keep it just between you and me about lying in hells face you got it she sent him a crafty smile then letting her eyes scan his face i dont suppose you and ginnie im her defence attorney caine countered as he rose reaching out he grasped agathas surprisingly strong hand thank you mrs grant if i were forty years younger and on trial for murder agatha said slowly youd be a hell of a lot more than my defence attorney flashing her a grin caine brought her hand to his lips dont kill anyone agatha i find you very hard to resist pleased she let out a lusty laugh that followed him down the corridor caine found diana where he had left her a law book balanced on one knee a legal pad on the other she was busy writing apparently not affected by the inconvenience without speaking he took a chair and waited for her to finish he always enjoyed watching her this way when she was absorbed with what she was doing and cut off from her surroundings no guards now he thought hed wanted to help her accomplish that just as much as hed wanted to make love with her now that she was well on her way to the first he realized he couldnt afford to do the second there were too many undercurrents in her he decided undercurrents had a habit of pulling in the unwary perhaps it had been the sudden realization the evening before that he could conquer her with time with care that made him now too cautious to attempt it it was time to put their relationship on one balanced level and leave it there for her sake he wondered ruefully or for his own when diana stopped writing ten minutes later she closed the book and started to stretch her shoulders before she spotted caine oh when did you get back only a few minutes ago you know not everyone is able to block out their surroundings and work the way you do one of my more basic skills diana claimed slipping everything back into her briefcase i developed it out of necessity when i wanted to tune out my aunt how did it go perfectly caine rose picking up dianas coat to help her into it just how much trouble did you have with your aunt diana immediately she tensed up closed up he saw it and wondered if his princess in the tower idea had been closer to the mark than hed realized my aunt her voice was cool and emotionless yes how much trouble did you have she was fond of phrases like a lady never wears diamonds before five a great deal obviously caine murmured as he picked up his own jacket i wonder if i was a little rough on you in atlantic city surprised diana stared up at him as they walked toward the elevator theres no need to apologize but her body was still on guard her voice still on edge what brought that on i was thinking about agatha caine pushed the button for the lobby she doesnt particularly approve of her niece but she loves her it shows he released a lock of hair that was caught in dianas collar im beginning to think it was just the opposite in your case aunt adelaide approved of what she thought shed made me with a shrug diana stepped out of the elevator it was enough as for love she never loved me but then again she never pretended to either i cant fault her for that why the hell not he demanded angry all at once with the clarity of the picture her limited words drew she gave him a steady look that clearly told him he was too close you cant blame someone for their emotions or for the lack of them when she turned away it was a signal that the conversation was ended unable to stop himself he grabbed her arm where she was cool again he was heating yes you can he countered you damn well can leave it caine i did when he started to object she turned again then stopped oh my god look diana stared through the glass doors still frowning at her words caine glanced over snow was falling fast and thick already blanketing the ground so much for the weather forecast caine muttered this was supposed to hold off until tonight diana drew on her gloves the drive back to bostons going to be very interesting and very slow she added as they stepped outside into the full force of the storm with any luck well be heading out of it caine took a firm grip on her arm as they walked across the parking lot as he finished the statement they looked toward the sky simultaneously at dianas arched brow look he shrugged both of them were already covered with snow we could go back to the hospital and wait it out not unless you dont want to risk driving in it caine looked toward the road as they stopped by the car well see how it goes for the first twenty minutes they drove through the storm with relative ease caine was a good driver and the car hugged the road confidently diana watched the snow hurtle down building quickly on the roadside coating naked trees the farther south they got the more the wind picked up so that snow covered the windshield as quickly as the wipers cleared it catching her breath diana saw the car in front of them fishtail and skid into the centre lane before the driver regained control its pretty bad she murmured casting caine a look its not good he kept the speed slow and even with his eyes narrowed in concentration on the road ahead with every mile the visibility became shorter and the road slicker hed lived in new england long enough to know the makings of a blizzard when he saw one it was falling too thick and fast caine was aware now that rather than heading out of the storm they were heading into it on the other side of the median strip two cars slid into each other and stopped both he and diana remained silent for the next twenty miles theyd reached the halfway point between boston and salem in nearly twice the time it had taken them to make the entire trip earlier the light was failing and when he turned on the headlights the snow danced crazily in the beams there were drifts of over a foot of snow on the side of the road with more coming an abandoned car sat crookedly where it had skidded off and stalled diana began to wish shed taken caines suggestion of staying in the hospital more seriously a car passed them on the right at a dangerous speed that had it sliding toward the jags front fender diana smothered a gasp as caine swore ripely forced to brake then fight a skid he was still cursing as he brought the car under control and took the first turnoff its suicide to travel that road in this diana merely nodded busy trying to swallow her heart again well stop off at the first hotel we come to get a couple of rooms and wait until morning he took his eyes off the road long enough to look at her you all right diana let out a deep breath ask me again when im not praying caine gave quick chuckle then narrowed his eyes as the bluish glare of a neon light shone mistily through the snow i think were in luck the last slash of the m in motel had gone out but the rest of the neon was garishly visible ah a notel diana said with a grin what better shelter from a storm caine glanced at the singlestory compound before he pulled the car to a halt we wont get deluxe accommodations in this section will we have a roof probably thats good enough she had to use both hands to push open the door against the wind standing outside diana sank to her knees took a deep breath and burst out laughing whats so funny caine demanded as he began to pull her toward a tiny building marked office nothing nothing she shouted back it just feels wonderful now you should have told me you were frightened he tightened his arm around her waist as the wind shoved both of them back two steps diana lifted her face to the full fury of snow i would have when id run out of my repertoire of prayers the door jingled stridently as caine shoved it open the cold clean smell of snow was immediately blocked out by the scent of cheap tobacco and stale beer behind a laminated counter a grizzled man lifted his eyes from a magazine he was reading yeah we need a couple of rooms for the night one glance told caine it was the sort of establishment that normally rented them by the hour amused he reminded himself beggars couldnt be choosers only got one the clerk lit a kitchen match with his thumbnail and eyed diana blizzards good for business diana looked at caine then back out the glass door behind him he was leaving it up to her she realized as a little nerve jumped at the base of her neck she remembered that last long skid well take it the clerk dug under the counter for a key thatll be twentytwo fifty he told caine still holding the key cash in advance any place to get some food around here caine asked as he counted out bills diner next door open til two your rooms out and to the left number twentyseven checkout at ten or you owe another nights rent rooms got free tv and pay movies caine lifted a brow as he exchanged money for the key thank you friendly sort diana commented as they fought their way toward number you did mention food hungry caine checked the number on a peeling greypainted door im starving i hadnt realized it until dianas voice trailed off as her eyes widened in astonishment the room what there was of it was mostly bed one bed she noted but even that didnt alarm her in her present state the walls were a sizzling pink to match the wildpinkandpurple sunburst pattern of the bedspread there was one chair and an excuse for a table both painted in glaring white the rug though worn and thin picked up the purple tint all the way to the door of what diana assumed was the bath and on the ceiling over the bed was a round dusty mirror well it isnt the ritz caine said dryly struggling not to burst out laughing at her dazed expression he set both their briefcases on top of a white plastictopped dresser but it does have a roof hmm diana gave the mirror a last dubious look perhaps it was best not to think about that for the moment its freezing in here turning she saw that the drapes unfortunately matched the bedspread catching her expression caine couldnt hold back the grin its a room thats at its best in the dark ill see if i can get the heater working ignoring what she considered his odd humour diana sat gingerly on the edge of the bed the only bed she reminded herself the only room the only hotel one might think you were enjoying this whole fiasco who me caine gave the heater a quick kick that sent it roaring into life enjoying wasnt the word hed have picked even the thought of spending the night with her in this laughable room had the knot back in his stomach for the next few hours hed have to concentrate on pretending he was her big brother again if he was going to remember his resolution not to touch her ill go pick something up at the diner he continued when diana only stared at him theres no use both of us going out in this again want anything special quick and edible remembering the storm he had driven through she unbent enough to smile at him if he was going to accept the situation with a shrug then so would she thanks i owe you eleven dollars and a quarter ill bill you he promised then leaned over to give her a brief kiss before he went out alone diana glanced around the room again it wasnt so bad really she told herself if you kept your eyes halfclosed and the heater was certainly working great guns now she slipped out of her coat and looked for a closet it seemed the room didnt run to such extravagances draping the coat over the dresser diana unzipped her boots the idea of a hot bath was appealing but the prospect of undressing just to dress again had her vetoing the notion shed compensate by stretching out on the bed until caine came back with dinner maybe some television she thought idly then noticed a black box attached to the side of the set on closer examination diana noted it was some kind of timer fed by quarters the pay movies she remembered and decided to try her luck it might be wise to have a movie marathon that way itd be easier to remember they were both lawyers a word without gender rooming together through circumstances she glanced over her shoulder at the bed again and felt a little bead of tension work its way up her spine resolutely she turned away a search through her wallet found her three quarters and what would amount to fortyfive minutes of whatever movie was playing following the instructions printed on the box diana turned the set to the proper channel fed in the quarters and twisted a knob not unlike one on a parking meter she turned and went to the bed stretched out in the centre and gave a sigh of pure appreciation it was while she was busy arranging the pillows behind her head that the movement on the set caught her eye after a classic doubletake she simply stared openmouthed when the initial shock wore off diana lay back and laughed until her sides ached good god she thought as she hauled herself off the bed again of all the motels in massachusetts they had to find one with pink walls and blue movies diana was just hitting the off switch when caine walked back in do you know what kind of movies you get for a quarter on this machine she demanded before hed shut the door behind him he shook himself like a dog scattering snow yes did you need some change very cute though she tried she couldnt keep her lips from curving i just wasted seventyfive cents i wouldnt be a bit surprised to have the vice squad banging on the door in this weather caine countered and set two white bags down on the little table is that dinner i smell so to speak i got quick i wont guarantee edible he pulled out two wrapped hamburgers you go first young attorney poisoned in notel diana murmured as she unwrapped one of the sandwiches theres fries too he peeked into the bag i think theyre fries anyway i got some wine for now and coffee for later he took out two capped foam cups and set them aside before he drew out a bottle the best i can say is that its red oh i dont know diana bit into the hamburger taking the bottle in her free hand this was a great week does this place run to glasses or do we swig straight from the bottle ill check in the bathroom no sudden stomach pains he asked as he went no she decided to risk the fries i dont suppose the storms letting up if anything its worse caine came back with two plastic glasses word over at the diner is more than a foot before morning diana sat on the edge of the bed and took the offered glass i suppose we could watch the news she mused with a glance at the set if you can get the news on that thing laughing caine sat down and unwrapped his hamburger poor diana what a shock that must have been im not a prude she said primly it was simply unexpected she took a sip of wine grimaced and sipped again its really not too bad best in the house caine told her a buck fiftynine a bottle in that case ill sip more slowly caine there is one small detail we should discuss he took a swallow of wine hed known it was coming while hed trudged through the storm hed decided exactly how to handle it im not sleeping on the floor diana made a face at his accurate reading of her mind theres always the bathtub be my guest its becoming painfully clear that chivalry is dead look he began over a mouthful of hamburger its a big bed if you dont want to put it to any better use than sleeping i certainly dont the sharp answer was precisely what hed been working toward if they kept it casual kept it up front they both might survive the night then you sleep on one side and ill sleep on the other he finished telling himself it was just as simple as that im not certain i like how quickly you agreed to that she murmured if youd like me to convince you otherwise he began with a slow smile no thats not what i meant frowning diana finished off her hamburger after all she mused hed driven for nearly two hours in that miserable storm she could hardly deny him a decent nights sleep you stay on your side and ill stay on mine she repeated he leaned over to fill her glass again if you insist i hate to repeat myself by bringing up clark gable again clark gable diana repeated blankly than gave a brief laugh claudette colbert it happened one night exactly he said with an amused smile in a similar situation they imagined something along the lines of the walls of jericho she gave him a long look hows your imagination caine shrugged and sipped his wine i told you once i could wait until you admitted you wanted me deliberately he lifted his eyes to hers and deliberately he baited her knowing shed step back he desperately needed her to step back i can be very patient refusing to acknowledge the challenge diana merely nodded as long as you know the rules i think ill skip the coffee and have a bath before i turn in standing he ran a casual hand down her hair you should get some sleep its been a long day she felt a quick sense of regret which she firmly stemmed yes i think i will shall i leave the light on no dont bother its impossible to miss the bed in this room he wanted to kiss her badly and made himself walk away good night diana good night diana waited until she heard the water running then slowly rose youre being a fool a voice told her with sharp surprising impatience you know theres nothing you want more than to make love with him to lose yourself in him thats just it diana thought with a sudden panic i would lose myself or a part im not sure im ready to lose hes different and i dont trust him or myself diana ran an agitated hand through her hair and listened to the sound it wouldnt be the same with caine as it might with any other man hed already broken down so many barriers once the physical was down he wouldnt stop there she couldnt wouldnt allow him that kind of hold over her oh but she wanted him tonight like caine diana let her coffee sit growing cold she wanted nothing that might keep her awake and restless while she shared a bed with him after a moments struggle she stripped down to her chemise she wasnt going to be a fool and sleep in her clothes carefully she climbed into bed keeping close to the edge she found this more difficult than she had anticipated as the mattress sagged in the centre swearing against what caine would have called fate diana switched off the light and gripping the side of the bed to keep from rolling out of her territory firmly shut her eyes when caine came out the room was silent he could see dianas vague outline at the far side of the bed hed spoken easily enough about sharing that soft warm rectangle with her but the hot bath had done nothing to ease the need it might be wise he thought to use the rest of the wine in lieu of a sleeping pill god he was going to need something knowing she was only an arms length away it would have been smarter he told himself grimly not to have given her his word hed stay on his side but he had caine let the towel drop and got quietly into bed like diana he found himself sliding toward the centre cursing silently he shifted away with the habit of years caine drifted awake slowly and early something soft and warm was wrapped around him though still more asleep than awake he knew by the scent it was diana without conscious thought he drew her closer then heard her sigh as she snuggled against him with lazy pleasure he ran a hand down her to where the silk gave way to skin then back again diana pressed against him her fingers sliding lazily over his back murmuring her name he touched his lips to her forehead while his hand slipped beneath the silk they gave simultaneous sounds of pleasure languid and soft he thought it was no more than a dream hed dreamed of having her but it had never been quite like this so slow and easy when he shifted his leg slid intimately between hers while his mouth began a leisurely journey over her face with an inarticulate murmur diana tilted her head back so that her lips found his the dream lingered the kiss lingered without pressure as he continued to stroke and caress beneath the thin silk there was no place for doubts in soft drowsy light no room for reservations on a soft sagging mattress he touched her seducing both of them into sleepy surrender warm so warm he thought feeling the first real tug of desire as he found her breast diana moaned a little and arched against him he thought he heard his own name whispered against his lips and then her hands were moving over him steeped in her and the fantasy he took his mouth to her shoulder nudging the strap aside they were as strong as he had imagined and smooth following the gentle slope he slipped the chemise down farther pressing quiet sleepy kisses along her arm he could hear her breathing now a little fast a little unsteady and found that his mouth had fastened onto her breast to suckle and nibble he was unaware of passion until the need was a hard knot in his stomach and his own breathing was labored her heartbeat was a hammer against his lips which were now demanding more and she was naked although he wasnt fully aware that he had pulled the short length of silk from her her fingers were digging into his flesh her hips moving in a fastergrowing rhythm his name sighed from between her parted lips for a moment he tried to clear his head separate dream from reality but his body was in full command then he was inside her driven past fantasies and beyond reason chapter eight the light was a dim dark grey shuddering and stunned diana opened her eyes to see only shadows she was cupped in the centre of the bed nestled beneath caine and the thin blanket they had shared through the night though his face was buried against her throat she could hear his unsteady breathing feel the racing thump of his heart against hers his skin was hot and like hers faintly damp her fingers were curled into his hair and the taste of him still lingered on her lips her mind like her body felt heavy as if wrapped in some thick sweet honey tiny thrills of pleasure hummed over her flesh where she could still feel the pressure of his fingers in one flashing explosion her brain cleared with a quick sound of outrage diana struggled from beneath him then rolled to the far edge of the bed how could you dazed caine opened his eyes to stare at her what you gave your word she began a furious search beneath the covers for her camisole still throbbing from her and equally stunned caine dragged a hand through his hair diana i should have known better than to trust you she said pulling the brief covering of the camisole over her before she jumped out of bed her body tingled her limbs felt weighted in defence her eyes grew stormier god knows why i thought youd keep a bargain bargain he repeated blankly you stay on your side of the bed and i stay on mine she reminded him bitterly you and your damn walls of jericho he rubbed a hand over his face are you crazy i must have been diana ranted to have thought youd understand common decency now wait a minute in the dim light caine could make out little more than her silhouette and the faint gleam of her eyes but he could feel his own anger growing surely enough and pushed himself out of bed his temper only increased as he felt a wave of weakness that came from a draining of passion dont tell me to wait a minute diana snapped wrapping her hands around her arms as she started to shiver that was despicable fury and something he didnt recognize as hurt sped through him swiftly despicable he repeated in an ominously low tone despicable in echoing the word he fought for control you didnt appear to think so a few moments ago her own fingers dug into her arms as she tossed back her head no she hadnt thought at all a few moments ago only felt only wanted caine had been right there warm gentle seductive you had no right no right i had no right he retorted and what about you i was halfasleep damn it diana so was i dragging a hand through his hair again caine struggled against a sensation of confused frustrated fury as he fought for calm he grabbed his pants and stepped into them guilt was overwhelming guilt that hed taken her beyond the point shed been prepared for by doing so hed changed things between them just when hed resolved to keep them stable look it just happened i didnt plan it things like that dont just happen shivering she whipped the garish bedspread from the tumbled bed and wrapped herself in it this did caine said between his teeth as he pulled on his turtleneck even anger couldnt completely dissipate the feeling that he had woken from some hazy dream i dont even know how the hell it got started he muttered his eyes seared into hers he might be guilty but he wasnt alone i know when it ended and before it ended you were just as much involved as i was the truth stung and frightened you expect me to believe you didnt know what you were doing she shouted at him that you didnt plan for this to happen on an irresistible wave of fury he swooped up his coat and marched to her why the hell dont you blame me for the blizzard he demanded or for the fact that this this dump he bit off with a violent gesture of his arm only had one room or that the damn mattress sags in the middle i know exactly what to blame you for diana said and what to regret the room fell into deadly silence broken only by the sound of angry breathing and the rumble of the heater she saw something violent flash into his eyes darkening them narrowing them in her own confused fury she welcomed it and a fight you dont regret it any more than i do caine said softly without another word he pulled open the door letting windblown snow rush in before he slammed it behind him alone diana gripped the spread tightly but still felt the icy chill on her skin it was outrage she told herself fury shed trusted him and hed betrayed her deceived her hed made her feel wonderful alive desired a tiny choked sound escaped her as she dropped onto the bed and huddled under the spread no no she told herself as she balled her hands into fists it shouldnt have happened once she had given in to him and to herself it would be only the beginning wouldnt she be right back to having her life dominated by someone who could pick up and leave at any moment not again diana swore pounding her fist on her knee never again shed barely begun to discover herself for herself everywhere in every aspect of her life there was caine whod been there urging her to reconcile with justin hed been there with an answer to her professional problems on her return to boston now he was here tempting her to strip away her last defences expose the last of her emotions would she be any different from irene walker if she allowed it diana wondered when a woman was ruled by emotion didnt she open herself to whatever a man chose to give her closing her eyes she bit down on her lip no she wouldnt couldnt allow it all of her life shed been forced to accept whatever someone chose to give her it had been a mistake she told herself and one she could have avoided if she hadnt dropped her guard and she had every right to be furious with caine hed exploited the situation hed aroused her when she had been drowsy and defenceless dianas shoulders slumped under the spread hed been no more to blame than shed been herself she admitted hadnt she been half dreaming when shed run her hands up his naked back couldnt she remember if she allowed herself to that misty sleepy pleasure in pressing her body against his somewhere in the back of her mind shed known exactly what she was doing and yet shed made no attempt to stop it then she had blamed caine because it was easier than admitting shed wanted to love him squeezing her eyes shut again diana pressed her fingers against her brow oh how could she have said those things to him how could she have acted like some outraged hypocrite when hed been every bit as overwhelmed as she had been pushing the hair away from her face she stared around the empty room what now she wondered apologize though the answer had her shifting uncomfortably dianas conscience held firm shed been wrong dead wrong and admitting it was the only way she could live with it remembering her hard accusing words she knew she couldnt blame him if he told her to take her apology and go to hell with it with a sigh diana rose shed take a hot shower dress and wait for him to come back two hours later diana paced the cramped little room caught somewhere between worry and annoyance what was he doing out there she asked herself for the hundredth time a peek through the drapes showed her that the snow was falling with the same steady speed again she considered going out and looking for him and again she reminded herself that caine had the only key diana wasnt going to depend on the likelihood of securing another from the clerk hes hardly walking around out there she told herself as she pushed the drapes apart again across the lot cars were halfburied in drifts she could see no sign of life only the endless blowing curtain of snow she imagined caine sitting over in the diner enjoying one of his enormous breakfasts and cup after cup of steaming coffee she grew irritated at the picture particularly as her own stomach insisted on reminding her it was empty he was doing it on purpose she decided twitching the curtains back into place punishing me the flood of guilt shed felt earlier was now completely obliterated by resentment and basic hunger infuriated and undeniably trapped between four pink walls diana snatched up her briefcase and flopped in the centre of the unmade bed she wasnt going to waste time worrying about caine macgregor shed catch up on the rest of her paperwork and wait out the storm if he never came back she told herself it was perfectly all right with her pulling out her pad she poured all of her anger and frustration into her work nearly another hour had passed before diana heard the key rattle in the lock tossing down her pad she continued to sit crosslegged in the centre of the bed as caine walked in covered with snow and in no better frame of mind than when he had walked out three hours earlier he glanced at her then shrugged out of his coat her initial intention of greeting him with an apology was overruled as was her second idea of ignoring him where the hell have you been diana demanded caine tossed his wet coat over the table the storms due to continue through the afternoon he said briefly there still arent any other vacancies in this place and the next hotels ten miles down the road diana felt another surge of guilt that slipped away as caine dropped into the chair and calmly lit a cigarette it didnt take you three hours to find that out she snapped didnt it occur to you that i was stuck in here he gave her a glance that would have been mild had his eyes not been so dark couldnt you find the door on a sound of fury diana scrambled off the bed you have the only key with a shrug caine reached in his pocket drew it out then dropped in on the table its all yours he told her as he leaned across to pull a small bag from his coat pocket i picked up a couple of toothbrushes she caught one as he tossed it at her thank you she said icily she wouldnt apologize diana thought if they were stuck in that dreadful little room for the next month since it appears were going to be marooned here for another night we should discuss the arrangements caine fought back anger as it boiled again if he lost it this time he warned himself he would very likely strangle her make whatever arrangements you like he said coolly im going to shave picking up the bag he rose just a minute diana pressed her hand to his chest as he started to walk by her were going to get this straight the chill in his eyes turned quickly to fire dont push me diana push you she retorted do you think you can calmly walk back in here announcing youre going to shave after what happened this morning do you think im going to shrug this off as though it were a slight error in judgment that he returned taking her wrist and holding it aloft would be very wise jerking her wrist free she stood firmly in his path well i wont and youre not going to shave or anything else until you hear exactly what i have to say i heard all i wanted to hear this morning giving her a nonetoogentle shove out of his way caine started toward the bathroom dont you dare walk away from me as the final hold over her temper snapped diana grabbed his arm ive had enough pushed beyond endurance caine spun back around grabbing her shoulders with enough force to cause her to gasp in alarm i dont have to take this from you he shouted i wont calmly stand here while you accuse me of resorting to some devious plan to get you into bed with me i dont need any plan do you understand i could have had you last night and half a dozen times before without any need for ploys he gave her a quick hard shake we both know it damn it i wanted you and you wanted me but you havent got the guts to admit it eyes wide with fury diana pulled out of his hold dont tell me what to admit this morning i was asleep are you awake now he demanded yes damn it im awake now and good in one swift move caine dragged her back in his arms and took her mouth in a hard savage kiss he heard her muffled sound of protest felt her frantic struggles for freedom but only crushed her more tightly against him he thought of punishment he thought of releasing the anger and the tension that had been building and building inside of him since that morning then he thought of how much he needed her and thought of nothing else with his fingers still digging into her shoulders he pulled her away breathing hard eyes locked they stared at each other diana felt desire pounding in her demanding freedom she shook her head once as if to deny it but like an avalanche it was already thundering its way down the mountain surrendering to all the needs raging inside her she pulled his mouth back to hers and took what she wanted there were no gentle sleepy explorations now they were both awake both ravenous each feeding from the others lips as though years had passed since they had tasted this kind of pleasure locked together already struggling against the barrier of clothing they fell into the bed now fury was all passion and passion all urgency impatient diana dragged the sweater over his head then made a deep pleased sound in her throat as her hands found those tight ridges of muscle desperate for more she shifted until she lay half across him her mouth hot and avid on his all the longings she had refused all the desires she had suppressed burst out in one violent explosion she couldnt get enough of him shed known almost from the first that he would be the one to unlock that last door shed had so tightly locked freedom she moaned with the heady painful thrill of it as she nipped into his bottom lip wanting to drive him as she was driven as she began to tug at the hips of his slacks caine groaned rolling on top of her again pushing her deep into the mattress as a lover he was no less than she had expected terrifying vital exciting the slow dreamy loving of the morning had been only a brief sample of what he could bring her to a wildness was growing in her some latent savageness she had once feared and now revelled in with it there were no rules her body was liberated pulsing everywhere at once arching as fluid as hot wine as he pulled clothes from her in a frenzy she heard a low throaty laugh that she didnt recognize as her own as he swore at the last barrier of silk as if driven mad by the sound caine crushed his mouth to hers again probing deep as his impatient hand tore the strap of the chemise in an effort to find her and her lips answered his with equal pressure equal turbulence it seemed akin to war this desperate demanding this frantic challenging his hands ran bruisingly over her and she pressed him closer daring him to take more she heard his ragged breathing match hers as his mouth rushed down to her breast to ravage greedily until they were both past the edge of control passion was a bluewhite fire now searing skin to skin the silk ripped again as he dragged it down mouth and hands speeding after it pausing only to find new surprising points of delight diana cried out when he drove his tongue into her centre but it was a low smoky sound trailing off into a throaty moan her body was damp and agile her movements instinctive arousal came in titanic waves thrusting her up tossing her back cresting again and again and remaining strong as the musky scent of passion whirled in her head she was unaware of the breathless wild demands she uttered reality had spiralled down to one man one need in a single cloudy moment she realized they might be one and the same his name trembled from her lips but whatever words she would have spoken were only a gasp as he drove her to a staggering peak then his mouth was fused to hers again and even as her arms locked around him he took her over the final verge of reason lids heavy body sated diana opened her eyes and found herself staring at their twin reflections in the mirror above the bed experimentally she spread her fingers over his back and watched the movement in the glass how dark her skin looked next to his she thought hazily and what a contrast the colours of their hair made when side by side it was odd to watch his body move with the breathing she could hear and feel she ran her hands over his back again and watched the muscles ripple under them strong she thought with another tingle of pleasure strong and reckless and so diana thought with satisfaction was she sighing she let her fingers dive into his hair caine made a quick impatient sound and started to shift away with a murmured protest she tightened her arms diana lifting his head he stared down at her then with a brief oath he rolled away i didnt mean for that to happen it sounds a little weak after this morning but caine diana shifted so that she lay across his chest again dont she pressed her lips to his until she felt resistance ease im so sorry for the things i said this morning no she laid her fingertips over his mouth i was wrong i knew it even when i was shouting at you but i couldnt stop if id stopped i would have admitted that i wanted you letting her head fall to his shoulder she shut her eyes tight on a long sigh he ran a hand down her hair i didnt mean to touch you again when i came back here she gave a quiet laugh as she pressed her face into his shoulder and i was going to apologize when you got back somehow he murmured i think this was a much better idea for both of us diana he drew her away until their eyes met again ive never wanted anyone he said cautiously exactly the way i want you i dont want to hurt you will you believe that she opened her mouth to speak but knew he would never understand the doubts the lifetime of small fears no questions now she said instead touching her lips to his again no reasons this is enough fighting back the need to press her for more caine gathered her close to his side for now he agreed and found an astonishing surge of pleasure at simply having her lie beside him you know he began as his eyes drifted toward the ceiling im beginning to like this room after all it does have a fascinating view following the direction of his gaze diana gave a wry smile the next thing i know youll ask me for a quarter for the television in the reflection she saw his brow lift questioningly no okay he rolled on top of her ive always preferred doing things myself rather than spectating caine as he nibbled at her neck she sighed tilting her head to accommodate him i hate to bring up something so mundane but im starving mmhmm he ran his lips along her jawline as he traced the shape of her shoulders seriously starving how seriously as in willing to risk another one of those hamburgers that sounds more like desperately he murmured and with a groan he rolled aside okay ill go buy you another slice of ptomaine thanks she said dryly but sat up as he did the moment the contact between them had been broken shed felt some of the tension return foolish she told herself she was a grown woman and lovemaking was part of life wasnt it as simple as that ill go with you its nearly as bad out there as it was yesterday he began as he reached for his pants why did he have the need to gather her to him again reassure her and himself that nothing had changed everything had changed id like to get out of this room for awhile diana let her eyes scan the walls the pink is beginning to close in on me caine tugged his sweater on all right well eat at the scene of the crime he lifted a brow as diana examined her torn chemise i suppose youre going to say i owe you one of those i could take you to small claims court she declared slipping into her blouse without it caine gave a burst of appreciative laughter and grabbed her around the waist itd be worth it just to hear your opening statement as she tipped her head back to smile up at him he was drowned in a wave of emotion too strong to resist desire he told himself almost desperately just desire and desire was easy oh again he murmured before his mouth found hers the fingers that had been buttoning her blouse stilled her head tilted back in surrender but her mouth met his aggressively through parted lips came a sound of quiet lingering pleasure that seemed to skip into the core of him and expand once before she had felt that strange soft texture to his kiss it was infinitely gentle but seemed to demand more than passion when he released her diana was forced to blink to clear her vision caine she said wonderingly was he telling her or asking her or was it something within herself that was questioning he took a step back not quite comfortable with the feeling of uncertainty she could bring out in him im in the position of telling you to get dressed again he smiled but his eyes remained intense otherwise i wont be responsible if you go hungry with fingers that werent completely steady she finished buttoning her blouse i think you like confusing me she muttered im not very good with moods and yours never stays the same sometimes they keep me guessing too he said half to himself when she looked at him her eyes direct her mouth unsmiling he consciously fought off the tension she was vulnerable he was responsible he wasnt at all sure he could handle the responsibility play it light caine warned himself keep it simple maybe i like keeping you in the same mental state im in myself diana gave him one of her long deliberating looks before she smiled do i confuse you caine he met the look as he slipped into his shoes something vibrated in the room that both of them took great care not to notice im going to decline to answer that question at this time interesting diana pulled up the zipper of her skirt that leads me to assume that i do she slipped into her coat i think i like that youll need your gloves was all he said as he pocketed the key again the minute they stepped outside diana sucked in her breath at the force of the wind and the cold the flakes were smaller she thought as she hooked her arm firmly through caines but the wind was going to make the drifts treacherous even after they stopped falling still as she looked around even the battered little motel seemed rather clean and picturesque in its coating of white its not such a bad little place she decided while they struggled against the wind it looks even better after youve been out in this for a while there was a path of sorts through the four feet of snow where other tenants of the motel had fought their way to the diner and back again struggling through this diana still found herself buried up to her knees when she stumbled she tightened her grip on caine sure you dont want to go back in and wait caine shouted close to her ear are you kidding she lifted her face squinting against the flying snow is that it with her free hand diana pointed to the dim outline of a building with floodlights making an eerie glow against the unrelieved white yeah the places been doing a thriving roundtheclock business since the blizzard our notel has all thirtyfive rooms booked youre a fount of information god she went on before caine could retort i could eat two hamburgers well discuss your suicidal tendencies when we get inside here watch out he tightened his grip on her arm to guide her therere steps buried somewhere under here breathless diana stumbled through the door when caine pushed it open the heavy scent of frying grease hung in the air overlaid by tobacco smoke and something that might have been bacon several scratched plasticcoated tables were scattered around the long room with vinylcushioned chairs and paper placemats along the rear of the room was a counter with many of its stools already occupied by diners most of whom turned to stare at the newcomers in a covered dessert dish on the far end were a few tiredlooking doughnuts while behind the counter several signs announced the specials it seemed the meatloaf dinner with gravy was only three fortynine back again the chubby waitress behind the counter sent caine a cheery smile and brought your lady come on in and warm up honey she told diana you could use some coffee i bet yes the dingy atmosphere was forgotten in the face of the friendly greeting id love some coffees on the house as long as it lasts the waitress proclaimed setting two cups and saucers on the counter im peggy sit yourselves down and drink up hungry starving diana said recklessly as she slid onto a stool beside a young nervouslooking man with flyaway hair and glasses we got fresh vegetable soup today peggy told diana as she handed out thin handwritten menus been simmering all morning sounds fine caine decided with a glance at diana mmm for a start she agreed chewing on her bottom lips as she studied the menu two soups hal peggy shouted through the opening that led to the kitchen the blts are popular today she added yes all right that sounds good closing the menu diana reached for a plastic container of cream as the waitress called out the rest of the order caine leaned over nuzzling at dianas ear as he whispered into it eat all you want were going to stock up on candy bars and canned sodas to get through tonight youre so resourceful she murmured turning her head so that her lips met his you folks from out of town peggy asked as she refilled the coffee cup of the man beside diana boston caine told her taking out a cigarette at the small sound of distress from beyond diana he glanced over charlie here was on his way to boston too the waitress said giving the young mans hand a sympathetic pat with his bride she tucked a strand of tumbling blond hair behind her ear and sent caine a quick wink supposed to be our honeymoon charlie muttered staring into his coffee lori took one look at the room and started to cry oh diana gave him an understanding smile i suppose it isnt exactly what she was looking forward to we had reservations at the hyatt he lifted his head then pushing his glasses back on his nose loris very sensitive yes im sure at a loss diana met the helpless stare he looked she thought a bit like a little boy who hadnt found his bicycle under the christmas tree well ah perhaps you could make the room a little more romantic that room with a snort charlie turned back to his coffee candles diana suggested with sudden inspiration as the soup was set on the counter maybe someone has some candles well sure i got a few in the back room peggy said helpfully as she gave the counter a swipe with a rag your bride like candlelight charlie maybe he mumbled but his frown became more thoughtful of course she does diana stirred her soup while she watched him what woman doesnt like candlelight and flowers she added now where can we get flowers got a few plastic poinsettias in the back the waitress cut in getting into the spirit we use em at christmas you know really brightens up the place wonderful you think shed like that charlie asked diana i think shell be very touched well im going to go dig them up wiping her hands on her apron the waitress headed toward the back charlie leaned forward to look at caine what do you think struggling to keep his face grave caine glanced up from his soup i bow to a ladys opinion on matters such as this go ahead kid someone down the counter advised give it a shot yeah abruptly decisive he rose as peggy came back arms full yeah i will here you go honey she passed over three candles in plastic holders and several sprays of plastic poinsettia with large glittered red bows you go fix up your honeymoon suite your little brides gonna feel better thanks he grinned at diana as he stuffed as much as he could into his pockets thanks a lot good luck charlie diana called after him then swung back to her soup catching caines look she arched a brow i think its very sweet i didnt say a word you didnt have to you cynic when he only grinned at her diana turned back to her lunch eat your soup some of us she announced loftily appreciate romance should i buy another bottle of wine he murmured raising her hand to his lips dont you dare laughing she leaned over to kiss him chapter nine behind her desk with the fire noisily burning diana worked at a steady pace shed given the walker case meticulous research careful thought and long hours the story diana felt was almost too typical irene walker had been young fresh out of college when she had married she had never worked her husband hadnt permitted it instead shed kept his home and fixed his meals dedicating her life to his comfort now that their marriage was breaking up irene had no income no training for outside work and a small infant to care for diana was going to see to it that she was compensated for the four years she had worked as housekeeper cook laundress and hostess the fact that irene had been the victim of wifebeating only made diana more determined that her client receive justice and ive got him diana thought with a sense of satisfaction as she closed a law book ive got george walker cold now if irene would just stick with those counselling sessions shaking her head diana reminded herself not to get in any deeper she was already much too emotionally involved in the chad rutledge case she couldnt afford to spread herself too thin chad she thought pressing her hands to her tired eyes a moment things were not moving as smoothly there as they were for irene walker diana had already called over half the names on the list he had given her so far none of the people who knew him or beth could give her any corroborating evidence i need something she thought tossing down her pen in disgust i have to go into court with something more than chads story and my own feelings if i cant break beths story on the stand leaning back in her chair diana stared up at the ceiling and thought through the case as it stood a pretty wellliked college student blond delicate privileged family background a tough streetwise hood with a belligerent attitude and a quick temper if it came down to his word against hers diana had little doubt what the outcome would be then there was the medical evidence berns condition when she was admitted to the hospital emergency room chads admission that he had been with her no she couldnt go into court with nothing more than a story about starcrossed lovers and expect it to work especially when she wasnt too sure of her client oh he was innocent diana mused frowning she didnt doubt that but she was very much afraid that hed lose his head if she started pressing beth too hard diana wouldnt put it past him to stand up in open court and make a full confession with a weary sigh diana reminded herself that she still had the last few names on chads list to contact there were two diana only had first names on which meant a trip to the university and a bit of detective work who said law was all books and briefs she thought then managed a smile for the first time in more than an hour this was what she wanted diana distracted she glanced up oh yes lucy im going to leave now unless you need me for something she found a thread hanging from the sleeve of her dress wrapped it around two fingers and snapped it off caine checked in about half an hour ago his meeting ran over but he said hed be stopping in here before going home oh diana didnt notice lucys speculative look as she gazed into the fire no lucy you go on home i have some things i want to finish up here ill lock up want me to make some coffee before i leave hmm oh no smiling diana glanced back up no thanks have a nice evening you have one too lucy told her with a last meaningful look before she walked back down the hall tell caine i left his messages on his desk all right diana pondered the empty doorway for a moment lucy she decided was a great deal shrewder than that placid round face indicated and i thought i was being so discreet diana thought with a rueful smile working very calmly very practically day after day with caine just next door keeping up the polite friendly tone of colleagues in the same office building but it seemed lucy had caught something a look a gesture a tone of voice diana wondered just how realistic she had been in thinking she could keep her relationship with caine strictly between them she wondered suddenly why she had felt it necessary thoughtful diana rose to walk to the fire it was burning low now the coals piled high and glowing red stooping she added a log and watched it catch with violent snaps and hisses perhaps her emotions had been like that low and carefully banked until caine had come into her life now she knew what it was to feel wild bursts of flame fast crackling heat it was impossible always impossible to remain calm and controlled when she was with him it frightened her he frightened her caine and his ability to make her want him with unrestrained and uninhibited passion caine and his ability to make her think of him at odd moments emotion seemed to come so effortlessly to him and the demonstration of emotion shed been trained for so long to suppress passions control surges of feelings even now that she was freer with them more comfortable with some of them she was poles apart from caine shed never have his spontaneity or his careless selfease diana envied him while not completely understanding him she did understand however that caine had the ability to dominate by force of personality alone perhaps that was why she had insisted that they keep their relationship on a firmly professional level during business hours diana was struggling to hold on to those hours to keep them as a time where she still had complete control over her actions her feelings and her thoughts im going to fall in love with him if im not careful diana thought with a flutter of panic as she watched flames lap greedily around the new log if i havent already catching her bottom lip between her teeth she tried to think clearly but found as she found so often when she attempted to reason her feelings for caine that logic had no place there she wished there was a way to escape him she wished he would come back so that she could be with him with a sound of annoyance she turned away from the fire then heard the phone begin to ring in his office a glance at her watch told her it was nearly six and the offices were officially closed shrugging diana walked next door to answer caine macgregors office she said as she fumbled for the switch on the lamp is he back yet a booming voice demanded no im sorry diana picked up a pen as she slipped into caines chair mr macgregors out of the office may i take a message where is that boy exasperation came clearly over the wire so clearly diana held the receiver a few inches from her ear ive been trying to reach him all afternoon im sorry mr macgregors been in a meeting shall i have him return your call tomorrow damn boy never could stay put the voice muttered i beg your pardon hah dianas brow lifted at the exclamation id be happy to take your name and number and any message youd care to leave this isnt lucy the man stated suddenly where the devils lucy amused and just a bit perplexed diana put down the pen lucys gone for the day this is diana blade im mr macgregors associate is there something justins sister the voice interrupted in a bellow ill be damned now ive been wanting to have a few words with you girl id heard youd set up business there with caine yes she began growing more bewildered do you know my brother know him there was an explosion of laughter of course i know him girl i let him marry my daughter didnt i oh as the light dawned diana sat back in caines chair hadnt she been warned about daniel macgregor how do you do mr macgregor ive heard a great deal about you hah he snorted you dont listen to that son of mine do you she laughed idly toying with the phone cord not even aware that she was relaxing for the first time in eight hours caine speaks very highly of you mr macgregor im sorry youve missed him hmm well he paused as the germ of an idea formed in his mind so youre a lawyer too are you yes i was at harvard a few years behind caine small world small world rena tells me you favour justin good stock ah well a little nonplussed by the phrase diana trailed off good bloods an important thing dont you know yes brows knit she shook her head i suppose no supposing to it girl got to keep the line strong ive a birthday coming up he announced suddenly congratulations i didnt want any fuss he began breezily but my wife loves a party dont like to disappoint her no diana agreed with the beginnings of a smile of course you wouldnt she misses the children you know yes off they went in every direction he said in a pained voice and not a grandchild between them ah diana said again for lack of anything better a few grandchildren to spoil in her winter years he continued with a sigh but when do children think about their parents needs id like to know well anna wants all the children here next weekend he interrupted a family gathering well want caine to bring you along thank you mr macgregor i daniel girl after all youre part of the family now back in hyannis port daniel gave a crafty secret smile his careless words disguised the macgregors look after their own yes im sure she murmured then laughed id love to come for your birthday daniel good thats settled then you tell caine his mother wants him here friday night a lawyer too hmm thats handy aye thats handy friday night diana yes baffled again she stared at caines desk goodbye daniel diana hung up with the odd feeling she had agreed to something entirely different from a weekend visit to hyannis port sitting back in caines chair she thought over the conversation it seemed she mused that daniel macgregor was every bit as eccentric as his legend claimed i wonder how much caines like him diana reflected idly certainly caine had inherited his fathers skill in dominating a conversation when he chose and there was something in the laugh if she hadnt been thrown off by the way hed bellowed into the phone diana would have recognized the macgregor patriarch by the faint scottish burr and what in the world was all that business about good stock hearing the front door open and close diana rose from the desk to walk to the top of the stairs hi as he tossed his coat over a hook on the hall rack caine glanced up hi recognizing the fatigue in the single syllable diana went down to him howd it go he flexed his back three hours with ginnie day diana needed no more lifting her hands she began to knead at the tension in his shoulders you dont like her she said as caine let out a quiet sigh no i dont he stretched under dianas hands shes spoiled selfish and vain she has the courtesy of a nasty fiveyearold it must have been a very pleasant afternoon diana murmured caine chuckled and lifted his hands to her wrists i dont have to like her i just have to defend her it would be easier if ginnie herself wasnt the das best weapon theres no way to make a jury see her as a sympathetic victim most of the emotionll be on the prosecutions side while ill have to stick with straight law youre going for a bench trial diana said as she studied her face a hint of a smile played on his mouth as he nodded in agreement id rather present this kind of case to a judge when i told ginnie she had a temper fit and fired me laughing at dianas outraged expression caine cupped her face in his hands then kissed her for about five minutes he added she might be rude but shes not stupid it sounds to me as though it would have served her right if youd taken her dismissal at face value and walked out would you he countered her face relaxed into a smile no but id have been tempted are you through for the day yeah his hand slipped to her waist to gather her closer absolutely then get your coat she ordered on an impulse that would have surprised her even weeks before im going to take you to dinner then she added as she took her own coat from the hook im going to lure you back to my place really really here gravely diana handed him his coat caine studied her noting that her eyes were as confident as her words he touched her hair i like your style counsellor macgregor diana returned as she buttoned his coat herself you havent seen anything yet flushed with cold and gripping an icy bottle of champagne diana opened the door of her apartment dinner had relaxed them slowly nudging the demands of their work the people whose lives and problems dominated so many of their hours to the back of their minds now they were just a man and a woman with lives and problems of their own ill get the glasses diana stated handing the bottle to caine he glanced idly at the label i suppose you intend to fuddle my mind with champagne coming back with two tulip glasses she smiled im counting on it why dont you open that lifting a brow caine tore the foil from the top of the bottle i might not be as easily manipulated as you think oh no diana set down the glasses then slid her hands up the front of his suit jacket slipping it off him this time she would test her own strengths and his weaknesses this time she wouldnt be led she would lead an open and shut case she murmured nibbling lightly on his bottom lip as she loosened the knot of his tie when she felt his arms come around her she drew back keeping her lips inches from his how about that champagne didnt we drink it already on a low laugh she caught the end of his tie between her thumb and forefinger no slowly she slipped the tie off and tossed it aside she felt a quick thrill at her own action and wondered if he felt it too why dont you pour it she murmured undoing the first three buttons of his shirt ill put on some music as she crossed the room diana stepped out of her shoes she turned the stereo on low so that the soft bluesy number was hardly more than a whisper when she dimmed the lights caine glanced over to see her slip off her pinecoloured blazer i think he said quietly as he filled the both glasses im in trouble with a laugh that was more of a sigh diana walked back to him you are in trouble taking a glass she sat on the sofa and pulled him down beside her deep trouble she added nipping at his ear maybe i should put myself entirely in your hands turning his head he found her mouth with his but she allowed him only the briefest taste my thoughts exactly she touched the rim of her glass to his then drank have i ever told you she began while her fingers began to toy with the curls that fell over his ears that you fascinate me no do i caine lifted his hand to draw her closer but diana caught it in hers yes slowly she brought his hand to her lips pressing them against his palm tonight she would be all woman only a woman strong hands watching him she kissed his fingers one by one one of the first things i noticed was that they werent the soft lawyers hands id expected i wondered how theyd feel on my skin she laced her fingers with his as she brought the glass to her lips again feeling desire sprint through him caine stared at her she was mesmerizing him he hadnt known she could and the feeling left him burning and oddly weak in the dim light her eyes were dark and mysterious with the seductively languid look that had stirred him from the first moment diana then there was your mouth she went on letting her eyes linger on it such a clever mouth she brushed her lips lightly over his the first time you kissed me i couldnt think of anything else exciting she whispered tilting her head back ever so slightly when he sought to deepen the kiss and at times indescribably gentle i could spend hours and hours doing nothing more than kissing you but she shifted away to watch him over the rim of her glass as she drank champagne diana caines voice was low as he cupped his hand around her neck to drag her closer diana kept herself a frustrating distance away with her hand against his chest more time she thought greedily she wanted more of it to explore a power shed just discovered i like your eyes she murmured she could feel his need the tension of his need in the fingers that pressed into her skin he had always driven her quickly beyond control each time he touched her this time she thought flushed with power this time she would drive him then revel in the consequences i like the way they darken when you want me i can see it she spread her fingers over his chest i love seeing it youre tense as she felt his heart thud furiously beneath her palm her own speeded up to race with it you should drink your champagne and relax throbbing he met the challenge in her eyes through sheer force of will he lightened his grip and fought back the first flood of need she fully intended to drive him mad and knowing it caine determined to regain some control you know that i want you keeping his eyes on hers he lifted the glass you know that ill have you perhaps she smiled again as she shook back her hair her scent seemed to drift out from it to wrap around him the wine bubbled icily over her tongue adding to the sense of power i think of storms when i think of making love to you leisurely she ran a fingertip down his shirtfront then back up to loosen the rest of the buttons that morning on the beach when i first kissed you that little motel room in the blizzard storms and wind strange i never get a picture of anything placid she ran her hand over his naked chest slowly very slowly moving down if you want me to be gentle he managed as the soft touch of her fingers tore at his restraint this isnt the way did i say thats what i wanted she asked with a low laugh watching him diana took his mouth again this time allowing the kiss to linger his mind clouded her taste that wicked scent setting his glass aside caine plunged both hands into her hair and dove into the kiss more was all he could think he had to have more and still more her mouth had softened seductively under his with a deceptive surrender he would have recognized had his mind been as clear as his need her quiet sigh seemed to race through him with his breathing already laboured caine reached for the zipper at the back of her dress not yet not yet diana ordered herself as her thoughts began to swim passion was lapping at her as the flames had lapped at the log she had watched in the fire but she wanted something more tonight she wanted a few more moments of control she wanted to prove to herself that she could erase every layer of the polish that lay over the dangerous inner man she had once feared what would happen if the two of them came together without that safe gloss of sophistication now she craved it feeling her dress begin to loosen she pulled away diana caine began on a half groan but she evaded him and rose dont you want any more champagne she asked pouring more into her glass in one quick move caine stood and grabbed her arm you know damn well what i want another thrill of excitement sped into her reflecting in her eyes even as she kept her voice low yes impulsively she drained her glass then held it lightly by the stem such a civilized drink take me to bed she invited softly as she stepped closer and make love to me as the last thread of control snapped caine yanked her against him the glass fell to the rug to roll across the room here he demanded and now with his mouth crushed on hers he dragged her to the floor his hands seemed to be everywhere at once seeking finding while his mouth stayed fused to hers diana gloried in it and while her body wildly responded sought to drive him further from reason her mouth was aggressive meeting his with a hot hungry fury that could only partially show the needs raging inside her she would feed on his desire even while she stoked it she pulled the shirt from his back and when his mouth freed hers briefly nipped her teeth lightly into his shoulder with a halfmuffled oath caine crushed her roaming mouth with his again he peeled the dress from her quickly hands rushing to possess the soft naked skin desire was stabbing at him painful forcing him to hurry where he would have lingered driving him to take quickly what he would have savored he thought he had felt need before but it had never been like this unreasonable unmanageable a rough urgency took the place of skill when he at last had her naked beneath him her taste filled him but he hadnt the patience to relish it her soft rounded curves entranced him but he hadnt the will to wait the whispering music seemed to be all bass and drums now pounding taunting and her scent promised no more and no less than the passion of the woman beneath him he swore once with no knowledge of whom of what he was cursing then took her with a force that had her gasping out his name halfmad he covered her mouth with his and swallowed the sounds he drove her drove himself until there was only blinding heat and whirling colours caine knew nothing else savagely he wanted nothing else caught in the vortex of the storm they moved like lightning until shattered their strength drained with something like pain he felt sanity return still he couldnt move his breath came in gasps he couldnt control as he buried his face in her hair he was trembling he realized with a small sliver of fear no woman no passion had ever made him tremble what was she doing to him he wondered as he tried to catch his breath the last thing he clearly remembered was pulling her to the floor all the rest came back as sensations they might have lain there for ten minutes or for hours he couldnt think even now that the desperation had passed he still couldnt think had he hurt her his mood had been close to violent when he had dragged her to the floor thered been something about the way she had looked at him when shed told him to take her to bed in that moment he had lost all sense of time and place and any tenuous claim hed still held to being civilized dazed caine lifted his head to look down at her her eyes were open though those long heavy lids were nearly closed her skin held that flushing glow of passion just spent incredibly he felt fresh desire ripple through him dropping his face back into her hair he took deep steadying breaths he needed a minute he told himself good god he needed a minute or hed take her like a madman again sighing his name diana ran her hands over his back thered been something in his eyes just then shed never expected to see vulnerability she didnt feel power now but wonder and something else that made her touch gentle and soothing no she hadnt expected to see vulnerability and even as she nestled closer diana wasnt certain she wanted to see it seeing it in his eyes only forced her to face her own weakness slowly and with uncanny success hed scaled the walls of her defences and things werent so simple any longer she could feel his heartbeat begin to level the breath that feathered over her ear grew steadier when caine lifted his head again his eyes werent giving away any secrets youre a surprising woman diana he kissed her but touched the lips still warm and swollen from his gently why she murmured all that passion all that fire he added as his lips continued to nibble at hers in a woman who takes such pains to be dignified cool unflappable you wanted to make me crazy didnt you she sighed as his mouth began to feast at her throat triumph glowed through her shed discovered one more part of diana blade i did make you crazy his lips curved into a smile against her skin before he lifted his head again well have that champagne now before i take you to bed as you asked caine poured more wine into the glass on the table then offered it to her we seem to have lost the other glass well share this one sitting up diana drank letting the champagne pour through her with its icy effervescence its tastes even better now she said with a smile as she passed it back to caine as you said he sipped as his eyes answered her smile a civilized drink diana caine lifted his hand to her hair and watched his fingers comb through it stay with me at my place this weekend we can eat in watch old movies the grin touched his eyes again neck on the sofa were both going to be under a lot of pressure these next few weeks with the cases coming to trial it might be the last time for quite a while that well have the time to be together like this the picture he painted was tempting and frightening one more step into intimacy yet even as a part of her wanted to back away she couldnt resist i cant think of anything id rather oh with a look of comic dismay on her face diana paused in the act of reaching for the glass your father with a chuckle caine took another sip before he handed her the wine what does my father have to do with it he called i forgot completely her eyes laughed at him as she drank i believe weve received a royal summons oh came traced a fingertip over the slope of her shoulder enjoying how dark and smooth her skin looked in the dim light for the weekend diana elaborated laughing out loud when his fingertip stopped the weekend your fathers birthday leaning across him diana filled the glass again he doesnt want a fuss you know but your mother of course with a wry smile caine shifted so that he could replace his fingertip with his lips my quiet undemanding father would simply treat his birthday as any other day of the year hell only go through the noise and fuss and bother of a party for my mothers sake and naturally hell only accept presents because she expects it if it were up to him the day would pass without a thought chuckling diana struggled to concentrate on his words as he began to lightly caress her well it was very sweet of him to include me in the invitation im looking forward to it i enjoyed talking to him even if the conversation was a bit confusing how he carefully traced her ear with his tongue taking the glass from her as it began to slip through her fingers mmm he said something about justin and i being from good stock caine as he caught the lobe in his teeth diana lost track of her own words what else he murmured pleased that her voice was unsteady and her body pliant against his it wasnt often he could coax her into this kind of surrender sweet and complete this time they would go slowly and he would savour every moment something something about it being handy we were both lawyers somehow she was cradled in his arms with his lips roaming her face his hands roaming her body and she was helpless i see and he did with a sigh that was halfamused halfexasperated caine continued to take her deeper did rena ever mention to you how she and justin happened to meet what drugged her eyes already closed her body already melting she couldnt understand the question or the need for it no no she didnt caine make love to me he wondered how she would react when she learned his father had engineered rena and justins meeting in the hope of their making a match he wondered how she would react when she learned daniel macgregor wasnt above applying a bit of genial pressure to secure what he might feel was a suitable mate for his youngest son and that she would fit the bill very nicely he wondered as his lips toyed with hers how he felt about the idea himself but it wasnt a night for thinking caine decided as her arms wound around his neck it wasnt a night for thinking at all rising he lifted her and took her to bed chapter ten diana sat behind her desk staring into the fire that crackled and spat in the hearth in her hand she held irene walkers file numb she stayed perfectly still as a log crumbled quietly in the grate she couldnt believe it even running the conversation over again in her mind diana couldnt believe it charges dropped divorce action cancelled glancing down diana studied the neatly written check that had been left on her desk paid in full thanks but no thanks irene walker had decided to give her husband another chance hes so sorry that he hurt me diana could hear irenes soft apologetic voice as if her former client were still in the room and he promised it would never happen again never happen again diana thought letting the file folder drop no therapy no counselling but it would never happen again irene walker lived in a dream world diana thought grimly and the next nightmare might leave her with more than a few loose teeth and some bruises damn after pounding a fist on the folder diana sprang up damn we had him cold all that paperwork all those hours of careful research for nothing and sooner or later irene would be back to go through the whole ugly mess again diana stared at the neat manila folder knowing every word it contained yes she would be back it was inevitable frustration drove diana to whirl to the window to glare out at the frosttipped branches how could irene love him after everything hed done to her how could she want to go back take her child back to that kind of life it would be like living with an open keg of gunpowder dear god diana thought on a sigh of disgust what a pitiful wasted life at the knock on her door she continued to stare out at the naked trees and frosty hedges yes bad time caine asked crossing the threshold but coming no farther into the room with her temper heating up diana turned irene walker she said moving to the desk to pick up the file she just reconciled with her husband caine glanced at the file then up into the smouldering fury in dianas eyes i see how could she be such a fool diana put the folder back down and strode to the fire he calls her up sweettalks her into seeing him then with a few roses for good measure convinces her hes a new man caine walked to the desk noting the check maybe he is are you joking diana demanded spinning around why should a few weeks separation make any difference shes left him before shed never started divorce proceedings before he pointed out that and the threat of a criminal action might make a man do some serious thinking oh hes done some thinking she agreed bitterly no he didnt want to face a possible jail sentence he didnt want to lose his wife and child and a good portion of his income but whats he done to deserve clemency nothing dragging a hand through her hair diana paced the room he wont agree to therapy or marriage counselling she says he doesnt want to make their problems public public she repeated gesturing broadly she burns the meat and he beats her in the backyard in front of the neighbours but he doesnt want to discuss the problem with a professional and she diana trailed off dropping into a chair shes hopeless how can she love someone who periodically uses her for a punching bag do you think she loves him caine countered do you really believe love has anything to do with it why else wouldnt it make sense to say shes more afraid of being on her own than she is of risking another beating crouching down in front of her caine took dianas hand diana loves a strong motivation but it isnt always the reason for staying with something even when it hurts maybe not i dont know the feeling of helplessness swamped her again love she didnt understand it for most of her life hadnt had to deal with it but it seemed love was the one emotion that turned a reasonably intelligent person into a fool it was a maze she thought in frustration full of dead ends wrong turns and potholes she thinks she loves him diana said at length because of that shes risking everything were lawyers he reminded her not psychiatrists irene walkers problem is no longer a legal one i know on a long breath she squeezed his hand but its so frustrating to know she couldve been helped even he couldve been helped and now now you take her folder file it and forget it caine gave her a long steady look you dont have any other choice its hard yeah but its necessary we can only advise in a legal frame diana we can only work with the law once something goes beyond that its out of our hands it has to be out of our hands he added why didnt we choose something simpler she murmured and something less painful it looks so basic from the outside this is right and this is wrong according to the law and this is how we might get around it legally speaking with a sigh of frustration she shook her head then suddenly therere people involved and its not so simple i wanted to help her damn it caine i really wanted to help her you cant help someone unless theyre ready for help and irene walker isnt ready for help diana nodded but her eyes still smouldered how could she explain that she saw the walker case her first case out on her own as her first failure both professionally and personally diana had felt that freeing irene from bondage would somehow have symbolized her own liberation from another kind of domination irenes was physical hers had been emotional and neither had been healthy i was ready to help her she said after a long breath i needed to help her he saw it then the vulnerability that could creep so unexpectedly into her eyes and bring him twin urges to protect and to run for cover caine stayed where he was while a quiet war raged inside him you cant keep drawing parallels diana she closed down instantly her emotional withdrawal should have relieved him he wished it had i have to work my own way she told him flatly we all do caine agreed in the same tone he should have left it at that but even as he told himself to he went on trying to reach her i defended a kid once drinking while intoxicated first offence i got him off with the minimum three months later he wrapped his car around a telephone pole and killed his passenger his eyes darkened with the memory but remained steady on hers she was seventeen years old oh caine at a loss diana could only reach for his hand we all carry around our baggage diana we can only do the best job we can and hope its right when its wrong or when one gets away from us we file it away youre right the anger seeped out of her as she rose i know youre right deliberately she took the walker file and dropped it into her desk drawer case closed she murmured as she shut the drawer lucy tells me you have two other clients coming in next week making an effort diana shook off the depression and looked back at him i handled them when i was with barclay they must have been satisfied caine grinned at her expression pleased with yourself well after all theyre coming to me not barclay stevens and fitz walking over he lifted his hands to her shoulders the tension was gone youre going to be very busy i certainly hope so with a smile diana slid her hands around his waist in order to become the best defence attorney on the east coast i require clients it helps caine agreed and gave her a quick kiss on the nose in the meantime its he glanced at his watch four fortyseven on friday evening so late diana smiled ruefully ive been brooding for some time are you finished brooding for the day yes absolutely then lets go my fatherll carry on for an hour if were late dont tell me youre worried about a tonguelashing diana asked with a laugh as she took her purse from the bottom drawer of her desk you dont know my father caine told her pulling her out the door diana found the trip relaxing and quick caine had been right she decided in telling her to file and forget the walker case and for the weekend she would slip chad rutledge and her other cases to the back of her mind it was time for the lawyer to ease off so that the woman could breathe she could look forward to seeing justin again with none of the doubts and pain shed taken with her to atlantic city perhaps this time they would be simply brother and sister a family though not on the same order as the macgregor clan it was natural to think of them as a clan diana had already seen caines close relationship with his sister even if it hadnt been obvious from the way caine had spoken of the rest of his family the phone call from daniel clearly showed just how much a family in every sense of the word the macgregors were diana found herself intrigued and a bit intimidated with the idea what she knew of family relationships was all secondhand that she mused meant she knew virtually nothing at all in boston caine macgregor was a dynamic successful attorney with a reputation for winning and women in boston he was her lover and her associate in hyannis port caine was a son and a brother diana knew very little of that side of him would he be different she mused wouldnt he have to be in her aunts house diana had always been a different person following a different set of rules logically she thought the same would hold true for caine as the car climbed higher diana caught a few glimpses of the sound with waves tossing below for a moment she lost herself in it appreciating the rocks froth and energy but when she looked up again her impression of nantucket sound faded with a new image the house was grey against the cold winter sky huge and structured like a fortress it stood with its back to the water there was a fairytale aura about it set apart built high standing against a dark moonless sky with dozens of windows burning with light it was ostentatious a bit foolish and unapologetically pretentious oh caine its wonderful diana leaned forward as the jaguar sped closer what a marvellous place to grow up its the closest thing to a scottish castle ive ever seen outside of a book my fathers going to be crazy about you with a half grin he glanced at her not everyone has the same impression of it at first glance my father has a few quirks he decided after a moment he built the house to please himself i cant think of a better reason to build one she tilted her head so that she could see the top of the tower there was a flag blowing wildly in the wind diana didnt need to see the colours to know it would be a scottish flag you must have loved growing up here yeah caine allowed his gaze to sweep from the tower to the sea wall it was odd he thought that dianas reaction brought him both pleasure and relief until that moment he hadnt realized how disappointed he would have been if shed been politely stunned yeah he repeated as his lips curved i guess we all did its huge and the devil to heat everythings done on a grand scale wide draughty corridors high ceilings and fireplaces you could roast an ox in gothic arches granite pillars and a wine cellar thats the closest thing to a dungeon ive ever seen we used to play spanish inquisition down there oh diana sent him an appalled look what lovely children you must have been i like to think we were inventive laughing she turned her attention back to the house it must be difficult to stay away no because you know its always going to be here and you can come back therere memories in every room caine swung the car around the circular drive and stopped maybe i should warn you that the inside is exactly what youd expect from the outside dungeons and all diana agreed with a nod as she stepped out i wouldnt have it any other way well get the bags later his hand linked with hers caine started up the rough granite steps on the door was a large brass knocker in the shape of a lions head caine pounded it against the wood as he read the gaelic inscription over it royal is my race he translated with a grin im impressed of course you are bending down he touched his lips to hers then with a quiet sound of pleasure he drew her closer and so am i he murmured before he deepened the kiss instinctively she wrapped her arms around him pressing her body against the warmth of his as the night wind whipped around them it was easy always so easy to forget everything but the feel and the taste of him she felt his fingers brush over the nape of her neck as he tangled them in her hair her head tilted back inviting more as her bones began to soften thats one way to ward off the chill dianas head whipped around at the voice leaning against the door was a tall angular man with dark brooding looks and a full sculptured mouth that was curved in a smile its the only way caine returned and gave the man a hard unselfconscious hug my brother alan caine told diana as he drew her inside out of the cold diana blade with her hand enveloped in the senators firm quick grip diana found herself quietly and thoroughly summed up there was something about that dark intense look she thought a bit uncomfortably that would brush away the nonsense and get right to the core he was more like caine than she had imagined even though there was almost no resemblance between them physically its good to have you here diana alans gaze changed so swiftly from intense to welcoming she wondered if she had imagined that brief appraisal everyones in the throne room at dianas lifted brow caine laughed and drew off her coat a family term for one of the drawing rooms its a barn carelessly he tossed their coats over the carved lions head that served as a newel post for the main staircase rena here she and justin were already settled in when i got here alan answered diana watched the silent subtle look that passed between the brothers well i guess that puts me at the top of the list then alan grinned a quick unexpected expression that lightened his features yeah caine swung an arm around dianas shoulders as they began to walk down the hall bringing diana should redeem me he shot his brother another look you come alone i take it ive already had the lecture alan returned dryly thirtyfive years old and without a wife he stated in a soft burr remarkably like his fathers im in disgrace better you than me caine murmured should i know what you two are talking about diana demanded with a puzzled smile caine looked down at her then up to meet his brothers amused eyes you will he muttered soon enough diana opened her mouth to question then was interrupted by the sound of a booming voice echoing off the walls the boy should come and see his mother more often children today are a disgrace what do they think about the line their ancestors and the generations to come wheres the pride in the family name hes off and running caine said under his breath he paused his arm still around dianas shoulders at the entrance to the drawing room to say the room was impressive would have been an understatement it had the dimensions of a ballroom with one huge claretcoloured rug spreading from wall to wall at the far end was an enormous stone fireplace piled high with wood and flame the windows ran from floor to ceiling along one side with stainedglass inserts along the top the drapes were red and heavy but spread open so that the fire danced in reflection on the many panes furniture was gothic and oversized to suit the room a belter table held an ornate urn and a porcelain casket box the paintings against the thick dark panelling were all in fussy gilded frames sitting on the stone hearth was a lifesize statue of a jackal though there were no less than a dozen chairs and sofas scattered about the family was grouped in one section around a wide highbacked chair carved and curved like a throne and upholstered in the same red as the carpet and drapes in it sat a barrel of a man redbearded strikingly handsome in a bold warlike fashion it was a simple matter for diana to imagine him with a kilt and dirk rather than the fullcut italian suit he wore there was a woman to his right with fineboned features and dark slightly greying hair as daniel continued with his complaints her expression remained serene while her fingers were busy forming a pattern with floss and needle in a cloth held taut on a standing hoop to the left serena was curled on a curved overstuffed lounge idly watching the colours of the fire reflect in a glass of kirsch justin sat beside her his arm draped carelessly over the back of the lounge his fingers toying absently with his wifes hair theyre his court diana thought as her lips curved and theyve heard this proclamation hundreds of times before what a magnificent man she decided watching daniel drain the liquor in his glass before he continued it seems a small thing to ask daniel went on to have your children pay their respect to their father on his birthday it might be my last one he added shooting a look at his daughter you say that every year caine commented before serena could retort its his traditional threat serena stated as she sprang up to race to caine she hugged him fiercely giving him a hard kiss before turning to hug diana im so glad you came serena told her then took both her hands diana was as overwhelmed by the greeting as she was warmed by it she found the macgregors unselfconsciously physical shows of affection appealed to her while leaving her uncertain if she were capable of returning them im glad to be here you look wonderful with a laugh serena kissed her again ill pour your drinks give me a hand alan you need one too diana turning diana saw justin standing beside her pleasure and a sudden sense of awkwardness ran through her so that while her eyes lit with the first her hand reached for his with the second justin took it then lacing his fingers with her drew diana to him will you kiss me little sister he would ask diana thought as the clear green eyes stayed on hers to give her the choice of backing away rising on her toes she brushed his lips with hers and felt the awkwardness vanish oh its good to see you justin on impulse she wrapped her arms around him and held tight its so good to see you justin kissed the top of her head returning the embrace as his gaze drifted to caines he felt something the instinct that tells a person when two people close to him are intimate the knowledge flashed into his eyes as caine met his stare without faltering caine read justins expression easily and kept silent he remembered exactly how hed felt when he had found serena sharing justins suite at the comanche annoyed uncomfortable possessive protective all the feelings an older brother has when he suddenly discovers his sisters grown up in front of his eyes their friendship spanned a decade but fate had sent them a curve so that each had found himself attracted to the others sister ties of friendship and ties of blood ran strong in both of them caine justin brought diana to his side holding her there a moment as he tried to sort out his emotions well damn it are you going to keep the girl in the doorway or are you going to bring her in daniel demanded giving an impatient wheeze as he hauled himself out of his chair let me have a look at that sister of yours justin rena my glass is empty its nice to see you too caine drawled as he crossed the room hah daniel exclaimed as he gave him a stern look caine merely grinned at him until the folds on daniels wide face shifted with a bellowing laugh disrespectful young pup he gathered his son to him in a bear hug and gave him three hearty slaps on the back youre late your mother was worried you werent coming as long as i havent missed dinner caine unfolded himself from his father and went to anna so this is diana daniel clasped her by both shoulders a fine looking girl he decided with a quick nod youve a bit of your brother in you tall strong he went on aye blood will tell diana lifted a brow at the greeting thank you daniel i appreciate you including me in your family weekend ah but youre part of the family now arent you swinging her around he faced his wife a handsome girl aye anna lovely anna agreed then held out her hands dont let him make you feel like a thoroughbred at auction diana its just a habit of his come sit down a thoroughbred at auction daniel blustered now what kind of talk is that straight talk caine said casually as he sat on the arm of the sofa beside his mother thanks rena he gave his sister a wink as she passed out drinks daniel harrumphed and settled back into his thronelike chair so we have another lawyer in the family he began caine shot him a long deadly look but he continued placidly i have great respect for the law you know having two sons who passed the bar of course alans so busy with politics he doesnt take the time for anything else youre top of the list now caine muttered under his breath causing his brother to shrug and you went to harvard too daniel stated between sips now thats a coincidence for you small world small world his gaze skimmed briefly over his youngest son and now you two are partners were not partners caine and diana said in unison then shot each other a rueful look arent you now his fathers smile caine thought was entirely too bland now i wonder where i got an idea like that well he gave diana a paternal smile rena tells me you grew up in boston diana anna interrupted tranquilly as she began to embroider again do you know the omarra family my aunt was well acquainted with a louise omarra yes louise and what was her husbands name brian yes brian and louise omarra odd people anna smiled as she finished another stitch they really enjoy playing bridge a chuckle escaped diana before she could muffle it glancing up she caught annas quick knowing wink i hate the game myself anna went on stitching again perhaps because im so poor at it no caine corrected giving her hair a tug youre poor at it because you hate it the omarras have three grandchildren if im not mistaken daniel put in then narrowed his gaze as it swept around the room nice try caine murmured to his mother how do you feel about children diana daniel leaned back in his chair and fixed his clever eyes on her children she heard a muffled laugh from behind her which alan disguised halfheartedly with a fit of coughing caine muttered something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like an oath well i havent had a great deal of experience with them she began sending caine a puzzled look where would we be without children daniel demanded leaning forward again to give us that sense of continuity of responsibility as he spoke he punctuated his words with a thump of his finger on the arm of his chair your glass is empty caine said abruptly and rose keep it up he said under his breath as he took the glass from his fathers hand and ill dilute every bottle of scotch in the house well now daniel cleared his throat and considered the possibility dinner should be ready soon shouldnt it anna i think serena whispered to justin that we might take a bit of the pressure off our siblings go ahead justin brushed his lips over her cheek im dying to see his face speaking of children serena said ignoring the fulminating look caine shot at her i think dad has a very good point a good point daniel repeated bouncing back to the topic with gusto of course i have a good point its disgraceful your mother without a single grandchild to spoil heartbreaking serena murmured sending her mother a wink well justin and i have decided to remedy that in about six and a half months and about time daniel began then stopped as his mouth hung open better late than never serena countered laughing at his stunned expression she rose and went to her father nothing to say macgregor youre with child with a smile at his phrasing she bent to kiss his cheek yes youll have your grandchild before the leaves turn in september as diana watched daniels eyes filled my little girl he murmured then rose to cup her face in his hands my little rena i wont be little for long daniel gathered her close always my little girl diana looked away moved and strangely unsettled by the scene she saw caine his gaze fixed on his sister his eyes dark and intense as they were when he worked out a complicated point of law hes trying to see her as a mother diana reflected hes trying to picture himself as an uncle to her child justins child she realized with a jolt her brothers child something stirred in her that old buried need for family hardly realizing she moved diana stood and went to justin to your child she said quietly and lifted her glass to the health and beauty of your son or daughter and to our parents who would have loved it justin stood taking her hand as he murmured something in comanche i dont remember the language diana told him thank you he translated aunt of my children well have champagne tonight daniel bellowed suddenly and caught serena close again another macgregors on the way blade justin and diana corrected together aye blade flushed with good humour he grabbed justin in one of his bear hugs good blood he declared then hugged diana for good measure until she was laughing and gasping for breath strong stock when he released her the words played back in dianas head a glimmer of a notion flitted through her head then fixed oh my god she thought he was talking about me about me and stunned she turned her head so that her eyes met caines he was watching her his arm draped around his sisters shoulder reading dianas glazed expression accurately he gave her a crooked smile and lifted his glass he couldnt sleep caine didnt have to lie in bed and stare at the ceiling to know he couldnt sleep instead he sat in a straddle chair smoking slowly as he watched the moonlight play on the bare branches outside his window the house was quiet now a quiet all the more complete after the noise and laughter at the dinner table strange how right diana had looked in the enormous shadowy room strange he thought again how right it had seemed for her to be here in the home of his childhood hed managed or nearly managed to rationalize his feelings about her for weeks he was attracted to her enjoyed her company liked to watch her laugh found pleasure in her passion it had been true of other women perhaps caine thought as he studied the tip of his cigarette it had been true of too many other women why couldnt he stop thinking about her hour after hour day after day why did he know before he had even attempted it that he wouldnt be able to walk away from her and he wouldnt by god he wouldnt let her walk away from him on a sound of annoyance he crushed out his cigarette and rose there were times when he couldnt rationalize his feelings he couldnt quite convince himself hed just enjoyed helping her along on her road to selfdiscovery there were times when he knew and was terrified that he was in love with her wanted needed those were easy words love wasnt not for caine love meant commitment one to one it meant giving and sharing deep intimacies when hed been very careful never to dip below the surface with any woman until diana for wanting and needing the path was clear but for loving it took all sorts of unexpected twists and treacherous turns it sounded like an easy word an easy word when applied to someone else he mused he loved and wasnt sure of his next step and how did diana blade feel about him caine wondered he stared out the window his palms resting on the sill she was a woman who budgeted her affections meticulously she wanted and needed him but with a short laugh caine turned away to light another cigarette to prowl restlessly around the room love how did a man go about coaxing love from a woman that was something hed been very careful to avoid and somehow he didnt think love could be coaxed from a woman like diana it was either there or it wasnt or it was there he continued thoughtfully and she wouldnt admit it suddenly painfully he needed her the softness the heat she would be asleep in the high huge fourposter in the next room without giving himself a chance to think caine crushed out his cigarette and went into the hall he knew every inch every board without faltering he found the door to dianas room and stepped inside closing it quietly behind him there was only moonlight here pale streams of it slanted over the bed the fire had been lit but was down to embers that gave neither heat nor light shed snuggled beneath the quilt for warmth her slow quiet breathing barely moved it emotions flooded him as he watched her and altered the hunger to an aching tenderness he knew at once how it would be to see her like this night after night to know when he woke each morning she would be beside him and he knew too what his life would be like without her bending he brushed his lips over her cheek diana he murmured as she sighed in sleep and shifted on the pillow whispering her name again he began to trace kisses over her face nibbling lightly at her lips until he felt her sleepy response i want you diana pressing his mouth to hers he let his tongue wake her on a sound of pleasure her response grew more active then coming fully awake she let out a gasp of surprise and scrambled up caine she hissed aware that her heart was pounding from a combination of fear and desire you scared me to death it didnt feel like fear he said quietly as he sat on the bed taking her shoulders he drew her closer what are you doing in here its the middle of the his mouth silenced her sweetly effectively slowly he slid his hands down finding to his pleasure that she was warm and soft and naked caine her mouth found a brief freedom as he tasted the curve of her shoulder you cant your parents house i can he corrected and heard her breath catch as his hands moved lower anywhere i want you diana i cant sleep for wanting you let me show you caine but his mouth was on hers again there was no protest as he pressed her back against the feather pillow had he ever loved her like this before diana wondered dazedly as he moved his lips and hands leisurely over her once once in that first dreamlike loving there was no urgency no hurry it was as if theyd had years together and were assured of years more slowly he savoured the tastes of her mouth the tastes of her skin murmuring in approval as he went steeped in him she could find no will to rush the blazing passion she had grown used to was banked smouldering like an easy fire in a comfortable hearth they moved at the same lazy pace whispering requests murmuring in pleasure while they lay flesh to flesh beneath the thick quilt she hadnt been aware he had so much tenderness in him or indeed that she had it in herself she wanted to please him and to soothe her hands touched gently as his did but even gentleness aroused as the lazy stroking continued she seemed to become more and more aware of her body every pore every pulse with a long quiet moan diana surrendered to the next phase of passion he could hear the change in her breathing the subtle alteration in the rhythm of her body her needs accelerated his own he was dizzy from the scent of her mixed with the faintest touch of woodsmoke from the dying fire the linen sheets worn smooth and thin through the years skimmed over his skin as her hands pressed him closer as her desire deepened the taste of her seemed to grow darker and sweeter he kept his mouth light on hers toying with her tongue nipping while her fingers dove into his hair he slipped into her slowly aroused by the gasp of surprise that became a moan of need though she arched in invitation he kept his pace easy murmuring mindless promises against her lips as she shuddered for more the greater his need the tighter he clung to control hazy waves of passion rippled through him as she crested once yet he guided her gently up again and again saturated with desire she murmured his name over and over so that he quieted her with a long luxurious kiss he thought he could feel her melt bone by bone until her body was limp and he knew her mind was filled with nothing but him it was then he gave his own needs their freedom the red smouldering flame became a bluewhite flash that consumed them both chapter eleven it would have taken days to explore every nook and cranny of the house the more diana saw of it the more she wanted to see shed spent most of her childhood and adolescent years in proper drawing rooms and parlours admiring paintings by reynolds or gainsborough steuben glass and queen anne furniture but nothing had prepared her for the macgregors lifestyle there were twentyfoot ceilings with arched beams and gargoyles carved mahogany doors stone fireplaces with spears crossed over the hearth even an occasional suit of armour she might find an ancient blunderbuss and a favrile compote in the same room it was a hodgepodge an aladdins cave at once barbaric and sophisticated if she chose she could wind her way down a shadowy corridor lit with gaslight and enjoy a huge tiled swimming pool or steaming jacuzzi as charmed as she was with the house diana was equally fascinated by the macgregors themselves whether their environment had grown to fit them or vice versa she couldnt be certain but they were an intriguing mixture of the worldly and primitive overlying it all was daniels fierce innate pride in his heritage his clan and his children and shed been wrong about one thing caine was no different here than he was in boston than hed been in atlantic city he was exactly who he was having no need to put on different faces for different people the security of his childhood the strong binding love of his family had given him that gift she wondered if he knew what a gift it was because she wanted to think diana drifted away alone into what caine had jokingly referred to as the war room here daniel kept his collection of weapons daggers swords pistols ornately carved rifles and to her amazement a small cannon the fire hadnt been lit so the room was chilly sunbeams filtered through the leaded glass windows to fall in crisscross patterns on the thick planked floor dianas heels echoed hollowly as she walked idly from case to case so she thought as she admired an italian dagger with a jewelled handle daniel macgregor was setting her up caine might have warned her shed meant to speak to him about it the night before but theyd had no time alone then when hed come to her room she couldnt wouldnt be pressured by people she hardly knew to make a decision that involved the rest of her life shed never thought of marrying caine even as she realized that wasnt quite true diana passed over it shed never seriously thought of it she amended marriage and children were things shed never permitted herself to consider didnt marriage mean giving up part of yourself to someone else for so long she had fought to keep that inner part private so private she admitted ruefully that there had been times she herself had forgotten just what diana blade was made of and marriage meant risk trusting someone to stay no there was only one person she could completely trust and depend on and that was herself shed realized that years ago when shed known the pain of loss the fear of desertion it wasnt going to happen to her again love no she wouldnt think of love diana told herself as she stared at the empty hearth she wasnt in love with caine she didnt choose to be in love with caine but something began to pull at her threatening to cloud logic with emotions frightened diana forced it away no she wouldnt fall in love she wouldnt consider marriage in any case it was academic it wasnt caine who was pressuring her hed asked her for nothing given no promises demanded none its foolish to worry about it she reminded herself ive let his family get to me that unity that closeness it appeals just as much as it frightens it tempted her to daydream and shed given up fantasies long ago all alone diana she turned smiling as justin walked into the room i cant get enough of this house she told him its like something out of the middle ages with unexpected touches of the twentieth century the macgregors are fascinating people the first time i walked in here i wondered if daniel macgregor was mad or brilliant with one of his quick charming grins he scanned the room i still havent made up my mind you really love him dont you justin lifted a brow at the serious tone of her question yes hes a man who demands strong emotions all of them do he added thoughtfully i dont think i fully realized until serena was kidnapped that id made them my family for ten years i wish youd had that i had other things with a shrug diana walked to a slightly rusted suit of armour i was very selfsufficient was and are justin murmured do you ever think too much she turned back lifting a brow in almost the identical manner of her brother you too justin have you gotten it into your head to match me up with caine his eyes remained calm and very cool it appears the two of you have managed that all on your own thats my business so it is dipping his hands into his pockets he studied her she was annoyed and he suspected a bit frightened i wasnt there for you when you were growing up diana perhaps its too late to play big brother now but i promised to be your friend she went to him quickly pressing her face to his shoulder as she held him im sorry its hard for me im afraid to need you or anyone justin asked tilting her face to his though she remained silent the answer was in her eyes its disconcerting to see so much of yourself in another person he murmured diana are you in love with caine dont ask me that drawing away she held up her hands as if to ward off the question dont ask me that all right he hadnt expected to feel concern or to feel this vague helplessness if i asked would you tell me about the years you lived with adelaide really tell me diana opened her mouth then closed it again no she said after a moment no thats over if it was over youd tell me about it diana he continued when she would have spoken im not going to give you advice or tell you what you should do but id like to tell you something about myself i was in love with serena but i didnt tell her i didnt he continued with a rueful grin tell myself id been in charge of my own life for so long id never loved anyone you our parents that was all too distant telling her was one of the hardest things i ever did there are people love comes gently to theyre not us what about rena diana wondered was it easy for her easier i think he smiled then and sitting on the arm of a chair lit a cigarette shes a great deal like her father more than any of the others shed suffer all sorts of torture before shed admit it but when she came to me in atlantic city shed already made up her mind that wed be together daniels little scheme had worked very well daniels scheme justin blew out a stream of smoke and laughed hed thrown us together very cleverly by buying me a ticket for the cruise liner serena worked on of course he didnt mention to me that she worked there or to her that he had a friend coming on board he counted on chemistry or on fate as he puts it fate diana murmured then gave a bewildered laugh the old devil to put in mildly justin watched her through a mist of smoke he knows how to get what he wants all the macgregors do and he added slowly so do you and i once we acknowledge what it is we want she shot him a look but justin rose and slipped an arm around her shoulders lets go find the clan or daniel will send search parties there was something different about caine diana couldnt quite put her finger on it but she sensed it at first she wondered if perhaps the virginia day case was troubling him he was to go to trial the following week and diana knew that he had been pumping his mother for every scrap of information she had on dr francis day on the surface he seemed relaxed enough laughing with his family teasing his sister but there was something going on beneath an edginess shed never found in him before there were times throughout the day that she caught him looking at her in his old direct dissecting way it was as if he were seeing her for the first time as if they hadnt worked and talked together as if they hadnt been as close as a man and woman could be while she felt herself being drawn into the circle of his family dianas thoughts of caine kept her from being completely relaxed thered been a change and if she was honest she would admit she had sensed it in the way he had made love to her the night before the road had suddenly developed a new surface she would navigate cautiously well now mellow pleased with himself daniel sat back in his thronelike chair with his gifts spread out on the floor around him a mans compensation for adding another year of course it has nothing to do with the basic greed or the love of opening presents serena commented as she crossed her bare feet on the coffee table one of the trials of my life has been disrespectful children daniel told diana with a sigh the curse of parenting she agreed knowing him well enough now to play the game the times ive been shouted at aye even threatened by my own flesh and blood daniel heaved a sigh as he flopped back in his chair im getting pretty close to tears serena said dryly i can overlook that in your condition daniel sent her a stern look but dont think ive forgotten how you yelled at me just because i bought that husband of yours a ticket for that boat yelled at me he repeated turning back to diana and broke half a dozen of my best cigars cigars anna said mildly old ones that were just lying around he said quickly it must have been difficult raising three volatile children diana felt caines fingers squeeze the back of her neck but she kept her expression bland ah i could tell you stories daniel smiled reminiscently and shook his head that one he said pointing a wide finger at caine hardly a moments peace anna will tell you then he continued before anna had a chance to that one was nothing but mischief when he was a lad and then there were the females a regular parade daniel announced proudly a parade diana repeated turning her head she started to smile at caine but found him staring at her with that odd light in his eyes with their gazes locked he cupped her face in his hand were both grown up now he murmured then covered her mouth in a long firm kiss well then daniel began with a wide grin as diana sat silent and flustered you havent tried the piano yet have you diana anna asked calmly what im sorry out of her depth diana turned to see a look of gentle understanding in annas eyes the piano she repeated you play dont you yes i do its so rarely touched these days would you mind playing something diana no of course not relieved she rose to cross the room to the baby grand youre pressuring the children daniel anna said quietly me he shot her an incredulous look nonsense anyone can see that they why dont you let them see for themselves first he subsided in a huff as diana sifted through the sheet music she was grateful for the distraction it was simpler for her to remain outwardly composed when she had something specific to do the notes came easily to her a result of years of structured lessons and an affection for music music had perhaps been the only one of her accomplishments that had pleased diana as much as it had pleased her aunt she used it now as she had often in the past as a curtain for her private thoughts and private emotions what had been in caines mind when he had kissed her diana wasnt accustomed to or completely comfortable with public shows of affection certainly not in the boisterous sense the macgregors were yet even with that she could have accepted a simple kiss was it her imagination or had there been something possessive in the gesture perhaps she was just letting daniels notsosubtle machinations get to her those and justins unexpected questions why should she feel pressured today when she hadnt felt so yesterday last night hadnt it really begun last night lifting her gaze from the keys she met caines eyes he was silent brooding diana mused as her brows drew together it wasnt characteristic of him to brood nor she reminded herself was it characteristic of him to be tense yet he was could something have changed overnight without her being aware of it it might have been better if she hadnt come diana thought as she felt little fingers of tension probe at the back of her neck she shouldnt have allowed herself to be charmed by the eccentricities of this family the closeness the camaraderie it might not have been wise to have seen came in this kind of setting away from boston the office her own established apartment if she wasnt careful she might find herself forgetting her own goals and the rules shed set up to accomplish them success was first it had to be if she were to justify all the years she had danced to someone elses tune and success diana knew was a greedy god who demanded constant vigilance gaining it then maintaining it would require all of her skill and a large chunk of her time when she had chosen law diana had made a pact with herself there would be no personal complications to interfere with her career she had neither the inclination nor the patience for them again her gaze drifted to caine the knots of tension tightened hadnt she told herself from the beginning that if she let him get too close things would drift out of her control shed known yet had somehow convinced herself that she could handle an intimate relationship with him without letting her emotions completely outweigh her logic had it been pride that had caused her to accept the challenge passion it hardly mattered since she had accepted and was now forced to deal with the consequences as the music built her feelings intensified she could feel them pour through her hear the crackling snap from the blaze of the fire and sense somehow the varying emotions in play across the room why had she let herself get so involved she wondered in quick panic she had her life a streamlined path shed just begun to follow there were all those promises to herself to keep though she could remember even when she struggled not to the tenderness caine had brought to her bed in the dark hours of the night diana let the notes drift into silence then gripped her hands together finding they were not quite steady now that was a pleasure daniel gave a windy sigh from his chair is there anything that brings a man more contentment than a beautiful woman and a song caine reluctantly took his eyes from diana and gave his father a long cool stare did you have plans to survive until your next birthday he asked pleasantly now what kind of talk is that daniel blustered but then he hesitated hed planted enough seeds for an evening and he knew the value of strategic retreat well have another bottle of champagne and some more cake he declared caine toss another log or two on the fire before you come along as the family swept from the room serena paused by the piano to squeeze dianas hand hes an old meddler she murmured but he has a good heart when the room was quiet diana rose and watched as caine added fresh wood to the already blazing fire the tension at the back of her head had built to an ache do you want some more cake caine asked with his back still to her no no not really diana linked her hands together and wished they were back in boston would she be more certain of her moves there another drink now this is a ridiculously polite conversation caine thought in disgust as he turned to her yes all right moistening her lips diana searched for some safe topic did you get the information you wanted on the day case from your mother just a corroboration on francis days character caine shrugged as he poured from the decanter to glass it was nothing that i didnt already have but my mother has a way of getting to the heart of the matter without all the fuss he interned under her at boston general still its nothing i can use in litigation as he handed diana her drink caine brushed at her bangs in a habitual gesture when she stepped back he narrowed his eyes but said nothing it always helps to get an objective viewpoint before you go to trial am i on trial diana her eyes came swiftly to his i dont know what you mean youre hedging taking a step closer he circled the back of her neck then lowered his lips to hers he felt the tension beneath his fingers felt her initial resistance to the kiss as he drew back caine lifted an ironic brow yes it seems i am but i cant make my plea until im sure of the charges dont be ridiculous quickly annoyed diana lifted her drink and swallowed dont be evasive caine countered i thought wed gotten past that point in our relationship stop pushing me caine he took a long hard look at the drink in his hand but didnt taste it in what way i dont know every way she dragged a hand through her hair as she walked away lets just drop it i dont want to fight with you is that what were doing with a nod he drank then set down his glass well if it is lets do it right you get the first shot i dont want the first shot abruptly furious she whirled back to him im not going to stand in your parents drawing room and snipe at you but you would if we were somewhere else yes i dont know caine leave me alone the hell i will and the very calmness of his tone warned her of his mood lets hear it diana i want to know why youre pulling away from me im not pulling away youre imagining things she took a quick nervous sip of her drink and turned away again when his hand touched her shoulder she jerked then cursed herself not pulling away caine murmured trying to ignore the slash of hurt whats your term for it look its late im tired diana fumbled for the excuse knowing it was a weak one caine with a frustrated sigh she moved away from him again please dont pressure me now is that what you think im doing diana pressuring you yes damn it you your family justin all in your own separate ways setting down her glass she leaned her palms against a table she was overreacting but for once couldnt summon the logic to clear her mind caine cant we just leave this alone no i dont think so he would have gone to her but somehow the distance she had put between them stopped him he felt awkward and close to furious with her for making him so and he hurt that was something he would think about later its not my intention to pressure you diana he said in a low precise voice that had her digging her teeth into her lower lip but there are things that i think should be said now why she demanded as she spun back around why this sudden urgency there werent any complications when we were in boston what kind of complications are there now dont crossexamine me caine you have an objection to that question oh you make me furious when you act like this seething she dug her hands into the pockets of her skirt and whirled around the room ive felt like ive been under a microscope off and on since i walked through the front door you might have told me i was top of your fathers list as the proper mate for his second son my father has absolutely nothing to do with you and me diana id apologize for his lack of subtlety but i dont feel responsible for it i dont want your apology she fumed but it would have been more comfortable if id been prepared damn it i like him and the rest of your family its impossible not to but i dont like the quiet looks of speculation and the unasked questions what would you like me to do about it i dont know nothing she said as she moved to stand in front of the roaring fire but i dont have to like it did it ever occur to you that i might not particularly care for it myself simmering with anger caine swirled his drink and stared at her back did it ever occur to you that i might not care for the interference in my life no matter how well intentioned theyre your family she tossed back over her shoulder youre bound to be more accustomed to it than i i spent twenty years trying to live up to my aunts plans for me i didnt get this far to follow someone elses the hell with your aunt caine exploded and with everyone else that isnt you and me what do you want diana why dont you just spell it out i dont know what i want she shouted shocking herself with the admission i knew yesterday and now damn it caine i cant deal with this i cant deal with having my private life poked into not by your father my brother anyone its my life and ill make my own decisions you cant deal with it he murmured then gave a short laugh before he drained his glass then deal with this im in love with you diana stared at him in utter shock in utter silence she wondered if her heart had simply stopped and she didnt move a muscle as a log snapped loudly and sparks sprayed against the screen at her back they watched each other both pale their eyes dark with what seemed more like anger than any other emotion how had it come to this she wondered and what in gods name would they do about it well you dont seem thrilled about it furious with himself for having made the statement so baldly caine reached for the decanter with studied calm he poured a brandy how could he have known that silence could bring this kind of pain as he listened to the brandy splash against the glass he wondered why he had waited more than thirty years to say those words to a woman to find only emptiness would you like the statement stricken from the record counsellor dont diana squeezed her eyes shut for a moment i dont know what to say to you or how to handle this its easier for you thereve been other women other women he exploded he wasnt pale anymore but his eyes were even darker more furious than shed ever seen them instinctively diana stepped back as he walked toward her how can you say that to me now what do i have to do to make up for a past that happened before i even met you and why the hell should i he gripped her by the shoulders fingers digging into flesh damn it diana i said i love you i love you his mouth came down on hers in anger and frustration as if by that alone he could wipe out the hurt she brought him the doubts he brought her something built inside her threatening to burst diana dragged herself away with a cry of alarm you frighten me her eyes swam with sudden tears as they faced each other again their breathing unsteady i said that you didnt but it was always a lie from the very beginning she choked back a sob and pushed her hair away from her face with both hands youre what ive always avoided i cant risk it dont you understand all of my life someones played carrot and stick with me do this fit into this mould and youll have security youll have normalcy ive just found my own mould i wont fit someone elses expectations now im not asking you to fit anything he tossed back ive never asked you to be anyone but yourself perhaps it was the truth of that which frightened her more than anything else she dragged a hand through her hair as the last lingering fear broke through how do i know youll stay how do i know if i let myself love you that one day there wouldnt be someone else something else and youd just walk away i can handle being alone now i know how but i cant i wont be left again caine struggled against fury against the sense of his own impotence ive asked you more than once to trust me its not me that frightens you diana its ghosts and your own selfdoubt she swallowed winning the battle of tears you dont understand youve never lost everything so you intend to go through your life never taking a chance because you might lose his eyes hardened as they swept her face i never took you for a coward i choose the chances i take she countered furiously i choose i wont put myself in a position to be hurt i wont take chances on my career why do you automatically assume ill hurt you and what in gods name does your career have to do with my loving you i have the same profession the same demands whos asking you to make a choice between love and the law did you have to chop down a tree caine were halfway through the cake and champagne and serena trailed off as she reached the centre of the room the waves of tension and hurt poured over her so that she stared in awkward silence from caine to diana im sorry she said knowing of no gracious way to cover up the intrusion ill tell everyone youre busy no please diana met the banked fury in caines eyes before turning to his sister just tell them im a bit tired im going to go up now quickly without looking back she walked from the room caine watched her in silence then turned to retrieve his snifter of brandy from the sideboard oh caine im so sorry it seems i couldnt have picked a worse time to barge in it doesnt matter he drained the remaining liquor then poured more wed said all we had to say caine serena went to him distressed by the controlled voice and stony expression do you need a sympathetic ear or solitude i need a drink he answered taking both the snifter and decanter to a chair i need quite a few of them youre in love with diana right the first time he said and toasted her ignoring the sarcasm serena sat beside him and youd like to murder her right again its easy to be right when youve been through it i dont know what went on in here tonight but i told her in the midst of a nasty little argument that i was in love with her he brought the snifter to his lips again and swallowed deeply it seems my timing and my delivery were a bit off im going to do something i despise serena said with a sigh which is give advice thats my territory rena save it shut up firmly she took the snifter from his hand and set it down give her some room and some time youre not an easy man to love in the best of circumstances i should know i appreciate the testimonial caine a lot of things have changed in dianas life very quickly shes the kind of woman who needs to make her decisions a step at a time at least she thinks she is he gave a quiet laugh as he leaned back in the chair you were always an excellent judge of character rena youd have made a hell of a lawyer it comes in handy in my line of work too reaching out she took his hand dont press her caine there are storms inside diana let her battle them out i might have pressed her too far already on a long breath he shut his eyes oh god i hurt serena wanted to comfort and forced herself not to love has to hurt its rule number one go to bed she ordered briskly youll have a better idea what to do in the morning caine opened his eyes again its a hell of a thing that i should be sitting here taking advice from the kid sister who sharpened her left jab on me im a comfortable matron now serena said majestically as she patted her stomach hah caine retorted in an accurate imitation of their father go to bed serena advised before i take it into my head to see if that jabs still effective rising she tugged him to his feet you always were a bossy little busybody caine told her as they walked toward the doorway im still crazy about you yeah serena grinned up at him me too chapter twelve diana sat in the empty courtroom numb and nauseated the hands she folded together on her briefcase were ice cold and nerveless she knew she had to pull herself together go out and get in her car drive home somehow she knew if she stood up at that moment her legs would buckle she sat as still as a stone and waited for the feeling to pass logic told her she was being a fool she should feel wonderful she should celebrate shed won chad rutledge was free exonerated beth howards father would face perjury charges and so would beth diana added silently as she stared at the empty witness chair it was unlikely the girl would be convicted not when a dozen witnesses had seen so clearly that it had been fear that had caused her to lie about the rape not when a dozen witnesses had watched how pitifully she had fallen apart under examination not diana thought as a small pain rippled through her when a dozen witnesses had watched diana blade attorney at law rip her to shreds diana could hear the echo of her own voice in the now silent courtroom cold accusing merciless she could see the pale fragile face of beth howard as it crumbled and the tears the near hysterical confession she could hear chads loud furious demands that beth be left alone then there had been chaos in the courtroom as chad had been restrained and beth had wept out the entire story when the courtroom had been cleared diana had remained to deal with her victory and the cost of it in human terms she had never felt more alone or more lost than at that moment she wanted to weep but sat dryeyed she was a professional and tears had no place caine oh god she needed caine diana closed her eyes as the numbness faded into pain she had no right to need him or to use him as a lifeline when she felt she was sinking though two weeks had passed she could still see the look in his eyes as they had faced each other in his parents drawing room hurt she had hurt him and now they treated each other like strangers each time diana tried to tell herself it was for the best she remembered that look in his eyes and the flood of feeling that had risen in her only to be forced back in panic love she couldnt afford to love him couldnt afford the risk it would be best if she found another office perhaps left boston altogether running away a small voice asked her with a sigh diana stared down at her hands yes thats what she had in mind if she ran fast enough she might be able to escape caine but she wasnt going to be able to escape herself and if she were honest she would admit it was herself she was running from when had she started to love him perhaps it had been when he had shown her such gentleness and understanding after her first meeting with justin or perhaps it had been on that snowy beach when hed made her laugh then made her ache with need shed known it was happening but had pretended otherwise every time her emotions had begun to take over she had closed them off afraid she looked around the empty courtroom again then slowly rose to her feet it was twilight when she stepped outside in the west the sky was clumped with clouds that glowed with bronzes and pinks the lengthening of days was the only sign of spring as the wind was as sharp as a knife and the dark leafless trees shimmered under a thin coat of ice diana saw chad hunched in his coat sitting near the bottom of the courtroom steps she hesitated not certain she was strong enough for a confrontation then squaring her shoulders she walked down the remaining steps chad he looked up staring into her face for a long five seconds before he rose ive been waiting for you i can see that with a nonchalance she wasnt feeling diana sipped up the collar of her coat against the wind you should have waited inside i needed the air he kept his hands in his pockets his shoulders rounded against the cold as he watched her they wouldnt let me see beth im sorry carefully she kept all emotion and all weariness out of her voice i hurt too she thought in despair for you for myself must i always have the answers ill arrange for you to see her tomorrow you dont look so good diana gave him a thin smile thanks as she turned he caught at her arm ms blade awkwardly chad dropped his hand and stuffed it back in his pocket i gave you a hard time in there i guess ive given you a hard time all along it comes with the territory chad dont worry about it watching beth he swore softly then turned away to stare at the traffic i couldnt stand watching her cry in there i hated you for making her cry like that when i came out here to wait i had a lot of things i was going to say to you diana gripped her briefcase tighter and braced herself go ahead say them now he gave a shaky laugh and turned back to her i had some time to think i guess i dont do enough of that he took out a cigarette cupping his hands around the match as he lit it diana saw that his hands were steady ive got something different to say to you now ms blade chad blew out smoke on a long breath before he met her eyes you saved my life and i think maybe you saved beths too i want to thank you unable to speak diana stared at the hand he held out to her after a moment she accepted it then found hers clasped hard all i could think about in there was that you were hurting her i couldnt see past that sitting out here i started thinking about that cell and what it would be like to be in one for the next twenty years you dont know how good it is to sit outside and know nobodys going to come along and lock you back in a cage when his voice trembled chad swallowed but kept his hand tight on hers id have done that for her and i guess after a while id have hated her and she shed have lived with that lie crawling around inside of her beth wouldnt have made it i know that itll be over for her soon diana lifted her free hand to cover their joined ones objective she thought only a robot could be cool and objective when someone looked at them like this he needed to give his gratitude but he was also asking for comfort no courts going to punish beth for being terrified if they if she has to go to court will you help her yes if she wants me to and youll be there for her yeah im going to marry her right away the hell with money well figure something out his hand relaxed as he smiled for the first time i was always thinking i had to prove something you know to beth to myself to the whole damn world funny it doesnt seem so important anymore to prove that i can make it all by myself diana gave him an odd look and shook her head no she said slowly i suppose only fools think that way it wont be so easy with beth finishing school he grinned now as though the challenge appealed to him but well be together and thats what counts yes chad she dropped her hand to her side is it worth it the risk the pain he tilted back his head and drew in the cold evening air its worth anything everything with a wide brilliant smile he looked back at her youll come to the wedding ms blade yes she smiled back at him then gently kissed his cheek yes ill come to your wedding chad now go home youll see your girl tomorrow diana walked to her car realizing the sickness had left her stomach the dull threat of a headache at her temple had vanished they were so young she thought as she joined the long stream of traffic with a dozen strikes against them yet that look of shining hope in chads eyes made her believe theyd face the odds together and if there was any justice theyd make it and what about you diana asked herself are you determined to be a fool or are you going to face the odds just how much blade blood gamblers blood was there in her perhaps like chad she had been fluting with spending her life in a cell there was a certain safety there to compensate for the lack of freedom words began to flit through her head justins voice telling her that love came gently to some people but not to them caine furiously telling her he loved her demanding that she trust him she could hear her own voice edged with nerves telling him she wouldnt risk being left alone what was she now diana asked herself if not alone alone and aching with love and needs but letting those old fears the ghosts caine had called them rule her life in doing so she was breaking the most important promise she had ever made to herself to be diana blade shed intended to go home but now found herself pulling up in the drive beside the office instinct she wondered seeing that caines car was parked there her nerves began to jump again what would she say to him it might be best to go home wait until she could think clearly and plan even as this went through her mind diana stepped from the car she could see the light in the window of his office hes been working too hard she thought the day case the trial should be nearly over by now diana knew more of its progress from the press reports man from caine had they spoken a dozen words to each other in the last two weeks she wondered what would she say to him now the first floor was dark and silent she could hear the quiet creak of the door as she shut it behind her glancing up the stairs she slipped out of her coat her timing was probably very poor she thought and caught her bottom lip between her teeth as she again considered going home she walked up the stairs caines office door was open diana could hear the whispers from the fire as she moved toward it hesitating at the doorway she studied caine while he sat behind his desk his head was bent over a stack of papers his jacket and tie had been tossed in a heap over the back of the chair so that he wore the black vest unbuttoned and his shut open at the throat in the ashtray a cigarette he hadnt quite put out smouldered as she watched he dragged a hand through his hair then reached up without looking up for his coffee cup she studied him as she hadnt permitted herself to do since that night in hyannis port god he looks tired she thought with a jolt as if he hasnt slept properly in days could the case be going so badly suddenly he swore softly under his bream and ran his hand over his face swamped with concern diana stepped forward caine his head jerked up for an instant he stared at her with eyes that were dark and unguarded she felt his need as a tangible thing then just as quickly it was gone diana he turned coolly i didnt expect you back tonight maybe she had been mistaken it might only have been surprise she had seen in his eyes her own emotions she had felt she searched her mind for all the things she wanted to say chad rutledge was acquitted was all that came out congratulations he leaned back and studied her with apparent dispassion was she more beautiful than shed been yesterday he wondered as the ache crept into him was he going to go mad seeing her day after day loving her and not being loved in return it was ugly she said after a moment im not particularly proud of the way i treated beth howard on the stand caine balled his hand into a fist then flexed it her vulnerability would always tear at him do you want a drink no i yes she decided yes ill get it moving to a cabinet across the room diana found a decanter and poured without having any idea what the liquor was this wasnt happening the way it should she told herself all the words she wanted to say to him stuck in her throat selfdoubts hadnt he told her she was plagued with them as usual hed been accurate now she simply didnt know if she could find the right phrasing the right tone to tell him she wanted to do what hed asked of her almost from the beginning to trust moistening her lips she tried to break some of the tension hovering in the air is the day case giving you problems no not really its nearly over he sipped at his coffee and found it cold and bitter it suited his mood the prosecution didnt have as tight a case as id imagined i put ginnie on the stand today she was hard as nails unsympathetic and perfectly believable he couldnt shake her testimony an inch in crossexamination then youre feeling confident about the verdict virginia day will be acquitted he said flatly but she wont get justice at dianas puzzled look he pushed his coffee aside and rose legally shell be free but the public will look at her as a spoiled rich woman who murdered her husband and got away with it i can keep her out of jail but i cant vindicate her a lawyer i admire once told me a defence counsel has to keep his objectivity caine shot her a look then shrugged what the hell did he know diana set down her glass and walked to him why dont you let me buy you a drink and some dinner he needed to touch her caine could feel his fingertips tingle with the need to stroke the softness of her skin rejection the thought of facing it again had him slipping on his armour no he moved back behind his desk ive got a lot to catch up on tonight all right ill see whats in the refrigerator downstairs no the single sharp word stopped her the pain registered pushing her back a step turning she stared at the fire until she was certain her voice wouldnt tremble youd like me to go away wouldnt you i told you im busy i could wait unable to keep her hands still she toyed with the handle of the brass fireplace poker we could have a late supper at my apartment he stared at her the slim straight figure in jadegreen wool she was offering him the opportunity to go back to the way things had been the way it had always been for him with women before fun games no complications nothing had ever seemed so empty with a sigh caine looked down at his hands how many times in the last two weeks had he thought about her about the way things had been between them hed considered begging it wasnt a matter of pride once in the early hours of the morning hed considered going to her apartment and using force for lack of anything better every possible angle from reason to abduction had gone through his mind and every one had been discarded hed had to remind himself that love couldnt be forced or coaxed or pleaded out of a woman like diana he wanted her needed to lose himself in that mindless passion they could bring each other he could almost taste her from where he stood that not quite sweet not quite sharp flavour of her mouth when it heated it would have been simple once but it would never be simple again i appreciate the offer he said curtly im not interested she shut her eyes at that surprised again at how much pain words could bring i hurt you badly she murmured i dont know if theres any way to make up for it he gave a quick hard laugh i can do without the sympathy diana distressed by his tone she turned around caine thats not what drop it caine please damn it diana let it alone struggling for control he lifted his coffee again she saw his knuckles go white on the handle go home he ordered ive got work to do i have things i want to say to you doesnt it occur to you that i dont want to hear them i stripped my soul for you he tossed out before he could stop himself made a fool of myself ive already heard your reasons why you cant give me what i want i dont need to hear it all over again i dont think i can take it stop making this impossible for me she shouted at him i dont give a damn about you at the moment enraged he grabbed her arm and yanked her against him before he could stop himself his mouth was on hers savagely brutally the hell with love he told himself if this was all she wanted from him then it was all he would give he let the needs and frustration take him oblivious to her response or protest until she was limp and trembling on a wave of selfdisgust he shoved her away love he realized helplessly could not be ignored get out of here diana leave me alone shaken she gripped the back of a chair no not until ive finished all right you stay ill go but she was at the door ahead of him slamming it shut and leaning back against it sit down shut up and listen to me for a moment she thought hed simply yank her aside throttle her for good measure there was murder in his eyes as he glared down at her then he hooked his thumbs in his front pockets okay say your piece sit down she repeated dont press your luck her chin jerked up at the soft threat all right well stand im not going to apologize for the things i said two weeks ago i meant them my career is important to me vital because its something ive done for myself and trusting someone trusting them with my emotions is the most difficult thing in the world for me no one can make me do it its my own choice fine now get out of the way im not finished she swallowed then heard herself say i think its time we were partners partners the fury in his eyes was replaced by blank astonishment good god youre standing there now after everything ive said to you giving me a business proposition this has nothing to do with business she shot back i want you to marry me she watched as caines eyes narrowed sharpened until she could read nothing in them at all what did you say im asking you to marry me diana kept her eyes level and wondered why her legs didnt buckle brows drawn together he stood where he was youre proposing to me he asked carefully she felt the colour warm her cheeks but wasnt certain if it was embarrassment or annoyance yes i thought it was perfectly clear he laughed quietly at first then with more feeling running his hands over his face caine turned and walked to the window diana watched his reaction with a mixture of anger and anxiety ill be damned he murmured i dont think its funny diana crossed her arms over her chest and felt like an idiot i dont know caine continued to stare out the window as he tried to sort out his thoughts after all the pain of the last two weeks she suddenly appears on his doorstep and asks him to marry her somehow it appeals to my humour ill just leave you alone to enjoy your little joke then she fumbled with the knob but even as she jerked the door open caine was there slamming it shut again diana get away she demanded as she attempted to shove him aside wait a minute taking her shoulders he pressed her back against the door are we always going to be at cross purposes he wondered his eyes werent laughing at her but were deadly serious and a bit wary id like to know why you asked me to marry you diana glared at him a moment then swallowed her pride because i knew after the things i had said to you that you wouldnt ask me i wasnt sure youd forgive me he shook his head and his fingers tightened demandingly on her shoulders dont be ridiculous its not a matter of forgiveness caine she wanted to touch him but kept her hands at her sides not certain she could accept that kind of unquestioning clemency i hurt you yes by god you did im sorry she whispered but it wasnt pity he saw in her eyes the first wave of relief washed over him you havent answered my question diana he kept his hands firm on her shoulders his eyes direct on hers why do you want me to marry you i suppose i need a promise she began feeling the flutter of fear again i think when people just live together its too easy to walk away and no he shook his head again thats not what i want and you know it why diana say it she swallowed as the slivers of fear grew to panic i faltering she closed her eyes say it he demanded again her lashes fluttered up so that she met his eyes levelly once the words were said she knew thered be no backing away for her they would be complete commitment he knew it as well she realized and needed it why had she been so foolish as to think she was the only one with fears i love you she whispered then let out a long shuddering breath with it went the fear oh god caine i love you she fell into his arms clinging and felt the release bubble up in laughter i love you she said again how many times would you like to hear it ill let you know in a minute he murmured as his lips found hers with a groan of pleasure of relief of joy he drew her closer again he demanded against her mouth tell me again she laughed and tugged him down until they lay on the rug i love you if id known how good it would feel to say it i would have told you before caine framing his face with her hands diana looked down at him with her eyes suddenly serious being with you belonging to you is worth everything ive known i have known but it seemed safer to pretend i could live without you taking her hand he pressed his lips to the palm i still cant give you guarantees diana i can only love you i dont want guarantees she drew him down so that her cheek rested against his not anymore im going to gamble on you macgregor slowly she ran her hands up his back and im going to win caine slipped the jacket of her suit off her shoulders as his lips toyed with hers its a night of firsts he decided my first proposal he began loosening the buttons of her blouse the first time i manage to drag those three little words out of you his lips followed the trail of his fingers and the first time i make love with you in my office diana sighed as she stripped his shirt from him theres a minor point of order counsellor hmm you havent answered my proposal yet arent you supposed to give me time to think it over he caught the lobe of her ear between his teeth no in that case i accept he lifted his head as a gleam of amusement lit his eyes do we intend to add to the macgregor line with her lids halfclosed she gave him a lazy smile absolutely i come from very good stock laughing he pressed his lips against her throat diana youve made my father a very happy man
