chapter one juniper all men are born condemned so the wise say all suckle the breast of death all bow before that silent monarch that lord in shadow lifts a finger a feather flutters to the earth there is no reason in his song the good go young the wicked prosper he is king of the chaos lords his breath stills all souls we found a city dedicated to his worship long ago but so old now it has lost that dedication the dark majesty of his godhead has frayed been forgotten by all but those who stand in his shadow but juniper faced a more immediate fear a specter from yesteryear leaking into the present upon a height overlooking the city and because of that the black company went there to that strange city far beyond the bounds of the ladys empire but this is not the beginning in the beginning we were far away only two old friends and a handful of men we would meet later stood nosetonose with the shadow chapter two tally roadside the childrens heads popped from the weeds like groundhog heads they watched the approaching soldiers the boy whispered must be a thousand of them the column stretched back and back the dust it raised drifted up the face of a far hill the creak and jangle of harness grew ever louder the day was hot the children were sweating their thoughts lingered on a nearby brook and a dip in a pool they had found there but they had been set to watch the road rumor said the lady meant to break the renascent rebel movement in tally province and here her soldiers came closer now grim hardlooking men veterans easily old enough to have helped create the disaster which had befallen the rebel six years ago claiming among a quarter million men their father its them the boy gasped fear and awe filled his voice grudging admiration edged it thats the black company the girl was no student of the enemy how do you know the boy indicated a bear of a man on a big roan he had silvery hair his bearing said he was accustomed to command thats the one they call the captain the little black one beside him would be the wizard called oneeye see his hat thats how you tell the ones behind them must be elmo and the lieutenant are any of the taken with them the girl rose higher for a better look where are the other famous ones she was the younger the boy at ten already considered himself a soldier of the white rose he yanked his sister down stupid want them to see you so what if they do the boy sneered she had believed their uncle neat when he had said that the enemy would not harm children the boy hated his uncle the man had no guts nobody pledged to the white rose had any guts they just played at fighting the lady the most daring thing they did was ambush the occasional courier at least the enemy had courage they had seen what they had been sent to see he touched the girls wrist lets go they scurried through the weeds toward the wooded creek bank a shadow lay upon their path they looked up and went pale three horsemen stared down at them the boy gaped nobody could have slipped up unheard goblin the small frogfaced man in the middle grinned at your service laddyboy the boy was terrified but his mind remained functional he shouted run if one of them could escape goblin made a circular gesture pale pink fire tangled his fingers he made a throwing motion the boy fell fighting invisible bonds like a fly caught in a spiders web his sister whimpered a dozen feet away pick them up goblin told his companions they should tell an interesting tale chapter three juniper the iron lily the lily stands on floral lane in the heart of the buskin junipers worst slum where the taste of death floats on every tongue and men value life less than they do an hour of warmth or a decent meal its front sags against its neighbor to the right clinging for support like one of its own drunken patrons its rear cants in the opposite direction its bare wood siding sports leprous patches of grey rot its windows are boarded with scraps and chinked with rags its roof boasts gaps through which the wind howls and bites when it blows off the wolander mountains there even on a summers day the glaciers twinkle like distant veins of silver sea winds are little better they bring a chill damp which gnaws the bones and sends ice floes scampering across the harbor the shaggy arms of the wolanders reach seaward flanking the river port forming cupped hands which hold the city and harbor the city straddles the river creeping up the heights on both sides wealth rises in juniper scrambling up and away from the river the people of the buskin when they lift their eyes from their misery see the homes of the wealthy above noses in the air watching one another across the valley higher still crowning the ridges are two castles on the southern height stands duretile hereditary bastion of the dukes of juniper duretile is in scandalous disrepair most every structure in juniper is below duretile lies the devotional heart of juniper the enclosure beneath which lie the catacombs there half a hundred generations rest awaiting the day of passage guarded by the custodians of the dead on the north ridge stands an incomplete fortress called simply the black castle its architecture is alien grotesque monsters leer from its battlements serpents writhe in frozen agonies upon its walls there are no joints in the obsidianlike material and the place is growing the people of juniper ignore the castles existence its growth they do not want to know what is happening up there seldom do they have time to pause in their struggle for survival to lift their eyes that high chapter four tally ambush i drew a seven spread discarded a trey and stared at a lone ace to my left pawnbroker muttered that did it hes down to a rock i eyed him curiously what makes you say that he drew cursed discarded you get a face like a corpse when youve got it cold croaker even your eyes candy drew cursed discarded a five hes right croaker you get so unreadable youre readable come on otto otto stared at his hand then at the pile as though he could conjure victory from the jaws of defeat he drew shit he discarded his draw a royal card i showed them my ace and raked in my winnings candy stared over my shoulder while otto gathered the cards his eyes were hard and cold what i asked our host is working up his courage looking for a way to get out and warn them i turned so did the others one by one the tavernkeeper and his customers dropped their gazes and shrank into themselves all but the tall dark man seated alone in shadows near the fireplace he winked and lifted a mug as if in salute i scowled his response was a smile otto dealt one hundred ninetythree i said candy frowned damn you croaker he said without emotion i had been counting hands they were perfect ticks of the clocks of our lives as brothers of the black company i had played over ten thousand hands since the battle at charm only the gods themselves know how many i played before i started keeping track think they got wind of us pawnbroker asked he was edgy waiting does that i dont see how candy arrayed his hand with exaggerated care a dead giveaway he had something hot i reexamined mine twentyone probably get burned but the best way to stop him i went down twentyone otto sputtered you sonofabitch he laid down a hand strong for going low but it added to twentytwo because of one royal card candy had three nines an ace and a trey grinning i raked it in again you win this one were going to check your sleeves pawnbroker grumbled i collected the cards and started shuffling the back door hinges squealed everyone froze stared at the kitchen door men stirred beyond it madle where the hell are you the tavernkeeper looked at candy agonized candy cued him the taverner called out here neat candy whispered keep playing i started dealing a man of forty came from the kitchen several others followed all wore dappled green they had bows across their backs neat said they mustve got the kids i dont know how but he saw something in madles eyes whats the matter we had madle sufficiently intimidated he did not give us away staring at my cards i drew my spring tube my companions did likewise pawnbroker discarded the card he had drawn a deuce he usually tries to go low his play betrayed his nervousness candy snagged the discard and spread an acedeucetrey run he discarded an eight one of neats companions whined i told you we shouldnt send kids it sounded like breathing life into an old argument i dont need any itoldyouso neat growled madle i spread the word for a meeting well have to scatter the outfit we dont know nothing for sure neat another green man said you know kids youre fooling yourself the ladys hounds are on our trail the whiner said i told you we shouldnt hit those he fell silent realizing a moment too late that strangers were present that the regulars all looked ghastly neat went for his sword there were nine of them if you counted madle and some customers who got involved candy overturned the card table we tripped the catches on our spring tubes four poisoned darts snapped across the common room we drew swords it lasted only seconds everybody all right candy asked got a scratch otto said i checked it nothing to worry about back behind the bar friend candy told madle whom he had spared the rest of you get this place straightened up pawnbroker watch them they even think about getting out of line kill them what do i do with the bodies throw them down the well i righted the table again sat down unfolded a sheet of paper sketched upon it was the chain of command of the insurgents in tally i blacked out neat it stood at midlevel madle i said come here the barkeep approached with the eagerness of a dog to a whipping take it easy youll get through this all right if you cooperate tell me who those men were he hemmed and hawed predictably just names i said he looked at the paper frowning he could not read madle be a tight place to swim down a well with a bunch of bodies he gulped surveyed the room i glanced at the man near the fireplace he hadnt moved during the encounter even now he watched with apparent indifference madle named names some were on my list and some were not those that were not i assumed to be spear carriers tally had been well and reliably scouted the last corpse went out i gave madle a small gold piece he goggled his customers regarded him with unfriendly eyes i grinned for services rendered madle blanched stared at the coin it was a kiss of death his patrons would think he had helped set the ambush gotcha i whispered want to get out of this alive he looked at me in fear and hatred who the hell are you guys he demanded in a harsh whisper the black company madle the black company i dont know how he managed but he went even whiter chapter five juniper marron shed the day was cold and grey and damp still misty and sullen conversation in the iron lily consisted of surly monosyllables uttered before a puny fire then the drizzle came drawing the curtains of the world in tight brown and grey shapes hunched dispiritedly along the grubby muddy street it was a day ripped fullgrown from the womb of despair inside the lily marron shed looked up from his mugwiping keeping the dust off he called it nobody was using his shoddy stoneware because nobody was buying his cheap sour wine nobody could afford it the lily stood on the south side of floral lane sheds counter faced the doorway twenty feet deep into the shadows of the common room a herd of tiny tables each with its brood of rickety stools presented a perilous maze for the customer coming out of sunlight a halfdozen roughly cut support pillars formed additional obstacles the ceiling beams were too low for a tall man the boards of the floor were cracked and warped and creaky and anything spilled ran downhill the walls were decorated with oldtime odds and ends and curios left by customers which had no meaning for anyone entering today marron shed was too lazy to dust them or take them down the common room led around the end of his counter past the fireplace near which the best tables stood beyond the fireplace in the deepest shadows a yard from the kitchen door lay the base of the stair to the rooming floors into that darksome labyrinth came a small weasely man he carried a bundle of wood scraps shed can i hell why not asa well all benefit the fire had dwindled to a bank of grey ash asa scuttled to the fireplace the group there parted surlily asa settled beside sheds mother old june was blind she could not tell who he was he placed his bundle before him and started stirring the coals nothing down to the docks today shed asked asa shook his head nothing came in nothing going out they only had five jobs unloading wagons people were fighting over them shed nodded asa was no fighter asa was not fond of honest labor either darling one draft for asa shed gestured as he spoke his serving girl picked up the battered mug and took it to the fire shed did not like the little man he was a sneak a thief a liar a mooch the sort who would sell his sister for a couple of copper gersh he was a whiner and complainer and coward but he had become a project for shed who could have used a little charity himself asa was one of the homeless shed let sleep on the common room floor whenever they brought wood for the fire letting the homeless have the floor did not put money into the coin box but it did assure some warmth for junes arthritic bones finding free wood in juniper in winter was harder than finding work shed was amused by asas determination to avoid honest employment the fires crackle killed the stillness shed put his grimy rag aside he stood behind his mother hands to the heat his fingernails began aching he hadnt realized how cold he was it was going to be a long cold winter asa do you have a regular wood source shed could not afford fuel nowadays firewood was barged down the port from far upstream it was expensive in his youth no asa stared into the flames piney smells spread through the lily shed worried about his chimney another pine scrap winter and he hadnt had the chimney swept a chimney fire could destroy him things had to turn around soon he was over the edge in debt to his ears he was desperate shed he looked to his tables to his only real paying customer raven refill if you please shed looked for darling she had disappeared he cursed softly no point yelling the girl was deaf needed signs to communicate an asset he had thought when raven had suggested he hire her countless secrets were whispered in the lily he had thought more whisperers might come if they could speak without fear of being overheard shed bobbed his head captured ravens mug he disliked raven partially because raven was successful at asas game raven had no visible means of support yet always had money another reason was because raven was younger tougher and healthier than the run of the lilys customers he was an anomaly the lily was on the downhill end of the buskin close to the waterfront it drew all the drunkards the wornout whores the dopers the derelicts and human flotsam who eddied into that last backwater before the darkness overhauled them shed sometimes agonized fearing his precious lily was but a final way station raven did not belong he could afford better shed wished he dared throw the man out raven made his skin crawl sitting at his corner table dead eyes hammering iron spikes of suspicion into anyone who entered the tavern cleaning his nails endlessly with a knife honed razorsharp speaking a few cold toneless words whenever anyone took a notion to drag darling upstairs that baffled shed though there was no obvious connection raven protected the girl as though she were his virgin daughter what the hell was a tavern slut for anyway shed shuddered pushed it out of mind he needed raven needed every paying guest he could get he was surviving on prayers he delivered the wine raven dropped three coins into his palm one was a silver leva sir get some decent firewood in here shed if i wanted to freeze id stay outside yes sir shed went to the door peeked into the street lathams wood yard was just a block away the drizzle had become an icy rain the mucky lane was crusting going to snow before dark he informed no one in particular in or out raven growled dont waste what warmth there is shed slid outside he hoped he could reach lathams before the cold began to ache shapes loomed out of the icefall one was a giant both hunched forward rags around their necks to prevent ice from sliding down their backs shed charged back into the lily ill go out the back way he signed darling im going out you havent seen me since this morning krage the girl signed krage shed admitted he dashed into the kitchen snagged his ragged coat off its hook wriggled into it he fumbled the door latch twice before he got it loose an evil grin with three teeth absent greeted him as he leaned into the cold foul breath assaulted his nostrils a filthy finger gouged his chest going somewhere shed hi red just going to see latham about firewood no youre not the finger pushed shed fell back till he was in the common room sweating he asked cup of wine thats neighborly of you shed make it three three sheds voice squeaked dont tell me you didnt know krage is on his way i didnt shed lied reds snaggletoothed smirk said he knew shed was lying chapter six tally mixup you try your damnedest but something always goes wrong thats life if youre smart you plan for it somehow somebody got away from madles along about the twentyfifth rebel who stumbled into our web when it really looked like neat had done us a big favor summoning the local hierarchy to a conference looking backward it is hard to fix blame we all did our jobs but there are limits to how alert you stay under extended stress the man who disappeared probably spent hours plotting his break we did not notice his absence for a long time candy figured it out he threw his cards in at the tail of a hand said were minus a body troops one of those pig farmers the little guy who looked like a pig i could see the table from the corner of my eye i grunted youre right damn should have taken a head count after each trip to the well the table was behind pawnbroker he did not turn around he waited a hand then ambled to madles counter and bought a crock of beer while his rambling distracted the locals i made rapid signs with my fingers in deafspeech better be ready for a raid they know who we are i shot my mouth off the rebel would want us bad the black company has earned a widespread reputation as a successful eradicator of the rebel pestilence wherever it appears though we are not as vicious as reputed news of our coming strikes terror wherever we go the rebel often goes to ground abandoning his operations where we appear yet here were four of us separated from our companions evidently unaware that we were at risk they would try the question at hand was how hard we did have cards up our sleeves we never play fair if we can avoid it the company philosophy is to maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk the tall dark man rose left his shadow stalked toward the stair to the sleeping rooms candy snapped watch him otto otto hurried after him looking feeble in the mans wake the locals watched wondering pawnbroker used signs to ask what now we wait candy said aloud and with signs added do what we were sent to do not much fun being live bait pawnbroker signed back he studied the stair nervously set otto up with a hand he suggested i looked at candy he nodded why not give him about seventeen otto would go down first time around every time if he had less than twenty it was a good percentage bet i quick figured the cards in my head and grinned i could give him seventeen and have enough low cards left to give each of us a hand that would burn him give me those cards i hurried through the deck building hands there nobody had higher than a five but ottos hand had higher cards than the others candy grinned yeah otto did not come back pawnbroker said im going up to check all right candy replied he went and got himself a beer i eyed the locals they were getting ideas i stared at one and shook my head pawnbroker and otto returned a minute later preceded by the dark man who returned to his shadow pawnbroker and otto looked relieved they settled down to play otto asked who dealt candy did i said your go he went down seventeen hehhehheh i replied burned you fifteen and pawnbroker said got you both fourteen and candy fourteen youre hurting otto he just sat there numbed for several seconds then he caught on you bastards you stacked it you dont think im going to pay off settle down joke son candy said joke it was your deal anyhow the cards went around and the darkness came no more insurgents appeared the locals grew ever more restless some worried about their families about being late as everywhere else most tallylanders are concerned only with their own lives they dont care whether the white rose or the lady is ascendant the minority of rebel sympathizers worried about when the blow might fall they were afraid of getting caught in the crossfire we pretended ignorance of the situation candy signed which ones are dangerous we conferred selected three men who might become trouble candy had otto bind them to their chairs it dawned on the locals that we knew what to expect that we were prepared not looking forward but prepared the raiders waited till midnight they were more cautious than the rebel we encountered ordinarily maybe our reputation was too strong they burst in in a rush we discharged our spring tubes and began swinging swords retreating to a corner away from the fireplace the tall man watched indifferently there were a lot of rebels far more than we had expected they kept storming inside crowding up getting into one anothers ways climbing over the corpses of their comrades some trap i gasped must be a hundred of them yeah candy said it dont look good he kicked at a mans groin cut him when he covered up the place was walltowall insurgents and from the noise there were a hell of a lot more outside somebody didnt want us getting away well that was the plan my nostrils flared there was an odor in the air just the faintest offkey touch subtle under the stink of fear and sweat cover up i yelled and whipped a wad of damp wool from my belt pouch it stunk worse than a squashed skunk my companions followed suit somewhere a man screamed then another voices rose in a hellish chorus our enemies surged around baffled panicky faces twisted in agony men fell down in writhing heaps clawing their noses and throats i was careful to keep my face in the wool the tall thin man came out of his shadows calmly he began despatching guerrillas with a fourteeninch silvery blade he spared those customers we had not bound to their chairs he signed its safe to breathe now watch the door candy told me he knew i had an aversion to this kind of slaughter otto you take the kitchen me and pawnbroker will help silent the rebel outside tried to get us by speeding arrows through the doorway he had no luck then he tried firing the place madle suffered paroxysms of rage silent one of the three wizards of the company who had been sent into tally weeks earlier used his powers to squelch the fire angrily the rebel prepared for a siege must have brought every man in the province i said candy shrugged he and pawnbroker were piling corpses into defensive barricades they must have set up a base camp near here our intelligence about the tally guerrillas was extensive the lady prepares well before she sends us in but we hadnt been told to expect such strength available at short notice despite our successes i was scared there was a big mob outside and it sounded like more were arriving regularly silent as an ace in the hole hadnt much more value you send your bird i demanded assuming that had been the reason for his trip upstairs he nodded that provided some relief but not much the tenor changed they were quieter outside more arrows zipped through the doorway it had been ripped off its hinges in the first rush the bodies heaped in it would not slow the rebel long theyre going to come i told candy all right he joined otto in the kitchen pawnbroker joined me silent looking mean and deadly stationed himself in the center of the common room a roar went up outside here they come we held the main rush with silents help but others began to batter the window shutters then candy and otto had to concede the kitchen candy killed an overzealous attacker and spun away long enough to bellow where the hell are they silent silent shrugged he seemed almost indifferent to the proximity of death he hurled a spell at a man being boosted through a window trumpets brayed in the night ha i shouted theyre coming the last gate of the trap had closed one question remained would the company close in before our attackers finished us more windows gave silent could not be everywhere to the stair candy shouted fall back to the stair we raced for it silent called up a noxious fog it was not the deadly thing he had used before he could not do that again now he hadnt time to prepare the stair was easily held two men with silent behind them could hold it forever the rebel saw that he began setting fires this time silent could not extinguish all the flames chapter seven juniper krage the front door opened two men shoved into the lily stamped their feet and beat the ice off themselves shed scuttled over to help the bigger man pushed him away the smaller crossed the room kicked asa away from the fire squatted with his hands extended sheds guests stared into the flames seeing and hearing nothing except raven shed noted raven looked interested and not particularly disturbed shed sweated krage finally turned around you didnt stop by yesterday shed i missed you i couldnt krage i didnt have anything to bring you look in my coin box you know ill pay you i always do i just need a little time you were late last week shed i was patient i know youre having problems but you were late the week before that too and the week before that youre making me look bad i know you mean it when you say youll pay me but what will people think eh maybe they start thinking its all right for them to be late too maybe they start thinking they dont have to pay at all krage i cant look in my box as soon as business picks up krage gestured red reached behind the counter business is bad everywhere shed i got problems too i got expenses i cant meet mine if you dont meet yours he ambled around the common room examining the furnishings shed could read his mind he wanted the lily wanted shed in a hole so deep he would have to give the place up red handed sheds box to krage krage made a face business really is bad he gestured the big man count seized sheds elbows from behind shed nearly fainted krage grinned wickedly pat him down red see if hes holding out he emptied the coin box on account shed red found the silver leva raven had given shed krage shook his head shed shed you lied to me count pressed his elbows together painfully that isnt mine shed protested that belongs to raven he wanted me to buy wood thats why i was headed for lathams krage eyed him shed knew krage knew he was telling the truth he didnt have the guts to lie shed was scared krage might bust him up just so he would give up the lily to buy his life what then he would be without a gersh and in the street with an old woman to look after sheds mother cursed krage everyone ignored her including shed she was harmless darling stood in the kitchen doorway frozen one hand fisted before her mouth eyes full of appeal she watched raven more than krage and shed what do you want me to break krage red asked shed cringed red enjoyed his work you shouldnt hold out on us shed you shouldnt lie to krage he unleashed a vicious punch shed gagged tried to fall forward count held him upright red hit him again a soft cold voice said he told the truth i sent him for wood krage and red shifted formation count did not relax his grip who are you krage demanded raven let him be krage exchanged glances with red red said i think maybe youd better not talk that way to mister krage ravens gaze rose reds shoulders tightened defensively then aware of his audience he stepped over and threw an openpalmed punch raven plucked his hand out of the air twisted red went to his knees grinding his teeth on a whimper raven said that was stupid astonished krage replied smart is as smart does mister let him go while youre healthy raven smiled for the first time in sheds recollection that wasnt smart there was an audible pop red screamed count krage snapped count hurled shed aside he was twice reds size quick strong as a mountain and barely as smart nobody survived count a wicked nineinch dagger appeared in ravens hand count stopped so violently his feet tangled he fell forward rolling off the edge of ravens table oh shit shed groaned somebody was going to get killed krage wouldnt put up with this it would be bad for business but as count rose krage said count help red his tone was conversational count obediently turned to red who had dragged himself away to nurse his wrist maybe we had a little misunderstanding here krage said ill put it plain shed youve got one week to pay me the big and the nut both but no buts shed thats according to terms kill somebody rob somebody sell this dump but get the money the orelses did not have to be explained ill be all right shed promised himself he wont hurt me im too good a customer how the hell would he come up with it he couldnt sell out not with winter closing in the old woman couldnt survive in the street cold air gusted into the lily as krage paused at the door he glared at raven raven did not bother looking back some wine here shed raven said i seem to have spilled mine shed hustled despite his pain he could not help fawning i thank you raven but you shouldnt have interfered hell kill you for that raven shrugged go to the woodseller before somebody else tries to take my money shed looked at the door he did not want to go outside they might be waiting but then he looked at raven again the man was cleaning his nails with that wicked knife right away it was snowing now the street was treacherous only a thin white mask covered the mud shed could not help wondering why raven had intervened to protect his money reasonable only reasonable men stayed quiet around krage he would cut your throat if you looked at him wrong raven was new around here maybe he did not know about krage he would learn the hard way his life wasnt worth two gersh anymore raven seemed wellheeled he wouldnt carry his whole fortune around with him would he maybe he kept part hidden in his room maybe enough to pay off krage maybe he could set raven up krage would appreciate that lets see your money latham said when he asked for wood shed produced ravens silver leva ha who died this time shed reddened an old prostitute had died at the lily last winter shed had rifled her belongings before summoning the custodians his mother had lived warm for the rest of the winter the whole buskin knew because he had made the mistake of telling asa by custom the custodians took the personal possessions of the newly dead those and donations supported them and the catacombs nobody died a guest sent me ha the day you have a guest who can afford generosity latham shrugged but what do i care the coin is good i dont need its provenance grab some wood youre headed that way shed staggered back to the lily face burning ribs aching latham hadnt bothered to hide his contempt back home with the fire taking hold of the good oak shed drew two mugs of wine and sat down opposite raven on the house raven stared momentarily took a sip maneuvered the mug to an exact spot upon the tabletop what do you want to thank you again theres nothing to thank me for to warn you then you didnt take krage serious enough latham tramped in with an armload of firewood grumbling because he couldnt get his wagon out he would be back and forth for a long time go away shed and as shed rose face hot raven snapped wait you think you owe me then someday ill ask a favor you do it right sure raven anything just name it go sit by the fire shed shed squeezed in between asa and his mother joining their surly silence that raven really was creepy the man in question was engaged in a lively exchange of signs with the deaf serving girl chapter eight tally closeup i let the tip of my blade drop to the inn floor i slumped in exhaustion coughing weakly in the smoke i swayed feebly reached for the support of an overturned table reaction was setting in i had been sure this time was the end if they hadnt been forced to extinguish the fires themselves elmo crossed the room and threw an arm around me you hurt croaker want me to find oneeye not hurt just burned out been a long time since i been so scared elmo thought i was a goner he righted a chair with a foot and sat me down he was my closest friend a wiry old hardcase seldom given to moodiness wet blood reddened his left sleeve i tried to stand sit he ordered pockets can take care of it pockets was my understudy a kid of twentythree the company is getting olderat least at its core my contemporaries elmo is past fifty the captain and lieutenant straddle that fivezero i wouldnt see forty again get them all enough elmo settled on another chair oneeye and goblin and silent went after the ones who took off his voice was vacant half the rebels in the province first shot were getting too old for this the men began bringing prisoners inside sifting them for characters who might know something useful ought to leave this stuff to the kids they couldnt handle it he stared into nothing at long ago and far away something wrong he shook his head then contradicted himself what are we doing croaker isnt there any end to it i waited he did not go on he doesnt talk much especially not about his feelings i nudged what do you mean just goes on and on hunting rebels no end to the supply even back when we worked for the syndic in beryl we hunted dissidents and before beryl thirtysix years of same old same old and me never sure i was doing right especially now it was like elmo to keep his reservations in abeyance eight years before airing them were in no position to change anything the lady wont take kindly to us if we suddenly say were only going to do thus and so and none of that the ladys service has not been bad though we get the toughest missions we never have to do the dirty stuff the regulars get those jobs preemptive strikes sometimes sure the occasional massacre but all in the line of business militarily necessary wed never gotten involved in atrocities the captain wouldnt permit that its not the morality croaker whats moral in war superior strength no im just tired not an adventure anymore eh stopped being that a long time ago turned into a job something i do because i dont know anything else something you do very well that did not help but i couldnt think of anything better to say the captain came in a shambling bear who surveyed the wreckage with a cold eye he came over how many did we get croaker counts not in yet most of their command structure id guess he nodded you hurt worn out physically and emotionally been a while since i was so scared he righted a table dragged up a chair produced a case of maps the lieutenant joined him later candy brought madle over somehow the innkeeper had survived our friend has some names for you croaker i spread my paper scratched out those madle named the company commanders began drafting prisoners for gravedigging detail idly i wondered if they realized they were preparing their own resting places no rebel soldier is paroled unless we can enlist him inescapably into the ladys cause madle we enlisted we gave him a story to explain his survival and eliminated everyone who could deny it candy in a fit of generosity had the bodies removed from his well silent returned with goblin and oneeye the two smaller wizards bickering caustically as usual i do not recall the argument it didnt matter the struggle was all and it was all decades old the captain gave them a sour look asked the lieutenant heart or tome heart and tome are the only substantial towns in tally there is a king at heart who is allied with the lady she crowned him two years ago after whisper slew his predecessor he is not popular with the tallylanders my opinion never asked is that she should dispose of him before he does her further harm goblin laid a fire the morning hours were nippy he knelt before it toasting his fingers oneeye poked around behind madles counter found a beer jar miraculously unscathed he drained it in a single draft wiped his face surveyed the room winked at me here we go i murmured the captain glanced up eh oneeye and goblin oh he went back to work and did not look up again a face formed in the flames before frogfaced little goblin he did not see it his eyes were closed i looked at oneeye his eye was sealed too and his face was all pruned wrinkles atop wrinkles shadowed by the brim of his floppy hat the face in the fire took on detail eh it startled me for a moment staring my way it looked like the lady well like the face the lady wore the one time i actually saw her that was during the battle at charm she called me in to dredge my mind for suspicions about a conspiracy among the ten who were taken a thrill of fear i have lived with it for years if ever she questions me again the black company will be short its senior physician and annalist i now have knowledge for which she would flatten kingdoms the face in the fire extended a tongue like that of a salamander goblin squealed he jumped up clutching a blistered nose oneeye was draining another beer back to his victim goblin scowled rubbed his nose seated himself again oneeye turned just enough to place him at the corner of his vision he waited till goblin began to nod this has been going on forever both were with the company before i joined oneeye for at least a century he is old but is as spry as men my age maybe spryer lately ive felt the burden of time more and more all too often dwelling on everything ive missed i can laugh at peasants and townies chained all their lives to a tiny corner of the earth while i roam its face and see its wonders but when i go down there will be no child to carry my name no family to mourn me save my comrades no one to remember no one to raise a marker over my cold bit of ground though i have seen great events i will leave no enduring accomplishment save these annals such conceit writing my own epitaph disguised as company history i am developing a morbid streak have to watch that oneeye cupped his hands palmsdown on the countertop murmured opened them a nasty spider of fist size stood revealed wearing a bushy squirrel tail never say oneeye has no sense of humor it scuttled down to the floor skipped over to me grinned up with a oneeye black face wearing no eyepatch then zipped toward goblin the essence of sorcery even for its nonfraudulent practitioners is misdirection so with the bushytailed spider goblin was not snoozing he was lying in the weeds when the spider got close he whirled and swung a stick of firewood the spider dodged goblin hammered the floor in vain his target darted around chuckling in a oneeye voice the face formed in the flames its tongue darted out the seat of goblins trousers began to smoulder ill be damned i said what the captain asked not looking up he and the lieutenant had taken opposite ends of an argument over whether heart or tome would be the better base of operations somehow word gets out men streamed in for the latest round of the feud i observed i think oneeye is going to win one really for a moment old grey bear was interested oneeye hadnt bested goblin in years goblins frog mouth opened in a startled angry howl he slapped his bottom with both hands dancing you little snake he screamed ill strangle you ill cut your heart out and eat it ill ill amazing utterly amazing goblin never gets mad he gets even then oneeye will put his twisted mind to work again if goblin is even oneeye figures hes behind settle that down before it gets out of hand the captain said elmo and i got between the antagonists this thing was disturbing goblins threats were serious oneeye had caught him in a bad temper the first id ever seen ease up i told oneeye he stopped he too smelled trouble several men growled some heavy bets were down usually nobody will put a copper on oneeye goblin coming out on top is a sure thing but this time he looked feeble goblin did not want to quit did not want to play the usual rules either he snatched a fallen sword and headed for oneeye i couldnt help grinning that sword was huge and broken and goblin was so small yet so ferocious that he seemed a caricature a bloodthirsty caricature elmo couldnt handle him i signaled for help some quick thinker splashed water on goblins back he whirled cussing started a deadly spell trouble for sure a dozen men jumped in somebody threw another bucket of water that cooled goblins temper as we relieved him of the blade he looked abashed defiant but abashed i led him back to the fire and settled beside him whats the matter what happened i glimpsed the captain from the corner of my eye oneeye stood before him drained by a heavyduty dressing down i dont know croaker goblin slumped stared into the fire suddenly everything was too much this ambush tonight same old thing theres always another province always more rebels they breed like maggots in a cowpie im getting older and older and i havent done anything to make a better world in fact if you backed off to look at it weve all made it worse he shook his head that isnt right not what i want to say but i dont know how to say it any better must be an epidemic what nothing thinking out loud elmo myself goblin a lot of the men judging by their tenor lately something was wrong in the black company i had suspicions but wasnt ready to analyze too depressing what we need is a challenge i suggested we havent stretched ourselves since charm which was a halftruth an operation which compelled us to become totally involved in staying alive might be a prescription for symptoms but was no remedy for causes as a physician i was not fond of treating symptoms alone they could recur indefinitely the disease itself had to be attacked what we need goblin said in a voice so soft it almost vanished in the crackle of the flames is a cause we can believe in yeah i said that too from outside came the startled outraged cries of prisoners discovering that they were to fill the graves they had dug chapter nine juniper death pays shed grew increasingly frightened as the days passed he had to get some money krage was spreading the word he was to be made an example he recognized the tactic krage wanted to scare him into signing the lily over the place wasnt much but it was damned sure worth more than he owed krage would resell it for several times his investment or turn it into whore cribs and marron shed and his mother would be in the streets with winters deadly laughter howling in their faces kill somebody krage had said rob somebody shed considered both he would do anything to keep the lily and protect his mother if he could just get real customers he got nothing but onenight chiselers and scroungers he needed residential regulars but he could not get those without fixing the place up and that he couldnt do without money asa rolled through the doorway pale and frightened he scuttled to the counter find a wood supply yet shed asked the little man shook his head slid two gersh across the counter give me a drink shed scooped the coins into his box one did not question moneys provenance it had no memory he poured a full measure asa reached eagerly oh no shed said tell me about it come on shed i paid you sure and ill deliver when you tell me why youre so rocky wheres that raven upstairs sleeping raven had been out all night asa shook a little more give me that shed talk all right krage and red grabbed me they wanted to know about raven so shed knew how asa had come by money he had tried to sell raven tell me more they just wanted to know about him what did they want to know if he ever goes out why asa stalled shed pulled the mug away all right they had two men watching him they disappeared nobody knows anything krage is furious shed let him have the wine he drained it in a single gulp shed glanced toward the stair shuddered maybe he had underestimated raven what did krage say about me sure could use another mug shed ill give you a mug over the noggin i dont need you shed i made a connection i can sleep over to krages any time i want shed grunted made a mask of his face you win he poured wine hes going to put you out of business shed whatever it takes hes decided youre in it with raven wicked little smile only he cant figure where you got the guts to buck him im not i dont have anything to do with raven asa you know that asa enjoyed his moment i tried to tell krage shed he didnt want to hear it drink your wine and get out asa shed the old whine filled asas voice you heard me out back to your new friends see how long they have a use for you shed theyll throw you back into the street asa right beside me and mom git you bloodsucker asa downed his wine and fled shoulders tight against his neck he had tasted the truth of sheds words his association with krage would be fragile and brief shed tried to warn raven raven ignored him shed polished mugs watched raven chatter with darling in the utter silence of sign language and tried to imagine some way of making a hit in the upper city usually he spent these early hours eying darling and trying to imagine a way to gain access but lately sheer terror of the street had abolished his customary randiness a cry like that of a hog with a cut throat came from upstairs mother shed took the stairs two steps at a time his mother stood in the doorway of the big bunkroom panting mom whats wrong theres a dead man in there sheds heart fluttered he pushed into the room an old man lay in the bottom right bunk inside the door there had been only four bunkroom customers last night six gersh a head the room was six feet wide and twelve long with twentyfour platforms stacked six high when the room was full shed charged two gersh to sleep leaning on a rope stretched down the middle shed touched the oldtimer his skin was cold he had been gone for hours who was he old june asked i dont know shed probed his ragged clothing he found four gersh and an iron ring damn he could not take that the custodians would be suspicious if they found nothing were jinxed this is our fourth stiff this year its the customers son they have one foot in the catacombs already shed spat id better send for the custodians a voice said hes waited this long let him wait a little longer shed whirled raven and darling stood behind his mother what he might be the answer to your problems raven said and immediately darling began flashing signs so fast shed could not catch one in twenty evidently she was telling raven not to do something raven ignored her old june snapped shed her voice was heavy with admonition dont worry mom ill handle it go ahead with your work june was blind but when her health permitted she dumped the slops and handled what passed for maid service mainly dusting beds between guests to kill fleas and lice when her health confined her to bed shed brought in his cousin wally a neerdowell like asa but with a wife and kids shed used him out of pity for the wife he headed downstairs raven followed still arguing with darling momentarily shed wondered if raven was diddling her be a damned waste of fine womanflesh if someone wasnt how could a dead man with four gersh get him out from under krage answer he could not not legitimately raven settled onto his usual stool he scattered a handful of copper wine buy yourself a mug too shed collected the coins deposited them in his box us contents were pitiful he wasnt making expenses he was doomed his debt to krage could miraculously be discharged and still hed be doomed he deposited a mug before raven seated himself on a stool he felt old beyond his years and infinitely weary tell me the old man who was he who were his people shed shrugged just somebody who wanted to get out of the cold the buskin is full of them so it is shed shuddered at ravens tone are you proposing what i think whats that i dont know what use is a corpse i mean even the custodians only stuff them in the catacombs suppose there was a buyer ive been supposing that and what would i have to do his voice barely carried across the table he could imagine no more disgusting crime even the least of the citys dead were honored above the living a corpse was a holy object the enclosure was junipers epicenter very little late tonight have the body at the back door you could do that shed nodded weakly good finish your wine shed downed it in a gulp he drew another mug polished his stoneware industriously it was a bad dream it would go away the corpse seemed almost weightless but shed had difficulty negotiating the stairs he had drunk too much he eased through the shadowed common stepping with exaggerated care the people clustered near the fireplace looked demonic in the sullen red of the last coals one of the old mans feet toppled a pot as shed entered the kitchen he froze nothing happened his heartbeat gradually slowed he kept reminding himself that he was doing this so his mother would not have to freeze on winter streets he thumped the door with his knee it swung inward immediately a shadow hissed hurry up and seized the old mans feet helped shed heave it into a wagon panting terrified shed croaked what now go to bed you get your share in the morning sheds relieved sigh nearly became tears how much he gasped a third only a third im taking all the risk youre safe already all right how much would it be the market varies raven turned away shed closed the door leaned against it with closed eyes what had he done he built up the fire and went to bed lay listening to his mothers snores had she guessed maybe she wouldnt the custodians often waited for night he would tell her she had slept through everything he could not sleep who knew about the death if word got out people would wonder they would begin to suspect the unsuspectable what if raven got caught would the inquisitors make him talk bullock could make a stone sing he watched his mother all next morning she did not speak except in monosyllables but that was her custom raven appeared shortly after noon tea and a bowl of porridge shed when he paid he did not shove copper across the counter sheds eye widened ten silver leva lay before him ten for one dead old man that was a third and raven had done this before he must be rich sheds palms grew moist his mind howled after potential crimes shed raven said softly when he delivered the tea and porridge dont even think about it what dont think what youre thinking you would end up in the wagon darling scowled at them from the kitchen doorway for a moment raven seemed embarrassed shed slunk into the hostel where krage held court from the outside the place was as crummy as the lily timidly he looked for count tried to ignore asa count would not torment him for fun count i need to see krage count opened big brown cow eyes why i brought him some money on account count heaved himself upright all right wait here he stalked off asa sidled up whered you get the money shed where do you get yours asa asa did not answer it isnt polite to ask mind your own business or stay away from me shed i thought we were friends i tried to be friends asa i even let you have a place to sleep and as soon as you hooked up with krage a shadow crossed asas face im sorry shed you know me i dont think so fast i do dumb things shed snorted so asa had come to the inevitable conclusion krage would dump him once he settled with raven shed was tempted to betray raven the man had to have a fortune hidden but he was afraid of a thousand things and his guest stood at the top of the list asa said i found a way to get deadwood from the enclosure his face brightened in pathetic appeal mostly pine but its wood the enclosure its not illegal shed it keeps the enclosure cleaned up shed scowled righteously shed its less wrong than going through somebodys shed controlled his anger he needed allies inside the enemy camp firewood could be like money asa no provenance asa smiled fawningly thanks shed count called shed shed shook as he crossed the room krages men smirked this wouldnt work krage wouldnt listen he was going to throw his money away count says youve got something to give me on account krage said uhm krages den could have been ripped whole from a mansion high up the wall of the valley shed was stunned stop gawking and get on with it youd better not give me a handful of copper and beg for an extension either picked a warm doorway yet your payments are a joke shed no joke mr krage honest i can pay over half of it krages eyebrows rose interesting shed laid nine silver leva before him very interesting he fixed shed with a penetrating stare shed stammered thats over half counting interest i hoped maybe seeing as how that would put me ahead quiet shed shut up you think i should forget what happened that wasnt my fault mr krage i didnt tell him to you dont know what raven is like shut up krage stared at the coins maybe something can be arranged i know you didnt put him up to it you dont have the guts shed stared at the floor unable to deny his cowardice okay shed youre a regular client back to the regular schedule he eyed the money youre ahead three weeks looks like thank you mr krage really you dont know how much this means shut up i know exactly what it means get out start getting another payment together this is your last reprieve yes sir shed retreated count opened the door shed i may want something sometime a favor for a favor understand yes sir all right go shed left a sinking feeling replacing relief krage would make him help get raven he almost wept as he tramped homeward it never got any better he was always in a trap chapter ten tally turnaround tome was typical of towns we had garrisoned recently small dirty boring one wondered why the lady bothered what use were these remote provinces did she insist they bend the knee merely to puff her ego there was nothing here worth having unless it was power over the natives even they viewed their country with a certain contempt the presence of the black company strained the resources of the area within a week the captain started talking about shifting a company to heart and billeting smaller units in the villages our patrols seldom encountered the rebel even when our wizards helped hunt the engagement at madles had all but eliminated the infestation the ladys spies told us the few committed rebels left had fled into tambor an even bleaker kingdom to the northeast i supposed tambor would be our next mission i was scribbling away at these annals one day when i decided i needed an estimate of the mileage wed covered in our progression eastward i was appalled to learn the truth tome was two thousand miles east of charm far beyond the bounds of the empire as it had existed six years ago the great bloody conquests of the taken whisper had established a border arc just this side of the plain of fear i ran down the line of citystates forming that forgotten frontier frost and ade thud and barns and rust where the rebel had defied the lady successfully for years huge cities all formidable and the last such we had seen i still shuddered recalling the plain of fear we crossed it under the aegis of whisper and feather two of the taken the ladys black apprentices both sorceresses orders of magnitude above our three puny wizards even so and traveling with entire armies of the ladys regulars we suffered there it is a hostile bitter land where none of the normal rules apply rocks speak and whales fly coral grows in the desert trees walk and the inhabitants are the strangest of all but that is neither here nor there just a nightmare from the past a nightmare that haunts me still when the screams of cougar and fleet come echoing down the corridors of time and once again i can do nothing to save them whats the trouble elmo asked slipping the map from beneath my fingers cocking his head sideways look like you saw a ghost just remembering the plain of fear oh yeah well buck up have a beer he slapped my back hey kingpin where the hell you been he charged away in pursuit of the companys leading malingerer oneeye arrived a moment later startling me hows goblin he asked softly there had been no intercourse between them since madles he eyed the map the empty hills interesting name also called the hollow hills hes all right why dont you check him out what the hell for he was the one who acted the ass cant take a little joke your jokes get a bit rough oneeye yeah maybe tell you what you come with me got to prepare my reading one night a month the captain expects me to exhort the troops with a reading from the annals so well know where we came from so well recall our ancestors in the outfit once that meant a lot the black company last of the free companies of khatovar all brethren tight great esprit us against the world and let the world watch out but the something that had manifested itself in goblins behavior in the lowgrade depression of elmo and others was affecting everybody the pieces were coming unglued i had to pick a good reading from a time when the company had its back against the wall and survived only by clinging to its traditional virtues there have been many such moments in four hundred years i wanted one recorded by one of the more inspired annalists one with the fire of a white rose revivalist speaking to potential recruits maybe i needed a series one that i could read several nights running crap oneeye said you know those books by heart always got your nose in them anyway you could fake the whole thing and nobody would know the difference probably and nobody would care if i did its going sour oldtimer right lets go see goblin maybe the annals needed a rereading on a different level maybe i was treating symptoms the annals have a certain mystic quality for me maybe i could identify the disease by immersing myself hunting something between the lines goblin and silent were playing nohands mumbletypeg ill say this for our three spookpushers they arent great but they keep then talents polished goblin was ahead on points he was in a good mood he even nodded to oneeye so it was over the stopper could be put into the bottle oneeye just had to say the right thing to my amazement he even apologized by sign silent suggested we get out and let them conclude their peace in private each had an overabundance of pride we stepped outside as we often did when no one could intercept our signs we discussed old times he too was privy to the secret for which the lady would obliterate nations half a dozen others suspected once and had forgotten we knew and would never forget those others if put to the question would leave the lady with serious doubts we two never we knew the identity of the ladys most potent enemyand for six years we had done nothing to apprise her of the fact that that enemy even existed as more than a rebel fantasy the rebel tends to a streak of superstition he loves prophets and prophecies and grand dramatic foretellings of victories to come it was pursuit of a prophecy which led him into the trap at charm nearly causing his extinction he regained his balance afterward by convincing himself that he was the victim of false prophets and prophecies laid upon him by villains trickier than he in that conviction he could go on and believe more impossible things the funny thing was he lied to himself with the truth i was perhaps the only person outside the ladys inner circle who knew he had been guided into the jaws of death only the enemy who had done the guiding was not the lady as he believed that enemy was an evil greater still the dominator the ladys onetime spouse whom she had betrayed and left buried but alive in a grave in the great forest north of a far city called oar from that grave he had reached out subtly and twisted the minds of men high in rebel circles bending them to his will hoping to use them to drag the lady down and bring about his own resurrection he failed though he had help from several of the original taken in his scheme if he knew of my existence i must be high on his list he lay up there still scheming maybe hating me for i helped betray the taken helping him scary that the lady was medicine bad enough the dominator though was the body of which her evil was but a shadow or so the legend goes i sometimes wonder why if that is true she walks the earth and he lies restless in the grave i have done a good deal of research since discovering the power of the thing in the north probing littleknown histories scaring myself each time the domination an era when the dominator actually ruled smelled like an era of hell on earth it seemed a miracle that the white rose had put him down a pity she could not have destroyed him and all his minions including the lady the world would not be in the straits it is today i wonder when the honeymoon will end the lady hasnt been that terrible when will she relax and give the darkness within her free rein reviving the terror of the past i also wonder about the villainies attributed to the domination history inevitably is recorded by selfserving victors a scream came from goblins quarters silent and i stared at one another a moment then rushed inside i honestly expected one of them to be bleeding his life out on the floor i did not expect to find goblin having a fit while oneeye desperately strove to keep him from hurting himself somebody made contact oneeye gasped help me its strong i gaped contact we hadnt had a direct communication since the desperately swift campaigns when the rebel was closing in on charm years ago since then the lady and taken have been content to communicate through messengers the fit lasted only seconds that was customary then goblin relaxed whimpering it would be several minutes before he recovered enough to relay the message we three looked at one another with cardplaying faces frightened inside i said somebody ought to tell the captain yeah oneeye said he made no move to go neither did silent all right im elected i went i found the captain doing what he does best he had his feet up on his worktable was snoring i wakened him told him he sighed find the lieutenant he went to his map cases i asked a couple questions he ignored took the hint and got out he had expected something like this there was a crisis in the area how could charm have heard first silly worrying before i heard what goblin had to say the lieutenant seemed no more surprised than the captain something up i asked maybe a courier letter came after you and candy left for tally said we might be called west this could be it west really yeah such dense sarcasm he put into the word stupid if we chose charm as the customary demarcation point between east and west tally lay two thousand plus miles away three months travel under perfect conditions the country between was anything but perfect in places roads just didnt exist i thought six months sounded too optimistic but i was worrying before the fact again i had to wait and see it turned out to be something even the captain and lieutenant hadnt anticipated we waited in trepidation while goblin pulled himself together the captain had his map case open sketching a tentative route to frost he grumbled because all westbound traffic had to cross the plain of fear goblin cleared his throat tension mounted he did not lift his eyes the news had to be unpleasant he squeaked weve been recalled that was the lady she seemed disturbed the first leg goes to frost one of the taken will meet us there hell take us on to the barrowland the others frowned exchanged puzzled looks i muttered shit holy shit what is it croaker the captain asked they didnt know they paid no attention to historical things thats where the dominator is buried where they all were buried back when its in the forest north of oar wed been to oar seven years ago it was not a friendly city oar the captain yelled oar thats twentyfive hundred miles add another hundred or two to the barrowland he stared at the maps great just great that means not just the plain of fear but the empty hills and the windy country too just fandamntastic great i suppose weve got to get there next week goblin shook his head she didnt seem rushed captain just upset and wanting us headed the right way she give you any whys or wherefores goblin smirked did the lady ever hell no just like that the captain muttered out of the blue orders to hike halfway around the world i love it he told the lieutenant to begin preparations for movement it was bad news mad news insanity squared but not as bad as he made out he had been preparing since receiving the courier letter it wasnt that hard to get rolling the trouble was nobody wanted to roll the west was far nicer than anything wed known out here but not so great anybody wanted to walk that far surely she could have summoned a closer unit we are the victims of our own competence she always wants us where the going threatens to become toughest she knows we will do the best job damn and double damn chapter eleven juniper night work shed had given krage only nine of ten leva the coin he held back bought firewood wine and beer to replenish his stocks then other creditors caught wind of his prosperity a slight upturn in business did him no good he met his next payment to krage by borrowing from a moneylender named gilbert he found himself wishing somebody would die another ten leva would put him in striking distance of getting through the winter it was a hard one that winter nothing moved in the harbor there was no work in the buskin sheds only bit of good fortune was asa asa brought wood whenever he got away from krage in a pathetic effort to buy a friend asa arrived with a load privately he said better watch out shed krage heard about you borrowing from gilbert shed went grey hes got a buyer for the lily lined up theyre rounding up girls already shed nodded the whoremasters recruited desperate women this time of year by the time summer brought its sailors they were broken to their trade the bastard made me think hed given me a break i should have known better this way he gets my money and my place the bastard well i warned you yeah thanks asa sheds next due date came on like a juggernaut gilbert refused him another loan smaller creditors besieged the lily krage was aiming them sheds way he took raven a complimentary drink may i sit a hint of a smile crossed ravens lips its your place and you havent been friendly lately shed im nervous shed lied raven irritated his conscience worried about my debts raven saw through the excuse you thought maybe i could help shed almost groaned yes raven laughed softly shed thought he detected a note of triumph all right shed tonight shed pictured his mother being carted off by the custodians he swallowed his selfdisgust yeah all right but this time youre a helper not a partner shed swallowed and nodded put the old woman to bed then come back downstairs understand yes shed whispered good now go away you irritate me yes sir shed retreated he couldnt look anyone in the eye the rest of that day a bitter wind howled down the port valley freckled with flakes of snow shed huddled miserably the wagon seat a bar of ice beneath him the weather was worsening why tonight he grumbled best time ravens teeth chattered were not likely to be seen he turned into chandlers lane off which innumerable narrow alleyways ran good hunting territory here in this weather they crawl back in the alleys and die like flies shed shivered he was too old for this but that was why he was here so he wouldnt have to face the weather every night raven stopped the wagon check that passageway sheds feet started aching the instant he put weight on them good at least he felt something they werent frozen there was little light in the alley he searched more by feel than sight he found one lump under an overhang but it stirred and muttered he ran he reached the wagon as raven dumped something into the bed shed averted his eyes the boy couldnt have been more than twelve raven concealed the body with straw thats one night like this we ought to find a load shed choked his protests resumed his seat he thought about his mother she wouldnt last one night in this next alley he found his first corpse the old man had fallen and frozen because he couldnt get up again aching in his soul shed dragged the body to the wagon going to be a good night raven observed no competition the custodians wont come out in this softly i hope we can make the hill later after they had moved to the waterfront and each had found another corpse shed asked whyre you doing this i need money too got a long way to travel this way i get a lot fast without much risk shed thought the risks far greater than raven would admit they could be torn apart youre not from juniper are you from the south a shipwrecked sailor shed did not believe it ravens accent was not at all right for that mild though it was he hadnt the nerve to call the man a liar though and press for the truth the conversation continued by fits and starts shed didnt uncover anything more of ravens background or motives go that way raven told him ill check over here last stop shed im done in shed nodded he wanted to get the night over to his disgust he had begun seeing the street people as objects and he hated them for dying in such damned inconvenient places he heard a soft call turned back quickly raven had one that was enough he ran to the wagon raven was on the seat waiting shed scrambled up huddled tucked his face away from the wind raven kicked the mules into motion the wagon was halfway across the bridge over the port when shed heard a moan what one of the bodies was moving oh oh shit raven hes going to die anyway shed huddled back down stared at the buildings on the north bank he wanted to argue wanted to fight wanted to do anything to deny his part in this atrocity he looked up an hour later and recognized nothing a few large houses flanked the road widely spaced their windows dark where are we almost there half an hour unless the road is too icy shed imagined the wagon sliding into a ditch what then abandon everything and hope the rig couldnt be traced fear replaced loathing then he realized where they were there wasnt anything up here but that accursed black castle raven whats the matter youre head for the black castle whered you think we were going people live there yes whats your problem raven was a foreigner he couldnt understand how the black castle affected juniper people who got too close disappeared juniper preferred to pretend that the place did not exist shed stammered out his fears raven shrugged shows your ignorance shed saw the castles dark shape through the snow the fall was lighter on the ridge but the wind was more fierce resigned he muttered lets get it over with the shape resolved into battlements spires towers not a light shown anywhere raven halted before a tall gate went forward on foot he banged a heavy knocker shed huddled hoping there would be no response the gate opened immediately raven scrambled onto the wagons seat get up mules youre not going inside why not hey no way no shut up shed you want your money you help unload shed stifled a whimper he hadnt bargained for this raven drove through the gate turned right halted beneath a broad arch a single lantern battled the darkness clotting the passageway raven swung down shed followed his nerves shrieking they dragged the bodies out of the wagon and swung them onto stone slabs nearby then raven said get back on the wagon keep your mouth shut the one body stirred shed grunted raven pinched his leg savagely shut up a shadowy shape appeared it was tall thin clad in loose black pantaloons and a hooded shirt it examined each body briefly seemed pleased it faced raven shed glimpsed a face all of sharp angles and shadows lustrous olive cold with a pair of softly luminous eyes thirty thirty forty thirty seventy it said raven countered thirty thirty fifty thirty one hundred forty eighty fortyfive ninety forty ninety done they were dickering raven was not interested in quibbling over the old people the tall being would not advance his offer for the youth but the dying man was negotiable shed watched the tall being count out coins at the feet of the corpses that was a damned fortune two hundred twenty pieces of silver with that he could tear the lily down and build a new place he could get out of the buskin altogether raven scooped the coins into his coat pocket he gave shed five thats all isnt that a good nights work it was a good months work and then some but to get only five of last time we were partners raven said swinging onto the drivers seat maybe we will be again but tonight youre a hired hand understand there was a hard edge to his voice shed nodded beset by new fears raven backed the wagon shed felt a sudden chill that archway was hot as hell he shuddered feeling the hunger of the thing watching them dark glassy jointless stone slid past my god he could see into the wall he saw bones fragments of bones bodies pieces of bodies all suspended as if floating in the night as raven turned toward the gate he saw a staring face what kind of place is this i dont know shed i dont want to know all i care is they pay good money i need it i have a long way to go chapter twelve the barrowland the taken called the limper met the company at frost wed spent a hundred and fortysix days on the march they were long days and hard grinding men and animals going on more by habit than desire an outfit in good shape like ours is capable of covering fifty or even a hundred miles in a day pushing hell out of it but not day after week after month upon incredibly miserable roads a smart commander does not push on a long march the days add up each leaving its residue of fatigue till men begin collapsing if the pace is too desperate considering the territories we crossed we made damned good time between tome and frost lie mountains where we were lucky to make five miles a day deserts we had to wander in search of water rivers that took days to cross using makeshift rafts we were fortunate to reach frost having lost only two men the captain shone with a glow of accomplishmenttill the military governor summoned him he assembled the officers and senior noncoms when he returned bad news he told us the lady is sending the limper to lead us across the plain of fear us and the caravan well escort our response was surly there was bad blood between the company and the limper elmo asked how soon will we leave sir we needed rest none had been promised of course and the lady and the taken seem unconscious of human frailties but still no time specified dont get lazy hes not here now but he could turn up tomorrow sure with the flying carpets the taken use they can turn up anywhere within days i muttered lets hope other business keeps him away a while i did not want to encounter him again we had done him wrong frequently way back before charm we worked closely with a taken called soulcatcher catcher used us in several schemes to discredit limper both out of old enmity and because catcher was secretly working on behalf of the dominator the lady was taken in she nearly destroyed the limper but rehabilitated him instead and brought him back for the final battle way way back when the domination was aborning centuries before the foundation of the ladys empire the dominator overpowered his greatest rivals and compelled them into his service he accumulated ten villains that way soon known as the ten who were taken when the white rose raised the world against the dominators wickedness the ten were buried with him she could destroy none of them outright centuries of peace sapped the will of the world to guard itself a curious wizard tried to contact the lady the lady manipulated him effected her release the ten rose with her within a generation she and they forged a new dark empire within two they were embattled with the rebel whose prophets agreed the white rose would be reincarnated to lead them to a final victory for a while it looked like they would win our armies collapsed provinces fell taken feuded and destroyed one another nine of the ten perished the lady managed to take three rebel chieftains to replace a portion of her losses feather journey and whisperlikely the best general since the white rose she gave us a terrible time before her taking the rebel prophets were correct in their prophecies except about the last battle they expected a reincarnated white rose to lead them she did not they did not find her in time she was alive then but she was living on our side of the battleline unaware of what she was i learned who she was it is that knowledge which makes my life worthless should i be put to the question croaker the captain snapped wake up everybody looked at me wondering how i could daydream through whatever hed said what you didnt hear me no sir he glowered his best bear glower listen up then be ready to travel by carpet when the taken arrive fifty pounds of gear is your limit carpet taken what the hell i looked around some of the men grinned some pitied me carpet flight what for patiently the captain explained the lady wants ten men sent to help whisper and feather in the barrowland doing what i dont know youre one of the ones she picked flutter of fear why me it was rough back when i was her pet maybe she still loves you after all these years captain because she said so croaker i guess thats good enough sure cant argue with it who else pay attention and youd know these things worry about it later we have other fish to fry now whisper came to frost before the limper i found myself tossing a pack aboard her flying carpet fifty pounds the rest i had left with oneeye and silent the carpet was a carpet only by courtesy because tradition calls it that actually it is a piece of heavy fabric stretched on a wooden frame a foot high when grounded my fellow passengers were elmo who would command our team and kingpin kingpin is a lazy bastard but he swings a mean blade our gear and another hundred pounds belonging to men who would follow us later rested at the center of the carpet shaking elmo and kingpin tied themselves in place at the carpets two rear corners my spot was the left front whisper sat at the right we were heavily bundled almost to immobility we would be flying fast and high whisper said the temperature upstairs would be low i shook as much as elmo and kingpin though i had been aboard carpets before i loved the view and dreaded the anticipation of falling that came with flight i also dreaded the plain of fear where strange fell things cruise the upper air whisper queried you all use the latrine its going to be a long flight she did not mention us voiding ourselves in fear which some men do up there her voice was cool and melodious like those of the women who populate your last dream before waking her appearance belied that voice she looked every bit the tough old campaigner she was she eyed me evidently recalling our previous encounter in the forest of cloud raven and i had lain in wait where she was expected to meet the limper and lead him over to the rebel side the ambush was successful raven took the limper i captured whisper soulcatcher and the lady came and finished up whisper became the first new taken since the domination she winked taut fabric smacked my butt we went up fast crossing the plain of fear was faster by air but still harrowing windwhales quartered across our path we zipped around them they were too slow to keep pace turquoise manta things rose from their backs flapped clumsily caught updrafts rose above us then dived past like plunging eagles challenging our presence in their airspace we could not outrun them but outclimbed them easily however we could not climb higher than the windwhales so high and the air becomes too rare for human beings the whales could rise another mile becoming diving platforms for the mantas there were other flying things smaller and less dangerous but determinedly obnoxious nevertheless we got through when a manta did attack whisper defeated it with her thaumaturgic craft to do so she gave up control of the carpet we fell out of control till she drove the manta away i got through without losing my breakfast but just barely i never asked elmo and kingpin figuring they might not want their dignity betrayed whisper would not attack first that is the prime rule for surviving the plain of fear dont hit first if you do you buy more than a duel every monster out there will go after you we crossed without harm as carpets usually do and raced on all day long into the night we turned north the air became cooler whisper dropped to lower altitudes and slower speeds morning found us over forsberg where the company had served when new in the ladys service elmo and i gawked over the side once i pointed shouted theres deal we had held that fortress briefly then elmo pointed the other way there lay oar where we had pulled some fine bloody tricks on the rebel and earned the enmity of the limper whisper flew so low we could distinguish faces in the streets oar looked no more friendly than it had eight years ago we passed on rolled along above the treetops of the great forest ancient and virgin wilderness from which the white rose had conducted her campaigns against the dominator whisper slowed around noon we drifted down into a wide sprawl that once had been cleared land a cluster of mounds in its middle betrayed the handiwork of man though now the barrows are scarcely recognizable whisper landed in the street of a town that was mostly ruin i presumed it to be the town occupied by the eternal guard whose task it is to prevent tampering with the barrowland they were effective till betrayed by apathy elsewhere it took the resurrectionists three hundred seventy years to open the barrowland and then they did not get what they wanted the lady returned with the taken but the dominator remained chained the lady obliterated the resurrectionist movement root and branch some reward eh a handful of men left a building still in good repair i eavesdropped on their exchange with whisper understood a few words recall your forsberger i asked elmo while trying to shake the stiffness out of my muscles itll come back want to give kingpin a look he dont seem right he wasnt bad off just scared took a while to convince him we were back on the ground the locals descendants of the guards who had watched the barrowland for centuries showed us to our quarters the town was being restored we were the forerunners of a horde of new blood goblin and two of our best soldiers came in on whispers next flight three days later they said the company had left frost i asked if it looked like the limper was holding a grudge not that i could see goblin said but that dont mean anything no it didnt the last four men arrived three days later whisper moved into our barracks we formed a sort of bodyguard cum police force besides protecting her we were supposed to help make sure unauthorized persons did not get near the barrowland the taken called feather appeared bringing her own bodyguard specialists determined to investigate the barrowland came up with a battalion of laborers hired in oar the laborers cleared the trash and brush up to the barrowland proper entry there without appropriate protection meant a slow painful death the protective spells the white rose left hadnt faded with the ladys resurrection and she had added her own i guess she is terrified he will break loose the taken journey arrived bringing troops of his own he established outposts in the great forest the taken took turns making airborne patrols we minions watched one another as closely as we watched the rest of the world something big was afoot nobody was saying so but that much was obvious the lady definitely anticipated a breakout attempt i spent my free time reviewing the guards records especially for the period when bomanz lived here he spent forty years in the garrison town disguised as an antique digger before he tried to contact the lady and unintentionally freed her he interested me but there was little to dig out and that little was colored once id had his personal papers having stumbled onto them shortly before whispers taking but i passed them on to our then mentor soulcatcher for transportation to the tower soulcatcher kept them for her own reasons and they fell into my hands again during the battle at charm as the lady and i pursued the renegade taken i didnt mention the papers to anyone but a friend raven the raven who deserted to protect a child he believed to be the reincarnation of the white rose when i got a chance to pick up the papers from where i hid them they were gone i guess raven took them with him i often wonder what became of him his declared intent was to flee so far no one could find him again he did not care about politics he just wanted to protect a child he loved he was capable of doing anything to protect darling i guess he thought the papers might turn into insurance someday in the guard headquarters there are a dozen landscapes painted by past members of the garrison most portray the barrowland it was magnificent in its day it had consisted of a central great barrow on a northsouth axis containing the dominator and his lady surrounding the great barrow was a star of earth raised above the plain outlined by a deep waterfilled moat at the points of that star stood lesser barrows containing five of the ten who were taken a circle rising above the star connected its inward points and there at each stood another barrow containing another taken every barrow was surrounded by spells and fetishes within the inner ring around the great barrow were rank on rank of additional defenses the last was a dragon curled around the great barrow its tail in its mouth a later painting by an eyewitness shows the dragon belching fire on the countryside the night of the ladys resurrection bomanz is walking into the fire he was caught between resurrectionists and the lady all of whom were manipulating him his accident was their premeditated event the records say his wife survived she said he went into the barrowland to stop what was happening no one believed her at the time she claimed he carried the ladys true name and wanted to reach her with it before she could wriggle free silent oneeye and goblin will tell you the direst fear of any sorcerer is that knowledge of his true name will fall to some outsider bomanzs wife claimed the ladys was encoded in papers her husband possessed papers that vanished that night papers that i recovered decades later what raven snatched may contain the only lever capable of dumping the empire back to the barrowland in its youth impressive construction its weather faces were sheathed in limestone the moat was broad and blue the surrounding countryside was parklike but fear of the dominator faded and so did appropriations a later painting contemporary with bomanz shows the countryside gone to seed the limestone facings in disrepair and the moat becoming a swamp today you cant tell where the moat was the limestone has disappeared beneath brush the elevations and barrows are nothing but humps that part of the great barrow where the dominator lies remains in fair shape though it too is heavily overgrown some of the fetishes anchoring the spells keeping his friends away still stand but weather has devoured their features the edge of the barrowland is now marked by stakes trailing red flags put there when the lady announced she was sending outsiders to investigate the guards themselves having lived there always need no markers to warn them off i enjoyed my month and a half there i indulged my curiosities and found feather and whisper remarkably accessible that hadnt been true of the old taken too the commander of the guard called the monitor bragged up his commands past which stretches back as far as the companys we swapped lies and tales over many a gallon of beer during the fifth week someone discovered something we peons were not told what but the taken got excited whisper started lifting in more of the company the reinforcements told harrowing fables about the plain of fear and the empty hills the company was at lords now only five hundred miles distant at the end of the sixth week whisper assembled us and announced another move the lady wants me to take some of you out west a force of twentyfive elmo youll be in command feather and i some experts and several language specialists will join you yes croaker youre on the list she wouldnt deny her favorite amateur historian would she a thrill of fear i didnt want her getting interested again wherere we headed elmo asked professional to the core the sonofabitch not a single complaint a city called juniper way beyond the western bounds of the empire its connected with the barrowland somehow its a ways north too expect it to be cold and prepare accordingly juniper never heard of it neither had anyone else not even the monitor i scrounged through his maps till i found one showing the western coast juniper was way up north near where the ice persists all year long it was a big city i wondered how it could exist there where it should be frozen all the time i asked whisper she seemed to know something about the place she said juniper benefits from an ocean current that brings warm water north she said the city is very strangeaccording to feather whod actually been there i approached feather next only hours before our departure she couldnt tell me much more except that juniper is the demense of a duke zimerlan and he appealed to the lady a year ago for help solving a local problem that someone had approached the lady when the worlds desire is to keep her far away argued that we faced interesting times i wondered about the connection with the barrowland the negative was that juniper was so far away i was pleased that i would be there when the captain learned he was expected to head there after resting in oar though could be id hear his howl of outrage even from that far i knew he wouldnt be happy chapter thirteen juniper the enclosure shed slept badly for weeks he dreamt of black glass walls and a man who hadnt been dead twice raven asked him to join a night hunt twice he refused raven did not press though they both knew shed would jump if he insisted shed prayed that raven would get rich and disappear he remained a constant irritant to the conscience damnit why didnt krage go after him shed couldnt figure why raven remained unperturbed by krage the man was neither a fool nor stupid the alternative that he wasnt scared made no sense not to a matron shed asa remained on krages payroll but visited regularly bringing firewood by the wagonload sometimes whatre you up to shed demanded one day trying to build credit asa admitted krages guys dont like me much hardly anybody does asa they might try something nasty want a place to hide when they turn on you eh whatre you doing for krage why is he bothering with you asa hemmed and hawed shed pushed here was a man he could bully i watch raven shed i report what he does shed snorted krage was using asa because he was expendable hed had two men disappear early on shed thought he knew where they were sudden fear suppose asa reported ravens night adventures suppose hed seen shed impossible asa couldnt have kept quiet asa spent his life looking for leverage youve been spending a lot lately asa where are you getting the money asa turned pale he looked around gobbled a few times the wood shed selling the wood youre a liar asa wherere you getting it shed you dont ask questions like that maybe not but i need money bad i owe krage i almost had him paid off then he started buying my little debts from everybody else that damned gilbert i need to get ahead enough so i dont have to borrow again the black castle two hundred twenty pieces of silver how he had been tempted to attack raven and raven just smiled into the wind knowing exactly what he was thinking wherere you getting that money asa where did you get the money you paid krage huh people are wondering shed you dont come up with that kind of money overnight not you you tell me and ill tell you shed backed down asa beamed in triumph you little snake get out before i lose my temper asa fled he looked back once face knotted thoughtfully damnit shed thought made him suspicious he ground his rag into a tacky mug what was that shed spun raven had come to the counter his look brooked no crap shed gave him the gist so krage hasnt quit you dont know him or you wouldnt ask its you or him raven then it has to be him doesnt it shed gaped a suggestion shed follow your friend when he goes woodgathering raven returned to his seat he spoke to darling animatedly in sign which he blocked from sheds view the set of the girls shoulders said she was against whatever it was he was proposing ten minutes later he left the lily each afternoon he went out for a few hours shed suspected he was testing krages watchers darling leaned against the door frame watching the street shed watched her his gaze sliding up and down her frame ravens he thought theyre thick i dont dare but she was such a fine looking thing tall lean of leg ready for a man he was a fool he did not need to get caught in that trap too he had troubles enough i think today would be good for it raven said as shed delivered his breakfast eh good for what for a hike up the hill to watch friend asa oh no i cant got nobody to watch the place back by the counter darling bent to pick something off the floor sheds eyes widened and his heart fluttered he had to do something visit a whore or something or get hurt but he couldnt afford to pay for it darling couldnt handle it alone your cousin wally has stood in for you before caught off balance shed could not marshall his excuses quickly and darling was driving him to distraction she had to start wearing something that concealed the shape of her behind better uh he couldnt deal with darling doesnt know the signs ravens face darkened slightly give her the day off get that girl lisa you used when darling was sick lisa shed thought another hot one i only use lisa when im here to watch her a hot one not attached shell steal me blinder than my mother shed eh get wally and lisa here then go keep an eye on asa ill make sure they dont carry off the family silver but raven slapped a palm on the tabletop i said go the day was clear and bright and for winter warm shed picked up asas trail outside krages establishment asa rented a wagon shed was amazed in winter stablekeepers demanded huge deposits draft animals slaughtered and eaten had no provenance he thought it a miracle anyone trusted asa with a team asa went directly to the enclosure shed stalked along behind keeping his head down confident asa would not suspect him even if he looked back the streets were crowded asa left the wagon in a public grove across a lane running alongside the wall which girdled the enclosure it was one of many similar groves where junipers citizenry gathered for the spring and autumn rites for the dead the wagon could not be seen from the lane shed squatted in shadow and bush and watched asa dash to the enclosure wall somebody ought to clear that brush away shed thought it made the wall look tacky for that matter the wall needed repairing shed crossed and found a gap through which a man could duckwalk he crept through asa was crossing an open meadow hurrying uphill toward a stand of pines the inner face of the wall was brushmasked too scores of bundles of wood lay among the bushes asa had more industry than shed had suspected hanging around krages gang had changed him they had him scared for sure asa entered the pines shed puffed after him ahead asa sounded like a cow pushing through the underbrush the whole enclosure was tacky in sheds boyhood it had been parklike a fit waiting place for those who had gone before now it had the threadbare look that characterized the rest of juniper shed crept toward hammering racket what was asa doing making so much noise he was cutting wood from a fallen tree stacking the pieces in neat bundles shed could not picture the little man orderly either what a difference terror made an hour later shed was ready to give up he was cold and hungry and stiff he had wasted half a day asa was doing nothing remarkable but he persevered he had a time investment to recoup and an irritable raven awaiting his report asa worked hard when not chopping he hustled bundles down to his wagon shed was impressed he stayed watched and told himself he was a fool this was going nowhere then asa became furtive he collected his tools and concealed them looked around warily this is it shed thought asa took off uphill shed puffed after him his stiff muscles protested every step asa traveled more than a mile through lengthening shadows shed almost lost him a clinking brought him back to the track the little man was using flint and steel he crouched over a supply of torches wrapped in an oilskin taken from hiding he got a brand burning hastened into some brush a moment later he clambered over some rocks beyond disappeared shed gave it a minute then followed he slid round the boulder where he had seen asa last beyond lay a crack in the earth just big enough to admit a man my god shed whispered hes found a way into the catacombs hes looting the dead i came straight back shed gasped raven was amused by his distress i knew asa was foul but i never dreamed hed commit sacrilege raven smiled arent you disgusted no why are you he didnt steal any bodies shed came within a hairs breadth of assaulting him he was worse than asa he making out at it not as well as you the custodians take all the burial gifts except passage urns every corpse in the catacombs was accompanied by a small sealed urn usually fixed on a chain around the bodys neck the custodians did not touch the few coins in those when the day of passage came the boatmen would demand payment for passage to paradise all those souls stranded shed murmured he explained raven looked baffled how can anybody with an ounce of brains believe that crap dead is dead be quiet shed just answer questions how many bodies in the catacombs who knows theyve been putting them away since hell for a thousand years maybe theres millions must have them stacked like cordwood shed wondered about that the catacombs were vast but a thousand years worth of cadavers from a city junipers size would make a hell of a pile he looked at raven damn the man its asas racket lets not try why not too dangerous your friend hasnt suffered hes smalltime if he gets greedy hell get killed there are guardians down there monsters describe them i cant cant or wont cant all they tell you is that theyre there i see raven rose this needs investigating dont discuss it especially not with asa oh no panicked asa would do something stupid word drifted in off the street krage had sent his two best men after raven they had disappeared three more had vanished since krage himself had been injured by an unknown assailant he had survived only because of counts immense strength count wasnt expected to live shed was terrified krage was neither reasonable nor rational he asked raven to move out raven stared at him in contempt look i dont want him killing you here shed said bad for business for my health maybe hes got to kill you now people will stop being scared of him if he doesnt he wont learn eh a damned city of fools asa boiled through the doorway shed i got to talk to you he was scared krage thinks i turned him over to raven hes after me you got to hide me shed like hell the trap was closing two of them here krage would kill him for sure would dump his mother into the street shed i kept you in wood all winter i kept krage off your back oh sure so i should get killed too you owe me shed i never told nobody how you go out at night with raven maybe krage would want to know that huh shed grabbed asas hands and yanked him forward against the counter as if cued raven stepped up behind the little man shed glimpsed a knife raven pricked asas back whispered lets go to my room asa went pallid shed forced a smile yeah he released asa took a stoneware bottle from beneath the counter i want to talk to you asa he collected three mugs shed went up last intensely aware of his mothers blind stare how much had she heard how much had she guessed she had been cool lately his shame had come between them he no longer felt deserving of her respect he clouted his conscience i did it for her ravens room had the only door left on the upper floors raven held it for asa and shed sit he told asa indicating his cot asa sat he looked scared enough to wet himself ravens room was as spartan as his dress it betrayed no hint of wealth i invest it shed raven said wearing a mocking smile in shipping pour the wine he began cleaning his nails with a knife asa downed his wine before shed finished pouring the rest fill him up raven said he sipped his own wine shed why have you been giving me that sour cats piss when you had this nobody gets it without asking it costs more ill take this from now on raven locked gazes with asa tapped his own cheek with his knife blade no raven wouldnt have to live frugally the body business would be lucrative he invested in shipping odd the way he said that where the money went might be as interesting as whence it came you threatened my friend raven said oh excuse me shed a misstatement its partner not friend partners dont have to like each other little man you have something to say for yourself shed shuddered damn raven hed said that so asa would spread it around bastard was taking control of his life nibbling away at it like a mouse slowly destroying a head of cheese honest mr raven i didnt mean nothing i was scared krage thinks i tipped you i got to hide and sheds scared to put me up i was just trying to get him to shut up shed i thought he was your friend i just did him some favors i felt sorry for him youd shelter him from weather but not from enemies youre a real gutless wonder shed maybe i made a mistake i was going to make you a full partner going to give you the whole business eventually thought id do you a favor but youre a yellowdog creep without the guts to deny it he whirled talk little man tell me about krage tell me about the enclosure asa went white he didnt open up till raven threatened to call the custodians sheds knees racketed off one another the hilt of his butcher knife was sweatmoist and slippery he could not have used the blade but asa was too scared to see that he just squeaked at his team and started rolling raven followed them in his own wagon shed glanced across the valley the black castle brooded on the northern skyline casting its dread shadow across juniper why was it there where had it come from he rejected the questions best to ignore it how had he gotten into this he feared the worst raven had no sensibilities they left the wagons in the grove entered the enclosure raven examined asas wood stash move these bundles to the wagons stack them alongside for now you cant take my wood asa protested shut up raven pushed a bundle through the wall you first shed little man ill hunt you down if you run off they had moved a dozen bundles when asa whispered shed one of krages goons is watching us he was about to panic raven was not displeased with the news you two go get bundles from the woods asa protested raven glared asa headed uphill how does he know he whined at shed he never followed me im sure of that shed shrugged maybe hes a sorcerer he always knows what im thinking raven was gone when they returned shed looked around nervously decided lets get another load raven was waiting next trip take those bundles to asas wagon an object lesson shed said pointing into the wagon blood ran across the floorboards seeping from under a pile of wood see what kind of man he is up the hill now raven ordered when they returned lead off asa collect your tools and torches to start suspicion nagged shed as he watched raven build a litter but no even raven wouldnt stoop that low would he they stood looking down into the dark mouth of the underworld you first asa raven said reluctantly asa descended youre next shed have a heart raven get moving shed moved raven came down behind him the catacombs had a carnal smell but weaker than shed had anticipated a draft stirred asas torch stop raven said he took the brand examined the gap through which they had entered nodded passed the torch back lead on the cavern widened and joined a larger cave asa halted halfway across shed stopped too he was surrounded by bones bones on the cave floor bones on racks on the walls skeletons hanging from hooks loose bones in tumbles and piles all mixed together skeletons sleeping amidst the clutter bones still within shreds of burial raiment skulls leering from wooden pegs on the far wall empty eyes sinister in the torchlight a passage urn shared each peg there were mummified bodies too though only a few only the rich demanded mummification here riches meant nothing they were heaped with all the rest asa volunteered this is a real old place the custodians dont come here anymore unless maybe to get rid of loose bones the whole cave is filled up up that way like they just pushed them out of the way lets look raven said asa was right the cavern narrowed and its ceiling descended the passageway was choked with bones shed noted the absence of skulls and urns raven chuckled your custodians arent as passionate about the dead as you thought shedthe chambers you see during spring and autumn rites arent like this shed admitted i dont guess anybody cares about the old ones anymore asa said lets go back raven suggested as they walked he observed we all end up here rich or poor weak or strong he kicked a mummy but the rich stay in better shape asa whats down the other way i only ever went about a hundred yards more of the same he was trying to open a passage urn raven grunted took an um opened it dumped several coins onto his hand he held them near the torch uhm how did you explain their age asa money has no provenance shed said asa nodded and i made out like id found a buried treasure i see lead on soon asa said this is as far as i ever went keep going they wandered till even raven responded to the oppression of the cavern enough back to the surface once up top he said get the tools damn id hoped for better soon they were back with a spade and ropes shed dig a hole over there asa hang on to this end of the rope when i yell start pulling raven descended into the catacombs asa remained rooted as instructed shed dug after a while asa asked shed whats he doing you dont know i thought you knew everything he did i just told krage that i couldnt keep up with him all night shed grimaced turned another spadeful of earth he could guess how asa worked by sleeping somewhere most of the time spying would have interfered with woodgathering and graverobbing shed was relieved asa didnt know what he and raven had done but he would before long he looked inside himself and found little selfdisgust damn he was accustomed to these crimes already raven was making him over in his own image raven shouted asa hauled away he called shed give me a hand i cant get this by myself resigned shed joined him their catch was exactly what he expected a mummy sliding out of the darkness like some denizen of the deeps of yesteryear he averted his gaze get his feet asa asa gagged my god shed my god what are you doing be quiet and do what youre told thats the best way get his feet they moved the body into the brush near sheds pit a passage urn rolled out of a bundle tied upon its chest the bundle contained another two dozen urns so the hole was for burying empty urns why didnt raven fill his pockets down there lets get out of here shed asa whined back to your rope ums took time to empty and raven had two men up top with little to do but think so they were busywork and an incentive of course two dozen urns with each cadaver would build up quite a pile shed where you going to run to asa the day was clear and unseasonably warm but it was still winter there was no way out of juniper hed find you go back to your rope youre in it now like it or not shed resumed digging raven sent up six mummies each carried its bundle of urns then raven returned he studied asas ashen face sheds resignation your turn shed shed gulped opened his mouth swallowed his protest slunk toward the hole he lingered over it a hairs breadth from rebellion move it shed we dont have forever marron shed went down among the dead it seemed he was in the catacombs forever numbly selecting cadavers collecting urns dragging his grisly booty to the rope his mind had entered another reality this was the dream the nightmare at first he did not understand when raven called for him to come up he clambered into gathering dusk is that enough can we go now no raven replied weve got sixteen i figure we can get thirty on the wagons oh okay you haul up raven said asa and i will go down shed hauled in the silvery light of a threequarters moon the dead faces seemed accusing he swallowed his loathing and placed each with the others then emptied ums he was tempted to take the money and run he stayed more out of greed than fear of raven he was a partner this time thirty bodies at thirty leva meant nine hundred leva to share out even if he took the small cut he would be richer than hed ever dreamed what was that not ravens order to haul away it sounded like someone screaming he nearly ran he did go to pieces momentarily ravens bellowing brought him together the mans cold calm contempt had vanished shed heaved this one was heavy he grunted strained raven came scrambling up his clothing was torn a bloody gash marked one cheek his knife was red he whirled grabbed the rope pull he shouted damn you pull asa came out a moment later tied to the rope what happened my god what happened asa was breathing and that was about it something jumped us it tore him up before i could kill it a guardian i warned you get another torch lets see how bad he is raven just sat there panting flustered shed got the torch lighted it asas wounds were not as bad as he had feared there was a lot of blood and asa was in shock but he wasnt dying we ought to get out of here raven before the custodians come raven recovered his composure no there was only one i killed it were in this now lets get it done right what about asa i dont know lets get to work raven im exhausted youre going to get a lot tireder before were done come on lets get the mess cleaned up they moved the bodies to the wagons then the tools then carted asa down as they worked the litter through the wall shed asked what should we do with him raven looked at him as though he were a moron what do you think shed but it doesnt much matter now does it i guess not but it did matter asa wasnt much but shed knew him he was no friend but they had helped one another out no cant do it raven he can make it if i was sure he was checking out yeah okay no body no questions but i cant kill him well a little spirit after all how are you going to keep him quiet hes the kind who gets throats cut with loose talk ill handle him whatever you say partner its your neck the night was well along when they reached the black castle raven went in first shed followed closely they pulled into the same passage as before the drill was the same after they laid out the bodies a tall lean creature went down the line ten ten thirty ten ten and so forth raven protested vigorously the only offers above ten were for the men who had followed them to the enclosure and for asa who remained in his wagon the tall being faced raven these have been dead too long they have little value take them back if youre not satisfied all right all right lets have it the being counted out coins raven pocketed six of each ten he handed the rest to shed as he did so he told the tall being this man is my partner he may come alone the tall figure inclined its head took something from within its clothing handed it to shed it was a silver pendant in the form of serpents entwined wear that if you come up alone raven said thats your safeconduct under his icy stare shed slipped the pendant into a pocket already filled with silver he ran the arithmetic one hundred twelve leva as his share it would have taken him half a decade to accumulate that much honestly he was rich damn him he was rich he could do anything he wanted no more debts no more krage killing him slowly no more gruel every meal turn the lily into something decent maybe find a place where his mother would have proper care women all the women he could handle as he turned his wagon he glimpsed a high chunk of wall that hadnt been there last visit a face stared out it was the face of the man he and raven had brought in alive its eyes watched him chapter fourteen juniper duretile whisper delivered us to a brokendown castle named duretile it overlooks juniper in general and the enclosure in specific for a week we had no contact with our hosts we had no language in common then we were graced with the presence of a thug named bullock who spoke the languages of the jewel cities bullock was some kind of enforcer for the local religion which i could not figure out at all it looks like a death cult at first look again and you find death or the dead not worshipped but revered with bodies fanatically preserved against some millennial revival the whole character of juniper is shaped by this except for the buskin where life has so many concerns more vital than the welfare of the dead i took an instant dislike to bullock he struck me as violenceprone and sadistic a policeman who would solve his cases with a truncheon he would survive when the lady annexed juniper her military governors have a need for his ilk i expected annexation to occur within days of the captains arrival wed have it scoped out before he got here one word from charm would do it i saw no indication the dukes people could stop it as soon as feather and whisper had all our people in including translators bullock the duke himself and a man named hargadon who was senior custodian of the dead meaning he ran the catacombs where bodies were stored they led us into the bitter cold atop duretiles north wall the duke extended an arm that fortress over there is why i asked for help i looked at it and shuddered there was something creepy about the place we call it the black castle he said its been there for centuries and then he gave us a chunk almost too big to swallow it started out as a little black rock lying beside a dead man the man who found them tried to pick the rock up he died and the rock started growing its been growing ever since our ancestors experimented on it they attacked it nothing harmed it anybody who touched it died for the sake of their sanity they decided to ignore it i shaded my eyes stared at the castle not that unusual from duretile except it was black and gave me the creeps the duke continued for centuries it hardly grew its only a few generations since it stopped looking like a rock he got a haunted look they say there are things living inside there i smiled what did he expect a fortress exists to surround something whether built or grown hargadon assumed the narrative he had been in his job too long hed developed an officials pompous style for the last several years its grown damned fast the custodial office became concerned when we heard rumors out of the buskin so unreliable to be suresaying the creatures inside were buying cadavers the accuracy of those rumors remains a source of heated debate within the office however no one can deny that were not getting enough corpses out of the buskin these days our street patrols collect fewer than they did ten years ago times are leaner now the street poor are more numerous more should be expiring of exposure a real sweetheart this hargadon he sounded like a manufacturer whining because his profit margin was down he continued its been hypothesized that the castle may soon be beyond a need to purchase bodiesif it is at all im not convinced came down squarely on both sides of a question too thats my boy its occupants may become numerous enough to come take what they want elmo asked you think people are selling bodies why dont you grab them and make them talk time for the policeman to enter his bit bullock said we cant catch them he had a butiftheydletmedoitmyway tone its happening down in the buskin you see its another world down there you dont find out much if youre an outsider whisper and feather stood a bit apart examining the black castle their faces were grim the duke wanted something for nothing in essence he wanted to stop worrying about that fortress he said we could do whatever it took to eliminate his worry only wed have to do it his way like he wanted us to stay inside duretile while his men and hargadons acted as our eyes ears and hands he was afraid of repercussions our presence could cause if known a few rebel fugitives had come to juniper after their defeat at charm the lady was known here though little considered the duke feared the refugees would incite trouble if he was suspected of collaborating in some ways he was an ideal overlord all he wanted from his people was to be left alone he was willing to grant the same favor so for a while we stayed tucked awaytill whisper became irritated by the quality of information we were given it was filtered sanitized it was useless she cornered the duke and told him her men would be going out with his he actually stood up to her for a few minutes the battle was bitter she threatened to pull out leaving him twisting in the wind pure bluff she and feather were intensely interested in the black castle armed force could not have levered them out of juniper the duke subdued she turned on the custodians bullock was stubbornly jealous of his prerogatives i do not know how she brought him around he never was gracious about it i became his companion on investigative jaunts mainly because i learned the language quickly nobody down below paid me any mind him they did he was a walking terror people crossed the street to avoid him i guess he had a bad reputation then came news which miraculously cleared the obstacles the duke and custodians had dumped in our path you hear elmo asked somebody broke into their precious catacombs bullock is smoking his boss is having a shit hemorrhage i tried to digest that could not more detail if you please elmo tends to abbreviate during the winter they let poor people get away with sneaking into the enclosure to collect deadwood for firewood somebody got in who decided to take more found a way into the catacombs three or four men i still dont get the whole picture elmo he enjoys being coaxed all right all right they got inside and stole all the passage urns they could lay hands on took them out emptied them and buried them in a pit they also lifted a bunch of oldtime mummies i never seen such moaning and carrying on you better back off your scheme for getting into the catacombs i had mentioned a desire to see what went on down there the whole setup was so alien i wanted a closer look preferably unchaperoned think theyd get overwrought eh overwrought isnt the half bullock is talking bad id hate to be those guys and get caught by him yeah id better check this out bullock was in duretile at the time coordinating his work with that of the dukes incompetent secret police those guys were a joke they were practically celebrities and not a one had the guts to go down into the buskin where really interesting things happened there is a buskin in every city though the name varies it is a slum so bad the police dare go in only in force law there is haphazard at best mostly enforced by selfproclaimed magistrates supported by toughs they recruit themselves it is a very subjective justice they mete likely to be swift savage unforgiving and directed by graft i caught up with bullock told him till this latest business is cleaned up i stick like your leg he scowled his heavy cheeks reddened orders i lied faking an apologetic tone yeah all right come on where you headed the buskin thing like this had to come out of the buskin im going to track it down he had guts for all his other failings nothing intimidated him i wanted to see the buskin he might be the best guide available id heard he went there often without interference his reputation was that nasty a good shadow to walk in now i asked now he led me out into the cold and down the hill he did not ride one of his little affectations he never rode he set a brisk pace as a man will who is accustomed to getting things done afoot whatre we going to look for i asked old coins the chamber they defiled goes back several centuries if somebody spent a lot of old money in the last couple days we might get a line on our men i frowned i dont know spending patterns here places ive been though people can hang on to a family horde for ages then have one black sheep up and spend it all a few old coins might not mean anything were looking for a flood not a few for a man who spent a fistful there were three or four men involved odds are good one of them is a fool bullock had a good grasp of the stupid side of human nature maybe because he was close to it himself well be real nice doing the tracing he told me as though he expected me to hammer people in outrage his values were the only ones he could imagine the man we want will run when he hears me asking questions we chase him just enough so he keeps moving maybe hell lead us somewhere i know several bosses down there who couldve engineered this if one of them did i want his balls on a platter he spoke in a fever like a crusader did he have some special grievance against the crime lords of the slum i asked yeah i came out of the buskin a tough kid who got lucky and got on with the custodians my dad wasnt lucky tried to buck a protection gang he paid and they didnt protect him from another gang in the same racket he said he wasnt going to put out good money for something he wasnt getting they cut his throat i was one of the custodians who picked him up they stood around laughing and cracking jokes the ones responsible ever settle them up i asked certain of the answer yeah brought them into the catacombs too he glanced at the black castle half obscured by mists drifting across the far slope if id heard the rumors about that place maybe id have no i wouldnt i didnt think so myself bullock was a fanatic of sorts hed never break the rules of the profession that had brought him out of the buskin unless he could advance its cause by so doing think well start right at the waterfront he told me work our way up the hill tavern to tavern whorehouse to whorehouse maybe hint that theres a reward floating around he ground one fist into another a man restraining anger there was a lot of that bottled up inside him someday he would blow up good wed gotten an early start i saw more taverns cathouses and reeking dives than id passed through in a dozen years and in every one bullocks advent engendered a sudden frightened hush and a promise of dutiful cooperation but promises were all we got we could find no trace of any old money except a few coins that had been around too long to be the booty we sought bullock was not discouraged something will turn up he said times are tough just take a little patience he looked thoughtful might just put some of your boys down here they arent known and they look tough enough to make it they are i smiled mentally assembling a team including elmo goblin pawnbroker kingpin and a few others be great if raven were still with the company and could go in with them they would be running the buskin inside six months which gave me an idea to take up with whisper if we wanted to know what was happening we should take charge of the buskin we could bring in oneeye the little wizard was a gangster born stand out some though i hadnt seen another black face since wed crossed the sea of torments had an idea bullock asked about to enter a place called the iron lily you look like your brain is smoking maybe on something down the line if it gets tougher than we expect the iron lily looked like every other place wed been only more so the guy who ran it cringed he didnt know nothing hadnt heard nothing and promised to scream for bullock if anybody so much as spent a single gersh struck before the accession of the present duke every word bullshit i was glad to get out of there i was afraid the place would collapse on me before he finished kissing bullocks ass got an idea bullock said moneylenders took me a second to catch it and to see where the idea had come from the guy in the tavern whining about his debts good thinking a man in the snares of a moneylender would do anything to wriggle away this is krages territory hes one of the nastiest lets drop in no fear in the man his confidence in the power of his office was so strong he dared walk into a den of cutthroats without blinking an eye i faked it good but i was scared the villain had his own army and it was jumpy we found out why in a moment our man had come up on the short end of somebody in the last couple days he was down on his back mummified in bandages bullock chuckled customers getting frisky krage or did one of your boys try to promote himself krage eyed us from a face of stone i help you with something inquisitor probably not youd lie to me if the truth would save your soul you bloodsucker flattery will get you nowhere what do you want you parasite tough boy this krage struck from the same mold as bullock but he had drifted into a socially less honored profession not much to choose between them i thought priest and moneylender and that was what krage was saying cute im looking for a guy no shit hes got a lot of old money cajian period coinage am i supposed to know him bullock shrugged maybe he owes somebody moneys got no provenance down here bullock bullock told me a proverb of the buskin he faced krage this money does this money better lets say this is a big one krage not a little letslookaroundandmakeashow not some bumpandrun were going the route anybody covers on it they go down with this boy you remember bullock said it for a second bullock made an impression the message got through then krage blankfaced us again youre sniffing up the wrong tree inquisitor just telling you so youd know what did this guy do hit somebody who dont take hitting krages eyebrows rose he looked puzzled he could think of no one who fit that description who uhnuh just dont let your boys take any old money without you checking the source and getting back to me hear said your piece inquisitor yeah shouldnt you better be going then we went i didnt know the rules of the game so didnt know how the locals would score the exchange i rated it too close to call outside i asked would he have told us if hed been paid in old coin no not until he looked into it at least but he hasnt seen any old money i wondered why he thought that i didnt ask these were his people he might know something thought i saw a glint in his eye a couple times maybe maybe not let him stew maybe if youd told him why no that doesnt get out not even a rumor if people thought we couldnt protect their dead or them after they kick off all hell would break loose he made a downward gesture with one hand juniper like that crunch we walked on he muttered all hell would break loose and after another halfblock thats why weve got to get these guys not so much to punish them to shut them up i see we strolled back the direction we had come planning to resume tavernhopping and to see a moneylender named gilbert when we reached his territory hey bullock stopped what i shook my head nothing thought i saw a ghost guy down the street walked like somebody i used to know maybe it was nah long ago and far away long dead now just because i was thinking about him a little bit ago i figure we got time for half a dozen more visits then we head uphill dont want to hang around here after dark i looked at him one eyebrow raised hell man it gets dangerous down here when the sun goes down he chuckled and gave me one of his rare smiles it was the genuine article for one moment then i liked him chapter fifteen juniper death of a gangster shed had long violent arguments with his mother she never accused him directly but she left little doubt she suspected him of hideous crimes he and raven took turns nursing asa then it was time to face krage he did not want to go he was afraid krage might have lumped him with raven and asa but if he didnt go krage would come to him and krage was looking for people to hurt shaky shed trudged up the frozen street snow fell in lazy fat flakes one of krages men ushered him into the presence there was no sign of count but word was out that the big man was recovering too damned stupid to die shed thought ah shed krage said from the deeps of a huge chair how are you cold howre you keeping krage worried him when he was affable be all right krage plucked at his bandages close call i was lucky come to make your payment how much do i owe all told you buying up my debts i couldnt keep track you can pay out krages eyes narrowed i dont know i have ten leva krage sighed dramatically you got enough didnt think you had it in you shed well you win some and you lose some its eight and some change shed counted out nine coins krage made change youve had a run of luck this winter shed sure have you seen asa krages voice tautened not since three days ago why nothing important were even shed but its time i collected that favor raven i want him krage i dont want to tell you your business but thats one man youd better leave alone hes crazy hes nasty and hes tough hed as soon kill you as say hi i dont mean no disrespect but he acts like youre a big joke the joke will be on him shed krage dragged himself out of his chair wincing he grabbed his wound the joke will be on him maybe next time he wont let you get away krage fear crossed krages features shed its him or me if i dont kill him my business will fall apart where will it be if he kills you again that flicker of fear i dont have any choice be ready when i need you shed soon now shed bobbed his head and retreated he ought to get out of the buskin he thought he could afford it but where would he go krage could find him anywhere in juniper running didnt appeal anyway the lily was home he had to weather this one or the other would die and either way he would be off the hook he was in the middle now he hated krage krage had humiliated him for years keeping him in debt stealing food from his mouth with ridiculous interest rates on the other hand raven could connect him with the black castle and crimes in the enclosure the custodians were on the hunt looking for somebody spending a lot of old money little had been said publicly but bullock being on the case told shed just how seriously they were taking the case up the hill hed nearly had a stroke when bullock walked into the lily what had become of the passage money shed hadnt seen any of it he supposed raven still had it he and raven were partners now what did krage say raven asked when shed reached the lily wants me to help kill you i thought so shed its late in the season its time to send krage up the hill which way are you leaning partner him or me i uh in the long run youre better off getting rid of krage hed find a way to get the lily eventually true shed reflected all right what do we do tomorrow go tell him you think ive been selling bodies that you think asa was my partner that you think i did asa in asa was your friend and youre upset itll all be just near enough reality to confuse him whats the matter always a trap raven was right krage would believe the story but shed had hoped for a less direct role if raven screwed up marron shed would be found in a gutter with his throat cut nothing all right night after tomorrow night ill go out you run to tell krage ill let his men track me krage will want to be in at the kill ill ambush him you did that before didnt you hell come anyway hes stupid shed swallowed that isnt a plan that does much for my nerves your nerves arent my problem shed theyre yours you lost them only you can find them again krage bought sheds story he was ecstatic because raven was such a villain if i didnt want him myself id yell for the custodians you did good shed i should have suspected asa he never brought no news worth hearing shed whined who would buy bodies krage krage grinned dont worry your ugly head let me know next time he goes on one of his jaunts well rig up a little surprise next night shed reported according to plan and suffered all the disappointment he expected of life krage insisted he join the hunt what good would i be krage im not even armed and hes one tough nut you wont take him without a fight i dont expect to youre coming along just in case in case in case theres a trap in this and i want to lay hands on you fast shed shuddered whined i done right by you dont i always do right by you you always do what a coward would which is why i dont trust you anybody can scare you and you had all that money it occurs to me you might be in the racket with raven shed went cold krage donned his coat lets go shed stay right beside me you try to wander off ill kill you shed started shaking he was dead all he had gone through to get krage off his back it wasnt fair it just wasnt fair nothing ever worked for him he stumbled into the street wondering what he could do and knowing there was no escape tears froze on his cheeks no exit if he fled krage would be warned if he did not krage would kill him when raven sprang his ambush what was his mother going to do he had to do something had to find some guts make a decision act he couldnt surrender to fate and hope for luck that meant the catacombs or black castle before dawn he had lied to krage he had a butcher knife up his left sleeve he had put it there out of sheer bravado krage hadnt searched him old shed armed ha not likely he might get himself hurt old shed did go armed sometimes but he never advertised the fact the knife did wonders for his confidence he could tell himself he would use it and hed believe the lie long enough to get by but in any tight spot he would let fate run its course his fate was sealed unless he whipped it headsup no holds barred how krages men were amused by his terror there were six of them then there were seven and eight as those tracking raven reported in could he hope to beat those odds raven himself didnt stand a chance you are a dead man a tiny voice whispered over and over dead man dead man hes working his way down chandlers a shadow reported going into all the little alleyways krage asked shed think hell find anything this late in the winter the weaklings have all died shed shrugged i wouldnt know he rubbed his left arm against his side the knifes presence helped but not much his terror peaked and began to recede his mind cooled to an unemotional numbness fear in abeyance he tried to find the unseen exit again someone loomed out of the darkness reported they were a hundred feet from ravens wagon raven had gone into an alley ten minutes ago he hadnt come out he spot you krage growled i dont think so but you never know krage eyed shed shed would he abandon his team and wagon how would i know shed squeaked maybe he found something lets take a look they moved to the alley one of countless deadend breezeways opening off chandlers lane krage stared into the darkness head canted slightly quiet as the catacombs check it out luke boss take it easy luke old shed is going to be right behind you wont you shed krage move out shed shambled forward luke advanced cautiously wicked knife probing the darkness shed tried to talk to him shut up he snarled dont you have a weapon no shed lied he glanced back it was just the two of them they reached the dead end no raven ill be damned luke said how did he get out i dont know lets find out this might be his chance here we go luke said he climbed this downspout sheds guts knotted his throat tightened give it a try maybe we can follow him yeah luke started up shed didnt think about it the butcher knife materialized in his hand his hand slammed forward luke arched back dropped shed jumped on him jammed a palm against his mouth held on for the minute it took him to die he backed away unable to believe hed done it whats going on back there krage demanded cant find anything shed yelled he dragged luke against a wall buried him under trash and snow ran to the downspout krages approach made a marvelous incentive he grunted strained popped a muscle reached the roof it consisted of a skirt two feet wide set at a shallow angle then twelve feet rising at fortyfive degrees above which the roof was flat shed leaned against the steep slate panting still unable to believe that he had killed a man he heard voices below began moving sideways someone snarled theyre gone krage no raven no luke and no shed either that bastard i knew he was setting me up why did luke go with him then hell i dont know dont stand there look around they got out of here somehow hey over here somebody went up this spout maybe theyre after raven climb the damned thing find out luke shed over here a voice called shed froze what the hell raven had to be raven he inched along trying to fake himself into believing there wasnt thirtyfive feet of nothing behind his heels he reached a ridged corner where he could clamber up to the flat top over here i think we got him cornered get up there you bastards krage raged lying motionless on the cold icy tar shed watched two shadows appear on the skirt and begin easing toward the voice a squeal of metal and vicious cursing proclaimed the fate of a third climber twisted my ankle krage the man complained come on krage growled well find another way up run while you got the chance shed thought go home and hole up till its over but he could not he slid down to the skirt and crept after krages men someone cried out scrabbled for a hold plunged into the darkness between buildings krage shouted nobody answered shed crossed to the roof next door it was flat and forested with chimneys raven he called softly its me shed he touched the knife in his sleeve still unable to believe that hed used it a shape materialized shed settled into a sitting position arms around his knees what now he asked whatre you doing here krage dragged me along i was supposed to be the first one dead if it was a trap he told raven what he had done damn youve got guts after all he backed me into a corner what now the odds are getting better let me think about it krage shouted out in chandlers lane raven yelled back over here were right behind him he told shed i dont know how long i can fool him i was going to pick them off one at a time i didnt know hed bring an army my nerves are shot shed said heights were another of the thousand things that terrified him hang on its a long way from over raven yelled cut him off why dont you he took off come on shed shed could not keep up he wasnt as nimble as raven a shape loomed out of the darkness he squeaked that you shed it was one of krages men sheds heartbeat doubled yeah you seen raven no wheres luke damnit he was headed right at you how could you miss him look here shed indicated disturbances in traces of snow look man i didnt see him dont come on at me like you was krage ill kick your ass up around your ears all right all right calm down im scared and i want to get it over luke fell off back there slipped on some ice or something be careful i heard sounded like milt though id have sworn it was milt this is stupid he can pick us off up here we ought to back off and try something else uhnuh i want him now i dont want him tracking me down tomorrow shed was amazed how easily the lies came silently he cursed the man because he wouldnt turn his back you got an extra knife or something you use a knife come on stick with me shed ill look out for you sure look the trail goes that way lets get it done the man turned to examine ravens tracks shed drew his knife and hit him hard the man let out a yell twisted the knife broke shed almost pitched off the roof his victim did people shouted questions krage and his men all seemed to be on the rooftops now when shed stopped shaking he started moving again trying to recall the layout of the neighborhood he wanted to get down and head home raven could finish this insanity shed ran into krage on the next roof krage he whined god let me out of here hell kill us all ill kill you shed it was a trap wasnt it krage no what could he do he didnt have the butcher knife now fake whine and fake krage you got to get out of here he already got luke and milt and somebody else he wouldve gotten me when he got luke except he fell down and i got awayonly he caught up again when i was talking to one of your guys right over there they got fighting and one of them went off the edge i dont know which but i bet it wasnt raven we got to get down from here on account of we cant tell who were running into so we got to be careful i could have had him this last time only i didnt have a weapon and we didnt know it wasnt one of our own guys coming raven dont have that problem anybody he sees he knows is an enemy so he dont have to be so careful shut up shed krage was buying it shed talked a little louder hoping raven would hear come and finish it there was a cry across the rooftops thats teskus krage growled thats four right shed bobbed his head that we know about maybe theres only you and me now krage we should get out of here before he finds us might be something to what you say shed might be we shouldnt have come up here come on shed followed keeping up the chatter it was lukes idea he thought hed make points with you see we saw him at the top of this drainspout and he didnt see us so luke said why dont we go after him and get him and old krage will shut up shed for gods sake shut up your voice sickens me yes sir mr krage only i cant im so scared if you dont ill shut you up permanent you wont have to worry about raven shed stopped talking he had pushed as far as he dared krage halted a short time later well set an ambush near his wagon hell come back for it wont he i expect so mr krage but what good will i be i mean i dont have a weapon and wouldnt know how to use one if i did shut up youre right youre not much good shed but i think youll do fine as a distraction you get his attention talk to him ill hit him from behind krage shut up krage rolled over the side of the building clung to the parapet while getting a solid foothold shed leaned forward three storeys to the ground he kicked krages fingers krage cursed scrabbled for a fresh hold missed dropped yelled hit with a muted thump shed watched his vague shape twitch become still i did it again he started shaking cant stay here his men might find me he swung over the parapet and monkeyed down the side of the building more afraid of being caught than of falling krage was still breathing in fact he was conscious but paralyzed you were right krage it was a trap you shouldnt have pushed me you made me hate you more than i was scared of you he looked around it wasnt as late as he had thought the rooftop hunt hadnt lasted long where was raven anyway somebody had to clean up he grabbed krage dragged him toward ravens wagon krage squealed for a moment shed was afraid someone would investigate no one did this was the buskin krage screamed when shed hoisted him into the wagon comfy krage he retrieved luke next then went seeking other bodies he found another three none were raven he muttered if he doesnt show in a half hour ill take them up myself and the hell with him then whats come over you marron shed letting this go to your head so you found some guts so what that dont make you no raven someone was coming he snatched a booty dagger faded into a shadow raven tumbled a body into the wagon how the hell i collected them shed explained who are they krage and his men i thought he ran for it figured i had to go through it all again what happened shed explained raven shook his head in disbelief you shed i guess theres only so much they can scare you true but i never thought youd figure it out shed you amaze me disappoint me too some i wanted krage myself thats him making the noise hes got a broken back or something kill him if you want hes worth more alive shed nodded poor krage where are the rest of them theres one on the roof guess the other one got away damn that means its not over we can get him later meanwhile he goes and gets the others and we have them all after us you think theyd risk their lives to avenge krage no way theyll be fighting among themselves trying to take over wait here ill get the other one hurry up shed said the reaction was catching up he had survived the old shed was coming back dragging all his hysteria with him coming down from the castle with pink and purple strands of dawn smearing the gaps between the wolanders shed asked why is he screaming the tall being had laughed and paid a hundred twenty leva for krage his shrieks could still be heard i dont know dont look back shed do what you have to and move on and a moment later im glad its over over what do you mean that was my last visit raven patted his pocket i have enough me too im out of debt i can refurbish the lily set my mother up in her own place and have plenty to make it next winter no matter what business is like im going to forget that castle exists i dont think so shed you want to get away from it better come with me itll always be calling when you want some fast money i couldnt leave i have to look out for my mother ah right i warned you then raven asked what about asa hes going to be a problem the custodians are going to keep looking till they find the people who raided the catacombs hes the weak link i can handle asa i hope so shed i hope so krages disappearance was the talk of the buskin shed played a baffled role claiming he knew nothing despite rumors to the contrary his story held up he was shed the coward the one man who knew differently did not contradict him the hard part was facing his mother old june said nothing but her blind stare was accusing she made him feel evil an infidel and disowned in the secret reaches of her mind the gap had become unbridgable chapter sixteen juniper nasty surprise bullock looked me up next time he wanted to go downhill maybe he just wanted company he had no local friends whats up i asked when he barged into my tiny office cum dispensary get your coat buskin time again his eagerness excited me for no reason other than that i was bored with duretile i pitied my comrades they hadnt yet had a chance to get out the place was a drudge so away we went and going down the hill past the enclosure i asked why all the excitement he replied not really excitement not even anything to do with us probably remember that sweetheart of a moneylender in the bandages yeah krage hes vanished him and half of his boys seems he took a crack at the guy who cut him and hasnt been seen since i frowned that did not seem remarkable gangsters are always disappearing then popping up again over there bullock pointed to some brush along the enclosure wall thats where our men got inside he indicated a stand of trees across the way parked their wagons there weve got a witness who saw those filled with wood he says come on ill show you he pushed into the brush dropped to hands and knees i followed grumbling because i was getting wet the north wind did nothing to improve matters the interior of the enclosure was seedier than its exterior bullock showed me several dozen bundles of wood found in the brush near the breach looks like they were moving a lot i figure they needed a lot to cover the bodies cut it up there he indicated trees above us back toward duretile the castle stood limned against streamers of cloud a grey stone rockpile one earth tremor short of collapse i examined the bundles bullocks associates had dragged them out and stacked them which may not have been smart detective work looked to me like they had been cut and bundled over a period of weeks some ends were more weathered than others i mentioned that to bullock i noticed way i figure somebody was getting wood regular they found the catacombs by accident thats when they got greedy uhm i considered the woodpile figure they were selling it no that we know nobody has been selling enclosure wood probably a family or a group of neighbors using the wood themselves you check on wagon rentals how stupid do you think people are rent a wagon for a raid on the catacombs i shrugged were counting on one of them being stupid arent we he admitted youre right it should be checked but its hard when im the only one who has guts enough to do legwork in the buskin im hoping we get lucky somewhere else if i have to ill cover it when theres nothing more pressing i see the place where they got in i asked he wanted to tell me no instead he said its a fair hike use up an hour id rather go sniff around this krage thing while its hot i shrugged some other time then we got down into krages territory and started rambling bullock still had a few contacts left from his boyhood coaxed properly with a few gersh they would talk i was not allowed to sit in i spent the time sipping beer in a tavern where they alternately fawned over my money and acted like i had the plague when asked i did not deny being an inquisitor bullock joined me maybe we dont have anything after all theres all kinds of rumors one says his own men did him in one says it was his competition hes a little pushy with his neighbors he accepted a mug of wine on the house something i hadnt seen him do before i put it down to preoccupation theres one angle we can check he was obsessed about getting some foreigner who made a fool of him in public theres some say the same foreigner was the man who cut him up he took out a list and began to peruse it not going to be a lot there for us i expect the night krage disappeared there was a lot of whoop and holler not a single eyewitness of course he grinned earwitnesses say it was a running battle that makes me favor the palace revolution theory what have you got there a list of people who were maybe getting wood out of the enclosure some might have seen each other i was thinking i might find something interesting if i compared their stories he waved for more wine this time he paid and covered the first mug too though the house would have forgiven him payment i got the impression junipers people were used to giving custodians anything they wanted bullock simply had a sense of ethics at least where the people of the buskin were concerned he would not make their lives harder than they already were i could not help liking him on some levels youre not going to pursue the krage thing then oh yeah of course the bodies are missing but thats not unusual probably turn up across the river in a couple days if theyre dead or screaming for blood if theyre not he tapped a name on his list this guy hangs around the same place maybe ill talk to this guy raven while im there i felt the blood drain from my face who he looked at me strangely i forced myself to relax to look casual his eyebrows dropped guy named raven the foreigner who was supposed to be feuding with krage hangs out the same place as this one guy on my woodgatherers list maybe ill ask him a few questions raven unusual name what do you know about him just that hes a foreigner and supposed to be bad news been around a couple years typical drifter hangs out with the crater crowd the crater crowd were the rebel refugees who had established themselves in juniper do me a favor its a long shot but this guy could be the ghost i was talking about the other day stand off a ways pretend you never heard the name but get me a physical description and find out if hes got anybody with him bullock frowned he didnt like it is it important i dont know it could be all right keep the whole thing under your hat if you can this guy means something to you eh if hes the guy i knew that i thought was dead yeah him and me got business he smiled personal i nodded i was feeling my way now this was touchy if this was my raven i had to go careful i didnt dare let him get caught in the coils of our operation he knew too damned much he could get half the company officers and noncoms put to the question and made dead i decided bullock would respond best if i kept it mysterious with raven an old enemy by implication somebody i would do most anything to jump in the dark but not somebody important in any other way i got you he said he looked at me somewhat differently as though glad to discover i wasnt different after all hell im not but i like to pretend i am most of the time i told him im going back to duretile got to talk to a couple buddies can you find your way i can let me know what you find out will do we separated i went up the hill as fast as fortyyearold legs would carry me i got elmo and goblin off where nobody could overhear us we maybe got a problem friends like what goblin wanted to know he had been aching for me to talk from the minute i rounded him up i guess i looked a little ragged around the fringes theres a guy named raven operating down in the buskin the other day when i was down there with bullock i thought i saw a guy who looked like our raven from a distance but i shrugged it off then they quick got as nervous as me you sure its him elmo asked no not yet i got the hell out of there the minute i heard the name raven let bullock think hes an old enemy i want to stick a knife in hes going to ask around for me while hes doing his own business get me a description see if darling is with him im probably off in the wild blue yonder but i wanted you guys to know in case what if it is him elmo said what do we do then i dont know it could be big trouble if whisper had some reason to get interested like because he hangs around with the rebel refugees here well you know goblin mused seems silent said raven was going to run so far nobody would ever find him again so maybe he thought hed run far enough this is damned near the end of the world which in part was why i was so nervous this was the kind of place i could picture raven having gone to ground as far from the lady as you could get without learning to walk on water seems to me elmo said we ought to make sure before we panic then decide what to do this might be the time to put our guys into the buskin thats what i was thinking i already got a plan in front of whisper for something else lets tell her were going with that and have the guys watch for raven who elmo asked raven would recognize anybody who knows him not true use guys who joined up at charm send pawnbroker just to make sure hes not likely to remember the new guys there were so many of them if you want somebody reliable to run the thing and back them up use goblin park him where he can stay out of sight but keep his hands on the reins what do you think goblin he asked goblin smiled nervously give me something to do anyway im going out of my skull up here these people are weird elmo chuckled missing oneeye almost all right i said youll need a guide thatll have to be me i dont want bullock getting his nose any deeper into this but they think im one of his men down there youll have to follow me from a distance and try not to look like what you are dont make it hard on yourselves elmo stretched ill get kingpin and pawnbroker now you take them down and show them a place one can come back for the others go ahead and scope it out with goblin he left and so it went goblin and the six soldiers took rooms not far from the moneylender krages headquarters up on the hill i pretended it was all for the cause i waited chapter seventeen juniper travel plans shed caught asa trying to sneak out what the hell is this i need to get out shed im going crazy up there yeah you want to know something asa the inquisitors are looking for you bullock himself was in here the other day and he asked for you by name shed was stretching the facts slightly bullocks interest had not been intense but it had to have something to do with the catacombs bullock and his sidekick were in the buskin almost every day asking asking asking questions he didnt need asa meeting bullock facetoface asa would either panic or crumble under questioning either way marron shed would get into the heat damned fast asa if they catch you were all dead why you were spending those old coins theyre looking for somebody with a lot of old money damn that raven what he gave me the passage money as my share im rich and now you tell me i cant spend it without getting grabbed he probably figured youd hold off till the excitement died down hed be gone by then gone hes leaving as soon as the harbor opens wheres he headed south somewhere he wont talk about it so what do i do keep scrambling for a living damn it shed thats not fair look on the bright side asa nobody wants to kill you anymore so now bullock is after me maybe i could have made a deal with krage bullock dont deal it aint fair all my life shed did not listen he sang the same song all too often what can i do shed i dont know stay holed up i guess he had a glimmer of a notion how about you get out of juniper for a while yeah you might have something that money would spend just fine somewhere else wouldnt it i dont know ive never traveled get raven up here when he shows up asa hey shed come on it wont hurt to ask all he can do is say no whatever you want asa i hate to see you go sure you do shed sure you do as shed ducked out the doorway asa called wait a second yeah uh its kind of hard i never did thank you thank me for what you saved my life you brought me back didnt you shed shrugged nodded no big thing asa sure it is shed and ill remember it i owe you the big one shed went downstairs before he could be embarrassed further he discovered that raven had returned the man was in one of his animated discussions with darling arguing again they had to be lovers damn it all he waited till raven noticed him watching asa wants to see you i think he wants to go with you when you leave raven chuckled that would solve your problem wouldnt it shed did not deny that he would be more comfortable with asa out of juniper what do you think not a bad idea actually asa isnt much but i need men i have a hold on him and him being gone would help cover my backtrail take him with my blessing raven started upstairs shed said wait he didnt know how to approach this because he didnt know if it was important but hed better tell raven bullocks been hanging around the buskin a lot lately him and a sidekick so so maybe hes closer than we think for one thing he was in here looking for asa for another hes been asking about you ravens face went empty about me how so on the quiet my cousin wallys wife sal her brother is married to one of bullocks cousins anyway bullock still knows people down here from when before he got on the custodians he helps them out sometimes so some of them tell him things he wants to know i get the picture get to the point bullock was asking about you who you are where you come from who your friends arethings like that why shed could only shrug all right thanks ill check it out chapter eighteen juniper blowing smoke goblin stood across the street leaning against a building staring intently i frowned angrily what the hell was he doing on the street bullock might recognize him and realize we were playing games obviously he wanted to tell me something bullock was about to enter another of countless dives i told him got to see a man about a horse in the alley yeah he went inside i slipped into the alley and made water goblin joined me there what is it i asked what it is croaker is its him raven our raven not only him but darling shes a barmaid in a place called the iron lily holy shit i murmured raven lives there theyre doing a show like they dont know each other that well but raven looks out for her damnit it had to be didnt it what do we do now maybe bend over and kiss our asses goodbye the bastard could be smack in the middle of the bodyselling racket everything we found could add up that way how come you could find that when bullock couldnt i got resources bullock doesnt i nodded he did sometimes its handy having a wizard around sometimes its not if its one of those bitches up in duretile hurry it up i said hell wonder where i am raven has his own wagon and team keeps it way across town usually only takes it out late at night i nodded wed already determined that bodyrunners worked the night shift but he said and youre going to love this but croaker he took it out in the daytime once a while back coincidentally the day somebody hit the catacombs oh boy i looked that wagon over croaker there was blood in it fairly fresh i date it about when that moneylender and his pals disappeared oh boy shit were in for it now better get going to have to think of a story for bullock now later yeah at that moment i was ready to give up despair overwhelmed me that damned fool raveni knew exactly what he was doing getting together a fat bunch of running money by selling bodies and plundering graves his conscience wouldnt bother him in his part of the world such things were of much less consequence and he had a cause darling i couldnt get away from bullock i wanted desperately to run to elmo but i had to trudge hither and yon asking questions i looked up the northern slope at the black castle and thought of it as the fortress raven had built i was going off the deep end i told myself that the evidence wasnt yet conclusive but it was enough my employers did not wait on legal niceties or absolute evidence elmo was rattled too we could kill him no risk him giving anything away then really elmo i didnt mean it but you know id do it if the choice got narrow enough yeah we all would or wed try raven might not let us he was the toughest sonofabitch id ever known if you ask me we ought to find him and just tell him to get the hell out of juniper elmo gave me a disgusted look havent you been paying attention right now the only way in or out is the one we took the harbor is frozen the passes are snowed in you think we could get whisper to fly some civilian out for us civilians goblin says darling is still with him elmo looked thoughtful i started to say something else he waved a hand for silence i waited he finally asked what would he do if he saw you if hes been hanging around with the crater bunch i clicked my tongue yeah i didnt think of that let me go check something i hunted bullock up you or the duke got somebody inside the crater bunch he looked puzzled maybe why lets have a sitdown with them an idea it might help us break our thing here he looked at me a long moment maybe he was sharper than he pretended all right not that they wouldve learned much the only reason they havent run our guys off is we dont bother them they just get together and talk about the old days they dont have any fight left lets give it a look anyway maybe theyre less innocent than they look give me a halfhour i did and when that time was up he and i sat down with two secret policemen he and i took turns asking questions each coming from his own private slant neither knew raven at least not by that name that was a relief but there was something there and bullock sensed it immediately he hung on till he had something to chew im going to my boss i told him shell want to know about this i had come up with a diversion it seemed it would suit bullock he said ill take it up with hargadon didnt occur to me this might be foreigners political that could be why the money didnt show up maybe theyre selling bodies too rebellions do take money i observed we moved next evening at whispers insistence over the objections of the duke but with the support of the chief custodian the duke still did not want us seen the custodians didnt give a damn they just wanted to salvage their reputation elmo came slinking through the evening shadows ready here he whispered i glanced at the four men with me ready every company man in juniper was there with the dukes secret police and a dozen of bullocks men id thought his job silly but even so had been astonished to discover how few men his office actually employed all but one were there the one was legitimately sick elmo made a sound like a cow mooing repeated three times the onetime rebels were all together for their regular confab i snickered thinking of the surprise they were going to get they thought they were safe from the lady by fifteen hundred miles and seven years it took less than a minute no one was injured they just looked at us dumbly arms hanging slack then one even recognized us and groaned the black company in juniper then another its over its the end shes really won they didnt seem to care much some in fact looked relieved we pulled it off so smoothly there was hardly any notice from the neighbors the slickest raid id ever seen we marched them up to duretile and whisper and feather went to work i just hoped one of them wouldnt know too much id made a long bet hoping raven would not have told them who darling was if he had id pulled the roof down instead of misdirecting attention i did not hear from whisper so i guessed id won chapter nineteen juniper fear raven slammed through the door of the lily shed looked up startled raven leaned against the door frame panting he looked like hed just stared his death in the face shed put his rag aside and hurried over a stoneware bottle in hand what happened raven stared over his shoulder at darling who was waiting on sheds lone paying customer he shook his head took several deep breaths shuddered he was scared by all that was holy the man was terrified shed was aghast what could have gotten him into this state even the black castle did not shake him raven come over here and sit he took ravens arm the man followed docilely shed caught darlings eye signed for two mugs and another stoneware bottle darling took one look at raven and forgot her customer she was there with mugs and bottle in seconds her fingers flashing at raven raven did not see raven shed said in a sharp whisper snap out of it man what the hell happened ravens eyes focused he looked at shed at darling at the wine he tossed off a mug in one gulp slapped it down darling poured again her customer protested at being abandoned get it yourself shed told him the man became abusive go to hell then shed said raven talk are we in trouble uh no not we shed me he shuddered like a dog coming out of water faced darling his fingers started talking shed caught most of it raven told her to pack they had to run again darling wanted to know why because theyve found us raven told her who darling asked the company theyre here in juniper darling did not seem distressed she denied the possibility the company shed thought what the hell was this they are here raven insisted i went to the meeting i was late lucky i got there after it started the dukes men the custodians and the company i saw croaker and elmo and goblin i heard them call each other by name i heard them mention whisper and feather the company is in juniper and the taken are with them we have to go shed had no idea what in hell this was about who were these people why was raven scared how you going to run anywhere raven you cant get out of town the harbors still frozen raven looked at him as if he were a heretic settle down raven use your head i dont know what the hell is going on but i can tell you this right now youre acting more like marron shed than like raven old shed is the guy who panics remember raven managed a feeble grin youre right yeah raven uses his brain he snickered sourly thanks shed what happened lets just say the past came back a past i didnt expect to see again tell me about this sidekick you said bullocks been pulling around lately word ive heard bullock is a loner shed described the man though he could not recall him well his attention had been on bullock darling positioned herself so she could read his lips she formed a word with hers raven nodded croaker shed shivered the name sounded sinister when raven translated it he some kind of hired killer raven laughed softly no actually hes a physician halfway competent too but he has other talents like being crafty enough to come around looking for me in bullocks shadow who would pay attention to him theyd be too worried about the damned inquisitor darling flashed signs she went too fast for shed but he thought she was admonishing raven telling him croaker was his friend and would not be hunting him it was coincidence that their paths had crossed not coincidence at all raven countered both aloud and by sign if they arent hunting me why are they in juniper why are two of the taken here again darling responded too fast for shed to catch everything she seemed to be arguing that if someone called the lady had gotten to this croaker or another someone called silent croaker would not be here raven stared at her a good fifteen seconds still as stone he downed another mug of wine then he said youre right absolutely right if they were looking for me they would have had me and you the taken themselves would have been all over us so coincidence after all but coincidence or not the ladys top thugs are in juniper and theyre looking for something what why this was the old raven cool and hard and thinking darling flashed black castle sheds humor vanished raven looked at the girl for several seconds glanced in the general direction of the black castle then he looked at darling again why darling shrugged she flashed there is nothing else about juniper that would bring her here raven thought a few minutes more then he turned to shed shed have i made you rich have i gotten your ass far enough out of trouble sure raven your turn to give me a hand then some very powerful enemies of mine are in juniper theyre working with the custodians and the duke and are probably here because of the black castle if they spot me im in trouble marron shed had a full belly he had a warm place to sleep his mother was safe he had no debts and no immediate threats hanging over his head the man opposite him was responsible also responsible for saddling him with an agonized conscience but that he could forgive ask ill do what i can youll be helping yourself too if theyre looking into the castle you me and asa we made a mistake raiding the catacombs never mind i want you to find out whatever you can about whats going on in duretile if you need bribe money tell me ill cover it puzzled shed said sure cant you tell me a little more not till i know a little more darling get your stuff together we have to disappear for the first time shed protested hey whatre you doing how am i supposed to run this place without her get that girl lisa in here get your cousin i dont care we have to disappear shed frowned raven said they want her more than they want me shes just a kid shed yes sir how do i get in touch sir you dont ill get in touch with you darling go those are taken up there whatre taken shed asked if you have gods shed pray that you never find out pray hard and when darling returned with her meager belongings raven said i think you ought to reconsider leaving juniper with me things are going to start happening around here and you wont like them i have to take care of my mother think about it anyway shed i know what im talking about i used to work for those people chapter twenty juniper shadow talk raven vanished on us even goblin could find no trace feather and whisper worked on our prisoners till each was drained and got nothing on our old friend i concluded that raven had used an assumed name when dealing with them why hadnt he used one down in the buskin folly pride as i recall raven had too much of that raven was not his real name any more than croaker is mine but that was the name we knew him by the year he served with us none of us unless maybe the captain knew his real one he had been a man of substance once in opal that i knew he and the limper became bitter enemies when the limper used his wife and her lovers to do him out of his rights and titles that i knew but not who he was before he became a soldier of the black company i dreaded telling the captain what we had found he was fond of raven like brothers the two of them the captain i think was hurt when raven deserted he would be hurt more deeply when he learned what his friend had done in juniper whisper called us in to announce the results of the interrogations she said roughly we did not exactly score a triumph gentlemen all but a couple of those men were dabblers we knocked the fight out of them at charm but we did learn that the black castle has been buying corpses its denizens even buy live bodies two of our captives have sold to them raising money for the rebel the idea of trading in corpses was repellent but not especially wicked i wondered what use the black castle people had for them whisper continued they were not responsible for the raid on the catacombs in fact they are of no interest to us were turning them over to the custodians to do with as they please you gentlemen will now go out into the city and resume digging excuse me maam elmo said somewhere in juniper there is someone who is feeding the black castle find him the lady wants him raven i thought had to be raven just had to be we had to find that sonofabitch yes and get him out of town or dead you have to understand what the company means for us it is father mother family we are men with nothing else raven getting caught would kill the family figuratively and literally the lady would disband what remained of the outfit after shed mauled us for not turning raven in back when i told whisper it might help if we knew what were dealing with its hard to take something serious when nobody tells you anything whats the point of the exercise that castle is damned bizarre i grant you but why should we care whisper seemed to think about it for several seconds her eyes were blank she had taken the matter to higher authority she was in communion with the lady when she returned she said the black castle has its roots in the barrowland that got our attention i croaked what the black castle is the dominators escape hole when it reaches a certain size and certain set of circumstances the creatures who live there who are his creatures heart and soul will conjur him out of the great barrow here several men snorted in disbelief it did seem farfetched for all the weirdness and sorceries we have seen whisper said he foresaw his defeat by the white rose though not his betrayal by the lady even before the domination fell he started preparing his return he sent a faithful follower here with the seed of the black castle something went wrong he never planned to spend so long waiting maybe he did not know of junipers preoccupation with preserving the dead what are they waiting for a ship that will carry them to paradise roughly i agreed i studied it but the whole business is still monkey chatter to me go on the dominator is going to pop out on us here not if we can stop him but we may have gotten here too late this man if we dont take him soon it will be too late the portal is almost ready to open i looked at elmo he looked at me oh boy i thought if raven knew what he was doing i still couldnt get upset he did it for darling he couldnt have known he was doing the dominators work he had that much conscience he would have found another way what the hell was he going to do with so much money we had to find him that was all there was to it whatever we did from now on our main goal for the sake of the company had to be to warn him off i glanced at elmo he agreed from this moment forward we would be fighting for the survival of the outfit somewhere somehow raven must have smelled trouble goblin looked under every rock in the buskin watched every alley practically lived in the iron lily and still found a big bunch of nothing time ground past warmer weather threatened and we became ever more panicky chapter twentyone juniper raven departed soon after the outer channel opened shed went down to say goodbyeand only then discovered the nature of ravens shipping investment he had had a ship built and crewed a whole new ship and as big a vessel as shed had seen no wonder he needed a fortune he mused how many bodies to build that he returned to the lily numbed he poured himself some wine sat staring into nothing that raven was a man of vision he mumbled glad hes gone though asa too maybe things can get back to normal shed bought a cottage near the enclosure he installed his mother with a staff of three it was a relief to be rid of her evil blind stare he had workmen into the lily every day they interfered with business but business remained good the harbor was busy there was work for anyone who wanted it shed could not handle prosperity he hared after every impulse he had known during his impoverishment he bought fine clothing he dared not wear he went places frequented only by the wealthy and he bought the attentions of beautiful women women cost a lot when you pretended to be somebody off the high slope one day shed went to his secret cash box and found it empty all that money gone where the improvements on the lily werent finished he owed the workmen he owed the people caring for his mother damn was he back where he started hardly he had his profits he scampered downstairs to his business cash box opened it sighed in relief hed done all his spending out of the box upstairs but something was wrong there wasnt anywhere near enough in the box hey wally his cousin looked at him gulped raced out the door baffled shed hurried outside saw wally vanish into an alley then the truth hit him damn you he yelled damn you you damned thief he went back in and tried to figure where he stood an hour later he told the workmen to knock off he left his new girl lisa in charge started the rounds of his suppliers wally had screwed him good he had bought on credit and pocketed monies payable shed covered his debts as he went growing increasingly alarmed as his reserves dwindled down to little more than copper he returned to the lily and started an inventory at least wally hadnt sold what he had bought on credit the lily was wellstocked only what was he going to do about his mother the house was paid for that was a plus but the old girl needed her servants to survive and he couldnt pay their wages but he didnt want her back in the lily he could sell all those clothes hed spent a fortune on them and couldnt wear them he did some figuring yes sell the clothes and he could support his mother till next summer no more clothes no more women no more improvements on the lily maybe wally hadnt spent it all finding wally was not difficult he returned to his family after two days in hiding he thought shed would endure the loss he didnt know he was dealing with a new shed shed stormed to his cousins tiny oneroom apartment kicked the door in wally wally squealed his children and wife and mother all screeched questions shed ignored them wally i want it back every damned copper wallys wife got in his way calm down marron whats the matter wally wally cowered in a corner out of my way sal he stole damned near a hundred leva shed grabbed his cousin and dragged him out the doorway i want it back shed shed shoved him he staggered backward tripped rolled down a flight of stairs shed charged after him hurled him down another flight shed please wheres the money wally i want the money i dont have it shed i spent it honest the kids had to have clothes we had to eat i couldnt help it shed you had so much youre family shed youre supposed to help shed shoved him into the street kicked him in the groin dragged him upright started slapping where is it wally you couldnt have spent that much hell your kids are wearing rags i paid you enough to handle that because you were family i want the money you stole as he raged shed drove his cousin toward the lily wally whined and begged refusing to tell the truth shed guessed he had stolen upward of fifty leva enough to have completed the renovation of the lily this hadnt been petty pilfering he hurled blows in an angry rain he herded wally around behind the lily away from prying eyes now i get nasty wally shed please you stole from me and youre lying about it i could forgive you for doing it for your family but you didnt tell me or give it back he punched wally hard the pain in his hands from hitting the man sapped his rage but then wally broke i lost it gambling i know i was stupid but i was so sure i was going to win they took me they let me think i was going to win big then took me and the only way out was to steal they would have killed me i borrowed from gilbert after i told him how good you were doing lost it gambling borrowed from gilbert shed muttered gilbert had moved in on krages territories he was a bad as his predecessor how could you be so stupid the rage took him again he snatched a board off a scrap pile left for kindling he hit wally hard and hit him again his cousin went down stopped trying to fend off the blows shed froze suddenly coldly rational wally wasnt moving wally wally hey wally say something wally did not respond sheds stomach knotted he tossed the board into the pile have to get that inside before people cart it off he gripped his cousins shoulder come on wally i wont hit you anymore wally did not move oh shit shed muttered i killed him this tore it what now there wasnt much justice in the buskin but what there was was quick and rough they would hang him sure he whirled looking for witnesses he saw no one his mind flew in a hundred directions there was a way out no body no proof that murder had been done but hed never gone up that hill alone hastily he dragged wally to the scrap pile and covered him the amulet he needed to get into the black castle where was it he dashed into the lily roared upstairs found the amulet examined it definitely serpents intertwined the workmanship was amazingly detailed tiny jewels formed the eyes of the snakes they sparkled menacingly in the afternoon sun he stuffed the amulet into his pocket shed get yourself together panic and youre dead how long before sal yelled for the law a few days surely plenty of time raven had left him his wagon and team he hadnt thought to keep paying the stablekeeper had the man sold them if so he was in trouble he cleaned out his coin boxes left the lily in lisas care the stablekeeper hadnt sold off but the mules were looking lean shed cursed him i should feed them at my own expense mister shed cursed him some more and paid what was owed he said feed them and have them hitched and ready at the tenth hour shed remained panicky all afternoon somebody might find wally but no lawman came stamping in soon after dark he stole away to the stable he spent the journey alternately being terrified and wondering how much wally would bring and how much he could get for his wagon and team he hadnt factored them into his earlier calculations he ought to help wallys family he had to it was the decent thing he was acquiring too many dependents then he was facing the dark gate the castle with all its monstrous decoration was terrible but it didnt seem to have grown since last he had been there he knocked as raven had done his heart in his throat he gripped his amulet in his left hand what was taking them so long he hammered again the gate jumped open startling him he fled to his wagon got the mules moving he entered exactly as raven had done ignoring everything but his driving he halted in the same place climbed down dragged wally out no one came for several minutes he grew ever more nervous wishing hed had the sense to come armed what guarantee did he have that they wouldnt turn on him that silly amulet something moved he gasped the creature that stepped out of the shadow was short and wide and radiated an air of contempt it never looked at him its examination of the cadaver was detailed it was being difficult like some petty official with a helpless citizen momentarily in his power shed knew how to handle that stubborn patience and refusal to become irritated he stood motionless waiting the creature finally placed twentyfive pieces of silver near wallys feet shed grimaced but collected the cash he returned to his seat backed the wagon got the team aligned with the gate only then did he register his protest that was a prime corpse next time youll do better or there wont be a time after that git up out the gate he went amazed at his temerity going down the hill he sang he felt great except for a fading guilt about wallythe bastard had earned ithe was at peace with his world he was free and safe out of debt and now had money in reserve he returned his team to its stable wakened the stablekeeper paid four months in advance take good care of my animals he admonished a representative of the precinct magistrate showed up next day he had questions about wallys disappearance sal had reported the fight shed admitted it i kicked the shit out of him but i dont know what happened to him he just took off i wouldve run too if i had somebody that mad at me what was the fight about shed played the role of a man who didnt want to get anybody in trouble finally he admitted he worked for me he stole money to pay back money he borrowed to pay gambling debts check with my suppliers theyll tell how he bought on credit he told me he was paying cash how much was involved cant say exactly shed replied more than fifty leva my whole profit for the summer and then some the questioner whistled i dont blame you for getting pissed yeah i wouldnt have begrudged him money to help his family hes got a whole mob to take care of but to lose it gambling damn i was hot i borrowed to fix this place up the payments are rough i probably wont make it through the winter now because that bastard couldnt resist a game i may still break his neck it was a good act shed pulled it off you want to register a formal complaint shed played reluctant hes family my cousin id break my own fathers back if he did that to me yeah all right ill register it but dont go hanging him right away maybe he can work it out or something hell maybe hes still got some he can pay back he could have lied about losing it all he lied about a lot of things shed shook his head he worked for us onandoff since my father ran this place i never thought hed do anything like that you know how it is you get too far into debt and the vultures start closing in youll do anything to save your ass you dont worry about tomorrow we see it all the time shed nodded he knew how it was after the magistrates man departed shed told lisa im going out he wanted one last fling before he settled in to the dreary business of managing the lily he bought the most skilled most beautiful woman he could find she cost but she was worth every copper he returned to the lily wishing he could live that way all the time he dreamed about the woman that night lisa wakened him early theres a man here who wants to see you who is he he didnt say cursing shed rolled out he did nothing to hide his nakedness more than once he had hinted that lisa should include more than barmaids chores in her duties she was not cooperating he had to find a handle hed better look out he was getting obsessed with sex that could give somebody a handle he descended to the common room lisa indicated a man he was no one shed knew you wanted to see me you got someplace private a hard case now what he did not owe anyone he did not have any enemies whats your business lets talk about your cousin the one who didnt disappear the way people think sheds stomach knotted he concealed his distress i dont understand suppose somebody saw what happened come into the kitchen sheds visitor peeped back through the kitchen door thought the splittail might try to listen in then he gave shed an accurate account of wallys death where did you get that fairy tale i saw it in a pipe dream maybe youre cooler than i heard heres the way it goes friend i have a trick memory sometimes i forget depends on how im treated ah i begin to see the light this is about hush money there you go sheds thoughts scurried like frightened mice he couldnt afford hush money he had to find another way out but he couldnt do anything right now he was too confused he needed time to get himself together how much a leva a week would buy a firstclass case of amnesia shed goggled he sputtered he choked back his protest the extortionist made a whatcanido gesture i have problems too i got expenses a leva a week or take your chancesthe black castle flickered through sheds thoughts low cunning grabbed it turned it over looked at the possibilities murder did not bother him anymore but not now not here how do i pay you the man grinned just hand me a levashed brought his coin box into the kitchen youll have to take copper i dont have any silver the mans smile grew broader he was pleased why the man left shed said lisa i have a job for you worth a bonus follow that man find out where he goes he gave her five gersh another five when you get back if its worth it lisa zipped out in a whirl of skirts he wandered around a lot lisa reported like he was killing time then he headed down by the sailmakers to see that oneeyed moneylender gilbert yeah gilbert thank you shed said thoughtfully thanks a bunch that casts light on the problem five gersh worth sure youre a good girl he made a suggestive offer as he counted i dont need money that bad mr shed he retreated to his kitchen began preparing supper so gilbert was behind the extortionist did gilbert want him financially pressed why the lily why else the renovations made the place that much more attractive a steal so assume gilbert was opening a campaign to snatch the lily he had to fight but this time nobody could help him he was on his own three days later shed visited an acquaintance who operated on the nether edge of the buskin for a consideration he received a name he visited the man attached and left him with two pieces of silver back at the lily he asked lisa to tell her favorite customers that gilbert was trying to force them out by spreading lies and making threats he wanted the magistrate suspicious of accusations leveled against him later the morning of the next payoff shed told lisa ill be gone all day anybody comes looking for me tell them to come back after supper the man i followed him especially at first shed just roamed killing time his nerve worsened with time something would go wrong gilbert would come back rough but he wouldnt dare would he that would tarnish his reputation sheds rumors had him on the defensive now people would make their loans elsewhere if he pressed shed found himself a woman she cost too much but she made him forget for a while he returned to the lily at sunset he came by he asked lisa be back too he looked put out i dont think hes going to be nice mr shed thats the way it goes ill be out back working on the woodpile shed glanced at a customer hed never before seen the man nodded departed through the front door shed chopped wood by lanternlight now and again he searched the shadows saw nothing he prayed nothing would go wrong the extortionist stormed out the kitchen doorway you trying to duck me shed you know what happens if you mess with me duck you what do you mean im right here you werent this afternoon now that girl of yours gives me a hard way to go trying to steer me away i like to had to pound her before shed tell me where you were very creative shed wondered how much lisa suspected save the dramatics you want your money i want your ugly face away from my place lets get on with it the extortionist looked puzzled you talking tough they told me you were the biggest coward in the buskin who told you you working for somebody this not a freelance play the mans eyes narrowed as he realized his mistake shed produced a handful of copper he counted counted counted again put a few coins away hold out your hands the extortionist extended cupped hands shed had not expected it to be this easy he dumped the coins grabbed the mans wrists hey what the hell a hand clamped over the mans mouth a face appeared over his shoulder mouth stretched in a grimace of effort the extortionist rose to his toes arching backward his eyes widened in fear and pain then rolled up he slumped forward all right perfect get out of here shed said hastening footsteps faded quickly shed dragged the body into shadow quickly covered it with wood scraps then dropped to hands and knees and began collecting coins he found all but two what are you doing mr shed he jumped whatre you doing i came to see if you were all right im fine we had an argument he knocked some coins out of my hand i cant find them all need help mind the counter girl or theyll steal us blind oh sure she ducked back inside shed gave it up a few minutes later he would search again tomorrow he got antsy waiting for closing time lisa was too curious he was afraid she would look for the missing coins and find the body he did not want her disappearance on his conscience too two minutes after he closed he was out his back door and heading for his wagon and team the tall being was back on duty he paid shed thirty pieces of silver as he was maneuvering to leave though the thing demanded why do you come so seldom im not as skilled as my partner what has become of him we have missed him hes out of town shed could have sworn he heard the thing chuckle as he went out the gate chapter twentytwo juniper running scared a long time had passed and nothing had happened the taken were not pleased neither was elmo he dragged me into his quarters were the hell did raven gocroaker i dont know i told him as if he were the only one disturbed i was scared and getting more so by the day i want to know soon look man goblins done everything but torture people trying to pick up his trail he flat vanished he got wind of us somehow how will you tell me how weve been here half our lives it seems like and nobody else down there has noticed why should raven be any different because we were around looking for him he must have spotted one of us if he did i want to know that you hike on down there and light a fire under goblins ass hear right whatever you say boss though he commanded the advance party technically i outranked elmo but i was not about to press for prerogatives at the moment there was too much tension in the air there was stress throughout duretile and i did not understand most of it i remained on the periphery of the takens study of the black castle just another messenger boy a footslogger bringing in data from the city i hadnt the slightest notion what they had discovered by direct examination or even if they were studying the castle directly they could be lying back afraid they would alert the dominator to their presence one of the men located me in elmos quarters whisper wants you croaker i jumped a foot guilty conscience what for i had not seen her for weeks youll have to go see she didnt say he sneered hoping he would see an officer in the soup he figured i was in trouble he figured that so did i i dawdled as much as i dared but eventually had to present myself whisper glared at me as i entered you people havent found a damned thing down there what are you doing dogging it taking a vacation well say something i do you know the black castle stopped growing after our raid on the crater group no why not youre supposed to be finding out these things none of the prisoners accounted for the i know that i know none of them knew who the main body supplier was but that supplier must have known them he packed up there have been just two bodies delivered since the latest just last night why didnt you know that why have you got people in the buskin they seem incapable of learning anything oh she was in a mood i said is the deadline close or something the way i understood it we wouldnt be in trouble if only a few bodies were delivered true as far as it goes but weve reached a point where a handful might make all the difference i bit my lower lip tried to look properly chastised and waited she told me the lady is pressing shes very nervous she wants something to happen up here so as always the shit rolls downhill the normal course would be for me to go out and tromp on somebody below me half the problem is we dont know whats going on if you claim you know what the castle is how its growing and so forth how come you dont go over and kick it down or turn it into grape preserves or something its not that simple it never is i tend to overlook political ramifications i am not politically minded maybe once the rest of your company gets here the city will have to be controlled the duke and his incompetents couldnt manage that i stood there looking expectant sometimes that will con people into telling you more than they plan the city will go up in flames if its not buttoned up tight when the truth comes out why do you think the custodians are so determined to keep the catacombs thing hushed several thousand citizens have relatives who went into that monstrosity thats a lot of people wholl get very irate about the souls of loved ones being lost i see i did a little it took a certain willing suspension of reason though were going at this from a different angle she told me im taking charge of your investigations report to me daily ill decide what youre going to do and how understand yes maam only too well it was going to get that much more difficult to keep her and raven apart the first thing youll do is set a watch on the castle and if that doesnt shake something loose ill send feather down there understand yes maam again only too well i wondered if whisper suspected we were working at crosspurposes you can leave ill expect you back tomorrow with something to report yes maam i went straight back to elmo fuming he should have faced her not me just because id sort of taken over i was with elmo barely long enough to tell him what had happened when a messenger came from bullock he wanted to see me right away bullock was another problem id become convinced he was smarter than he put on and was almost as sure that he suspected we were up to more than we admitted i eased into his cubicle in the secret police headquarters whats up ive made a little headway on the catacombs raid result of pure stubborn footwork well i felt pretty curt about then and he raised an eyebrow just had a facetoface with my boss i told him which was as near an apology as i cared to come what have you got a name i waited like elmo bullock liked to be coaxed i was in no mood to play that game i followed up your notion about rented wagons turned up the name asa a woodgatherer named asa was probably working through the hole i showed you a man named asa spent a number of old coins but before the raid on the catacombs a man named asa worked for krage before he and his men disappeared everywhere i go its asathis or asathat anything to connect him with the black castle no i dont think hes a principal in anything but he must know something i thought back bullock had mentioned this name once before referring to a man who hung around the same place as raven maybe there was a connection maybe i ought to find this asa before anybody else did im headed down to the buskin i said direct orders from her holiness ill have goblin round the guy up bullock scowled there had been some ill will when he found out that we had put men into the buskin without consulting him ah right but dont play any more fast shuffle with me eh your people and mine arent after the same things but thats no reason to undermine each other eh youre right were just used to doing things different ill see you when i get back id appredate that he eyed me in a way thatsaid he did not trust me anymore if ever he had i left thinking the company and i were into it deep trouble on every hand juggling with too many balls in the air only we were juggling knives with poisoned edges i hustled on down and looked up goblin told him about our escalating troubles he was no happier than elmo or i chapter twentythree juniper interrogation shed had no more trouble with extortionists somebody did tell the magistrate that he had killed wally the magistrate did not believe it or did not care then bullocks sidekick turned up shed nearly dropped a valuable piece of crockery he had felt safe from that the only people who knew anything were far away he clamped down on his nerves and guilt went to the mans table how may we serve you reverend sir bring me a meal and your best wine landlord shed lifted an eyebrow sir ill pay nobody in the buskin can afford to give away meals aint it the truth sir aint it the truth when shed returned with the wine the inquisitor observed you seem to be doing well landlord shed snorted we live on the edge reverend sir on the ragged edge one bad week would destroy me i spend every winter borrowing from one moneylender to pay another this summer was good though i found a partner i was able to fix a few things that made the place more attractive probably my last dying gasp before it gets away he donned his sourest face the inquisitor nodded leave the bottle let the brotherhood contribute to your prosperity ill ask no profit reverend sir why be foolish charge me the same as anyone else shed mentally upped the tab twenty percent over normal he was glad to be rid of the bottle raven had left him stuck with several when shed delivered the meal the inquisitor suggestedbring a mug and join me sheds nerves twisted as tight as a bowstring something was wrong they had caught on as you wish reverend sir he dragged over and collected his own mug it was dusty he had not done much drinking lately afraid his tongue would wag sit down and wipe the scowl off your face you havent done anything have you i dont even know your name shed reverend sir marron shed the iron lily has been in my family for three generations admirable a place with tradition tradition is falling by the wayside nowadays as you say reverend sir i guess our reputation has preceded me wont you calm down how may i help you reverend sir im looking for a man named asa i hear he was a regular here so he was sir shed admitted i knew him well a lazy wastrel hated honest work never a copper to his name either yet he was a friend after his fashion and generous in his way i let him sleep on the common room floor during the winter because in the days of my hardship he never failed to bring wood for the fire the inquisitor nodded shed decided to tell most of the truth he could not hurt asa asa was beyond the reach of the custodians do you know where he acquired the wood shed pretended acute embarrassment he collected itin the enclosure reverend sir i debated with myself about using it it wasnt against the law but it seemed reprehensible anyway the inquisitor smiled and nodded no failing on your part marron shed the brotherhood doesnt discourage gleaning it keeps the enclosure from becoming too seedy why are you looking for asa then i understand he worked for a man named krage sort of for a while he thought he was king of the buskin when krage took him on strutting and bragging but it didnt last so i heard its the timing of their fallingout that intrigues me sir krage and some of his friends disappeared so did asa about the same time and all of them vanished soon after somebody got into the catacombs and looted several thousand passage urns shed tried to look properly horrified krage and asa did that possibly this asa started spending old money after he began gleaning in the enclosure our investigations suggest he was petty at his grandest we think he pilfered a few urns each time he gathered wood krage may have found out and decided to plunder in a big way their fallingout may have been over that assuming asa had any conscience possibly sir i understood it to be a squabble over a guest of mine a man named raven krage wanted to kill him he hired asa to spy on him asa told me that himself krage decided he wasnt doing his job he never did anything right anyway he never did anything very well but that doesnt invalidate your theory asa could have been lying probably was he lied a lot what was the relationship between asa and raven there wasnt any where is raven now he left juniper right after the ice broke up in the harbor the inquisitor seemed both startled and pleased what became of krage nobody knows reverend sir its one of the great mysteries of the buskin one day he was there the next he wasnt there were all kinds of rumors could he have left juniper too maybe some people think so whatever he didnt tell anybody the people who worked for him dont know anything either or so they say could he have looted enough from the catacombs to make it worthwhile to leave juniper shed puzzled that question it sounded treacherous i dont i dont understand what youre asking sir uhm shed thousands of the dead were violated most were put away at a time when the wealthy were very generous we suspect a sum of gold may have been involved shed gaped he hadnt seen any gold the man was lying why laying traps it was a major plundering operation wed very much like to ask asa some questions i can imagine shed bit his lip he thought hard sir i cant tell you what became of krage but i think asa took ship for the south he went into a long songanddance about how asa had come to him after falling out with krage begging to be hidden one day he had gone out returned later badly wounded had hidden upstairs for a while then had vanished shed claimed to have seen him from a distance only on the docks the day the first ships sailed for the south i never got close enough to talk but he looked like he was going somewhere he had a couple bundles with him do you recall what ship sir what ship did he take i didnt actually see him board a ship sir i just assumed he did he might still be around only i figure he would have gotten in touch if he was he always came to me when he was in trouble i guess hes in trouble noweh maybe the evidence isnt conclusive but im morally convinced he was in on the looting you didnt see krage on the dock did you no sir it was crowded everybody always goes down to see the first ships off its like a holiday was the inquisitor buying it damn he had to an inquisitor wasnt somebody you got off your back by selling him into the black castle the inquisitor shook his head wearily i was afraid youd tell me a story like that damn it you leave me no choice sheds heart leapt into his throat crazy ideas swarmed through his head hit the inquisitor grab the coin box make a run for it i hate to travel shed but it looks like either bullock or i will have to go after those people guess wholl get stuck relief swamped shed go after them reverend sir but the law down there doesnt recognize the brotherhoods right wont be easy will it the barbarians just dont understand us he poured some wine stared into it for a long while finally he said thank you marron shed youve been very helpful shed hoped that was a dismissal he rose anything else reverend sir wish me luck of course sir a prayer for your mission this very evening the inquisitor nodded thank you he resumed staring into his mug he left a fine tip but shed was uneasy when he pocketed it the inquisitors had a reputation for doggedness suppose they caught up with asa chapter twentyfour juniper shadow dancing i think i was pretty slick i told goblin you should have seen that shed pawnbroker cackled a chicken sweating like a pig and lying like a dog a oneman barnyard was he really lying i mused he didnt say anything that conflicted with what we know what did you learn goblin asked i think he was lying pawnbroker insisted maybe by not telling everything he knew but he was lying he was into it somehow you keep hanging around the lily then keep an eye on him what did you learn goblin demanded elmo came in howd it go great i said i found out what happened to raven what he and goblin both demanded he left town by ship the first day the harbor was open darling too goblin asked you see her around what do you think pawnbroker mused bet that asa went with him old shed said they both left the first day could be i was proud of myself catching him with that looks to me now like this shed is our only outside loose end hes the only one who knows what happened to them no shed nobody to maybe tell bullock or the taken anything elmo frowned the suggestion was more in keeping with his style than mine he thought id put it forward seriously i dont know sounds too simple anyway were starting to get noticed down there arent we goblin nodded were supposed to be sailors who missed our ship but people are comparing notes trying to figure us out if shed got killed there might be enough fuss to get bullock wondering if he gets wondering sooner or later the news would get back to the taken i figure we ought to save heroic measures for heroic circumstances pawnbroker agreed that sheds got something to hide i know that in my guts croaker told him about the raid on the catacombs he hardly blinked anybody else would have whooped off and spread the news like the plague kingpin still watching him i asked him and sharkey and tickle are taking turns he aint going to be able to pool without we know about it good keep it that way but dont mess with him we just want to keep him away from bullock and the taken i faded away into my thoughts what elmo finally asked i had an idea while i was talking to shed bullock is our main risk right and we know hell stick like a bulldog once he gets on a trail and hes on the trail of this asa character so why dont we con him into going south after this asa i dont know elmo muttered he might find him whats he want him for questioning about a raid on the catacombs what kind of cooperation is he going to get someplace else not much way i hear it the cities down the coast think juniper is a bad joke anyway we just want to buy a little time and if he does catch up with asa i figure he catches up with raven too aint nobody going to bring raven back not if he thinks the taken are after darling they tangle ill put my money on raven cut out the only source of info temporarily or permanently see what i mean and if he does kill raventhen raven cant talk how you going to talk bullock into it elmo asked its dumb croaker hes not going to go haring off after some minor suspect yes he will you remember when we came here he had to translate how do you figure he learned the language of the jewel cities i asked him he spent three years there looking for a guy who wasnt any more important than asa goblin said this mess gets crazier every day we got so many cons and lies going i cant keep track of them anymore i dont think we better do anything except cover our asses till the captain gets here i often had a feeling we were making things worse but i could see no exit other than to keep coping and hoping best way out elmo observed laconically would be to kill everybody who knows anything then all of us fall on our swords sounds a little extreme goblin opined but if you want to go first im right behind you ive got to report in to whisper i said anybody got any brilliant ideas what i should tell her nobody did i went dreading the encounter i was sure guilt smouldered in my eyes whenever i faced her i resented elmo because he did not have to endure her daily fits of ire bullock was almost too easy he was packing almost before i finished handing him my line of bull he wanted that asa bad i wondered if he knew something we did not or if hed just worked up an obsession with the mystery of the invaded catacombs whisper was more of a problem she told me i want you to send somebody with him i had had to tell her something so had told her most of the truth i figured the chances of anybody tracking asa and raven were nil but she seemed a little too interestedtoo perhaps she knew more than she pretended she was after all one of the taken elmo picked three men put kingpin in charge and told him to stick a knife in bullock if he looked like needing it the captain and company were i was told in the wolander mountains a hundred miles from juniper they faced a slow passage through tough passes but i began to anticipate their arrival once the old man showed the weight would be off elmo and me hurry i muttered and returned to tangling our skein of deceits chapter twentyfive juniper lovers matron shed fell in love in love in the worst possible waywith a woman far younger who had tastes far beyond his means he charged into the affair with all the reserve of a bull in rut disdaining consequences squandering his cash reserve as though it came from a bottomless box his boxes dried up two weeks after he met sue he made a loan with gilbert the moneylender another loan followed that then another within a month he had gone into debt farther than he had been during the winter and he did not care the woman made him happy and that was that compounding his negative attributes was a tendency toward willful stupidity and an unconscious confidence that money could be no problem ever again wallys wife sal visited the lily one morning grim and slightly ashamed marron she said can we talk whats the matter you were going to help with rent and stuff sure so whats the problem well i dont want to sound ungrateful or like i have any right to expect you to support us but our landlord is threatening to throw us out on account of the rent hasnt been paid for two weeks we cant get work on account of nobody is putting out any sewing right now the rent isnt paid but i saw him just the other day it hadnt been just the other day he had forgotten his mother too her servants salaries would be due in a few days not to mention lisas oh my he said im sorry i forgot ill take care of it shed youve been good to us you didnt have to be i dont like seeing you get into this kind of mess what kind of mess with that woman shes trying to destroy you he was too puzzled to become angry sue why how give her up itll hurt less if you break it off everybody knows what shes doing whats she doing sheds voice was plaintive never mind i said more than i should already if theres ever anything we can do for you let us know i will i will he promised he went upstairs to his hidden cash box and found it barren there was not a gersh in the place upstairs or down what was going on lisa wheres all the money i hid it what i hid it the way youre carrying on youre going to lose this place you have a legitimate expense tell me ill cover it shed goggled he sputtered who the hell do you think you are girl the girl whos going to keep you in business in spite of yourself the girl whos going to stop you from being a complete fool with gilberts woman gilberts yes what did you think was going on get out shed snapped you dont work here anymore lisa shrugged if thats what you want wheres the money sorry come see me when you get your common sense back shed raged around the common room his customers clapped egging him on he threatened he cajoled nothing worked lisa remained adamant its my family he protested you go prove that woman isnt gilberts whore then ill give you the money and walk ill do that what if im right youre not i know her you dont know shit youre infatuated what if im right he was incapable of entertaining the possibility i dont care all right if im right i want to run things here you let me get us out of debt shed bobbed his head once and stormed out he was not risking anything she was wrong what was her game she was acting like a partner or something like his mother had after his father died and before she lost her sight treating him like he did not have twice her experience of business and the world he wandered for half an hour when he came up from his melancholy he saw he was near sailmakers hall hell he was there hed just go see gilbert make a loan so he could see sue that night little bitch lisa could hide his money maybe but she couldnt keep him away from gilbert half a block later he began to suffer conscience pangs too many people depended upon him he shouldnt make his financial situation worse damned woman he muttered shouldnt talk to me that way now shes got me doubting everybody he leaned against a wall and fought his conscience sometimes lust pulled ahead sometimes the urge toward responsibility he ached for sue he should not need money if she really loved him what he said aloud he looked again his eyes had not deceived him that was sue stepping into gilberts place his stomach sank like a falling rock no she couldnt there must be an explanation but his traitor mind started cataloguing little oddities about their relationship particularly mauling her penchant for spending a lowgrade anger simmered over the fire of his hurt he slipped across the street hurried into the alley leading behind gilberts place gilberts office was in the back it had an alley window shed did not expect that to be open he did hope to sneak a peek the window was not open but he could hear and the sounds of lovemaking in no way approximated what he wanted to hear he considered killing himself on the spot considered killing himself on sues doorstep considered a dozen other dramatic protests and knew none would move either of these villains they began talking their chatter soon killed sheds holdout doubts the name marron shed came up hes ready the woman said ive taken him as far as i can maybe one more loan before he starts remembering his family do it then i want him wrapped up make the hill steep then grease it he got away from krage shed shook with anger how far down do you have him eighteen leva and nearly another ten in interest i can work him for another five do it i have a buyer hot to go shed left he wandered the buskin for hours he looked so grim people crossed the street there is no vengeance as terrible as the vengeance a coward plots in the dark of his heart late that afternoon shed strolled into gilberts office all emotion locked back in the shadows he had discovered the night he had run with krages hunters i need fifteen leva gilbert in a hurry gilbert was startled his one eye opened wide fifteen what the hell for ive set up a sweet deal but i have to close it tonight ill go a couple extra points if you want shed youre into me big now im worried about you covering that this deal goes off and i can clear it all gilbert stared whats up shed up youre awful sure of yourself shed told the lie that hurt most im going to get married gilbert going to ask the lady tonight i want to close this deal so i can make the lily over into a decent place for her well gilbert breathed well well well matron shed getting married interesting all right shed its not good business but ill take a chance fifteen you said thank you mr gilbert im really grateful you sure you can meet the payments ill have you ten leva before the end of the week guaranteed and with sue helping out at the lily ill have no problem clearing enough to cover the rest gilbert controlled a thin smile then you wont mind putting up collateral more valuable than your word sir i want a lien on the iron lily shed pretended to think hard finally all right shes worth the risk gilbert smiled the smile of a hungry stoat but managed to look worried at the same time wait here ill have a note drawn up and get the money shed smiled nastily as gilbert departed chapter twentysix juniper lovers parting shed pulled his rig into the alleyway behind sues place raced around front pounded on the door it was a class place for the buskin a man guarded the entrance from within eight women lived there each in her own apartment each in the same business as sue each commanding a substantial premium for her time hello mr shed the door guard said go on up shes expecting you shed tipped him something he hadnt done before the man became obsequious shed ignored him mounted the stair now came the difficult part playing coweyed lover when he was no longer blind but he would fool her just as she had fooled him she answered the door radiantly beautiful sheds heart climbed into his throat he shoved something into her hand this is for you oh marron you shouldnt have but if he hadnt he would not have gotten past her door what a strange necklace are these serpents real silver he said and rubies it caught my fancy ugly but the craftsmanship is superb i think its gorgeous marron how much did it cost too much shed replied smiling sardonically i couldnt tell you more than i should have paid for anything sue did not press come here marron she must have had orders to play him carefully usually she gave him a hard time before surrendering she began disrobing shed went he took her rough something he had not done before then he took her again when it was over she asked whats gotten into you i have a big surprise for you a big surprise i know youll love it can you sneak out without anyone knowing of course but why thats the surprise will you do it you wont be disappointed i promise i dont understand just do it slip out a few minutes after i leave meet me in the alley i want to take you somewhere and show you something be sure to wear the necklace what are you up to she seemed amused not suspicious good shed thought he finished dressing no answers now darling this will be the biggest surprise of your life i dont want to spoil it he headed for the door five minutes she called dont make me wait im a bear when i have to wait and dont forget the necklace i wont dear shed waited nearly fifteen minutes he grew impatient but was certain greed would bring sue out the hook was set she was playing with him marron her voice was soft and musical his heart twisted how could he do this here love she came to him he enfolded her in his arms now now enough of that i want my surprise i can hardly wait shed took a deep breath do it he yelled inside ill help you up she turned now but his hands were made of lead come on marron he swung sue slammed into the wagon a mewl the only sound she made he hit her again as she bounced back she sagged he took a gag from the wagon forced it into her mouth before she could scream then tied her hands quickly she began kicking when he went for her ankles he kicked her back nearly let anger carry him away she quit fighting he finished binding her then propped her on the wagon seat in the darkness they looked like man and wife about some late business he did not speak till they were across the port youre probably wondering whats going on darling sue grunted she was pale and frightened he retrieved his amulet while he was at it he stripped her of jewelry and valuables sue i loved you i really did i would have done anything for you when you kill a love like that you turn it into a big hatred at least twenty leva worth of jewelry he guessed how many men had she destroyed working for gilbert like that trying to steal the lily anything else i could have forgiven anything he talked all the way up the hill it distracted her till the black castle loomed so large it could no longer be overlooked then her eyes got huge she began to shake to stink as she lost all control yes darling shed said voice pleasantly rational conversational yes the black castle you were going to deliver me to the mercy of your friends you made a bet and lost now i deliver you to mine he halted climbed down went to the gate it opened immediately the tall being met him wringing spidery hands good it said very good your partner never brought healthy game sheds guts knotted he wanted to change his mind he only wanted to hurt and humiliate sue but it was too late he could not turn back im sorry sue you shouldnt have done it you and gilbert his turn will come marron shed isnt what everybody thinks a whining noise came from behind sues gag shed turned away he had to get out he faced the tall creature it began counting coins directly into his hand as always shed did not barter in fact he did not look at the money just kept stuffing his pockets his attention was on the darkness behind the creature more of its kind were back there hissing jostling shed recognized the short one hed dealt with once the tall being stopped counting absently shed put the coins into a pocket returned to his wagon the things in shadow swept forward seized sue began ripping her clothing one yanked the gag out of her mouth shed started packing his rig for gods sake marron dont leave me its done woman its done he snapped his traces back up mules she started screaming as he turned toward the gate he did not look he did not want to know keep moving mules come again soon marron shed the tall creature called after him chapter twentyseven juniper banished the summons from whisper caught me unprepared it was too early for the daily report id barely finished breakfast i knew it meant trouble i was not disappointed the taken prowled like a caged animal radiating tension and anger i went inside by the numbers stood at a perfect attention giving no excuse for the picking of nitsin case whatever it was was not my fault she ignored me for several minutes working off energy then she seated herself stared at her hands thoughtfully her gaze rose and she was in complete control she actually smiled had she been as beautiful as the lady that smile would have melted granite but she was what she was a scarred old campaigner so a smile only ameliorated the grimness of her face how were the men disposed last night she asked baffled i responded excuse me you mean their temper where were they stationed oh that was properly elmos province but i knew better than to say so the taken do not tolerate excuses sound though they may be the three men on the ship south with bullock looking for that man asa i worried about her having sent them when i do not understand the motives of the taken i get paranoid five down in the buskin pretending to be foreign sailors three more down there watching people weve found especially interesting id have to doublecheck with elmo to be positive but at least four more were in other parts of the city trying to pick up something of interest the rest of us were here in the castle off duty wait one man would have been down in the dukes secret police office and two would have been at the enclosure hanging around with the custodians i was with the inquisitors most of the night picking their brains were scattered pretty thin right now ill be glad when the captain gets here weve got too much going for the available manpower the occupation planning is way behind she sighed rose resumed pacing my fault as much as anyones i suppose she looked out a window for a long time then she beckoned i joined her she indicated the black castle just whiskers short theyre trying to open the way for the dominator already its not yet time but theyre getting hurried maybe theyve sensed our interest this juniper business was like some giant tentacled sea beast from a sailors lie no matter where we turned or what we did we got deeper into trouble by working at crosspurposes with the taken trying to cover an increasingly more obvious trail we were complicating their efforts to deal with the peril of the black castle if we did cover well we just might make it possible for the dominator to emerge into an unprepared world i did not want that horror upon my conscience though i fear i tend not to record it that way we were embroiled in substantial moral quandaries we are not accustomed to such problems the lot of the mercenary does not require much moralizing or making of moral decisions essentially the mercenary sets morality aside or at best reorders the customary structures to fit the needs of his way of life the great issues become how well he does his job how faithfully he carries out his commission how well he adheres to a standard demanding unswerving loyalties to his comrades he dehumanizes the world outside the bounds of his outfit then anything he does or witnesses becomes of minor significance as long as its brunt is borne outside the company we had drifted into a trap where we might have to face the biggest choice in the companys history we might have to betray four centuries of company mythos on behalf of the greater whole i knew i could not permit the dominator to restore himself if that turned out to be the only way we could keep the lady from finding out about darling and raven yet the lady was not much better we served her and till lately well and faithfully obliterating the rebel wherever we found him but i dont think many of us were indifferent to what she was she was less evil than the dominator only because she was less determined about it more patient in her drive for total and absolute control that presented me with another quandary was i capable of sacrificing darling to prevent the dominators return if that became the price you seem very thoughtful whisper said uhm therere too many angles to this business the custodians the duke us bullock who has axes of his own to grind i had told her about bullocks buskin origins feeding her seemingly irrelevant information to complicate and distract her thinking she pointed again didnt i suggest a close watch be kept on that place yes maam we did for a while too but nothing ever happened and then we were told to do some other things i broke off quaking with a sudden nasty suspicion she read my face yes last night and this delivery was still alive oh boy i murmured who did it you know we just sensed the consequent changes they tried to open the way they werent strong enough yet but they came very close she began to prowl mentally i ticked off the roster for the buskin last night i was going to ask some very pointed questions i consulted the lady directly shes very worried her orders are to let ancillary business slide were to prevent any more bodies reaching the castle yes the rest of your company will be here soon from six to ten days and there is much to be done to prepare for their arrival but as you observed there is too much to do and too few to do it let your captain cope when he arrives the black castle must be isolated why not fly some men in the lady has forbidden that i tried to look perplexed buy why i had a sweating fearful suspicion that i knew whisper shrugged because she doesnt want you wasting time making hellos and briefing newcomers go see what can be done about isolating the castle yes maam i departed thinking it had gone both better and worse than i had anticipated better because she did not throw one of her screaming rages worse because she had in effect announced that we who were here already were suspect that we might have succumbed to a moral infection the lady did not want communicated to our brethren scary yeah elmo said when i told him he did not need it explained which means we got to make contact with the old man messenger what else who can we break loose and cover one of the men from the buskin elmo nodded ill handle that you go ahead and figure how to isolate the castle with the manpower we have why dont you go scout the castle i want to find out what those guys were doing last night thats neither here nor there now croaker im taking over not saying you done a bad job just you didnt get it done which is my fault really im the soldier being a soldier wont make any difference elmo this isnt soldiers work its spy stuff and spies need time to worm into the fabric of a society we havent had enough of that time is up now isnt that what you said i guess i admitted all right ill scout the castle but you find out what went on down there last night especially around that placed called the iron lily it keeps turning up just like that guy asa all the while we talked elmo was changing now he looked like a sailor down on his luck too old to ship but still tough enough for dirty work he would fit right in down in the buskin i told him so yeah lets get moving and dont plan on getting much sleep till the captain gets here we looked at one another not saying what lay in the backs of our minds if the taken did not want us in touch with our brethren what might they do when the company hove in sight coming out of the wolanders up close the black castle was both intriguing and unsettling i took a horse over circled the place several times even flipped a cheerful wave at the one movement i detected atop its glassy ramparts there was some difficult ground behind itsteep rocky overgrown with scraggly thorny brush which had a sagey odor nobody lugging a corpse would reach the fortress from that direction the ground was better along the ridgeline to east and west but even there an approach was improbable men of the sort who sold corpses would do things the easy way that meant using the road which ran from the port river waterfront through the scatter of merchant class houses on the middle slopes and just kept on to the castle gate someone had followed that course often for wheel ruts ran from the end of the road to the castle my problem was there was no place a squad could lie in wait without being seen from the castle wall it took me till dusk to finalize my plan i found an abandoned house a ways down the slope and a little upriver i would conceal my squad there and post sentries down the road in the populated area they could run a message to the rest of us if they saw anything suspicious we could hustle up and across the slope to intercept potential bodysellers wagons would be slow enough to allow us the time needed old croaker is a brilliant strategist yes sir i had my troops in place and everything set by midnight and had two false alarms before breakfast i learned the embarrassing way that there was legitimate night traffic past my sentry post i sat in the old house with my team alternately playing tonk and worrying and on rare occasions napping and wondering a lot about what was happening down in the buskin and across the valley in duretile i prayed elmo could keep his fingers on all the strings chapter twentyeight juniper lisa shed spent an entire day lying in his room staring at the ceiling hating himself he had sunk as low as a man could there was no deed too foul for him anymore and nothing more he could do to blacken his soul a millionleva passage fee could not buy him aboard on passage day his name had to be written in the black book with those of the greatest villains mr shed lisa said from the doorway next morning as he was contemplating another day of ceiling study and selfpity mr shed yeah bo and lana are here bo and lana with a daughter were his mothers servants what do they want their accounts settled for the month i expect oh he got up lisa stopped him at the head of the stair i was right about sue wasnt i you were im sorry i wouldnt have said anything if we could have afforded it we what do you mean we oh hell never mind forget about it i dont want to hear about it anymore whatever you say but im going to hold you to your promise what promise to let me manage the lily oh all right at that moment he did not care he collected the monthly accounting from the servants he had chosen them well they were not cheating him he suggested they deserved a small bonus he returned upstairs for the money lisa watched him go perplexed he realized his mistake too late now she wondered why he had money today when hed had none yesterday he located his dirty clothing emptied his pockets onto his bed and gasped oh damn damn he muttered what the hell am i going to do with three gold pieces there was silver too and even a fistful of copper but it was a gyp a fortune he could not spend juniper law made it illegal for commoners to hold minted gold even incoming foreigners had to exchange theirs for silverthough foreign silver was as welcome as local lucky too for the black castle mintage was a decidedly odd coinage though in the standard weights how could he get rid of the gold sell it to some ship captain headed south that was the usual procedure he slipped it into his most secret hiding place with the amulet from the black castle a useless fortune he assessed the remainder twentyeight pieces of silver plus several leva in copper enough to take care of his mother and sal way short of enough to pry gilbert off his back still be in the damned money trap he whined he recalled sues jewelry smiled nastily muttered ill do it he pocketed everything returned to the ground floor paid his mothers servants told lisa im going out for a while first he made sure wallys family was cared for then ambled down toward gilberts place no one seemed to be around gilbert was not like krage in that he felt he needed an army on hand but he did have his bonebreakers they were all away but someone was in gilberts office because lamplight illuminated the curtains he smiled thoughtfully then hustled back to the lily he went to a table back in the shadows near where raven used to sit a couple of foreign sailors were seated there tough merchandise if hed ever seen it theyd been around for some timethey said they and their friends who came and went had missed their ship they were waiting for another shed could not recall having heard the name of their home port you men like to pick up some easy money he asked who doesnt one responded and the other what you got in mind i have a little problem ive got to do some business with a man hes liable to get vicious want some backup eh shed nodded the other sailor looked at him narrowly who is he names gilbert a moneylender you heard of him yeah i was just past his place dont look like theres anybody there but him the men exchanged glances the taller said tell you what let me go get a friend of ours i cant afford a whole army hey no problem you two work out what youd pay two of us hell come along free just feel more comfortable having him with us tough both men grinned one winked at the other yeah like you wouldnt believe then get him one man left shed dickered with the other lisa watched from across the room eyes narrow and hard shed decided she was getting too much into his business too fast the third man was a frogfaced character barely five feet tall shed frowned at him his fetcher reminded hes tough remember yeah all right lets go he felt a hundred percent better with three men accompanying him though he had no real assurance they would help if gilbert started something there were a couple of thugs in the front room when shed arrived he told them i want to see gilbert suppose he dont want to see you it was standard toughguy gameplaying shed did not know how to respond one of his companions saved him the worry he dont got much choice does he unless that fats all muscle in disguise he produced a knife began cleaning his nails the deed was so reminiscent of raven that shed was startled hes back in the office the fat thug exchanged a look with his companion shed figured one would run for help he started moving his frogfaced companion said ill just stay out here shed pushed into gilberts office the moneylender had a sack of leva on his desk was weighing coins one at a time on a fine scale sorting out those that had been clipped he looked up angrily what the hell is this couple of friends wanted to stop by with me and watch how you do business i dont like what this says about our relationship shed it says you dont trust me shed shrugged theres some nasty rumors out there about you and sue working on me to do me out of the lily sue eh where is she shed there is a connection eh shed let his face fall damn you thats why she turned me down you villain now she wont even see me that ape at the door keeps telling me she isnt there you arrange that mister gilbert you know i dont like you much gilbert gave the lot of them a nasty oneeyed stare for a moment he seemed to consider his chances then the small man ambled in leaned against the wall his wide mouth wrinkled into a sneer gilbert said you come to talk or to do business if its business get at it i want these creeps out of here theyll give the neighborhood a bad name shed produced a leather bag you have the bad name gilbert i hear people saying they wont do business with you anymore they dont think its right you should try to screw people out of their property shut up and give me some money shed you just want to whine get out sure talks tough for being down four to one one of the men remarked a companion admonished him in another language gilbert glared in a way that said he was memorizing faces the little man grinned and beckoned with one finger gilbert decided it could wait shed counted coins gilberts eyes widened as the stack grew shed said told you i was working on a deal he tossed in sues jewelry one of his companions picked up a bracelet examined it how much do you owe this character gilbert snapped a figure which shed suspected to be inflated the sailor observed youre shorting yourself shed i just want quit of this jackals lien on my place gilbert stared at the jewelry pallid stiff he licked his lips and reached for a ring his hand shook shed was both fearful and filled with malicious glee gilbert knew the ring now maybe he would be a little nervous about messing with matron shed or he might decide to cut a few throats gilbert had some of the same ego problems krage had had this should more than cover everything mr gilbert the big too even with the extra points lets have my lien back dully gilbert retrieved that from a box on a nearby shelf his eyes never left the ring shed destroyed the lien immediately dont i still owe you a little something though mr gilbert yes i think so well ill do my best to see you get everything youve got coming gilbert squinted angrily shed thought he saw a hint of fear too that pleased him nobody was ever afraid of marron shed except maybe asa who did not count best make his exit before he stretched his luck thank you mr gilbert see you again soon passing through the outer room he was astonished to find gilberts men snoring the frogfaced man grinned outside shed paid his guardians he wasnt as much trouble as i expected you had us with you the little man said lets go to your place and have a beer one of the others observed he looked like he was in shock the little man asked howd you ever get that far into a moneylender anyway a skirt i thought i was going to marry her she was just taking me for my money i finally woke up his companions shook their heads one said women got to watch them buddy theyll pick your bones i learned my lesson hey drinks on the house ive got some wine i used to keep for a special customer he left town so im stuck with it that bad eh no that good nobody can afford it shed spent his entire evening sipping wine even after the sailors decided they had business elsewhere he broke into a grin each time he recalled gilberts reaction to the ring got to be careful now he muttered hes as crazy as krage in time the good feeling departed fear took over hed face anything gilbert did alone and he was still very much the same old shed under the patina left by raven and a few deals since ought to haul the bastard up the hill he muttered into his mug then damn im as bad as raven worse raven never delivered them alive wonder what that bastard is doing now with his fancy ship and slick young slot he got himself very very drunk and very very filled with selfpity the last guest went to his bunk the last outsider went home shed sat there nursing his wine and glowering at lisa angry with her for no reason he could define her body he thought ripe but she wouldnt too good for him and her pushiness lately yeah she studied him as she cleaned up efficient little witch better even than darling who had worked hard but hadnt the economy of movement lisa had maybe she did deserve to manage the place he hadnt done such a great job he found her seated opposite him he glowered she did not retreat a hard lass too wouldnt bluff didnt scare tough buskin bitch be trouble someday whats the matter mr shed nothing i hear you paid gilbert off on a loan you took on this place how could you take a loan on the lily its been in your family for ages dont give me that sentimental crap you dont believe it where did you get the money maybe you shouldnt be so nosy maybe nosiness could be bad for your health he was talking surly and tough but not meaning what he said youve been acting strange lately i was in love that wasnt it what happened to that anyway i hear sue disappeared gilbert says you did her in did what i was over to her place today you see her no the door guard said she wasnt home which means she didnt want to see me probably had somebody else up there maybe it meant she wasnt home shed snorted i told you i dont want to talk about her anymore understand sure tell me where you got the money shed glared why because if theres more i want a chunk i dont want to spend my life in the buskin ill do whatever it takes to get out shed smirked she misunderstood this job is just to keep body and sou together till i find something a million people have thought that lisa and theyve frozen to death in buskin alleys some make it i dont intend to fail where did you get the money mr shed she went for a bottle of the good wine vaguely shed thought it must be about gone he told her about his silent partner thats a crock ive been here long enough to know that better believe it girl he giggled you keep pushing and youre liable to meet him you wont like him i guarantee he recalled the tall creature telling him to hurry back what happened to sue shed tried to rise his limbs were limp he fell back into his seat im drunk drunker than i thought getting out of shape lisa nodded gravely i loved her i really loved her she shouldnt ought to have done that i would have treated her like a queen would have gone into hell for her almost did he chuckled went in with her oops would you do that for me mr shed what youre always trying to get me whats it worth shed leered dont know cant tell till ive tried you you dont have anything to give me old man know where to get it though where shed just sat there grinning a bit of drool trailing from one corner of his mouth i give up you win come on ill help you get up the stairs before i go home the climb was an epic shed was one drink short of passing out when they reached his room he just toppled into bed thanks he mumbled whatre you doing you have to get undressed guess so he made no effort to help whatre you doing now whyre you grabbing me like that you want me dont you a moment later she was in the bed with him rubbing her nakedness against his he was too drunk to make anything of the situation he held her and became maudlin spouting his trials she played to it chapter twentynine juniper payoff shed sat up so suddenly his head twisted around somebody started beating drums inside he rolled to the edge of the bed and was noisily sick and then became sick in another way with terror i told her i told her the whole damned thing he tried to jump up he had to get out of juniper before the inquisitors came he had gold a foreign captain might take him south he could catch up with raven and asa he settled onto the cot too miserable to act im dying he muttered if theres a hell this is what its going to be like had he told her he thought so and for nothing he had gotten nothing marron shed you were born to lose when will you ever learn he rose once more cautiously and fumbled through his hiding place the gold was there maybe he hadnt told her everything he considered the amulet lisa could follow the trail blazed by sue if she hadnt told anybody yet but she would be wary wouldnt she be hard to catch her off guard even assuming he could find her my head gods i cant think there was a sudden racket downstairs damn he muttered she left the place unlocked theyll steal everything tears rolled down his cheeks such an end he had come to maybe that was bullock and his thugs knocking around down there best to meet his fate cursing he eased into his clothing began the long journey downstairs good morning mr shed lisa called brightly what will you have for breakfast he stared gulped finally stumbled to a table sat there with his head in his hands ignoring the amused stare of one of his companions of the gilbert adventure a little hung over mr shed lisa asked yes his own voice sounded thunderous ill mix you something my father taught me to make hes a master drunkard you know shed nodded weakly even that proved painful lisas father was one reason he had hired her she needed all the help she could get another of his charities gone sour she returned with something so foul even a sorcerer would not have touched it drink fast it goes down easier that way i can imagine half praying it would poison him he gulped the malodorous concoction after gasping for breath he murmured when are they coming how long do i have who mr shed the inquisitors the law whoever you called why would they come here painfully he raised his gaze to meet hers she whispered i told you ill do anything to get out of the buskin this is the chance ive been looking for were partners now mr shed fiftyfifty shed buried his head in his hands and groaned it would never end not till it devoured him he cast curses on raven and all his house the common room was empty the door was closed first we have to take care of gilbert lisa said shed bobbed his head refused to look up that was stupid giving him jewelry he would recognize hell kill you if we dont kill him first again shed bobbed his head why me he whined to himself what have i done to deserve this and dont you think you can get rid of me the way you did sue and that blackmailer my father has a letter hell take to bullock if i disappear youre too smart for your own good and it wont be long till winter yes but we wont do it ravens way too risky and too much work well get charitable let all the derelicts in one or two can disappear every night youre talking murder wholl care nobody theyll be better off themselves call it mercy how can anybody so young be so heartless you dont prosper in the buskin if you have a heart mr shed well fix a place where the outside cold will keep them till we get a wagonload we can take them up maybe once a week winter is is going to be my last season in the buskin i wont do it yes you will or youll hear from bullock you dont have a choice you have a partner god deliver me from evil are you less evil than me you killed five people four he protested weakly you think sue is still alive youre splitting hairs any way you look at it youre guilty of murder youre a murderer so dumb about money he doesnt have a gersh to his name so stupid he keeps getting tangled with sues and gilberts mr shed they only execute you once how to argue with sociopathic reasoning lisa was the heart of lisas universe other people existed only to be exploited there are some others we should think about after gilbert that man of krages who got away he knows there was something strange about the bodies not turning up he hasnt talked or it would be all over the buskin but someday he might and theres the man you hired to help you with the blackmailer she sounded like a general planning a campaign planning murder wholesale how could anybody i want no more blood on my hands lisa how much choice do you have he could not deny that gilberts death had meaning in the equation of his survival and after gilbert one more before she destroyed him she would let her guard down sometime what about that letter damn maybe her father had to go first the trap was vast and had no apparent exits this could be my only chance to get out mr shed youd better believe im going to grab it shed shook his lethargy leaned forward stared into the fireplace his own survival came first gilbert had to go that was definite what about the black castle had he told her about the amulet he could not recall he had to imply the existence of a special passkey else she might try to kill and sell him he would become a danger to her once they implemented her plan yes for sure she would try to rid herself of him once she made her connection with the things in the castle so add another to his mustkill list damn raven had done the smart thing the only thing possible had taken the only exit leaving juniper was the only way out going to have to follow him he muttered there isnt any choice what just muttering girl you win lets get to work on gilbert good stay sober and get up early tomorrow youll need to watch the lily while i check something out all right time you pulled your own weight again anyway probably so lisa eyed him suspiciously good night mr shed lisa told shed its set up hell meet me at my place tonight alone you bring your wagon ill make sure my dad isnt around i hear gilbert wont go anywhere without a bodyguard now he will tonight hes supposed to pay me ten leva to help get control of the lily i let him think hes going to get something else too sheds stomach growled what if he catches on theres two of us and one of him how did such a chickenshit manage everything you have he had dealt with the lesser fear but he kept that thought to himself there was no point giving lisa more handles than she had it was time to find handles on her arent you scared of anything child poverty especially of being old and poor i get the grey shakes whenever i see the custodians haul some poor old stiff out of an alley yeah that i can understand shed smiled thinly that was a beginning shed stopped the wagon glanced at the window of a downstairs rear apartment no candle burning there lisa hadnt yet arrived he snapped the traces rolled on gilbert might have scouts out he was not stupid shed pulled around a kink in the alleyway strolled back pretending to be a drunk before long someone lighted a candle in the apartment heart hammering shed slunk to the rear door it was unlocked as promised maybe gilbert was stupid gently he eased inside his stomach was a mess of knots his hands shook a scream lay coiled in his throat this was not the matron shed who had fought krage and his troops that shed had been trapped and fighting for his life he had had no time to think himself into a panic this shed did he was convinced he would foul up the apartment consisted of two tiny rooms the first behind the door was dark and empty shed moved through carefully eased to a ragged curtain a man murmured beyond the doorway shed peeked gilbert had disrobed and was resting a knee on a bedraggled excuse of a bed lisa was in it covers pulled to her neck pretending second thoughts gilberts withered wrinkled blueveined old body contrasted bizarrely with her youth gilbert was angry shed cursed mutely he wished lisa would stop playing games always she had to do more than go directly to her goal she had to manipulate along the way just to satisfy something within herself he wanted to get it over lisa pretended surrender made room for gilbert beside her the plan was for shed to strike once lisa enwrapped gilbert in arms and legs he decided to play a game of his own he let it wait he stood there grinning while her face betrayed her thoughts while gilbert sated himself upon her finally shed moved in three quick quiet steps he looped a garotte around gilberts skinny neck leaned back lisa tightened her grip how small and mortal the moneylender appeared how unlike a man feared by half the buskin gilbert struggled but could not escape shed thought it would never end he hadnt realized it took so long to strangle a man finally he stepped back his shakes threatened to overcome him get him off lisa squealed shed rolled the corpse aside get dressed come on lets get out of here he might have some men hanging around ill get the wagon he swept to the door peeped into the alleyway nobody around he recovered the wagon fast come on he snapped when he returned and found lisa still undressed lets get him out of here she could not tear herself away shed shoved clothing into her arms slapped her bare behind get moving damn it she dressed slowly shed fluttered to the door checked the alley still no one around he scooted back to the body hustled it to the wagon and covered it with a tarp funny how they seemed lighter when they were dead back inside will you come on ill drag you out the way you are the threat had no effect shed grabbed her hand dragged her out the door up he hoisted her onto the seat jumped up himself he flicked the traces the mules plodded forward once he crossed the port river bridge they knew where they were headed and needed little guidance idly he wondered how many times they had made the journey the wagon was halfway up the hill before he calmed down enough to study lisa she seemed to be in shock suddenly murder was not just talk she had helped kill her neck was in a noose not as easy as you thought eh i didnt know it would be like that i was holding him i felt the life go out it it wasnt what i expected and you want to make a career of it ill tell you something im not killing my customers you want it done that way you do it yourself she tried a feeble threat you dont have any power over me anymore go to the inquisitors theyll take you to a truthsayer partner lisa shivered shed held his tongue till they neared the black castle lets not play games anymore he was considering selling her along with gilbert but decided he could not muster the hatred anger or downright meanness to do it he stopped the mules you stay here dont get off the wagon no matter what understand yes lisas voice was small and distant terrified he thought he knocked on the black gate it swung inward he resumed his seat and drove inside stepped down swung gilbert onto a stone slab the tall creature came forth examined the body looked at lisa not this one shed said shes a new partner the creature nodded thirty done we need more bodies marron shed many bodies our work is nearing completion we grow eager to finish shed shuddered at its tone therell be more soon good very good you shall be rewarded richly shed shuddered again looked around the thing asked you seek the woman she has not yet become one with the portal it snapped long yellow fingers feet scuffed in the darkness shadows came forth they held the arms of a naked sue shed swallowed hard she had been used badly she had lost weight and her skin was colorless where not marked with bruises or abrasions one of the creatures raised her chin made her look at shed her eyes were hollow and vacant the walking dead he whispered is the revenge sweet enough the tall creature asked take her away i dont want to see her the tall being snapped its fingers its compatriots retreated into the shadows my money shed snarled chuckling the being counted coins at gilberts feet shed scooped them into his pocket the being said bring us more live ones marron shed we have many uses for live ones a scream echoed from the darkness shed thought he heard his name called she recognized you friend a whimper crawled out of sheds throat he vaulted onto the wagon seat snarled at his mules the tall creature eyed lisa with unmistakable meaning lisa read it lets get out of here mr shed please git up mules the wagon creaked and groaned and seemed to take forever getting through the gate screams continued echoing from somewhere deep inside the castle outside lisa looked at shed with a decidedly odd expression shed thought he detected relief fear and a little loathing relief seemed foremost she sensed how vulnerable she had been shed smiled enigmatically nodded and said nothing like raven he recalled he grinned like raven let her think let her worry the mules halted eh men materialized out of the darkness they held naked weapons militarytype weapons a voice said ill be damned its the innkeeper chapter thirty juniper more trouble otto rolled in out of the night hey croaker we got a customer i folded my hand but did not throw the cards in you sure i was damned tired of false alarms otto looked sheepish yeah for sure something was wrong here where is he lets have all of it theyre going to make it inside they man and a woman we didnt think they were anything to worry about till they were past the last house and still headed uphill it was too late to stop them then i slapped my hand down i was pissed there would be hell to pay in the morning whisper had had it up to her chin with me already this might be her excuse to park me in the catacombs permanently the taken are not patient lets go i said in as calm a voice as i could manage while glaring a hole through otto he made sure he stayed out of reach he knew i was not pleased knew i was in a tight place with the taken he did not want to give me any excuse to wrap my hands around his neck im going to cut some throats if this gets screwed up again we all grabbed weapons and rushed into the night we had our place picked in brush two hundred yardsbelow the castle gate i got the men into position just as somebody started screaming inside sounds bad one of the men said keep it down i snapped cold crept my spine it did sound bad it went on and on and on then i heard the muted jangle of harness and the creak of wheels improperly greased then the voices of people talking softly we jumped out of the brush one of the men opened the eye of a lantern ill be damned i said its the innkeeper the man sagged the woman stared at us eyes widening then she sprang off the wagon and ran get her otto and heaven help you if you dont crake drag this bastard down walleye take the wagon around to the house the rest of us will cut across the man shed did not struggle so i detailed another two men to help otto he and the woman were crashing through the brush she was headed toward a small precipice she should corner herself there we led shed to the old house once in the light he became more deflated more resigned he said nothing most captives resist detention somehow if only by denying that there is any reason to detain them shed looked like a man who thought he was overdue for the worst sit i said and indicated a chair at the table where we had played cards i took another turned it parked myself with forearms atop its back and chin upon my forearms weve got you dead shed he just stared at the tabletop a man without hope anything to say theres nothing to be said is there oh i think theres a whole lot youve got your ass in a sling for sure but youre not dead yet you maybe could talk your way out of this his eyes widened slightly then emptied again he did not believe me im not an inquisitor shed his eyes flickered with momentary life its true i followed bullock around because he knew the buskin my job had very little to do with his i couldnt care less about the catacombs raid i do care about the black castle because its a disaster in the making but not as much as i care about you because of a man named raven one of your men called you croaker raven was scared to death of somebody named croaker that he saw one night when the dukes men grabbed some of his friends so hed witnessed our raid damn but i had cut it close to the wind that time im that croaker and i want to know everything you know about raven and darling and everything about anybody else who knows anything the slightest hint of defiance crossed his face a lot of folks are looking for you shed bullock isnt the only one my boss wants you too and shes worse trouble than he is you wouldnt like her at all and shell get you if you dont do this right i would rather have given him to bullock bullock wasnt interested in our problems with the taken but bullock was out of town theres asa too i want to know everything you havent told me about him i heard the woman cursing in the distance carrying on like otto and the guys were trying to rape her i knew better they hadnt the nerve after having screwed up once already tonight whos the slot my barmaid she and his story boiled out once he started there was no stopping him i had a notion how to wriggle out of a potentially embarrassing situation shut him up one of the men clamped a hand over sheds mouth heres what were going to do shed assuming you want out of this alive he waited the people i work for will know a body was delivered tonight theyll expect me to catch whoever did it ill have to give them someone that could be you the girl or both of you you know some things i dont want the taken to find out one way i can avoid handing you over is having you turn up dead i can make that real if i have to or you can fake it for me let the slot see you looking like youve been wrecked you follow shaking he replied i think so i want to know everything the girl i held up a hand listened the uproar was close she wont come back from her meeting with the taken theres no reason we couldnt turn you loose once were done doing what we have to do he did not believe me he had committed crimes he believed deserved the harshest punishment and he expected it were the black company shed juniper is going to get to know that real well soon including the fact that we keep our promises but thats not important to you right now you want to stay alive long enough to get a break that means youd damned well better fake being dead and do it better than any stiff you ever hauled up the hill all right take him over by the fire and make him look like hes had it rough the men knew what to do they sort of scattered shed around without actually hurting him i tossed a few things around to make it look like there had been a fight and finished just in time the girl came sailing through the doorway propelled by ottos fist she looked the worse for wear so did otto and the men id sent to help wildcat eh otto tried to grin blood leaked from the corner of his mouth aint the half of it croaker he kicked the girls feet from under her what happened to the guy got a little feisty i stuck a knife in him i see we stared at the girl she stared back the fire gone each few seconds she glanced at shed looked back more subdued yep youre in a heap of trouble sweetheart she gave us the songanddance id expected from shed we ignored it knowing it was bullshit otto cleaned up then bound her hands and ankles he parked her in a chair i made sure it faced away from shed the poor bastard had to breathe i sat down opposite the girl and began to question her shed said he had told her almost everything i wanted to know if she knew anything about raven that could give him or us away i got no chance to find out there was a great rush of air around the house a roar like a tornado passing a crack like thunder otto said it all oh shit taken the door blew inward i rose stomach twisting heart hammering feather came in looking like shed just walked through a burning building wisps of smoke rose from her smouldering apparel what the hell tasked the castle i got too close they almost knocked me out of the sky what have you got i told my story quickly not omitting the fact that we had allowed a corpse to get past i indicated shed one dead trying to fight questioning but this one is healthy i indicated the girl feather moved close to the girl she had taken a real blast out there i did not feel the aura of great power rigidly constrained that one usually senses in the presence of the taken and she did not sense the life still throbbing in marron shed so young she lifted the girls chin oh what eyes fire and steel the lady will love this one we keep the watch i asked assuming she would confiscate the prisoner of course there may be others she faced me no more will get through the margin is too narrow whisper will forgive the latest but the next is your doom yes maam only its hard to do and not attract the attention of the locals we cant just go set up a roadblock why not i explained she had scouted the black castle and knew the lay of the land youre right for the moment but your company will be here soon therell be no need for secrecy then yes maam feather took the girls hand come she said i was amazed at how docilely our hellcat followed feather i went outside and watched feathers battered carpet rise and hurry toward duretile one despairing cry floated in its wake i found shed in the doorway when i turned to go inside i wanted to smack him for that but controlled myself who was that he asked what was that feather one of the taken one of my bosses sorceress one of the greatest go sit lets talk i need to know exactly what that girl knows about raven and darling intense questioning convinced me that lisa did not know enough to arouse whispers suspicions unless she connected the name raven with the man who had helped capture her years ago i continued grilling shed till first light he practically begged to tell every filthy detail of his story he had a big need to confess over coming days when i sneaked down to the buskin he revealed everything recorded where he appears as the focal character i do not think i have met many men who disgusted me more nastier men yes i have encountered scores greater villains come by the battalion sheds leavening of selfpity and cowardice reduced him from those categories to an essentially pathetic level poor dolt he was born to be used and yet there was one guttering spark in matron shed reflected in his relationships with his mother raveo asa lisa sal and darling that he noted but did not recognize himself he had a hidden streak of charity and decency it was the gradual growth of that spark with its eventual impact upon the black company which makes me feel obligated to record all the earlier noxious details about that frightened little man the morning following his capture i rode into the city in sheds wagon and allowed him to open the iron lily as usual during the morning i got elmo and goblin in for a conference shed was unsettled when he discovered that we all knew one another only through sheer luck had he not been taken earlier poor fellow the grilling never ceased poor us he could not tell us everything we wanted to know what are we going to do about the girls father elmo asked if there is a letter weve got to grab it i replied we cant have anybody stirring up more problems goblin you take care of the papa hes even a little suspicious see he has a heart attack sourly goblin nodded he asked shed for the fathers whereabouts departed and returned within half an hour a great tragedy he didnt have a letter she was bluffing but he did know too much that would come out under questioning this business is beginning to get to me hunting rebels was cleaner you knew who was who and where you stood id better get back up the hill the taken might not be understanding about me being down here elmo better keep somebody in sheds pocket right pawnbroker lives there from now on that clown takes a crap hes holding his hand goblin looked remote and thoughtful raven buying a ship imagine that what do you figure he was going to do i think he wanted to head straight out to sea i said i hear therere islands out there way out maybe another continent a guy could hide pretty good out there i went back up the hill and loafed for two days except to slip off and get everything i could out of shed not a damned thing happened nobody else tried to make a delivery i guess shed was the only fool in the body business sometimes i looked at those grim black battlements and wondered they had taken a crack at feather somebody in there knew the taken meant trouble how long before they realized they had been cut off and did something to get the meat supply moving again chapter thirtyone juniper the return shed was still rattled two days after his capture each time he looked across the common room and saw one of those black company bastards he started falling apart again he was living on borrowed time he was not sure what use they had for him but he was sure that when he was used up they would dump him with the garbage some of his babysitters clearly thought him trash he could not refute their viewpoint in his own mind he was behind his counter washing mugs when asa walked through the door he dropped a mug asa met his eye for only an instant sidled around the l and headed upstairs shed took a deep breath and followed the man called pawnbroker was a step behind when he reached the head of the stair moving as silent as death he had a knife ready for business shed stepped into what had been ravens room pawnbroker remained outside what the hell are you doing here asa the inquisitors are after you about that catacombs business bullock himself went south looking for you easy shed i know he caught up with us it got hairy we left him cut up but hell mend and hell come back looking for you i came to warn you youve got to get out of juniper oh no shed said softly another tooth in the jaws of fate been considering that anyway that would not tell pawnbroker anything he could not guess for himself things have gotten rotten here ive started looking for a buyer not true but he would before days end for some reason asas return restored his heart maybe just because he felt he had an ally somebody who shared his troubles most of the story poured out pawnbroker did not take exception he did not make an appearance asa had changed he did not seem shocked shed asked why not because i spent so much time with raven he told me stories that would curl your hair about the days before he came to juniper how is he dead dead shed gasped what pawnbroker bulled through the doorway did you say raven was dead asa looked at pawnbroker at shed at pawnbroker again shed you bastard you shut up asa shed snapped you havent got the faintest whats happened while you were gone pawnbroker is a friend sort of pawnbroker eh like from the black company pawnbrokers eyebrows rose raven been talking he had some tales about the old days uhhuh right buddy thats me lets get back to raven being dead asa looked at shed shed nodded tell us okay i dont really know what happened we were clearing out after our mixup with bullock running his hired thugs caught us by surprise were hiding in some woods outside of town when all of a sudden he starts screaming and jumping around it dont make no sense to me asa shook his head his face was pale and sweaty go on shed urged gently shed i dont know what pawnbroker demanded i dont know i didnt hang around shed grimaced that was the asa he knew youre a real buddy fellow pawnbroker said look shed motioned for silence asa said shed youve got to get out of juniper fast any day a ship could bring a letter from bullock but its better down there than we thought shed you got money youre all right they dont care about the catacombs think it was a big joke on the custodians thats how bullock found us everybody was laughing about the raid there was even some guys talking about getting up an expedition to come clean them out how did anybody find out about the catacombs asa only you and raven knew asa looked abashed yeah thought so had to brag didnt you he was confused and frightened and starting to take it out on asa he did not know what to do he had to get out of juniper like asa said but how to give his watchdogs the slip especially when they knew he had to try theres a ship at the tulwar dock that leaves for meadenval in the morning shed i had the captain hold passage for two should i tell him youll be there too pawnbroker stepped into position to block the doorway neither one of you will be there some friends of mine want to talk to you shed what is this panic edged asas voice shed looked at pawnbroker the mercenary nodded shed poured out most everything asa did not understand shed did not himself because his chaperones had not told him everything so there was some sense missing from the picture he had pawnbroker was alone at the lily shed suggested how about i go get goblin pawnbroker smiled how about we just wait but somebody will turn up well wait lets go downstairs you he indicated asa with his blade dont get any funny ideas shed said be careful asa these are the guys raven was scared of i will i heard enough from raven thats a pity too pawnbroker said croaker and elmo arent going to like that down gents shed just go on about your business somebodys liable to recognize asa shed warned well take a chance git pawnbroker stood aside and allowed both men to pass downstairs he seated asa at the shadowiest table and joined him cleaning his nails with his knife asa watched in fascination seeing ghosts shed figured he could get away now if he wanted to sacrifice asa they wanted asa more than they wanted him if he just headed out through the kitchen pawnbroker would not come after him his sisterinlaw came from the kitchen a platter balanced on each hand when you get a minute sal and when she got the minute you think you and the kids could run the place for me for a few weeks sure why she looked puzzled but she glanced quickly into the shadows i might have to go somewhere for a while id feel better if i knew somebody in the family was running the place i dont really trust lisa you havent heard from her yet no youd have thought shed turn up when her father died wouldnt you maybe shes shacked up somewhere and hasnt heard yet sal did not sound convinced in fact shed suspected she thought he had something to do with the disappearance way too many people had disappeared around him he was afraid she would do her sums and decide he had had something to do with wally disappearing too theres one rumor i heard said she got arrested keep an eye out for mom shes got good people taking care of her but they need supervising where are you going marron i dont know yet he was afraid it might be just a way up the hill to the enclosure if not that then certainly somewhere away from everything that had happened here away from these merciless men and their even less merciful employers have to talk to asa about the taken maybe raven had told him something he wished he could get a moment with asa to plan something the two of them making a break but not on the tulwar ship asa had mentioned that damn him some other ship headed south what had become of ravens big new vessel and darling he went over to the table asa what happened to darling asa reddened he stared at his folded hands i dont know shed honest i panicked i just ran for the first ship headed north shed walked away shaking his head in disgust leaving the girl alone like that asa hadnt changed much after all the one called goblin came through the door he began to beam at asa before pawnbroker said anything my my my my my he said is this who i think it is pawn you got it the infamous asa himself home from the wars and does he have stories to tell goblin seated himself opposite asa he wore a big frog grin such as mainly he claims raven is dead goblins smile vanished in an eyes blink he became deadly serious he made asa tell his story again while staring into a mug of wine when he finally looked up he was subdued better talk this over with elmo and croaker good job pawnbroker ill take him keep your eye on friend shed shed winced in the back of his head had lain the small hope that both would leave with asa his mind was made up he would flee at the first opportunity get south change his name use his gold pieces to buy into an inn behave himself so thoroughly nobody would notice him ever again asa showed a spark of rebellion who the hell do you guys think you are suppose i dont want to go anywhere goblin smiled nastily muttered something under his breath dark brown smoke drifted out of his mug illuminated by a bloody inner glow goblin stared at asa asa stared at the mug unnerved the smoke coalesced formed a small headlike shape points began glowing where eyes might be goblin said my little friend wants you to argue he feeds on pain and he hasnt eaten for a long time ive had to keep a low profile in juniper asas eyes kept getting bigger so did sheds sorcery he had sensed it in the thing called the taken but that had not upset him much it had been removed not experienced something that had happened to lisa out of sight but this it was a minor sorcery to be sure some slight trick but it was sorcery in a city which saw none other than that involved in the slow growth of the black castle the dark arts hadnt gained any following in juniper all right asa said all right his voice was high and thin and squeaky and he was trying to push his chair back pawnbroker prevented him goblin grinned i see raven mentioned goblin good youll behave come along pawnbroker released asas chair the little man followed goblin docilely shed sidled over and looked into goblins mug nothing he frowned pawnbroker grinned cute trick eh yeah shed took the mug to his sink when pawnbroker was not looking he dropped it into the trash he was more scared than ever how did he get away from a sorcerer his head filled with tales he had heard from southern sailors bad business wizards were he wanted to weep chapter thirtytwo juniper visitors goblin brought me the man asa and insisted we wait for elmo before questioning him he had sent someone to dig elmo out of duretile where he was trying to placate whisper whisper was getting goosed by the lady regular and taking it out on anyone handy goblin was unsettled by what he had learned he did not play the usual game and try to make me guess what was going on he blurted asa says him and raven had a runin with bullock raven is dead he lit out darling is on her own down there excitement better believe it i was ready to put the little man to the question then and there but i controlled myself elmo was a while showing up goblin and i got damned antsy before he did while asa worked himself up for a stroke the wait proved worthwhile elmo did not come alone the first hint was a faint but sour odor that seemed to come from the fireplace where id had a small fire lighted just in case you know with a few iron rods set by ready to be heated so asa could look them over and think and maybe convince himself he ought not to leave anything out whats that smell somebody asked croaker you let that cat in again i kicked him out after he sprayed my boots i said like halfway down the hill maybe he got the firewood before he left the odor grew stronger it wasnt really obnoxious just mildly irritating we took turns examining the firewood nothing i was in the middle of a third search for the source when the fire caught my eye for a second i saw a face in the flames my heart nearly stopped for half a minute i was in a panic nothing but the faces presence having registered i considered every evil that could happen taken watching the lady watching the things from the black castle maybe the dominator himself peeking through our fire then something calm back in the far marches of mind reiterated something i hadnt noticed because i had no reason to expect it the face in the flames had had only one eye oneeye i said without thinking that little bastard is in juniper goblin spun toward me eyes wide he sniffed the air his famous grin split his face youre right croaker absolutely right that stink is the little skunk himself should have recognized it straight off i glanced at the fire the face did not reappear goblin mused what would be a suitable welcome figure the captain sent him probably be logical to send him or silent ahead do me a favor goblin what dont give him no special welcome goblin looked deflated it had been a long time he did not want to miss an opportunity to refresh his acquaintance with oneeye with a flash and a bang look i said hes here on the sneak we dont want the taken to know why give them anything to sniff out bad choice of words the smell was about to drive us outside yeah goblin grumbled wish the captain had sent silent i was all worked up for this had him the biggest surprise of his life so get him later meantime why not clear this smell out why not get his goat by just ignoring him he thought about it his eyes gleamed yeah he said and i knew he had shaped my suggestion to his own warped sense of humor a fist hammered on the door it startled me even though i was expecting it one of the men let elmo in oneeye came in behind elmo grinning like a little black mongoose about to eat snake we paid him no heed because the captain came in behind him the captain the last man i expected to reach juniper before the company itself sir i blurted what the hell are you doing here he lumbered to the fire extended his hands summer had begun to fade but it was not that cold he was as bearlike as ever though he had lost weight and aged it had been a hard march indeed stork he replied i frowned looked at elmo elmo shrugged said i sent stork with the message the captain expanded stork didnt make any sense whats this about raven raven of course had been his closest friend before deserting i began to get a glimmer i indicated asa this guy was in the thick of it from the beginning been ravens sidekick he says raven is dead down whats the name of that place asa asa stared at the captain and oneeye and swallowed about six times without being able to say anything i told the captain raven told stories about us that turned his hair grey lets hear the story the captain said he was looking at asa so asa told his tale for the third time while goblin hovered listening for the clunk of untruth he ignored oneeye in the most masterful show of ignoring ive ever seen and all for nought the captain dropped asa completely the moment he finished his tale a matter of style i think he wanted the information to percolate before he trotted it out for reexamination he had me review everything i had experienced since arriving in juniper i presumed he had gotten elmos story already i finished he observed youre too suspicious of the taken the limper has been with us all along he doesnt act like theres anything up if anyone had a cause for malice toward us the limper did nevertheless i said therere wheels within wheels within wheels with the lady and the taken maybe they didnt tell him anything because they figured he couldnt keep it secret maybe the captain admitted he shuffled around occasionally gave asa a puzzled look whatever lets not get whisper wondering any more than she is play it close pretend youre not suspicious do your job oneeye and his boys will be around to back you up sure i thought against the taken if the limper is with the company how did you get away if he knows youre gone the word will be out to the lady wont it he shouldnt find out we havent spoken in months he stays to himself bored i think what about the barrowland i was primed to find out everything that had happened during the companys long trek for i had nothing in the annals concerning the majority of my comrades but it was not yet time to exhume details just to feel for high points we never saw it the captain said according to the limper journey and the lady are working that end we can expect a major move as soon as we have juniper under control we havent done squat to prepare i said the taken kept us busy fussing about the black castle ugly place isnt it he looked us over i think you mightve gotten more done had you not been so paranoid sir most of your trailcovering strikes me as needless and a waste of time the problem was ravens not yours and he solved it in typical fashion without help he glared at asa in fact the problem seems solved for all time he had not been here and had not felt the pressures but i did not mention that instead i asked goblin you figure asa is telling the truth warily goblin nodded how about you oneeye you catch any false notes the little black man responded with a cautious negative asa raven should have had a bunch of papers with him he ever mention them asa looked puzzled he shook his head he have a trunk or something that he wouldnt let anybody near asa seemed baffled by the direction my questions had taken the others did too only silent knew about those papers silent and maybe whisper who had possessed them once herself asa anything he treated unusually a light dawned in the little mans mind there was a crate about the size of a coffin i remember making a joke about it he said something cryptic about it being somebodys ticket to the grave i grinned the papers still existed what did he do with that crate down there i dont know asa honest i only saw it a couple times on the ship i never thought anything about it what are you getting at croaker the captain asked i have a theory just based on what i know about raven and asa everyone frowned generally what we know about asa suggests hes a character raven wouldnt take up with on a bet hes chicken unreliable too talkative but raven did take up with him took him south and made him part of the team why maybe that dont bother you guys but it does me i dont follow you the captain said suppose raven wanted to disappear so people wouldnt even bother looking for him he tried to vanish once by coming to juniper but we turned up looking for him he thought so what next how about he dies in front of a witness people dont hunt for dead men elmo interrupted you saying he staged his death and used asa to report it so nobody would come looking im saying we ought to consider the possibility the captains sole response was a thoughtful uhm goblin said but asa did see him die maybe and maybe he only thinks he did we all looked at asa he cowered the captain said take him through his story again oneeye stepbystep for two hours oneeye dragged the little man through again and again and we could not spot one flaw asa insisted he had seen raven die devoured from within by something snakelike and the more my theory sprung leaks the more i was sure it was valid my case depends on ravens character i insisted when everybody ganged up on me theres the crate and theres darling her and a damned expensive ship that he for godsakes had built he left a trail going out of here and he knew it why sail a few hundred miles and tie up to a dock when somebody is going to come looking why leave shed alive behind you to tell about you being in on the raid on the catacombs and theres no way in hell hed leave darling twisting in the wind not for a minute he would have had arrangements made for her you know that my arguments were beginning to sound a little strained to me too i was in the position of a priest trying to sell religion but asa says they just left her hanging around some inn i tell you raven had a plan i bet if you went down there now youd find darling gone without a trace and if the ship is still there that crate wouldnt be aboard what is this with the crate oneeye demanded i ignored him i think you have too much imagination croaker the captain said but on the other hand raven is crafty enough to pull something like that soon as i can spring you figure on going down to check if ravens crafty enough how about the taken being villainous enough to try something against us well cross that bridge when we come to it he faced oneeye i want you and goblin to save the games understand too much clowning around and the taken will get curious croaker hang on to this asa character youll want him to show you where raven died im heading back to the outfit elmo come ride with me part way so a little private business bet it had to do with my suspicions about the taken after a while you get so used to some people you can almost read their minds chapter thirtythree juniper the encounter things changed after the captains visit the men became more alert elmos influence waxed while mine waned a less wishywashy more inflexible tone characterized the company deputation every man became ready to move at an instants notice communications improved dramatically while time available for sleep declined painfully none of us were ever out of touch more than two hours and elmo found excuses to get everyone but himself out of duretile into places where the taken would have trouble finding them asa became my ward out on the black castle slope tension mounted i felt like one of a flock of chickens poised to scatter the moment a fox landed among us i tried to bleed off my shakiness by updating the annals i had let them slide sadly seldom having done more than keep notes when the tension became too much for me i walked uphill to stare at the black castle it was an intentional risktaking like that of a child who crawls out a tree branch overhanging a deadly fall the closer i approached the castle the more narrow my concentration at two hundred yards all other cares vanished i felt the dread of that place down to my ankle bones and the shallows of my soul at two hundred yards i felt what it meant to have the shadow of the dominator overhanging the world i felt what the lady felt when she considered her husbands potential resurrection every emotion be came edged with a hint of despair in a way the black castle was more than a gateway through which the worlds great old evil might reappear it was a concretization of metaphorical concepts and a living symbol it did things a great cathedral does like a cathedralit was far more than an edifice i could stare at its obsidian walls and grotesque decoration recall sheds stories and never avoid dipping into the cesspool of my own soul never avoid searching myself for the essential decency shelved through most of my adult life that castle was if you like a moral landmark if you had a brain if you had any sensitivity at all there were times when oneeye goblin elmo or another of the men accompanied me not one of them went away untouched they could stand there with me talking trivialities about its construction or weightily about its significance in the companys future and all the while something would be happening inside i do not believe in evil absolute i have recounted that philosophy in specific elsewhere in the annals and it affects my every observation throughout my tenure as annalist i believe in our side and theirs with the good and evil decided after the fact by those who survive among men you seldom find the good with one standard and the shadow with another in our war with the rebel eight and nine years ago we served the side perceived as the shadow yet we saw far more wickedness practiced by the adherents of the white rose than by those of the lady the villains of the piece were at least straightforward the world knows where it stands with the lady it is the rebel whose ideals and morals conflict with fact becoming as changeable as the weather and as flexible as a snake but i digress the black castle has that effect makes you amble off into all the byways and culdesacs and false trails you have laid down during your life it makes you reassess makes you want to take a stand somewhere even if on the black side leaves you impatient with your own malleable morality i suspect that is why juniper decided to pretend the place did not exist it is an absolute demanding absolutes in a world with a preference for relatives darling was in my thoughts often while i stood below those black glossy walls for she was the castles antipode when i was up there the white pole and absolute in opposition to what the black castle symbolized i had not been much in her presence since realizing what she was but i could recall being morally unnerved by her too i wondered how she would affect me now after having had years to grow from what shed said she did not reek the way the castle did his main interest in her had been hustling her upstairs and raven had not been driven into puritanical channels if anything he had slipped farther into the darknessthough for the highest of motives possibly there was a message there an observation upon means to ends here was raven who had acted with the pragmatic amorality of a prince of hell all so he could save the child who represented the best hope of the world against the lady and the dominator oh twould be marvelous if the world and its moral questions were like some game board with plain black players and white and fixed rules and nary a shade of grey even asa and shed could be made to feel the aura of the castle if you took them up during the daytime and made them stand there looking at those fell walls shed especially shed had achieved a position where he could afford conscience and uncertainty i mean he had none of the financial troubles that had plagued him earlier and no prospect of digging himself a hole with us watching him so he could reflect upon his place in things and become disgusted with himself more than once i took him up and watched as that deep spark of hidden decency flared twisted him upon a rack of inner torment i do not know how elmo did it maybe he went without sleep for a few weeks but when the company came down out of the wolanders he had an occupation plan prepared it was crude to be sure but better than any of us expected i was in the buskin at sheds iron lily when the first rumors raged down the waterfront and stirred one of the most massive states of confusion ive ever seen sheds woodseller neighbor swept into the lily announced theres an army coming down out of the pass foreigners thousands of them they say during the following hour a dozen patrons brought the news each time the army was larger and its purpose more obscure nobody knew what the company wanted various witnesses assigned motives according to their own fears few came anywhere near the mark though the men were weary after so long a march they spread through the city quickly the larger units guided by elmos men candy brought a reinforced company into the buskin the worst slums are always the first site of rebellion weve found there were few violent confrontations junipers citizens were taken by surprise and had no idea what to fight about anyway most just turned out to watch i got myself back up to my squad this was the time the taken would do their deed if they planned anything nothing happened as i might have guessed knowing that men from our forerunner party were guiding the new arrivals indeed nobody got in touch with me up there for another two days by then the city was pacified every key point was in our hands every state building every arsenal every strong point even the custodians headquarters in the enclosure and life went on as usual what little trouble there was came when rebel refugees tried to start an uprising accurately accusing the duke of having brought the lady to juniper the people of juniper didnt much care there were problems in the buskin though elmo wanted to straighten the slum out some of the slum dwellers didnt want to be straightened he used candys company forcefully cracking the organizations of the crime bosses i did not see the necessity but wiser heads feared the gangs could become the focus of future resistance anything with that potential had to be squashed immediately i think there was a hope the move would win popular favor too elmo brought the lieutenant to my hillside shack the third day after the companys arrival how goes it i asked the lieutenant had aged terribly since i had seen him last the passage westward had been grim citys secure he said stinking dump isnt it better believe its all snakes belly whats up elmo said he needs a look at the target i lifted an eyebrow the lieutenant said the limper says were going to take this place i dont know how soon captain wants me to look it over fun times tomorrow i muttered aint going to grab it on the sneak i donned my coat it was chilly up on the slopes elmo and oneeye tagged along when i took the lieutenant up he eyeballed the castle deep in thought finally he said i dont like it not even a little bit he felt the cold dread of the place i got a man whos been inside i said but dont let the taken know hes supposed to be dead what can he tell me not much hes only been there at night in a court behind the gate uhm the taken have a girl up at duretile too i talked to her she couldnt tell me nothing only in there once and was too scared to look around shes still alive yeah thats the one you caught yeah shes alive ladys orders apparently nasty little witch lets hike around it we got onto the far slope where the going was rough to the accompaniment of constant crabbing by oneeye the lieutenant stated the obvious no getting at it from here not without help from the taken going to take a big lot of help to get at it from any direction he looked me a question i told him about feathers troubles the night we took shed and his barmaid anything since nope not before either my man whos been inside never saw anything extraordinary either but dammit the thing connects with the barrowland its got the dominator behind it you know its not going to be a pushover they know theres trouble out here oneeye made a squeaking sound what the lieutenant snapped oneeye pointed we all looked up the wall which loomed a good sixty feet above us i did not see anything neither did the lieutenant what he asked again something was watching us nastylooking critter i saw it too elmo volunteered long skinny yellowish guy with eyes like a snake i considered the wall how could you tell from here elmo shivered and shrugged i could and i didnt like it looked like he wanted to bite me we dragged on through brush and over boulders keeping one eye on the castle the other on the down slope elmo muttered hungry eyes thats what they were we reached the ridgeline west of the castle the lieutenant paused how close can you get i shrugged i havent had the balls to find out the lieutenant moved here there as if sighting on something lets bring up some prisoners and find out i sucked spittle between my teeth then said you wont get the locals anywhere near the place think not how about in exchange for a pardon candys rounded up half the villains in the buskin got a regular anticrime crusade going he gets three complaints about somebody he nabs them sounds a little simple i said we were moving around for a look at the castle gate by simple i meant simplistic not easy the lieutenant chuckled months of hardship had not sapped his bizarre sense of humor simple minds respond to simple answers a few months of candys reforms and the duke will be a hero i understood the reasoning juniper was a lawless city ruled by regional strongmen there were hordes of sheds who lived in terror continuously victimized anyone who lessened the terror would win their affection adequately developed that affection would survive later excesses i wondered though if the support of weaklings was worth much or if should we successfully infect them with courage we might not be creating trouble for ourselves later take away daily domestic oppression and they might imagine oppression on our part i have seen it before little people have to hate have to blame someone for their own inadequacies but that was not the problem of the moment the moment demanded immediate vigorous violent attention the castle gate popped open as we came in line a halfdozen wild beings in black rushed us a fog of lethargy settled upon me and i found fear fading the moment it sparked into existence by the time they were halfway to us all i wanted was to lie down pain filled my limbs my head ached cramps knotted my stomach the lethargy vanished oneeye was doing strange things dancing yelping like a wolf pup throwing his hands around like wounded birds his big weird hat flew off and tumbled with the breeze downhill till it became tangled in the brush between yelps he snapped do something you idiots i cant hold them forever shang elmos sword cleared its scabbard the lieutenants did the same i was carrying nothing but a long dagger i whipped it out and joined the rush the castle creatures stood frozen surprise in their ophidian eyes the lieutenant reached them first stopped wound up took a mighty twohanded swing he lugs a hanger that is damned near an executioners sword a blow like that would have severed the necks of three men it did not remove the head of his victim though it did bite deep blood sprayed the three of us elmo went with a thrust as did i his sword drove a foot into his victim my dagger felt like it had hit soft wood it sank but three inches into my victim probably not deeply enough to reach anything vital i yanked my blade free poked around in my medical knowledge for a better killing point elmo kicked his victim in the chest to get his weapon free the lieutenant had the best weapon and approach he hacked another neck while we diddled around then oneeye lost it the eyes of the castle creatures came alive pure fiery venom burned there i feared the two not yet harmed would swarm all over us but the lieutenant threw a wild stroke and they retreated the one i had wounded staggered after them he fell before he reached the gate he kept crawling the gate closed in his face so the lieutenant said theres a few lads we dont have to face later my commendation oneeye he spoke calmly enough but his voice was up in the squeak range his hands shook it had been close we would not have survived had oneeye not come along i think ive seen enough for today lets hike ninety percent of me wanted to run as fast as i could ten percent stuck to business lets drag one of these bastards along it croaked out of a mouth dry with fear what the hell for elmo demanded so i can carve it up and see what it is yeah the lieutenant squatted and grabbed a body under the arms it struggled feebly shuddering i took hold of booted feet and hoisted the creature folded in the middle hell with that the lieutenant said he dropped his end joined me you pull that leg ill pull this one we pulled the body slid sideways we started bickering about who should do what you guys want to stop crapping around oneeye snarled he stabbed a wrinkled black finger i looked back creatures had appeared on the battlements i felt an increase in the dread the castle inspired somethings happening i said and headed downhill never letting go of the body the lieutenant came along our burden took a beating going through the rock and brush wham something hit the slope like the stamp of a giants foot i felt like a roach fleeing a man who hated cockroaches and had his stomping boots on there was another stamp more earthshaking oh shit elmo said he came past me arms and legs pumping oneeye was right behind him flying low gaining ground neither offered to help a third thump and a fourth about equally spaced in time each closer than the last the last sent chunks of stone and dead brush arcing overhead fifty yards downslope oneeye halted whirled did one of his magic things a chunk of pale blue fire exploded in his upraised hands went roaring up the hill moaning past me less than a foot away the lieutenant and i passed oneeye a fifth giant stomp spattered our backs with shards of rock and brush oneeye let out a mad howl and ran again he yelled that was my best shot better dump that clown and scatter he pulled away bounding like a hare fleeing hounds a scream filled the valley of the port a pair of dots came hurtling over from the southern slope almost too fast for the eye to follow they passed over with a hollow deep roar and boomed like a gods drum behind us i was not sure but it seemed the dots were connected another pair appeared revolving about a common center i got a better look yes they were connected they roared they boomed i glanced back the face of the black castle had vanished behind a wall of color like paint thrown against then running down a pane of glass to which it would not adhere taken are on the job the lieutenant panted his eyes were wild but he clung to his side of our burden the damned creature got hung up panicky we hacked its clothing free from a thorn bush i kept looking up expecting something to come down and smash us all over the slope another pair of balls arrived spraying color they did no obvious harm but kept the castle occupied we freed our booty hurried on a different sort of dot pair came dropping from high above i pointed feather and whisper the taken plunged toward the black castle preceded by a highpitched shriek fire enveloped the castle wall obsidian seemed to melt and run like candle wax shifting the already grotesque decorations into forms even more bizarre the taken pulled out gained altitude came around for another pass in the interim another pair of dots screamed across the port valley and painted the planes of the air it would have been a great show if i had not been so damned busy getting away the slope resounded to the stamp of an invisible giant a circle fifteen feet across and five deep appeared above us sticks and stones flew it missed by only a dozen feet the impact knocked us down a line of like imprints marched back up the slope mighty though that blow was it was less forceful than its predecessors feather and whisper swooped again and again the face of the black castle melted ran shifted form then thunder racked the air barnbam both taken vanished in clouds of smoke they wobbled out fighting for control of their carpets both smouldered the way feather had the night we captured shed they fought for altitude the castle turned its entire attention to them the lieutenant and i made our escape chapter thirtyfour juniper flight the lily shuddered several times shed was doing mugs and wondering which of his customers were black company the shaking made him nervous then a shriek flashed overhead rising then falling as it whipped away north a moment later the earth shivered again strong enough to rattle crockery he rushed into the street one small cunning part of him kept watching his customers trying to determine who was watching him his chance of escape had lessened drastically with the advent of the company he no longer knew who was who they all knew him he hit the street as a second shriek came from the direction of the enclosure he followed pointing hands a pair of balls joined by a cord whipped away to the north seconds later all juniper was illuminated by a particolored glare the black castle people said they hit the black castle shed could see it from his street it had vanished behind a curtain of color terror gripped his heart he could not understand it he was safe down here wasnt he wasnt he the company had great wizards supporting it they would not let the castle do anything a mighty hammer blow threw stuff around the north slope he could not see what was happening but instantly sensed that the castle had struck at someone possibly that croaker who was up there keeping the place isolated maybe the castle was trying to open the road crowd yammer directed his attention to two dots dropping from the blue fire enveloped the castle obsidian shifted form writhing then found its normal shape again the flying attackers soared turned another pair of balls hurtled in apparently thrown from duretile and down came the carpet riders shed knew who they were and what was happening and he was terrified around him the buskin taken unawares went berserk he retained the presence of mind to consider his own position here there members of the black company were running for battle stations squads formed up hurried off pairs of soldiers took stations apparently assigned against times when rioting and looting looked possible nowhere did shed see anyone identifiable as his babysitter he slipped back inside the lily upstairs into his room dug into his secret place he stuffed gold and silver into his pockets dithered over his amulet then hung it around his neck under his clothing he scanned the room once saw nothing else he wanted to take hurried back downstairs there was no one in the common room but sal who stood at the door watching the display on the north slope hed never seen her more homebody and calm sal marron is it time yes im leaving twenty leva in the box youll do fine as long as the soldiers keep coming in is that up there whats been going on thats where its been headed itll probably get worse theyre here to destroy the castle if they can where are you going i dont know he honestly did not wouldnt tell you if i did they would find out from you when will you be back maybe never certainly not before they pull out he doubted the company ever would or if it did it would be replaced its lady seemed the type not to turn loose of anything he gave sal a peck on the cheek take care and dont short yourself or the kids if lisa turns up tell her shes fired if wally does tell him i forgive him he headed for the back door the flash and roar on the slope continued at one point there was a howling which fluttered toward duretile but it broke up somewhere over the enclosure he put his head down and his collar up and followed alleyways toward the waterfront only twice did he encounter patrols neither boasted a man who knew him the first ignored him the corporal commanding the second told him to get his ass off the street and went on from wharf street he could see the black castle once more through the masts and stays of countless ships it seemed to have gotten the worst of the exchange which had died away thick black smoke boiled out of the fortress an oily column leaning a few degrees and rising thousands of feet then spreading in a dark haze on the slopes below the castle there was a twinkling and seething an anthilllike suggestion of movement he supposed the company was hurrying into action the waterfront was in a frenzy the channel boasted a dozen vessels heading out every other foreign ship was preparing to sail the river itself seemed strangely disturbed and choppy shed tried three ships before he found one where money talked loudly enough to be heard he paid ten leva to a piratical purser and found himself a spot where he would not be seen from shore nevertheless as the crew were casting off the man called pawnbroker came racing along the pier with a squad of soldiers shouting at the ships master to hold fast the ships master made an obscene gesture told them where they could go and began drifting with the current there were too few tugs for the number of ships moving out for his defiance the skipper got an arrow through the throat astonished sailors and officers stood frozen aghast arrows stormed aboard killed more than a dozen men including the mate and boatswain shed cowered in his hiding place gripped by a terror deeper than any he had known before he had known they were hard men men who did not play games he had not realized just how hard they were how savage they could be the dukes men would have thrown up their hands in despair and wandered away cursing they would not have massacred anyone the arrows kept coming in a light patter till the vessel was out of range only then did shed peep out and watch the city dwindle slowly oh slowly did it drift away to his surprise none of the sailors were angry with him they were angry true but had not made a connection between the attack and their lastminute passenger safe he thought elated that lasted till he began to wonder where he was bound and what he would do once he got there a sailor called sir theyre coming after us in a launch sheds heart dropped to his ankles he looked and saw a small ship pulling out trying to put on sail men in black company uniform abused the crew hurrying them he got back into hiding after the mauling these men had taken there was no doubt they would surrender him rather than suffer more if they realized he was what pawnbroker wanted how had the man picked up his trail sorcery of course had to be did that mean they could find him anywhere chapter thirtyfive juniper bad news the fuss was over it had been a dramatic display while it lasted though not as impressive as some ive seen the battle on the stair of tear the fighting around charm this was all flash and show more rattling to junipers people than to us or the denizens of the black castle they did us no harm the worst they suffered was the direct deaths outside their gate the fire inside did no real harm or so the taken reported grimy whisper grounded her carpet outside my headquarters trundled inside looking the worse for wear but unharmed what started it she asked the lieutenant explained theyre getting frightened she said maybe desperate were they trying to scare you off or take you prisoner definitely prisoner i said they hit us with some kind of sleepy spell before they came after us oneeye supported me with a nod why were they unsuccessful oneeye broke the spell turned it around on them we killed three ah no wonder they were upset you brought one down with you i thought we could understand them better if i cut one up to see how he was made whisper did one of her mental fades communing with the mistress of us all she returned a good idea but feather and i will do the cutting where is the corpse ill take it to duretile now i indicated the body it was in plain sight she had two men carry it to her carpet i muttered dont damn trust us to do anything anymore whisper heard me she did not comment once the body was loaded she told the lieutenant begin your preliminary siegework immediately a circumvallation limper will support you its likely the dominators creatures will try to break out or take prisoners or both dont permit it a dozen captives would allow them to open the pathway you would find yourself facing the dominator he would not be kind no shit the lieutenant is a tough guys tough guy when it suits him in those moments not even the lady could intimidate him why dont you clear out tend to your job and let me tend to mine his remarks didnt fit the moment but he was fed up with taken in general he had been on the march with the limper for months and the limper fancied himself a commander he gave the lieutenant and captain both a bellyful and maybe that was the source of the friction between the company and taken the captain had his limits too though he was more diplomatic than the lieutenant he would ignore orders that did not suit him i went out to watch the circumvallation of the black castle drafts of laborers arrived from the buskin shovels over their shoulders and terror in their eyes our men put down their tools and assumed guardianship and supervisory roles occasionally the black castle sputtered making a feeble attempt to interfere like a volcano muttering to itself after its energy has been spent the locals sometimes scattered and had to be rounded up we lost a lot of good will won earlier a sheepish yet angry pawnbroker came looking for me gravity accentuated by the afternoon sunlight i eased away and went to meet him whats the bad news that damned shed made a run for it in the confusion confusion the city went crazy when the taken started sniping at the castle we lost track of shed by the time goblin found him he was on a ship headed for meadenvil i tried to keep it from pulling out but they wouldnt stop i shot them up then grabbed a boat and went after them but i couldnt catch up after cursing pawnbroker and stifling an urge to strangle him i sat down to think whats the matter with him pawn whats he afraid of everything croaker his own shadow i reckon he figured we were going to kill him goblin says it was more than that but you know how he loves to complicate stuff like what goblin says he wants to make a clean break with the old shed fear of us was the motivation he needed to get moving clean break you know like from guilt about everything he did and from reprisals by the inquisitors bullock knows he was in on the catacombs raid bullock would jump on him as soon as he got back i stared down at the shadowed harbor ships were getting under way still the waterfront looked naked if outsiders kept running we would become very unpopular juniper depended heavily on trade you find elmo tell him say i think you ought to go after shed find kingpin and those guys and bring them back check on darling and bullock while youre at it he looked like a man condemned but did not protest he had several screwups to his credit being separated from his comrades was a cheap penalty to pay right he said and hustled off i returned to the task at hand disorganization resolved itself as the troops formed the locals into work crews the earth was flying first a good deep trench so the creatures from the castle would have trouble getting out then a palisade behind that one of the taken remained airborne circling high above watching the castle wagons began coming up from the city carrying timber and rubble down there other work crews were demolishing buildings for materials though they were structures unfit for occupation and long overdue for replacement they housed people who were not going to love us for destroying their homes oneeye and a sergeant named shaky took a large labor draft around the castle down to the roughest slope and began a mine designed to drop part of the castle wall down the steep slope they did nothing to conceal their purpose wasnt much point trying the things we faced had the power to knife through any subterfuge actually managing to breech the wall would be a tough job it might take weeks even with oneeye helping the miners would have to cut through many yards of solid rock the project was one of several feints the lieutenant would employ though the way he plans a siege one days feint can become anothers main thrust drawing on a manpower pool like juniper he could exercise every option i felt a certain pride watching the siege take shape i have been with the company a long time never had we undertaken so ambitious a project never had we been given the wherewithal i wandered around till i found the lieutenant whats the plan here anyway nobody ever told me anything just nail them down so they cant get out then the taken will jump all over them i grunted basic and simple i expected it would get more complicated the creatures inside would fight i fispect the dominator was lying restless shaping a counterstroke must be hell to be buried alive able to do nothing but wish and hope at minions far beyond direct control such impotence would destroy me in a matter of hours i told the lieutenant about sheds escape he did not get excited shed meant little to him he did not know about raven and darling to him raven was a deserter and darling his camp follower nothing special i wanted him to know about shed so he would mention it to the captain the captain might want to take action more vigorous than my recommendation to elmo i stayed with the lieutenant a while he watching the work crews i watching a wagon train come uphill this one should be bringing supper getting damned tired of cold meals i muttered tell you what you ought to do croaker you ought to get married and settle down sure i replied more sarcastically than i felt right after you no really this might be the place to do it set yourself up in practice catering to the rich that dukes family say then when your girlfriend gets here you pop the question and youre all set daggers of ice drove into my soul twisting i croaked girlfriend he grinned sure nobody told you shes coming out for the big show going to run it personally be your big chance my big chance but for what he was talking about the lady of course it had been years but still they rode me about some romantic stories i wrote before i actually met the lady they always ride anybody about anything they know will get their goat all part of the game all part of the brotherhood i bet the sonofabitch had been boiling with the news since first he heard it waiting to spring in on me the lady coming to juniper i considered deserting for real while there was a ship or two left to get away chapter thirtysix juniper fireworks the castle lulled us let us think we could slam the door without a squawk for two days the labor crews ripped at the north ridge gouging out a good deep trench getting up much of the needed stockade hammering out a nice beginning of a mine then they let us in on their displeasure it was a little bit chaotic and a whole lot hairy and in retrospect it seems it may not have started as what it became it was a moonless night but labor crews were working by firelight torchlight lanternlight the lieutenant had wooden towers going up each hundred feet where the trench and palisade were complete and nearby them small ballistae for mounting atop them a waste of time i thought what value mundane siege equipment against minions of the dominator but the lieutenant was our siege specialist he was determined to do things properly by the numbers even if the ballistae never were used they had to be available sharpeyed company members were in the towers nearing completion trying to see into the castle one detected movement at the gate instead of raising a fuss he sent a message down the lieutenant went up he decided that someone had left the castle and slipped around to oneeyes side he had drums sounded trumpets blown and fire arrows shot into the air the alarm wakened me i rushed up to see what was happening for a while there was nothing to see on the far slope oneeye and shaky stood to arms their workers panicked many were killed or crippled trying to flee across the brushy rocky steep slope a minority had sense enough to stand fast the castle folks wanted to make a quick strike and catch some of oneeyes workers drag them inside and complete whatever rites were necessary to bring the dominator through once they were discovered their strategy shifted the men in the towers yelled that more were coming out the lieutenant ordered harassing fire he had a couple of small trebuchets chuck balls of burning brush into the area near the gate and he sent men to find goblin and silent figuring they could do more than he to provide needed illumination goblin was down in the buskin it would take him an hour to respond i had no idea where silent might be i had not seen him though he had been in juniper a week the lieutenant had signal fires lighted to warn watchers on ouretiles walls that we had a situation the taken above finally came down to investigate it proved to be the limper his first act was to take a handful of javelins do something to them then cast them to earth from above they became pillars of chartreuse light between trench and castle on the far slope oneeye provided his own illumination by spinning spiderwebs of violet and hanging their corners on the breeze they quickly betrayed the approach of a halfdozen shapes in black arrows and javelins flew the creatures suffered several casualties before they took exception light blazed then faded into a shimmer which surrounded each they attacked other shapes appeared atop the castle wall they hurled objects downslope the size of a mans head they bounded toward the minehead oneeye did something to alter their course only one escaped him it left a trail of unconscious soldiers and workers the castle creatures had evidently planned for every possibility but oneeye they were able to give the limper hell but did nothing about oneeye at all he shielded his men and made them fight toetotoe when the castle creatures closed most of his men were killed but they wiped out their attackers by then the castle creatures were mounting a sortie against the trench and wall directly toward where i stood watching i recall being more puzzled than fearful how many were there shed had given the impression the castle was practically untenanted but a good twentyfive of them attacking with wizardry backing them made the trench and wall almost pointless they came out the gate and something came over the castle wall vast and bladderlike it hit the ground bounded twice mashed down on the trench and palisade crushing one and filling the other the sortie streaked for the opening those creatures could move the limper came down out of the night shrieking with the fury of his descent glowing ever more brightly as he dropped the glow peeled off in flakes the size of maple seeds which fluttered in his wake spinning and twisting earthward eating into whatever they contacted four or five attackers went down the lieutenant launched a hasty counterattack finished several of the injured then had to retreat several of the creatures dragged fallen soldiers toward the castle the others came on without a heroic bone in my body i picked up my heels and headed across the slope and a wise move that proved the air crackled and sparked and opened like a window something poured through from somewhere else the slope froze so cold and so fast the air itself turned to ice the air around me rushed into the affected area and it too froze the cold took most of the castle creatures enveloping them in frost a random javelin struck one the creature shattered turning to powder and small shards men hurled whatever missiles were available destroying the others the opening closed after only a few seconds the relative warmth of the world sapped the bitter cold fogs boiled up concealed the area for several minutes when they cleared no trace of the creatures could be found meantime three untouched creatures raced down the road toward juniper elmo and an entire platoon raged in pursuit above the limper passed the apex of a climb and descended for a strike upon the fortress as another band of creatures came out they grabbed up whatever bodies they could and hurried back limper adjusted his descent and hit them half went down the others dragged at least a dozen dead men inside a pair of those flying balls came shrieking across from duretile and impacted the castle wall hurling up a shield of color another carpet dropped behind limper it released something which plunged into the black castle there was a flash so brilliant it blinded people for miles around i was facing away at the moment but even so fifteen seconds passed before my vision recovered enough to show me the fortress afire this was not the shifting fire we had seen earlier this was more like a conflagration actually consuming the stuff of the fortress itself strange screams came from inside they set chills crawling my spine they were screams not of pain but of rage creatures appeared on the battlements flailing away with what looked like catsoninetails extinguishing the flames wherever the flames had burned the fortress was visibly diminished a steady stream of ball pairs howled across the valley i do not see that they contributed anything yet im sure there was purpose behind them a third carpet dropped while limper and the other were climbing this one trailed a cloud of dust wherever the dust touched it had an effect like limpers maple seeds only generalized exposed castle creatures shrieked in agony several seemed to melt the others abandoned the walls events proceeded in like fashion for quite a while with the black castle appearing to get the worst of it yet they had gotten those bodies inside and i suspected that meant trouble sometime during all this asa made a getaway i was unaware of it so was everyone else till hours later when pawnbroker spotted him going into the iron lily but pawnbroker was a good distance away and the lily was doing a booming business despite the hour with everyone who could gathered for drinks while watching the fury on the north ridge pawnbroker lost him in the mob i expect asa spoke to sheds sisterinlaw and learned that he too had escaped we never had time to interview her meantime the lieutenant was getting things under control he had the casualties cleared away from the break in the circumvallation he moved ballistae into position to fire into any further breakout attempt he had pit traps dug sent laborers around to replace those oneeye had lost the taken continued their harassment of the castle though at a more leisurely pace they had shot their best bolls early the occasional pair of balls howled over from duretile i later learned that silent was throwing them having been taught by the taken the worst of it seemed over except for the three escapees elmo was hunting we had contained the thing the limper peeled off to join the hunt for the three whisper returned to duretile to refurbish her store of nasty tricks feather patrolled above the castle dipping down occasionally when its denizens came out to battle the last consuming flames relative peace had returned nobody rested though bodies had been hauled inside we all wondered if they had gleaned enough to bring the dominator through but they were up to something else in there a group of creatures appeared on the wall setting up a device pointing downslope feather dove bam smoke boiled around her illuminated from within she came out wobbling bam and bam again and thrice more still and after the last she could no longer hold it she was afire a comet arcing up out away and down into the city a violent explosion occurred where she hit in moments a savage conflagration raged upon the waterfront the fire spread swiftly among the tightly packed tenements whisper was out of duretile and hitting the black castle in minutes with the vicious dust that melted and the fire that burned the stuff of the fortress itself there was an intensity to her flying that betrayed her anger over feathers fall the limper meantime broke off hunting escapees to help fight the fire in the buskin with his aid it was controlled within hours without him the entire district might have burned elmo got two of the fugitives the third vanished utterly when the hunt resumed with the help of the taken no trace could be found whisper maintained her attack till she exhausted her resources that came well after sunrise the fortress looked more like a giant hunk of slag than a castle yet she had not overcome it oneeye when he came around seeking more tools told me there was plenty of activity inside chapter thirtyseven juniper the calm i caught a twohour nap the lieutenant allowed half the troops and workers the same then the other half when i wakened i found few changes except that the captain had sent pockets over to establish a field hospital pockets had been down in the buskin trying to win friends with free medical attention i looked in found only a handful of patients and the situation under control went on to check the siegework the lieutenant had repaired the gap in the palisade and trench he had extended both intending to take them all the way around despite the difficulty of the nether slope new heavier missile weapons were under construction he was not content to rely upon the taken to reduce the place he did not trust them to do the necessary sometime during my brief sleep drafts of candys prisoners came up but the lieutenant did not permit the civilians to leave he put them to gathering earth while he scoped out a site for building a ramp i suggested youd better get some sleep need to ride herd he said he had a vision his talent had gone unused for years he wanted this i suspect he found the taken an irritation despite the formidable nature of the black castle its your show i said but you wont be much good if they hit back and youre too exhausted to think straight we were communicating on a level outside words weariness had us all fragmented and choppy neither our thoughts nor actions nor speech moving logically or linearly he nodded curtly youre right he surveyed the slope seems to be clicking ill go down to the hospital have somebody get me if something happens the hospital tent was the nearest place out of the sun it was a bright clear intense day promising to be unseasonably warm i looked forward to that i was tired of shivering will do he was right about things running smoothly they usually do once the men know what has to be done from the viewpoint of the limper who again had the air patrol the slope must have looked like an overturned anthill six hundred company troops were supervising the efforts of ten times as many men from the city the road uphill carried so much traffic it was being destroyed despite the nights excitement and their lack of sleep i found the men in excellent spirits they had been on the march so long doing nothing else that they had developed a big store of violent energy it was pouring out now they worked with an eagerness which infected the locals those seemed pleased to participate in a task which required the concerted efforts of thousands some of the more thoughtful mentioned that juniper had mounted no major communal effort in generations one man suggested that that was why the city had gone to seed he believed the black company and its attack on the black castle would be great medicine for a moribund body politic that however was not a majority opinion candys prisoners especially resented being used as a labor force they represented a strong potential for trouble i have been told i always look at the dark underbelly of tomorrow possibly youre less likely to be disappointed that way the excitement i expected did not materialize for days the castle creatures seemed to have pulled their hole in after them we eased the pace slightly ceased working as if everything had to be done before tomorrow the lieutenant completed the circumvallation including the back slope looping around oneeyes excavation he then broke the front wall and began building his ramp he did not use many mantlets for he designed it to provide its own shielding it rose steeply at our end with steps constructed of stone from demolished buildings the work crews downtown were now pulling down structures ruined in the fire following feathers crash there were more materials than could be used in the siege candys outfit was salvaging the best to use in new housing planned for the cleared sites the ramp would rise till it overtopped the castle by twenty feet then it would descend to the wall the work went faster than i expected so did oneeyes project he found a combination of spells which turned stone soft enough to be worked easily he soon reached a point beneath the castle then he ran into the material that looked like obsidian and could go no farther so he started spreading out the captain himself came over i had been wondering what he was doing i asked finding ways to keep people busy he said he shambled around erratically if we did not pay attention we found ourselves wandering off after he made some sudden turn and went to inspect something apparently trivial damned whisper is turning me into a military governor uhm what croaker im the annalist remember got to get this all down somewhere he frowned eyeballed a barrel of water set aside for animals water was a problem a lot had to be hauled to augment the little we caught during the occasional shower she has me running the city doing what the duke and city fathers should he kicked a rock and said nothing more till it stopped rolling guess im coping isnt anybody in town who isnt working arent getting paid anything but keep but theyre working even got people lined up with projects they want done as long as were making people work the custodians are driving me crazy cant tell them all their cleanups may be pointless i caught an odd note in that it underscored a feeling id had already that he was depressed about what was happening whys that he glanced around no natives were within earshot just a guess mind nobodys put it in words but i think the lady plans to loot the catacombs people arent going to like that i know you know i know even whisper and limper know but we dont give the orders theres talk about how the lady is short of money in all the years wed been in her service wed never missed a payday the lady played that straight the troops got paid be they mercenaries or regulars i suspect the various outfits could tolerate a few delays its almost a tradition for commanders to screw their troops occasionally most of us didnt much care about money anyway we tended toward inexpensive and limited tastes i suppose attitudes would shift if we had to do without though too many men under arms on too many frontiers the captain mused too much expansion too fast for too long the empire cant take the strain the effort in the barrowland ate up her reserves and its still going if she whips the dominator look for things to change maybe we made a mistake eh made a lot which one are you talking about coming north over the sea of torments yes ive known that for years and and we cant get out not yet someday maybe when our orders take us back to the jewel cities or somewhere where we could leave the empire and still find ourselves in a civilized country there was an almost bottomless yearning in his voice the longer i spend in the north the less i want to end my days here croaker put that in your annals i had him talking a rare occurrence i merely grunted hoping he would continue filling the silence he did were running with the darkness croaker i know that dont make no nevermind really logically were the black company were not good or evil were just soldiers with swords for sale but im tired of having our work turned to wicked ends if this looting thing happens l may step aside raven had the right idea back at charm he got the hell out i then set forth a notion that had been in the back of my mind for years one id never taken seriously knowing it quixotic that doesnt contribute anything captain we also have the option of going the other way eh he came back from whatever faraway place ruled him and really looked at me dont be silly croaker thats a fools game the lady squashes anybody who tries he ground a heel into the earth like a bug yeah it was a silly idea on several levels not the least of which was that the other side could not afford us i could not picture us in the rebel role anyway the majority of rebels were idiots fools or ambitious types hoping to grab a chunk of what the lady had darling was the outstanding exception and she was more symbol than substance and a secret symbol at that eight years since the comet was in the sky the captain said you know the legends she wont fall till the great comet is up there you want to try surviving twentynine years on the run from the taken no croaker even if our hearts were with the white rose we couldnt make that choice thats suicide getting out of the empire is the way shed come after us why why shouldnt she be satisfied with what shes had of us these ten years were no threat to her but we were we very much were if only because we knew of the existence of the reincarnation of the white rose and i was sure that once we left the empire either silent or i would spill that secret of course the lady did not know that we knew this chatter is an exercise in futility the captain said id rather not talk about it as you wish tell me what were going to do here the lady is coming in tonight whisper says well begin the assault as soon as the auspices are right i glanced at the black castle no he said it wont be easy it may not be possible even with the lady helping if she asks about me tell her im dead or something i said that won a smile but croaker shes your raven i snapped i know things about him that could get us all killed so does silent get him out of duretile before she gets here neither one of us dares face the eye for that neither do i because i know you know something were going to have to take our chances croaker right so dont put notions into her head i expect shes forgotten you long since croaker youre just another soldier chapter thirtyeight juniper the storm the lady hadnt forgotten me not even a little shortly after midnight a grim elmo rousted me out whisper is here wants you croaker eh i hadnt done anything to arouse her ire not for weeks they want you over to duretile she wants you whisper is here to take you back ever seen a grown man faint i havent but i came close i may have come close to having a stroke too my blood pressure must have soared for two minutes i was vertiginous and unable to think my heart pounded my guts ached with fear i knew she was going to drag me in for a session with the eye which sees every secret buried in a mans mind and yet i could do nothing to evade her it was too late to run i wished i had been aboard the ship to meadenvil with pawnbroker like a man walking to the gallows i went out to whispers carpet settled myself behind her and dwindled into my thoughts as we rose and rushed through the chill night toward duretile as we passed over the port whisper called back you must have made quite an impression back when physician you were the first person she asked about when she got here i found enough presence of mind to ask why i suspect because she wants her story recorded again as she did during the battle at charm i looked up from my hands startled how had she known that id always pictured the taken and lady as uncommunicative among themselves what she said was true during the battle at charm the lady had dragged me around with her so the events of the day would be recorded as they happened and she did not demand special treatment in fact she insisted i write stuff as i saw it there was just the faintest whiff of a hint that she expected to be toppled sometime and once she was expected maltreatment by historians she wanted a neutral record to exist i hadnt thought about that for years it was one of the more curious anomalies id noted about her she did not care what people thought of her but was frightened that the record would be bastardized to suit someone elses ends the tiniest spark of hope rose from that maybe she did want a record kept maybe i could get through this if i could remain nimble enough to avoid the eye the captain met us when we landed on duretiles northern wall a glance at the carpets there told me all the taken were on hand even journey whom i had expected to remain in the barrowland but journey would have a grudge to soothe feather had been his wife a second glance told me the captain was silently apologetic about my situation that there were things he wanted to say but dared not i fed him a tiny shrug hoped we would get a moment later we did not whisper led me from the wall directly into the ladys presence she hadnt changed an iota since i had seen her last the rest of us had aged terribly but she remained twenty forever radiantly gorgeous with stunning black hair and eyes into which a man could fall and die she was as always such a focal point of glamor that she could not be physically described a detailed description would be pointless anyway as what i saw was not the true lady the lady who looked like that hadnt existed for four centuries if ever she rose and came to greet me a hand extended i could not tear my eyes away she rewarded me with the slightly mocking smile i recalled so well as though we shared a secret i touched her hand lightly and was astonished to find it warm away from her when she vanished from mind except as a distant object of dread like an earthquake i could think of her only as cold dead and deadly more on the order of a lethal zombie than a living breathing even possibly vulnerable person she smiled a second time and invited me to take a seat i did so feeling grotesquely out of place amidst a company which included all but one of the great evils of the world and the dominator was there in spirit casting his cold shadow i was not there to contribute that became obvious the captain and lieutenant did the talking for the company the duke and custodian hargadon were there too but contributed little more than i the taken carried the discussion questioning the captain and lieutenant only once was i addressed and that by the captain who inquired as to my readiness to treat casualties from the fighting the meeting had only one point so far as i was concerned the assault was set for dawn day after the one coming up it would continue till the black castle was destroyed or we lost our capacity to attack the place is a hole in the bottom of the ship of empire the lady said it has to be plugged or we all drown she entertained no protests from the duke or hargadon both of whom regretted asking her for help the duke was now impotent within his own domain and hargadon little better the custodian suspected he would be out of work entirely once the threat of the castle ended few of the company and none of the taken had been at any pains to conceal their disdain for junipers odd religion having spent a lot of time among the people i could say they took it only as seriously as the inquisitors custodians and a few fanatics made them i hoped she went slow if she intended changes though like so slow the company would be headed elsewhere before she started you mess with peoples religion and you mess with fire even people who dont much give a damn religion is something that gets hammered in early and never really goes away and has powers to move which go beyond anything rational morning after the day coming up total war allout effort to eradicate the black castle every resource of the lady taken company and juniper to be bent to that end for as long as it took morning after the day coming up but it did not work that way nobody told the dominator he was supposed to wait he got in the first strike six hours before jumpoff while most of the troops and all the civilian laborers were asleep while the only taken patrolling was journey who was the least of the ladys henchmen it began when one of those bladderlike things bounced over the wall and filled the gap remaining in the lieutenants ramp at least a hundred creatures stormed out of the castle and crossed journey was alert he had sensed a strangeness in the castle and was watching for trouble he came down fast and drenched those attackers with the dust that melted bam bambambam the castle hit him the way it had hit his onetime wife he fishtailed through the air evading the worst but caught the edge of every crack and went down smouldering his carpet destroyed the banging wakened me it wakened the entire camp for it started the same time as the alarms and drowned them entirely i charged out of the hospital saw the castle creatures boiling down the steps of the lieutenants ramp journey hadnt stopped more than a handful they were enveloped by that protective glow oneeye had encountered once before they spread out sprinting through a storm of missiles from the men who had the watch a few more fell but not many they began extinguishing lights i suppose because their eyes were more suited to darkness than ours men were running everywhere dragging their clothing on as they rushed toward or away from the enemy the laborers panicked and greatly hampered the companys response many were killed by our men vexed at finding them in the way the lieutenant charged through the chaos bellowing orders first he got his batteries of heavy weapons manned and trained on the steps he sent messengers everywhere ordering every ballista catapult mangonel and trebuchet moved to a position where it could fire on the ramp that baffled me only till the first castle creature headed home with a body under each arm a storm of missiles hit him tore the bodies to shreds battered him to a pulp and nearly buried him the lieutenant had trebuchets throw cannisters of oil which smashed on the steps and caught fire when flaming balls were thrown after them he kept the oil and fire flying the castle creatures would not run through the flames so much for my thinking the lieutenant was wasting time building useless engines the man knew his job he was good his preparation and quick response were more valuable than anything done by the lady or taken that night he held the line in the critical minutes a mad battle began the moment the creatures realized they were cut off they promptly attacked trying to reach the engines the lieutenant signaled his underofficers and brought the bulk of his available manpower to bear he had to those creatures were more than a match for any two soldiers and they benefited from the protective glow as well here there a brave citizen of juniper grabbed a fallen weapon and jumped into the struggle most paid the ultimate price but their sacrifice helped keep the enemy away from the engines it was obvious to everyone that if the creatures escaped with many bodies our cause was lost wed soon be facetoface with their master himself the ball pairs began coming over from duretile splashing the night with terrible color then taken dropped from the night limper and whisper each depositing an egg which hatched the fire that fed on the stuff of the castle limper dodged several attacks from the castle swooped around brought his carpet to ground near my hospital where we were swamped by customers already i had to retreat there to do the job for which i was paid i kept the uphill tent flaps open so i could watch limper left his aerial steed marched uphill with a long black sword that glimmered evilly in the light from the burning fortress he radiated a glow not unlike that protecting the castle creatures his however was far more puissant than theirs as he demonstrated when he pushed through the press and attacked them their weapons could not reach him his sliced through them as though they were made of lard the creatures by that time had slaughtered at least five hundred men the majority were workers but the company had taken a terrible beating too and that beating went on even after the limper turned the tide for he could engage but one creature at a time our people strove to keep the enemy contained till the limper could get to them they responded by trying to swamp the limper which they managed with some success fifteen or twenty piling on and keeping him pinned by sheer body weight the lieutenant shifted the fire of the engines temporarily pounded that seething pile till it broke up and the limper regained his feet that ploy having failed a band of the creatures clotted up and tried to break out to the west i dont know whether they planned to escape entirely or meant to swing around and strike from behind the dozen who made it through encountered whisper and a heavy fall of the melting dust the dust killed a halfdozen workers for every castle creature but it stopped the charge only five creatures survived it those five immediately encountered the portal from elsewhere that expelled the cold breath of the infinite they all perished whisper meantime was scrambling for altitude a drumroll procession of bangs pursued her up the sky she was a better flyer than journey but even so could not evade injury down she came eventually touching down beyond the fortress within the castle itself creatures were out with the catsoninetails extinguishing the fires started by whisper and the limper the structure had begun to look pathetic so much of its substance had been consumed gone was the dark dreadful grace of weeks before it was one big dark glassy lump and it seemed impossible that creatures could survive inside it yet they did and continued the fight a handful came out on the ramp and did something which gnawed black chunks out of the lieutenants conflagration all the creatures on the slope ran for home not a one forgetting to scoop up at least one body the ice door opened again its breath dumping on the steps the fires died instantly a score of the creatures died too hammered to powder by the lieutenants missiles the things inside took a tack i had anticipated fearfully since i had seen feather crash they turned their booming spell on the slope if it wasnt the thing that had pursued the lieutenant elmo oneeye and me that day it was a close cousin there wasnt much flash or smoke when they used it on the slope but huge holes appeared often with bloody pulp smashed into their bottoms all this happened so swiftly so dramatically that nobody really had time to think i dont doubt that even the company would have run had events been stretched out enough to allow thinking time as it was in their confusion the men had a chance only to pursue roles for which they had been preparing since reaching juniper they stood their ground and too often died the limper scampered around the slope like an insane chicken cackling and hunting creatures who hadnt died on the steps there were a score of those most surrounded by angry soldiers some of the creatures were slain by their own side for those knots made tempting targets for the booming spell teams of creatures appeared on the ramparts assembling devices like the one wed seen them try to use before this time there was no taken above to drop and give them hell not till fool journey came rushing past the hospital looking cruelly battered and stole the limpers carpet it had been my notion that one taken could not use anothers vehicle not so apparently for journey got the thing aloft and dove upon the castle again dumping dust and another fire egg the castle knocked him down again and despite the tumult i heard the limper howling and cursing him for it ever see how a child draws a straight line none too straight something as shaky as a childs hand scribbled a wobbly line from duretile to the black castle it hung against the night like an improbable clothesline wriggling of indeterminate color irridescent its tip threw sparks off the obsidian material like the meeting of flint and steel magnified ten thousand times generating an actinic glare too intense to view directly the entire slope was bathed in wild bluish light i put aside my instruments and stepped out to better observe for down in my gut i knew the lady anchored the nether end of that scrawl having entered the lists for the first time she was the big one the most powerful and if the castle could be reduced at all hers was the might that would do it the lieutenant must have been distracted for a few seconds his fires dwindled a halfdozen castle creatures went up the steps dragging two and three corpses apiece a rush of their compatriots came out to meet the limper who was in hot pursuit my guess is they got twelve bodies inside some might not have lost the spark of life entirely chunks flew from the castle where the ladys line touched each blazing with that brilliant light thin cracks in crimson appeared against the black spreading slowly the creatures assembling the devices retreated were replaced by others trying to lessen the effects of the ladys attack they had no luck several were knocked down by missiles from the lieutenants batteries the limper reached the head of the stairs and stood limned against the glow of a section of castle still afire sword raised high a giant runt if you will pardon the contradiction he is a tiny thing yet stood huge at that moment he bellowed follow me and charged down the ramp to my everlasting amazement men followed him hundreds of men i saw elmo and the remnants of his company go roaring up across and disappear even scores of gutsy citizens decided to take part part of the story of marron shed had come out recently without names or such but with heavy emphasis on how much wealth he and raven had garnered obviously the story had been planted against this moment when a storm of manpower would be needed to subdue the castle in ensuing minutes the call of wealth led many a man from the buskin up those steps down on the far side of the castle whisper reached oneeyes camp oneeye and his men of course had stood to arms but had taken part in nothing yet his mine operation had stalled once he was certain there was no way to get around or to breech the substance of the castle whisper brought one of those eggs of fire planted it against the obsidian exposed by oneeyes mine she set it off and let it gnaw at the fortresss underbelly that i learned later had been in the plan for some time she had done some fancy flying to bring her crippled carpet down near oneeye so she could carry it out seeing the men pour into the castle seeing the walls abandoned and being broken up by the lady seeing fires burning unchecked i decided the battle was ours and was all over but the crying i went back into the hospital and resumed cutting and stitching setting and just plain shaking my head over men for whom there was nothing i could do i wished oneeye werent on the far side of the ridge hed always been my principal assistant and i missed him while i could not denigrate pockets skill he did not have oneeyes talent often there was a man beyond my help who could be saved with a little magic a whoop and howl told me journey was back home from his latest crash and rushing his enemies once more and not far behind him came those elements of the company which had been stationed in the buskin the lieutenant met candy and prevented him from rushing over the ramp instead he manned the perimeter and began rounding up those laborers who could be found still close to the action he started putting things back together the bam weapon had continued pounding away all along now it began to falter the lieutenant loudly cursed the fact that there were no carpets to drop fire eggs there was one the ladys and i was sure she knew the situation but she did not abandon her rope of irridescent light she must have felt it to be more important down in the mine the fire gnawed through the bottom of the fortress a hole slowly expanded oneeye says there is very little heat associated with those flames the moment whisper considered it opportune she led his force into the fortress oneeye says he really considered going but had a bad feeling about it he watched the mob charge in workers and all then hiked around to our side he joined me in the hospital and updated me as he worked moments after he arrived the backside of the castle collapsed the whole earth rumbled a long roar rolled down the thousand feet of the back slope very dramatic but to little effect the castle creatures were not inconvenienced at all parts of the forewall were falling too broken by the ladys incessant attack company members continued to arrive accompanied by frightened formations of the dukes men and even some custodians rigged out as soldiers the lieutenant fed them into his lines he allowed no one else to enter the castle strange lights and fires fell howls and noises and terrible terrible odors came out of that place i dont know what happened in there maybe i never will i gather that hardly anyone came back a strange deepthroated almost inaudible moaning began it had me shuddering before i noted it consciously it climbed in pitch with extreme deliberation in volume much more rapidly soon it shook the whole ridge it came from everywhere at once after a while it seemed to have meaning like speech incredibly slowed i could detect a rhythm like words stretched over minutes one thought one thought alone the dominator he was coming through for an instant i thought i could interpret the words ardath you bitch but that went away chased by fear goblin appeared at the hospital looked us over and seemed relieved to find oneeye there he said nothing and i got no chance to ask what he had been up to recently he returned to the night parting with a wave silent appeared a few minutes later looking grim silent my partner in guilty knowledge whom i had not seen in more than a year whom i had missed during my visit to duretile he looked taller leaner and bleaker than ever he nodded began talking rapidly in deaf speech there is a ship on the waterfront flying a red banner go there immediately what go to the ship with the red banner immediately stop only to inform others of the old company these are orders from the captain they are not to be disobeyed oneeye i caught it croaker he said what the hell hey silent silent signed there will be trouble with the taken this ship will sail to meadenvil where loose ends must be tied off those who know too much must disappear come we just gather the old brothers and go there werent many old brothers around oneeye and i hurried around telling everyone we could find and in fifteen minutes a crowd of us were headed toward the port river bridge one as baffled as another i kept looking back elmo was inside the castle elmo who was my best friend elmo who might be taken by the taken chapter thirtynine on the run ninetysix men reported aboard as ordered a dozen were men for whom the order had not been meant but who could not be sent away missing were a hundred brothers from the old days before we crossed the sea of torments some had died on the slopes some were inside the castle some we hadnt been able to find but none of the missing were men who had dangerous knowledge except elmo and the captain i was there silent oneeye and goblin were there the lieutenant was there more baffled than anyone else candy otto hagop the list goes on and on they were all there but elmo wasnt and the old man wasnt and there was a threat of mutiny when silent passed the word to put out without them orders was all he would say and that in the finger speech many of the men could not follow though we had been using it for years it was a legacy darling had left the company a mode of communication useful on the hunt or battlefield the moment the ship was under way silent produced a sealed letter marked with the captains sign silent took the officers present into the cabin of the ships master he instructed me to read the letter aloud you were right about the taken croaker i read they do suspect and they do intend to move against the company i have done what i can to circumvent them by hiring a ship to take my most endangered brothers to safety i will not be able to join you as my absence would alert the taken do not dawdle i do not expect to last long once they discover your desertion as you and goblin can attest no man hides from the ladys eye i do not know that flight will present much hope they will hunt you for they will get things from me unless i am quick on my feet i know enough to set them on the trail the lieutenant interrupted what the hell is going on he knew there were secrets some of us shared to which he was not privy id say were past playing games and keeping things from each other i looked at silent said i think we should tell everybody just so theres a chance the knowledge wont die silent nodded lieutenant darling is the white rose what but yes silent and i have known since the battle at charm raven figured it out first thats why he deserted he wanted to get her as far from the lady as he could you know how much he loved her i think a few others guessed too the announcement did not cause a stir only the lieutenant was surprised the others had suspected the captains letter hadnt much more to say farewells a suggestion we elect the lieutenant to replace him and a final private word to me circumstances seem to have dictated a shift to the option you mentioned croaker unless you can outrun the taken back to the south i could hear the sardonic chuckle that went with the comment oneeye wanted to know what had become of the company treasure chest way way back in our service to the lady we had grabbed off a fortune in coin and gems it had traveled with us through the years through good times and badour final secret insurance against tomorrow silent told us it was up in duretile with the old man there had been no chance to get it out oneeye broke down and wept that chest meant more to him than all vicissitudes past present or promised goblin got down on him sparks flew the lieutenant was about to take a hand when someone shoved through the door you guys better come topside and see this he was gone before we could find out what he meant we hurried up to the main deck the ship was a good two miles down the port riding the current and tide but the glow from the black castle illuminated both us and juniper as brightly as a cloudy day the castle formed the base of a fountain of fire reaching miles into the sky a vast figure twisted in the flames its lips moved long slow words echoed down the port ardath you bitch i had been right the figures hand rose slowly lazily pointed toward duretile they got enough bodies inside goblin squeaked the old bastard is coming through the men watched in rapt awe so did i able only to think we were lucky to escape in time at the moment i felt nothing for the men we had left behind i could think only of myself there somebody said softly oh look there a ball of light formed on duretiles wall it swelled rapidly shedding many colors it was gorgeous like a giant moon of stained glass rotating slowly it was at least two hundred yards in diameter when it separated from duretile and drifted toward the black castle the figure there reached grabbed at the globe was unable to affect it i giggled whats so damned funny the lieutenant demanded just thinking how the people of juniper must feel looking up at that theyve never seen sorcery the stained glass ball rolled over and over for a moment it presented a side i hadnt noticed before a side that was a face the ladys face those great glassy eyes stared right into me hurting without thinking i said i didnt betray you you betrayed me swear to the gods there was some form of communication something in the eyes said she had heard and was pained by the accusation then the face rolled away and i did not see it again the globe drifted into the fountain of fire it vanished there i thought i heard the long slow voice say i have you ardath there look there the same man said and we turned to duretile and upon the wall where the lady had begun moving toward her husband there was another light for a while i could not make out what was happening it came our way faltering rising falling thats the ladys carpet silent signed i have seen it before but who there was no one left who could fly one the taken were ail over at the black castle the thing began to move faster converting rickety upanddown into everincreasing velocity it came our way faster and faster dropping lower and lower somebody who doesnt know what theyre doing oneeye opined somebody who is going to get killed if it came directly toward us now not more than fifty feet off the water the ship had begun the long turn which would take her around the last headland to the open sea i said maybe it was sent to hit us like a missile to keep us from getting away no oneeye said carpets are too precious too hard to create and maintain and the ladys is the only one left destroy it and even she would have to walk home the carpet was down to thirty feet swelling rapidly sending an audible murmur ahead it must have been traveling a hundred fifty miles an hour then it was on us ripping through the rigging brushing a mast and spinning on to impact on the sound half a mile away a gout of spray arose the carpet skipped like a flat stone hit again bounced again and smashed into the face of a cliff the spell energies ruling the carpet degenerated in a violet flash and not a word was spoken by any member of the company for as that carpet had torn through the rigging we had glimpsed the face of its rider the captain who knows what he was doing trying to join us probably i suspect he went to the wall planning to disable the carpet so it could not be used to pursue us maybe he planned to throw himself off the wall afterward to avoid being questioned later and maybe he had seen the carpet in action often enough to have been tempted by the idea of using it himself no matter he had succeeded the carpet would not be used to chase us he would not be exposed to the eye but he had failed his personal goal he had died in the north his flight and death distracted us while the ship moved down the channel till both juniper and the north ridge dropped behind the headland the fire over the black castle continued its terrible flames extinguishing the stars but it shrank slowly oncoming dawn lessened its brilliance and when one great shriek rolled across the world announcing someones defeat we were unable to determine who had won for us the answer did not matter we would be hunted by either the lady or her longburied spouse we reached the sea and turned south with sailors still cursing as they replaced lines torn by the captains passage we of the company remained very silent scattered about the deck alone with our thoughts and only then did i begin to worry for comrades left behind we held a long service two days out we mourned everyone left behind but the captain especially every survivor took a moment to eulogize him he had been head of the family patriarch father to us all chapter forty meadenvil pathfinding fair weather and good winds carried us to meadenvil in good time the ships master was pleased he had been wellpaid beforehand for his trouble but was eager to shed a manifest of such vile temper we had not been the best of passengers oneeye was terrified of the sea a grand victim of seasickness and insisted everyone else be as scared and sick as he he and goblin never let up on one another though the lieutenant threatened to throw the pair of them to the sharks the lieutenant was in such a foul temper himself that they took him half seriously in accordance with the captains wishes we elected the lieutenant our commander and candy to become second that position should have fallen to elmo we did not call the lieutenant captain that seemed silly with the outfit so diminished there werent enough of us left to make a good street gang last of the free companies of khatovar four centuries of brotherhood and tradition reduced to this a band on the run it did not make sense did not seem right the great deeds of our forebrethren deserved better of their successors the treasure chest was lost but the annals themselves had somehow found their way aboard i expect silent brought them for him they were almost as important as for me the night before we entered meadenvil harbor i read to the troops from the book of woeg which chronicled the companys history after its defeat and near destruction in the fighting along the bake in norssele only a hundred four men survived that time and the company had come back they were not ready for it the pain was too fresh i gave it up halfway through fresh meadenvil was refreshing a real city not a colorless berg like juniper we left the ship with little but our arms and what wealth wed carried in juniper people watched us fearfully and there was no little trepidation on our part too for we were not strong enough to make a show if the local prince took exception to our presence the three wizards were our greatest asset the lieutenant and candy had hopes of using them to pull something that would provide the wherewithal to move on aboard another ship with further hopes of returning to lands we knew on the southern shore of the sea of torments to do that though meant an eventual overland journey at least partly through lands belonging to the lady i thought we would be wiser to move down the coast confuse our trail and hook on with someone out here at least till the ladys armies closed in as they would someday the lady i kept thinking of the lady it was all too likely that her armies now owed allegiance to the dominator we located both pawnbroker and kingpin within hours of going ashore pawnbroker had arrived only two days before us having faced unfavorable seas and winds during his journey the lieutenant started on kingpin immediately where the hell you been boy it was a sure thing kingpin had turned his assignment into an extended vacation he was that sort you were supposed to come back when couldnt sir were witnesses in a murder case cant leave town till after the trial murder case sure ravens dead pawn says you know that well we fixed it so that bullock guy took the rap only weve got to hang around and get him hanged where is he i asked in jail the lieutenant reamed him good cussing and fussing while passersby nervously eyed the hard guys abusing each other in a variety of mystery tongues i suggested we ought to get off the street keep a low profile we got trouble enough without attracting attention lieutenant if you dont mind id like a chat with kingpin maybe these other guys can show you places to hole up king come with me you too i indicated silent goblin and oneeye where we going kingpin asked you pick it someplace where we can talk serious like right he led the way setting a brisk pace wanting to put distance between himself and the lieutenant that really true what happened up there the captain dead and everything too damned true he shook his head awed by the idea of the company having been destroyed finally he asked what do you want to know croaker just everything you found out since you been here especially about raven but also about that guy asa and the tavernkeeper shed i saw him the other day at least i think i did didnt realize it was him till later he was dressed different yeah pawn told me he got away the asa guy too him i think i know where to find the shed guy though well if you really want him youll have to start looking where i thought i saw him he see you that idea caught kingpin by surprise apparently it hadnt occurred to him to wonder he isnt the brightest fellow sometimes i dont think so we went into a tavern favored by foreign sailors the customers were a polyglot lot and as ragged as we were they spoke a dozen languages we settled in at a table used the language of the jewel cities kingpin did not speak it well but understood it i doubted that anyone else there could follow our discussion raven i said thats what i want to know about kingpin he told us a story which matched asas closely the edges being about as uneven as you would expect from someone who hadnt been an eyewitness you still think he faked it oneeye asked yeah its half hunch but i think he did maybe when we go look the place over ill change my mind there a way you guys could tell if hes in town they put their heads together returned a negative opinion not without we had something that belonged to him to start with goblin opined we dont got that kingpin what about darling what about ravens ship huh what happened to darling after raven supposedly died what happened to his ship i dont know about darling the ship is tied up down at its dock we exchanged glances around the table i said that ship gets visited if we have to fight our way aboard those papers i told you about asa couldnt account for them i want them to turn up theyre the only thing we got that can get the lady off our back if there is a lady oneeye said wont be much pumpkin if the dominator broke through dont even think that for no sound reason i had convinced myself that the lady had won mostly it was wishful thinking im sure kingpin were going to visit that ship tonight what about darling like i said i dont know you were supposed to look out for her yeah but she kind of vanished vanished how not how croaker oneeye said in response to vigorous signing from silent how is irrelevant now when all right when kingpin i dont know nobodys seen her since the night before raven died bingo goblin said in a soft awed voice damn your eyes croaker your instincts were right what kingpin asked theres no way she would have disappeared beforehand unless she knew something was going to happen kingpin i said did you go look at the place they were staying inside i mean yeah somebody got there before me what the place was cleaned out i asked the innkeeper he said they didnt move out they was paid up for another month that sounded to me like somebody knew about raven getting croaked and decided to clean his place out i figured it was that asa he disappeared right after what did you do then what i figured you guys didnt want bullock back in juniper so we got him charged with ravens murder there was plenty of witnesses besides us saw them fighting enough to maybe convince a court we really saw what we said you do anything to trace darling kingpin had nothing to say he stared at his hands the rest of us exchanged irritated glances goblin muttered i told elmo it was dumb to send him i guess it was in minutes we had come up with several loose ends overlooked by kingpin how come youre so damned worried about it anyway croaker kingpin demanded i mean it all looks like a big sowhat to me look king like it or not when the taken turned on us we got pushed over to the other side were white rose now whether we want it or not theyre going to come after us the only thing the rebel has going is the white rose right if there is a white rose there is darling is the white rose come on croaker shes a deafmute oneeye observed shes also a magical nullpoint eh magic wont work around her we noticed that clean back at charm and if she follows true for her sort the null will get stronger as she gets older i recalled noting oddities about darling during the battle of charm but hadnt made anything of it then what are you talking about i told you some people are negatives instead of having a talent for sorcery they go the other way it wont work around them and when you think about it thats the only way the white rose makes sense how could a deaf and dumb kid grow up to challenge the lady or dominator on their own ground ill bet the original white rose didnt i didnt know there had been nothing in the histories about her powers or their noteworthy absence this makes it more important to find her oneeye nodded kingpin looked baffled it was easy to fuddle king i decided i explained if magic wont work around her weve got to find her and stay close then the taken wont be able to hurt us oneeye said dont forget that they have whole armies they can send after us if they want us that bad oh my what elmo if he didnt get killed he knows enough to put the whole empire on our trail maybe not so much for us as in hopes well lead them to darling whatre we going to do whyre you looking at me youre the one seems to know whats going on croaker okay i guess first we find out about raven and darling especially darling and we ought to catch shed and asa again in case they know something useful we got to move fast and get out of town before the empire closes in without upsetting the locals we better have a sitdown with the lieutenant get everything on the table for everybody then decide exactly what well do chapter fortyone meadenvil the ship ours apparently was the last ship out of juniper we kept waiting for a later vessel to bring news none came the crew of our vessel did us no favor either they yammered all over town we were buried by nosy locals people concerned about relatives in juniper and the city government concerned that a group of tough refugees might cause trouble candy and the lieutenant dealt with all that the struggle for survival devolved on the rest of us the three wizards otto kingpin and pawnbroker and i stole through the shadowed meadenvil waterfront district after midnight there were strong police patrols to dodge we evaded them with help from oneeye goblin and silent goblin was especially useful he possessed a spell capable of putting men to sleep there she is kingpin whispered indicating ravens ship earlier id tried to find out how her docking fees were being paid id had no luck she was a fine big ship with a look of newness the darkness could not conceal only the normal lights burned aboard her bow stern masthead port and starboard and one at the head of the gangway where a single bored sailor stood watch oneeye he shook his head cant tell i polled the others neither silent nor goblin detected anything remarkable either okay goblin do your stuff thatll be the acid test wont it he nodded if darling was aboard his spell would not affect the watch now that everyone had accepted my suspicions about raven being alive id begun to question them i could see no sense in his not having slipped away by now taking his very expensive ship somewhere far away perhaps out to the islands those islands intrigued me i thought we might grab a ship and head out there had to take someone who knew the way though the islands were a long way out and there was no regular commerce no way to get there by guess work okay goblin said hes out the sailor on the quarterdeck had slumped onto a handy stool he had his arms folded on the rail and his forehead on his arms no darling i said no darling anybody else around no lets go then keep low move fast all that we crossed the pier and scampered up the gangway the sailor stirred goblin touched him and he went out like the dead goblin hustled forward then aft to the men on the rat guards he returned nodding another eight men below all asleep ill put them under you go ahead we started with the biggest cabin assuming it would be the owners it was it sat in the stern where the masters cabin usually is and was split into sections i found things in one indicating that it had been occupied by darling on ravens side we found soiled clothing discarded some time ago there was enough dust to indicate that no one had visited the cabin for weeks we did not find the papers i sought we did find money quite a substantial amount it was cunningly hidden but oneeyes sense for those things is infallible out came a chest brimming with silver i dont reckon raven is going to need that if hes dead oneeye said and if he aintwell tough his old buddies are in need the coins were odd after studying them i recognized what that oddness was they were the same as the coins shed had received at the black castle sniff these things i told oneeye theyre black castle see if theres anything wrong with them nope good as gold he chuckled uhm i hadnt any scruples about lifting the money raven had obtained it by foul means that put it up for grabs it had no provenance as they say in juniper gather round here i got an idea i backed up to the stern lights where i could watch the dock through the glass window they crowded in on me and the chest what goblin demanded why settle for the money why not take the whole damned ship if ravens dead or even faking hes dead whats he going to say about it we could make it our headquarters goblin liked the idea so oneeye didnt the more so because ships had to do with water what about the crew he asked what about the harbormaster and his people theyd get the law down on us maybe but i think we can handle it we move in and lock the crew up theres nobody to complain nobody complains why should the harbormaster be interested the whole crew aint aboard somes out on the town we grab them when they come back hell man what better way to be ready to move out in a hurry and what better place to wait for raven to turn up oneeye gave up objecting he is essentially lazy too there was a gleam in his eye which said he was thinking ahead of me better talk to the lieutenant he said he knows ships goblin knew oneeye well dont look at me if youre thinking about going pirate ive had all the adventure i want i want to go home they got into it and got loud about it and had to be shut up lets worry about getting through the next few days i growled what we do later we can worry about later look we got clothes that belonged to darling and raven can you guys find them now they put their heads together after some discussion goblin announced silent thinks he can trouble is he has to do it like a dog lock on the trail and follow around everywhere raven went right up till he died or didnt if he didnt right on to where he is now but that hell youre spotting him a couple months lead people spend a lot of time not moving around croaker silent would skip over that still sounds slow best you can get unless he comes to us which maybe he cant all right all right what about the ship ask the lieutenant lets see if we can find your damned papers there were no papers oneeye was able to detect nothing hidden anywhere if i wanted to trace the papers id have to start with the crew someone had to help raven take them off we left the ship goblin and pawnbroker found a good spot from which they could watch it silent and otto took off on ravens trail the rest of us went back and wakened the lieutenant he thought taking the ship was a good idea hed never liked raven much i think he was motivated by more than practical considerations chapter fortytwo meadenvil the refugee the rumors and incredible stories swept through meadenvil rapidly shed heard about the ship from juniper within hours of her arrival he was stunned the black company run out crushed by their masters that made no sense what the hell was going on up there his mother sal his friends what had become of them if half the stories were true juniper was a desolation the battle with the black castle had consumed the city he wanted desperately to go find somebody ask about his people he fought the urge he had to forget his homeland knowing that croaker and his bunch the whole thing could be a trick to smoke him out for a day he remained in hiding in his rented room debating till he convinced himself that he should do nothing if the company was on the run it would be leaving again soon us former masters would be looking for it would the taken come after him too no they had no quarrel with him they did not care about his crimes only the custodians wanted him he wondered about bullock rotting in prison accused of ravens murder he did not understand that at all but was too nervous to investigate the answer was not significant in the equation of marron sheds survival after his day in isolation he decided to resume his quest for a place of business he was looking for a partnership in a tavern having decided to stick with what he knew it had to be a better place one that would not lead him into financial difficulties the way the lily had each time he recalled the lily he suffered moments of homesickness and nostalgia of bottomless loneliness he had been a loner all his life but never alone this exile was filled with pain he was walking a narrow shadowed street slogging uphill through mud left by a nighttime rain when something in the corner of his eye sent chills to the deeps of his soul he stopped and whirled so swiftly he knocked another pedestrian down as he helped the man rise apologizing profusely he glared into the shadows of an alley conscience playing tricks on me i guess he murmured after parting with his victim but he knew better he had seen it had heard his name called softly he went to the mouth of the gap between buildings but it had not waited for him a block later he laughed nervously trying to convince himself it had been a trick of imagination after all what the hell would the castle creatures be doing in meadenvil theyd been wiped out but the company guys who had fled here didnt know that for sure did they they had run off before the fight was over they just hoped their bosses had won because the other side was even worse than theirs he was being silly how could the creature have gotten here no ships master would sell passage to a thing like that shed youre worrying yourself silly about nothing he entered a tavern called the ruby glass operated by a man named selkirk sheds landlord had recommended both their discussions were fruitful shed agreed to return the following afternoon shed was sharing a beer with his prospective partner his proposition seemed beneficial for selkirk had satisfied himself as to his character and now was trying to sell him on the ruby glass night business will pick up once the scare is over scare yeah some people have disappeared around the neighborhood five or six in the last week after dark not the kind usually grabbed by the press gangs so people have been staying inside we arent getting the usual night traffic the temperature seemed to drop forty degrees shed sat rigid as a board eyes vacant the old fear sliding through him like the passage of snakes his fingers rose to the shape of the amulet hidden beneath his shirt hey marron whats the matter thats how it started in juniper he said unaware that he was speaking only it was just the dead but they wanted them living if they could get them i have to go shed what the hell is wrong he came out of it momentarily oh sorry selkirk yeah we have a deal but theres something i have to do first something i need to check on what nothing to do with you with us were ready to go ill bring my stuff up tomorrow and we can get together with the people we need to close the deal legally i just have something else to do right now he went out of the place practically running not sure what he could do or where he could start not even if he was sane in his assumption but he was sure that what had happened in juniper would reoccur in meadenvil and a lot faster if the creatures were doing their own collecting he touched his amulet again wondering how much protection it afforded was it puissant or just a promise he hurried to his rooming house where people were patient with his questions knowing he was from out of town he asked about raven the murder had been the talk of the town what with a foreign policeman having been charged on the accusation of his own men but nobody knew anything there was no eyewitness to ravens death except asa and asa was in juniper probably dead the black company would not have wanted him turning witness against them he shed an impulse to contact the survivors they might want him out of the way too he was on his own with this the place where raven had died seemed a likely place to start who knew where that was asa asa was not available who else how about bullock his guts knotted bullock represented everything he feared back home in a cage here but still very much a symbol could he face the man would the man tell him anything finding bullock was no problem the main prison did not move finding the courage to face him even from beyond bars was another matter but this entire city lay under a shadow torment racked shed guilt cut him apart he had done things that left him unable to endure himself he had committed crimes for which there was no way of making restitution yet here was something youre a fool marron shed he told himself dont worry about it meadenvil can look out for itself just move on to another city but something deeper than cowardice told him he could not run and not just from himself a creature from the black castle had appeared in meadenvil two men who had had dealings with the castle had come here that could not be coincidence suppose he moved on what was to keep the creatures from turning up again wherever he went he had made a deal with a devil on a gut level he sensed that the net in which he had been taken had to be unwoven strand by strand he moved the everyday cowardly shed to a throne far behind his eyes and brought forward the shed who had hunted with krage and eventually killed his tormentor he did not recall the cockandbull story he used to get past the wards but did bullshit his way in to see bullock the inquisitor had lost none of his spirit he came to the bars spitting and cursing and promising shed an excruciating death shed countered you aint never going to punish nobody but maybe a cockroach in there shut up and listen forget who you were and remember where you are im the only hope you got of getting out shed was amazed could he have been half as firm without the intervening bars bullocks face went blank go ahead talk i dont know how much you hear in here probably nothing ill run it down after you left juniper the rest of the black company showed up they took over their lady and whatnot came to town they attacked the black castle i dont know how that turned out what word there is makes it sound like the city was wiped out during the fighting some of the company guys grabbed a ship and got out on account of their masters were going to turn on them why i dont know bullock stared at him considering thats the truth from what ive heard secondhand it was those black company bastards got me in here framed me i only had a fight with raven hell he almost killed me hes dead now shed described what asa had seen i have a notion what killed him and why what i need to know is where it happened so i can make sure you tell me that and ill try to get you out i only know approximately i know where i caught up with him and which way him and asa went when they got away that should pin it down pretty close why do you want to know i think the castle creatures planted something on raven like a seed i think thats why he died like the man who brought the original seed to juniper bullock frowned yeah sounds tall but listen to this the other day i saw one of the creatures near where im staying watching me wait i know what they look like i met them also people are disappearing not too many yet not enough to cause a big stink but enough to scare people bullock moved to the back of his cell settled on the floor placed his back against the wall he was quiet for more than a minute shed waited nervously whats your interest innkeeper repayment of a debt bullock the black company kept me prisoner for a while i learned a lot about that castle it was nastier than anybody guessed it was a doorway of sorts through which a creature called the dominator was trying to get into the world i contributed to the growth of that thing i helped it reach the point where it attracted the black company and its sorcerer friends if juniper has been destroyed its as much my fault as anybodys now the same fate threatens meadenvil i can do something to stop it if i can find it bullock sniggered sniggers turned into chuckles chuckles became laughter then rot here shed shouted and started to leave wait shed turned bullock stifled his mirth sorry its so incongruous you so righteous i mean i really believe you mean it all right marron shed give it a shot and if you manage it and you get me out of here i might not drag you back to juniper theres no juniper to drag me to bullock rumor says the lady planned to loot the catacombs after she finished the black castle you know what that means allout rebellion bullocks humor vanished straight down the shaker road past the twelfth mile marker left on the first farm track under a dead oak tree you go at least six miles on that way past the farms thats wild country you better go armed armed shed grinned a big selfconscious grin marron shed never had guts enough to learn to use a weapon thanks dont forget me shed my trial comes up first week next month right shed dismounted and began leading the rented mule when he reached a point he estimated to be six miles from the shaker road he went on another halfmile the track was little more than a game trail winding through rugged country densely covered with hardwood he saw no evidence man ever traveled this way odd what had raven and asa been doing out here he could think of no reason that made sense asa had claimed they were running from bullock if so why hadnt they kept on going down the shaker road his nerves tautened he touched the amulet the knife hidden up his sleeve he had splurged and bought himself two good short weapons one for his belt and one for his sleeve they did little to boost his confidence the trail turned downhill toward a brook ran beside that for several hundred yards and debouched into a broad clearing shed almost walked into that he was a city boy never before had he been into country more wild than the enclosure some innate sense of caution stopped him at the clearings edge he dropped to one knee parted the undergrowth cursed softly when the mule nudged him with its nose he had guessed right a great black lump stood out there it was the size of a house already shed stared at faces frozen in screams of terror and agony a perfect place for it out here growing this fast it would become complete before anyone discovered it unless by accident and the accidental discoverer would become one with it sheds heart hammered he wanted nothing more than to race back to meadenvil and cry the citys danger in the streets he had seen enough he knew what he had come to learn time to get away he went forward slowly he dropped the mules reins but it followed interested in the tall grass shed approached the black lump carefully a few steps at a time nothing happened he circled it the shape of the thing became more evident it would be identical to the fortress overlooking juniper except for the way its foundations conformed to the earth its gate would face south a wellbeaten path led to a low hole there further confirmation of his suspicions where had the creatures come from did they roam the world at will hidden on the edge of night seen only by those who bargained with them returning to the side from which he had approached he stumbled over something bones human bones a skeletonhead arms legs with part of the chest missing still clad in tatters hed seen raven wear a hundred times he knelt raven i hated you but i loved you too you were the worst villain i ever knew and as good a friend as i ever had you made me start thinking like a man tears filled his eyes he searched childhood memories finally found the prayer for the passage of the dead he began to sing in a voice that had no notion how to carry a tune the grass swished only once just on the edge of audibility a hand closed on his shoulder a voice said marron shed shed shrieked and grabbed for his belt knife chapter fortythree meadenvil warm trail i did not have a good night after visiting ravens ship it was a night of dreams of nightmares if you will of terrors i dared not mention when i wakened for the others had troubles and fears enough she came to me in my sleep as she had not done since our grim retreats when the rebel was closing in on charm so long ago she came a golden glow that might have been no dream at all for it seemed to be there in the room i shared with five other men illuminating them and the room while i lay with heart hammering staring in disbelief the others did not respond and later i was not sure i had not imagined the whole thing it had been that way with the visits in the way back when why did you abandon me physician did i treat you less than well baffled confused i croaked out it was run or be killed we would not have fled had there been a choice we served you faithfully through hazards and horrors greater than any in our companys history we marched to the ends of the earth for you without complaint and when we came to the city juniper and spent half our strength storming the black castle we learned that we were to be rewarded by being destroyed that marvelous face formed in the golden cloud that marvelous face drawn in sadness whisper planned that whisper and feather for reasons of their own but feather is gone and whisper has been disciplined i would not have allowed such a crime in any case you were my chosen instruments i would permit no machination of the taken to harm you come back its too late lady the die is cast too many good men have been lost our heart is gone we have grown old our only desire is to return to the south to rest in the warm sun and forget come back there is much to be done you are my chosen instruments i will reward you as no soldiers have ever been rewarded i could detect no hint of treachery but what did that mean she was ancient she had deluded her husband who was far harder to fuddle than i its too late lady come back physician you if no one else i need your pen i do not know why i said what i did next it was not the wisest thing to do if she was feeling the least benevolent toward us the least disinclined to come howling after us we will do one more thing for you because we are old and tired and want to be done with war we will not stand against you if you do not stand against us sadness radiated from the glow i am sorry truly sorry you were one of my favorites a mayfly who intrigued me no physician that cannot be you cannot remain neutral you never could you must stand with me or against me there is no middle ground and with that the golden cloud faded and i fell into a deep sleepif ever i had been awake i woke feeling rested but worried at first unable to recall the visit then it slammed back into consciousness i dressed hurriedly raced to the lieutenant lieutenant we got to start moving faster she won shes going to come after us he looked startled i told him about the night vision he took it with a pound of salt till i told him that she had done the same before during the long retreat and series of encounters that had brought the rebel main forces to the gates of charm he did not want to believe me but he dared not do otherwise get out there and find that asa then he said candy we move on that ship tonight croaker you pass the word were pulling out in four days whether you guys find raven or not i sputtered a protest the critical thing now was to find darling darling was our hope i asked why four days it took us four days to sail here from juniper good winds and seas all the way if the lady left when you turned her down she couldnt get here any quicker so ill give you that long then we hit the sea if we have to fight our way out all right i didnt like it but he was the man who made the decisions we had elected him to do that hagop find kingpin were going looking for asa hagop hurried away like his tail was aflame he brought kingpin back in minutes king crabbing because he hadnt yet eaten hadnt yet gotten his eight hours of sleep shut up king our ass is in a vise i explained though it wasnt necessary grab something cold and eat on the run weve got to find asa hagop kingpin oneeye and i hit the street as always we drew a lot of attention from morning marketers not only because we had come from juniper but because oneeye was an oddity theyd never seen a black man in meadenvil most people hadnt heard of blacks kingpin led us a mile through twisting streets i figure hell hole up in the same area as before he knows it hes not very bright either so it wouldnt occur to him to move because you guys came to town probably just plans to keep his head down till we pull out hes got to figure we have to keep moving his reasoning seemed sound and so it proved he interviewed a few people he had met in the course of previous poking around quickly discovered that asa was indeed hiding out in the area nobody was sure where though well take care of that in a hurry oneeye said he parked himself on a doorstep and performed a few cheap magic tricks that were all flash and show that arrested the attention of the nearest urchins meadenvils streets are choked with children all the time lets fade i told the others we had to be intimidating to small eyes we moved up the street and let oneeye draw his crowd he gave the kids their moneys worth of course and fifteen minutes later he rejoined us trailed by an entourage of street mites got it he said my little buddies will show us where he amazes me sometimes i would have bet he hated kids i mean when he mentions them at all which is about once a year it is in the context of whether they are tastier roasted or boiled asa was holed up in a tenement typical of slums the world over a real rat and firetrap i guess having come into money hadnt changed his habits unlike old shed who had gone crazy when he had money to spend there was but one way out the way we went in the children followed us i did not like that but what could i do we pushed into the room asa called home he was lying on a pallet in a corner another man reeking of wine lay nearby in a pool of vomit asa was curled into a ball snoring time to get up sweetheart i shook him gently he stiffened under my hand his eyes popped open terror filled them i pressed down as he tried to jump up caught you again i said he gobbled air no words came out take it easy asa nobodys going to get hurt we just want you to show us where raven went down i withdrew my hand he rolled over slowly watched us like a cat cornered by dogs you guys are always saying you just want something be nice asa we dont want to play rough but we will if we have to we have four days before the lady gets here were going to find darling before then youre going to help what you do afterward is your own business oneeye snorted softly he had visions of asa with a cut throat he figured the little man deserved no better you just go down the shaker road turn left on the first farm road past the twelfth milestone keep heading east till you get to the place its about seven miles the road turns into a trail dont worry about that just keep going and youll get there he closed his eyes rolled over and pretended to snore i indicated hagop and kingpin get him up hey asa yelped i told you what more do you want i want you to come along just in case in case what in case youre lying and i want to lay hands on you fast oneeye added we dont believe raven died i saw him you saw something i countered i dont think it was raven lets go we grabbed his arms i told hagop to see about rounding up horses and provisions i sent kingpin to tell the lieutenant we wouldnt be back till tomorrow hagop gave a fistful of silver from ravens chest asas eyes widened slightly he recognized the mintage if not the immediate source you guys cant push me around here he said youre not anything more than i am we go out in the street all i have to do is yell and and youll wish you hadnt oneeye said he did something with his hands a soft violet glow webbed his fingers coalesced into something serpentlike that slithered over and under his digits this little fellow here can crawl into your ear and eat out your eyes from behind you cant yell loud enough or fast enough to keep me from siccing him on you asa gulped and became amenable all i want is for you to show me the place i said quickly i dont have much time asa surrendered he expected the worst of us of course he had spent too much time in the company of villains nastier than us hagop had the horses within half an hour it took kingpin another halfhour to rejoin us being kingpin he dawdled and when he appeared oneeye gave him such a look he blanched and half drew his sword lets get moving i growled i did not like the way the company was turning upon itself like a wounded animal snapping at its own flank i set a stiff pace hoping to keep everybody too tired and busy to fuss asas directions proved sound and were easily followed i was pleased and when he saw that he asked permission to turn back how come youre so anxious to stay away from this place whats out there thats got you scared it took a little pressure with oneeye conjuring his violet snake again to loosen asas jaw i came out here right after i got back from juniper because you guys didnt believe me about raven i thought maybe you were right and hed fooled me somehow so i wanted to see how he maybe did it and and he checked us over estimating our mood theres another of those places out there it wasnt there when he died but it is now places i asked what kind of places like the black castle theres one right where he died out in the middle of the clearing tricky oneeye snarled trying to send us into that im going to cut this guy croaker no youre not you let him be over the next mile i questioned asa closely he told me nothing more of importance hagop was riding point being a superb scout he threw up a hand i joined him he indicated droppings in the trail were following somebody not far behind he swung down poked the droppings with a stick duck walked up the trail a way he was riding something big mule or plowhorse asa eh the little man squeaked whats up ahead where is this guy headed nothings up there that i know of maybe its a hunter they sell a lot of game in the markets maybe sure oneeye said sarcastic playing with his violet snake how about you put a little silence on the situation oneeye no i mean so nobody can hear us coming asa how far to go couple miles anyway why dont you guys let me head back now i can still get to town before dark nope you go where we go i glanced at oneeye he was doing as i had requested we would be able to hear one another talk that was all saddle up hagop hes only one guy but which guy eh croaker suppose its one of them creepy things i mean if that place in juniper had a whole battalion that came out of nowhere why shouldnt this place have some asa made sounds that indicated he had been having similar thoughts which explained why he was anxious to get back to town you see anything when you were there asa no but i seen where the grass was trampled like something was coming and going you pay attention when we get there oneeye i dont want no surprises twenty minutes later asa told me almost there maybe two hundred yards up the creek can i stay here quit asking stupid questions i glanced at hagop who pointed out tracks somebody was ahead of us still dismount and stow the chatter finger talk from here on in you asa dont open your mouth for nothing understand we dismounted drew our weapons went forward under cover of oneeyes spell hagop and i reached the clearing first i grinned waved oneeye forward pointed he grinned too i waited a couple of minutes for the right time then strode out stepped up behind the man and grabbed his shoulder marron shed he shrieked and tried to pull a knife tried to run at the same time kingpin and hagop headed him off and herded him back by that time i was kneeling where he had knelt examining the scatter of bones chapter fortyfour meadenvil the clearing i looked up at shed he looked resigned caught up faster than you expected eh he babbled i could make little sense of what he said because he was talking about several things at once raven black castle creatures his chance to make a new life whatnot calm down and be quiet shed were on your side i explained the situation telling him we had four days to find darling he found it difficult to believe that the girl who had worked in the iron lily could be the rebels white rose i did not argue just presented the facts four days shed then the lady and taken could be here and i guarantee you shell be looking for you too by now they know we faked your death by now theyve probably questioned enough people to have an idea what was going on were fighting for our lives shed i looked at the big black lump and said to no one in particular and that thing dont help one damned bit i looked at the bones again hagop see what you can make of this oneeye you and asa go over exactly what he saw that day walk through it kingpin you play raven for them shed come here with me i was pleased both asa and shed did as they were told shed though shaken by our return to the stage of his life did not seem likely to panic i watched him as hagop examined the ground inch by inch shed seemed to have grown to have found something in himself that had not had a chance in the sterile soil of juniper he whispered look croaker i dont know about that stuff about the lady coming and how you got to find darling i dont much care he indicated the black lump whatre you going to do about that good question he did not have to explain what it meant it meant the dominator had not endured final defeat in juniper he had hedged his bet beforehand he had another gateway growing here and growing fast asa was right to be afraid of castle creatures the dominator knew he had to hurrythough i doubted he had expected to be found out so soon there isnt much we can do when you get down to it you got to do something look i know i dealt with those things what they did to me and raven and juniper hell croaker you cant let that happen again here i didnt say i didnt want to do something i said i cant you dont ask a man with a penknife to chop down a forest and build a city he doesnt have the tools who does the lady then i have my limits friend im not going to get myself killed for meadenvil im not going to get my outfit scrubbed for people i dont know maybe we owe a moral debt but i dont think its that big he grunted understanding without accepting i was surprised without his having said as much i sensed that he had launched a crusade a grand villain trying to buy redemption i did not begrudge him in the least but he could do it without the company and me i watched oneeye and asa walk kingpin through everything raven had done the day he died from where i sat i could see no flaw in asas story i hoped oneeye had a better view he if anyone could find the angle he was as good at stage magic as at true wizardry i recalled that raven had been pretty good with tricks his biggie had been making knives appear out of thin air but he had had other tricks with which he had entertained darling hagop said look here croaker i looked i did not see anything abnormal what going through the grass toward the lump its almost gone now but its there like a trail he held blades of grass parted it took me a while to see it just the faintest hint of a sheen like an old snail track a closer scrutiny showed that it should have started roughly where the corpses heart would have lain it took a little work to figure because scavengers had torn the remains i examined a fleshless hand rings remained on the fingers various metal accoutrements and several knives also lay around oneeye worked kingpin over to the bones well i asked its possible with a little misdirection and stage magic i couldnt tell you how he did it if he did we got a body i said indicating the bones thats him asa insisted look hes still wearing his rings and thats his belt buckle and sword and knives but a shadow of doubt lingered in his voice he was coming around to my way and i still wondered why the nice new ship had not been claimed hagop hunt around for signs somebody went off in another direction asa you said you lit out as soon as you saw what was happening yeah so lets quit worrying about that and try to figure what happened here just to look at it this dead man had something that became that i indicated the lump i was surprised i had so little trouble ignoring it i guess you can get used to anything id paraded around the big one in juniper till id lost that cold dread that had moved me for a while i mean if men can get used to slaughterhouses or my businesssoldier or surgeonthey can get used to anything asa you hung around with raven shed he lived at your place for a couple years and you were his partner what did he bring from juniper that could have come to life and become that they shook their heads and stared at the bones i told them think harder shed it had to be something he had when you knew him he stopped going up the hill a long time before he headed south a minute or two passed hagop had begun working his way along the edge of the clearing i had little hope he would find traces this long after the fact i was no woodsman but i knew raven asa suddenly gasped what i snapped everything is here you know all the metal even his buttons and stuff but one thing well this necklace he wore i only seen it a couple times whats the matter shed i turned shed was gripping his chest over his heart his face was marble white he gobbled for words that would not come he started trying to rip his shirt i thought he was having an attack but as i reached him to help he opened his shirt and grabbed something he was wearing around his neck something on a chain he tried to get it off by main force the chain would not break i forced him to take it off over his head pried it out of stiff fingers held it out to asa asa looked a little pale yeah thats it silver oneeye said and looked at hagop meaningfully he would think that way and he might be right hagop come here oneeye took the thing held it to the light some craftsmanship he mused then flung it down and dived like a frog off his lily pad as he arced through the air he barked like a jackal light flashed i whirled two castle creatures stood at the side of the black lump frozen in midstep in the act of rushing us shed cursed asa shrieked kingpin zipped past me and drove his blade deep into a chest i did the same so rattled i did not recall the difficulty id had during our previous encounter we both hit the same one we both yanked out weapons free the neck i gasped go for the vein in the neck oneeye was up again ready for action he told me later he had glimpsed motion in the corner of his eye jumped just in time to evade something thrown they had known who to take first who was most potent hagop came up from behind as the things started moving added his blade to the contest as did shed to my surprise he jumped in with a knife about a foot long got low went for a hamstring it was brief oneeye had given us the moment we needed they were stubborn about it but they died the last to go looked up at shed smiled and said marron shed you will be remembered shed started shaking asa said he knew you shed hes the one i delivered bodies to every time but one wait a minute i countered only one creature got away at juniper dont seem likely it would be the one who knew you i stopped i had noticed something disturbing the two creatures were identical even to a scar across the chest when i peeled back their dark clothing the creature the lieutenant and i had hauled down the hill after having slain it before the castle gate had had such a scar while everyone else was suffering postcombat shakes oneeye asked hagop you see anything silver around old bones when you were checking first uh oneeye held up sheds necklace it might have looked something like this it was what killed him hagop gulped and dug into a pocket he handed over a necklace identical to sheds except that the serpents had no eyes yeah oneeye said and again held sheds necklace to the light yeah the eyes it was when the time was right time and place i was more interested in what else might come out of the black lump i pulled hagop around the side found the entrance it looked like the entrance to a mud hut i supposed it wouldnt become a real gate till the place grew up i indicated the tracks what do they tell you they tell me its busy and we ought to get out of here theres more of them yeah we rejoined the others oneeye was wrapping sheds necklace in a piece of cloth we get back to town im sealing this in something made of steel and sinking it in the harbor destroy it oneeye evil always finds its way back the dominator is a perfect example yeah all right if i can elmos rush into the black castle came to mind while i was getting everybody organized to get out of there i had changed my mind about overnighting we could get most of the way back before nightfall meadenvil like juniper had neither walls nor gates we would not be locked outside i let elmo lie in the back of my mind till the thought ripened when it did i was aghast a tree ensures reproduction by shedding a million seeds one certainly will survive and a new tree will grow i pictured a horde of fighters bursting into the guts of the black castle and finding silver amulets everywhere i pictured them filling their pockets had to be that place was doomed the dominator would have known that even before the lady my respect for the old devil rose crafty bastard it was not till we were back on the shaker road that i thought to ask hagop if he had seen any evidence that anyone had left the clearing by another route nope he said but that dont mean anything lets not spend so much time yakking oneeye said shed cant you make that damned mule go any faster he was scared and if he was i was more so chapter fortyfive meadenvil hot trail we made the city but i swear i could sense something sniffing along our backtrail before we reached the safety of the lights we returned to our lodgings only to find most of the men gone where were they off to take over ravens ship i learned i had forgotten about that yes ravens ship and silent was on ravens trail where was he now damn sooner or later raven would lead him to the clearing a way to find out if raven had left it for sure also a way to lose silent oneeye can you get hold of silent he looked at me strangely he was tired and wanted to sleep look if he follows ravens every move hes going to head out to that clearing oneeye groaned and went through several dramatic shows of disgust then he dug into his magic sack for something that looked like a desiccated finger he took it to a corner and communed with it then returned to say i got a line on him ill find him thanks yeah you bastard i ought to make you come with me i settled by the fire with a big beer and lost myself in thought after a while i told shed we have to go back out there eh with silent whos silent another guy from the company wizard like oneeye and goblin hes on ravens trail tracing every move he made from the minute he arrived he figured he could track him down or at least tell from his movements if he was planning to trick asa shed shrugged if we have to we have to hunh you amaze me shed youve changed i dont know maybe i could have done it all along i just know that this thing cant happen again to anybody else yeah i did not mention my visions of hundreds of men looting amulets from the fortress at juniper he did not need that he had a mission i couldnt make it sound hopeless i went downstairs and asked the landlord for more beer beer makes me sleepy i had a notion a possibility i did not share it with anyone the others would not have been pleased after an hour i took a leak and dragged off to my room more intimidated by the thought of returning to that clearing than by what i hoped to accomplish now sleep was a time coming beer or not i could not relax i kept trying to reach out and bring her to me which meant nothing at all it was a weak fools hope that she would return so soon i had put her off why should she why shouldnt she forget me till her minions caught up and could bring me to her in chains maybe there is a connection on a level i do not understand for i wakened from a drowse thinking i needed to visit the head again and found that golden glow hanging above me or maybe i did not waken but only dreamed that i did i cant get that straight it always seems so dreamlike in retrospect i did not wait for her to start i started talking i talked fast and told her everything she needed to know about the lump in meadenvil and about the possibility the troops had carried hundreds of seeds out of the black castle you tell me this when you are determined to be my enemy physician i dont want to be your enemy ill be your enemy only if you leave me no option i abandoned debate we cant handle this and it has to be handled all its like must be handled there is evil enough in the world as it is i told her we had found an amulet upon a citizen of juniper i named no name i told her we would leave it where she could be sure to find it when she arrived arrive arent you on your way here thin smile secretive perfectly aware that i was fishing no answer just a question where will you be gone long gone and headed far away perhaps we shall see the golden glow faded there were things i wanted to say yet but they had nothing to do with the problem at hand questions i wanted to ask i did not the last golden mote left me with a whispered i owe you one physician oneeye rambled into the place shortly after sunrise looking a lot worse for wear silent came along behind him looking pretty beaten himself he had been on ravens trail without letup oneeye said i caught him just in time another hour and he would have headed out i conned him into waiting till daylight yeah you want to wake the troops we get an earlier start today we ought to be able to get back before dark what i thought i was pretty clear weve got to go back out there now weve used one of our days hey man im ripped ill die if you make me sleep in the saddle thats always been one of your big talents sleep anywhere any time oh my aching butt an hour later i was headed down the shaker road again with silent and otto added to the crew shed insisted on coming along though i was willing to excuse him asa decided he wanted in too maybe because he thought shed would extend an umbrella of protection he had started talking mission like shed but a deaf man could hear its false ring we moved faster this time pressed harder and had shed on a real horse we got down to the clearing by noon while silent sniffed around i worked myself up and took a closer look at the lump no change except the two dead creatures were gone i did not need hagops eye to see that they had been dragged through the entry hole silent worked his way around the clearing to a point almost identical with that where the creature trail entered the forest then he threw up an arm beckoned i hurried over and did not have to read the dance of his fingers to know what he had found his face revealed the answer found it eh i asked more brightly than i felt i had started to count on raven being dead i did not like what the skeleton implied silent nodded yo i called we found it lets go bring the horses the others gathered asa looked a little peaked he asked how did he do it nobody had an answer several of us wondered whose skeleton lay in the clearing and how it had come to wear ravens necklace i wondered how ravens plot for vanishing had dovetailed so neatly with the dominators for seeding a new black castle only oneeye seemed in a mood to talk and that all complaint we follow this and were not going to get back to town before dark he said he said a lot more mostly about how tired he was nobody paid attention even those of us who had rested were tired lead off silent i said otto you want to take care of his horse oneeye bring up the rear so we dont get any surprises from behind the track was no track at ail for a while just a straight shot through the brush we were winded by the time it intercepted a game trail raven too must have been exhausted for he had turned onto that trail and followed it over a hill along a creek up another hill then he had turned onto a less traveled path which ran along a ridge toward the shaker road over the next two hours we encountered several such forkings each time raven had taken the one which tended more directly westward bastard was headed back to the high road oneeye said could have figured that gone the other way and saved all this tramping through the brush men growled at him his complaints were grating even asa tossed a nasty look over one shoulder raven had taken the long way no doubt about it i would guess we walked at least ten miles before coming across a ndgeline and viewing cleared land which descended to the high road a number of farms lay on our right in the distance ahead lay the blue haze of the sea the countryside was mostly brown for autumn had come to meadenvil the leaves were turning asa indicated a stand of maples and said they would look real pretty in another week odd you dont think of guys like him as having a sense of beauty down there otto indicated a cluster of buildings threequarters of a mile south it did not look like a farm bet thats a roadside inn he said what do you want to bet that was where he was headed silent he nodded but hedged he wanted to stick to the track to make sure we mounted up let him do what walking remained to be done i for one had had enough tramping around how about we stay over oneeye asked i checked the sun im considering it how safe you figure wed be he shrugged theres smoke coming up down there dont look like they had any trouble yet mindreader i had been examining farmsteads as we passed seeking indications that the lump creatures were raiding the neighborhood the farms had seemed peaceful and active i suppose the creatures confined their predations to the city where they would cause less excitement ravens track hit the shaker road a halfmile above the buildings otto thought an inn i checked landmarks could not guess how far south of the twelfth mile we were silent beckoned pointed raven had indeed turned south we followed and soon passed milestone sixteen how far are you going to follow him croaker oneeye asked bet you he met darling out here and just kept hiking i suspect he did how far to shaker anybody know two hundred fortyseven miles kingpin replied rough country likely to have trouble along the way bandits and such king said not that i ever heard of theres mountains though pretty rough ones take a while to get through them i did some calculating say three weeks to cover that distance not pushing raven wouldnt push what with darling along and the papers a wagon hed have to have a wagon silent too was mounted now we reached the buildings quickly otto proved right definitely an inn a girl came outside as we dismounted looked at us with wide eyes raced inside i guess we were a roughlooking lot those who did not show tough looked nasty a worried fat man came out strangling an apron his face could not decide if it wanted to remain ruddy or to go pallid afternoon i said we get a meal and some fodder for the animals wine oneeye called out as he loosened his cinch i need to dive into a gallon of wine and a feather bed i reckon the man said his speech proved difficult to follow the language of meadenvil is a dialect of that spoken in juniper in the city it wasnt hard to get along what with the constant intercourse between meadenvil and juniper but this fellow spoke a country dialect with an altered rhythm and you can afford it i produced two of ravens silver pieces handed them over let me know when were over that limit i dropped my reins over the hitching rail climbed the steps patted his arm as i passed not to worry were not bandits soldiers following somebody who passed this way a while back he rewarded me with a frown of disbelief it was obvious we did not serve the prince of meadenvil the inn was pleasant and though the fat man had several daughters everyone stayed in line after we had eaten and most had gone off to rest the innkeeper began to relax you answer me some questions i asked i placed a silver piece upon my table might be worth something he settled opposite me regarded me narrowly over a gigantic beer mug he had drained the thing at least six times since our arrival which explained his girth what do you want to know the tall man who cant talk hes looking for his daughter eh i indicated silent who had made himself at home near the fire seated on the floor folded forward in sleep a deaf and dumb girl who passed this way a while back probably driving a wagon met a guy here maybe i described raven his face went blank he remembered raven and did not want to talk about it silent he snapped out of sleep as if stung i sent a message with finger signs he smiled nastily i told the innkeeper he dont look like much but hes a sorcerer heres how it stands the man who was here maybe told you hed come back and cut your throat if you said anything thats a remote risk on the other hand silent there can cast a few spells and make your cows go dry your fields barren and all your beer and wine go sour silent did one of those nasty little tricks which amuse him oneeye and goblin a ball of light drifted around the common room like a curious puppy poking into things the innkeeper believed me enough not to want to call my bluff all right they was here like you said i get a lot of people through in the summer so i wouldnt have noticed except like you say the girl was deaf and the guy was a hard case she come in in the morning like she traveled all night on a wagon he come in the evening walking they stayed off in the corner they left next morning he looked at my coin paid in that same funny coin come to think yeah come from a long way off eh yeah whered they go south down the road questions i heard the guy ask i figure they was headed for chimney i raised an eyebrow id never heard of any place called chimney down the coast past shaker take the needle road out of shaker the tagline road from needle somewhere south of tagline theres a crossroad where you head west chimney is on the salada peninsula i dont know where for sure only what i heared from travelers uhm long hike how far you think see two hundred twentyfour miles to shaker round two hundred more to needle tagline is about one eighty on from needle i think or maybe its two eighty i dont rightly recollect that crossroad must be another hundred down from tagline then out to chimney dont know how far that would be least another hundred maybe two three seen a map oncet that a fellow showed me peninsula sticks way out like a thumb silent joined us he produced a scrap of paper and a tiny steeltipped pen he had the innkeeper run through it again he drew a crude map that he adjusted as the fat man said it did or did not resemble the map he had seen silent kept juggling a column of figures he came up with an estimate in excess of nine hundred miles from meadenvil he knocked off the last digit then wrote the word days and a plus sign i nodded probably a fourmonth trip at least i said longer if they spend much time resting up in any of those cities silent drew a straight line from meadenvil to the tip of the salada peninsula wrote est mi a knots hrs yeah i said yeah thats why the ship never left had to give him a head start think well have a talk with the crew tomorrow thanks innkeeper i pushed the coin over anything odd happened around here lately a weak smiled stretched his lips not till today right no i mean like neighbors disappearing or whatnot he shook his head nope less you count moleskin haint seen him in a while but that dont make no nevermind moleskin hunter works the forest over east mainly for furs and hides but brings me game when he needs salt or something he dont come around regular but i reckon hes overdue usually comes in come fall to get staples for the winter thought it was him when your friend come through the door eh which friend the one youre hunting that carried off this fellers daughter silent and i exchanged glances i said better not count on seeing moleskin again i think hes dead what brings you to say that i told him a little about raven faking his own death and leaving a body that had been confused for his bad thing that yep bad thing doing like that hope you catch him up his eyes narrowed slightly cunning you fellers wouldnt be part of that bunch come down from juniper would you everybody headed south talks about how silents glower shut him up im going to get some sleep i said if none of my men are up yet roust me out at first light yes sir the innkeeper said and a fine breakfast well fix you sir chapter fortysix meadenvil trouble and a fine breakfast we had i tipped the innkeeper another piece of silver he must have thought me mad half a mile up the road oneeye called a halt you just going to leave them he asked what those people first taken comes down this way is going to find out everything we did my heart flipflopped i knew what he was getting at i had thought about it earlier but i could not order it no point i said everybody in meadenvil is going to see us put out everybody in meadenvil dont know where were headed i dont like the idea any better than you do croaker but we have to cut the trail somewhere raven didnt and were on to him yeah i know i glanced at asa and shed they were not taking it well asa at least figured he was next cant take them with us croaker i know he swung around started back alone not even otto joined him and otto has very little conscience whats he going to do asa asked use his magic to make them forget i lied lets move along he can catch up shed kept giving me looks looks like he must have given raven when he first found out raven was in the body business he did not say anything oneeye caught up an hour later he busted out laughing they were gone he said every blessed one with all their dogs and cattle into the woods damned peasants he laughed again almost hysterically i suspect he was relieved we got two days and some gone i said lets push it the bigger head start we have the better we reached the outskirts of meadenvil five hours later not having pressed as hard as i wanted as we penetrated the city our pace lagged i think we all sensed it finally i stopped king you and asa wander around and see what you hear well wait at yonder fountain there were no children in the streets the adults i saw seemed dazed those who passed us moved by as widely as they could navigate king was back in two minutes no lollygagging big trouble croaker the taken got here this morning big blowout down at the waterfront i glanced in that direction a ghost of smoke rose there as if marking the aftermath of a major fire the sky to the west in the direction the wind was blowing had a dirty look asa returned a minute later with the same news and more they got in a big fight with the prince not over yet some say wouldnt be much of a fight oneeye said i dont know i countered even the lady cant be everywhere at once how the hell did they get here so fast they didnt have any carpets overland shed said overland but its shorter than the sea trip road cuts across if you ride hard day and night you can make it in two days when i was a kid they used to have races they stopped that when the new duke took over guess it doesnt matter so what now got to find out what happened oneeye said he muttered if that bastard goblin got himself killed ill wring his neck right but how do we do that the taken know us ill go shed volunteered harder looks you cannot imagine than those we bent upon marron shed he quailed for a moment then i wont let them catch me anyway why should they bother me they dont know me okay i said get moving croaker got to trust him oneeye unless you want to go yourself nope shed you screw us over and ill get you if i have to come back from the grave shed smiled weakly left us on foot not many people rode through meadenvils streets we found a tavern and made ourselves at home two men staying in the street to watch it was sundown before shed returned well i said signaling for another pitcher of beer its not good news you guys are stuck your lieutenant took the ship out twenty twentyfive of your guys were killed the rest went out on the ship the prince lost not all of them oneeye said and tipped a pointing finger over the top of his mug somebody followed you shed shed whirled terrified goblin and pawnbroker stood in the doorway pawn had been carved up some he limped over and collapsed into a chair i checked his wounds goblin and oneeye exchanged looks that might have meant anything but probably meant they were glad to see one another the taverns other customers began to fade word who we were had gotten out they knew some bad people were hunting us sit goblin i said king you and otto go get some fresh horses i gave them most of the money i had all the staples that will buy too i think we got a long ride ahead right goblin he nodded lets hear it whisper and limper turned up this morning came with fifty men company men looking for us made enough fuss we heard them coming the lieutenant sent word to everybody ashore some didnt get aboard in time whisper headed for the ship the lieutenant had to cut loose we left nineteen men behind whatre you doing here i volunteered went over the side off the point swam to shore came back to wait for you guys supposed to tell you where to meet the ship ran into pawn by accident i was patching him up when i seen shed poking around we followed him back here i sighed theyre headed for chimney right he was surprised yeah howd you know that i explained briefly he said pawn better tell them what you know pawn was caught ashore only survivor i could find this is a private adventure with the taken pawn said they snuck down here supposed to be somewhere else figured it was a chance to get even i guess now were not on the list of the ladys favorites she doesnt know theyre here no i chuckled despite the gravity of the situation i could not help that theyre in for a surprise then the old bitch herself is going to turn up we got another black castle growing here several of them looked at me askance wondering how i would know what the lady was doing i had not explained my dream to anyone but the lieutenant i finished patching pawnbroker youll be able to travel but take it easy howd you find that out shaky we talked some before he tried to kill me shaky oneeye snarled what the hell i dont know what the taken told those guys but they were cranked up wanted our asses bad suckers most of them got killed for their trouble killed prince whatsit got righteous about the taken walking in like they owned the place there was a big fightwith the limper and our boys our guys practically got wiped out maybe theyd have done better if they couldve rested first funny we talked it over like those men and we had not somehow become mortal enemies sympathizing and in my case feeling bitter toward the taken for having turned and squandered them shaky say anything about juniper yeah they had a real oldfashioned blood bath up there not much left of anything counting us the company was down six hundred guys when the lady finished with the castle lot more guys was killed in the riots that came after when she cleaned out the catacombs the whole damned city went crazy with that hargadon leading the rebellion had our guys trapped in duretile then the lady lost her temper she wrecked what was left of the town i shook my head the captain guessed right about the catacombs journey took over what was left of the company goblin said they was supposed to pull out with the plunder as soon as they got it all together city is so wrecked there isnt no reason to stay around i looked at shed a bleaker face could not be imagined pain and questions twisted inside him he wanted to know about his people did not want to speak for fear someone would accuse him not your fault man i told him the duke asked the lady in before you got involved it would have happened no matter what you did how can people do stuff like that asa gave him the odd look shed thats dumb how could you do all the stuff you did desperate thats what everybodys desperate they do crazy things oneeye gave me a howaboutthat look even asa could think sometimes pawn shaky say anything about elmo elmo remained my main regret no i didnt ask we didnt have much time whats the plan goblin said well head south when king and otto get here with the horses and supplies a sigh going to be hard times i got maybe two leva how about you guys we catalogued our resources i said were in trouble the lieutenant sent this goblin deposited a small sack on the table it contained fifty silver castle coins from ravens horde thatll help still going to make it on prayer though i have some money shed volunteered quite a bit its back where i was staying i eyeballed him you dont have to go youre not part of this yes i am for as long as ive known you youve been trying to run away got something to fight for now croaker what they did to juniper i cant let that go me too asa said i still got most of the money raven gave me after we raided the catacombs i polled the others silently they did not respond it was up to me all right get it but dont dawdle i want to pull out as soon as i can i can catch you one the road shed said i dont see why asa cant too he rose shyly he extended a hand i hesitated only a moment welcome to the black company shed asa did not make the same offer think theyll come back oneeye asked after they left what do you think nope i hope you know what youre doing croaker they could get the taken after us if they get caught yeah they could i was counting on it in fact a vicious notion had come to me lets have another round here be our last for a long time chapter fortyseven the inn on the run very much to my amazement shed overtook us ten miles south of meadenvil and he was not alone holy shit i heard oneeye yell from the rear and croaker come and look at this i turned back and there was shed with a bedraggled bullock shed said i promised to get him out if i could had to bribe some people but it wasnt that hard its every man for himself up there right now i looked at bullock he looked at me well i said shed gave me the word croaker i guess im in with you guys if youll take me i dont have anywhere else to go damn asa shows up ill lose my faith in human nature also blow an idea i have okay bullock what the hell just remember were not in juniper none of us were on the run from the taken and we dont have time to fuss over who did what to whom you want a fight save it for them youre the boss just give me a shot at evening things up he followed me back to the head of the column not much difference between your lady and somebody like krage is there matter of proportion i said maybe youll get your shot sooner than you think silent and otto came trotting out of the darkness you did good i said dogs never barked i had sent silent because he handled animals well theyre all back out of the woods and tucked in their beds otto reported good lets move in quietly and i dont want anybody hurt understand oneeye i hear you goblin pawnbroker shed you watch the horses ill signal with a lantern occupying the inn was easier than planning it we caught everyone asleep because silent had fuddled their dogs the innkeeper wakened puffing and blowing and terrified i took him downstairs while oneeye watched everybody else including some northbound travelers who represented a complication but who caused no trouble sit i told the fat man you have tea or beer in the morning tea he croaked its making so were back we didnt expect to be but circumstances dictated an overland trip i want to use your place a couple days you and me need to make an accommodation hagop brought out tea so strong it reeked the fat man drained a mug the size of that from which he drank his beer i dont want to hurt anybody i continued after taking a sip myself and ill pay my way but if you want it that way youll have to cooperate he grunted i dont want anybody to know were here that means no customers leave people who come through have to see things looking normal you get my drift he was smarter than he looked youre waiting for somebody none of the men had figured that out i dont think yes somebody who will do unto you as you expect me to just for being here unless my ambush works i had a crazy idea it would die if asa turned up i think he believed me when i claimed no wicked plans for his family now he asked that the same somebody who kicked up the ruckus in the city yesterday news travels fast bad news does yes the same somebody they killed about twenty of my people busted the city up pretty good too i heard like i said bad news travels fast my brother was one of the people they killed he was in the princes guard a sergeant only one of us ever amounted to anything he was killed by something that ate him i beared sorcerer sicced it on him yeah hes a bad one nastier than my friend who cant talk i did not know who would come after us i was counting on someone doing so with asa to point the way i also figured the pursuit would develop quickly asa would tell them the lady was on her way to meadenvil the fat man eyed me cautiously hatred smouldered behind his eyes i tried to direct it im going to kill him all right slow like my brother i dont think so if it isnt fast and sneaky he wins or she theres two of them actually i dont know which one will come i figured we could buy a lot of time if we could take out one of the taken the lady would be damned busy with black castles for a while with only two pairs of hands to help her also i had an emotional debt to pay and a message to make clear let me send the wife and kids away he said ill stand in with you i let my gaze flick to silent he nodded slightly all right what about your guests i know them theyll sit tight good go take care of your part he left then i had it out with silent and the others i had not been elected to command i was running on momentum as senior officer present it got angry for a while but i won my point fear is a wonderful motivator it moved goblin and oneeye like nothing ive ever seen moved the men too they set up every gimmick they could imagine booby traps hiding places prepared from which an attack could be carried out each glossed with a concealing spell weapons prepared with fanatical attention the taken are not invulnerable theyre just hard to reach and more so when theyre ready for trouble whoever came would be silent went into the woods with the fat mans family he returned with a hawk that he tamed in record time and cast it aloft to patrol the road between meadenvil and the inn we would be forewarned the landlord prepared dishes tainted with poison though i advised him that the taken seldom eat he petitioned silent for advice concerning his dogs he had a whole pack of savage mastiffs and wanted them in on the action silent found them a spot in the plan we did everything we could and then settled in to wait when my shift came i took my turn getting some rest she came almost the moment my eyes closed it seemed i was in a panic for a moment trying to banish my location and plan from my mind but what was the point she had found me already the thing to conceal was the ambush have you reconsidered she asked you cannot outrun me i want you physician that why you sent whisper and the limper to return us to the fold they killed half our men lost most of theirs wrecked the city and didnt make a single friend is that how you win us back she had not been party to that of course pawnbroker had said the taken were acting on their own i wanted her angry and distracted i wanted to know her reaction she said theyre supposed to be headed back to the barrowland sure they are they just go off on their own any time they feel like it to settle grudges ten years old do they know where you are not yet i now had the feeling she could not locate me precisely im outside the city lying low where i let an image seep through near the place where the new castle is growing it was the nearest place we could put up i figured a strong thread of truth was in order anyway i wanted her to find the gift i meant to leave stay where you are do not attract attention i will be there soon thought so do not test my patience physician you amuse me but you are not invulnerable i am short of temper these days whisper and limper have pressed their luck one time too many the door of the room opened oneeye said who you talking to croaker i shuddered he stood on the far side of the glow without seeing it i was awake i replied my girlfriend and giggled an instant later i endured a moment of intense vertigo something parted from me leaving a flavor both of amusement and irritation i recovered found oneeye kneeling frowning whats the matter he demanded i shook my head head feels like its on backwards shouldnt have had that beer whats up he scowled suspiciously silents hawk came in theyre coming come on downstairs we need to redo the plan they the limper and nine men thats what i mean we need to redo right now the odds look too good for the other side yeah those would be company men the inn wouldnt fool them inns are the axes of life in the hinterlands the captain used them frequently to draw the rebel silent did not have much to add except that we had only as long as it would take our pursuers to cover six miles hey the old comesthedawn suddenly i knew why the taken had come to meadenvil you got a wagon and team i asked the innkeeper i still did not know his name yeah use it to haul supplies down from meadenvil from the millers from the brewers why because the taken are looking for those papers ive been on about i had to reveal their provenance the same ones we dug up in the forest of cloud oneeye asked yes look soulcatcher told me they have the limpers true name in them they also include the wizard bomanzs secret papers where the ladys true name is supposedly encoded wow goblin said right oneeye demanded whats that got to do with us the limper wants his name back suppose he sees a bunch of guys and a wagon light out of here whats he going to figure asa gave him bum dope about them being with raven asa doesnt know everything weve been up to silent interjected in sign asa is with the limper fine he did what i wanted okay the limper figures thats us making a run for it with the papers specially if we let a few pieces go fluttering around i get it oneeye said only we dont have enough men to work it only bullock and the landlord that asa dont know about goblin said i think you better stop talking and start doing theyre getting closer i called the fat man your friends from the south have to do us a favor tell them its their only chance of getting out of this alive chapter fortyeight the inn ambush the four southerners were shaking and sweating they did not know what was going on did not like what they saw but they had become convinced that cooperation was their only hope goblin i shouted upstairs can you see them yet almost time count to fifty then turn it loose i counted slowly forcing myself to keep the pace down i was as scared as the southerners now goblin came boiling downstairs we all roared out to the barn where the animals and wagon were waiting whooped out of there stormed into the road and went howling off south like eight men very nearly taken by surprise behind us the limpers party halted momentarily talked it over then came after us i noted that the limper was setting the pace good his men were not eager to tangle with their old buddies i brought up the rear behind goblin and oneeye and the wagon oneeye was driving goblin kept his mount right beside the wagon we roared into a rising curve where the road began climbing a wooded hill south of the inn the innkeeper said the forest went on for miles he had gone ahead with silent and bullock and the men the southerners were pretending to be yo someone shouted back a scrap of red cloth whipped past oneeye stood up on the wagon clinging to the traces as he edged over goblin swung in close oneeye jumped for a moment i did not think he would make it goblin almost missed oneeyes feet trailed in the dust then he scrambled up lay on his stomach behind his friend he glared back at me daring me to grin i grinned anyway the wagon hit the timber prepared flung up twisted horses screamed fought could not hold it wagon and team went thrashing off the road crashed against trees the animals screaming in pain and terror while the vehicle disintegrated the men who had upset the wagon vanished immediately i spurred my mount forward past goblin and oneeye and pawnbroker yelled at the southerners gave them the sign to go on keep riding get the hell away a quarter mile father on i swung onto the track the fat man had told me about got down into the woods far enough not to be seen halted long enough for oneeye to get himself seated then we moved on hurriedly headed for the inn above us limper and his bunch came pounding up to where the wrecked wagon lay the animals still crying their distress it started cries shrieks men dying hiss and howl of spells i didnt think silent stood a chance but he had volunteered the wagon was supposed to distract the limper long enough for the massed attack to reach him the clangor was still going on muted by distance when we reached open country cant be going all wrong i shouted been going on a while i did not feel as optimistic as i pretended i did not want it to go on id wanted them to hit quick hurt the limper and fade away doing enough damage to make him retreat to the inn to lick his wounds we hustled the animals into the barn and headed for our hiding places i muttered you know we wouldnt be in this spot if raven had killed him when he had a chance way back when i had helped capture whisper when she was trying to bring limper over to her side raven had had a fantastic opportunity to finish him off he had not been able though he had had grievances against the taken his mercy had come back to haunt us all pawnbroker went into the pig shed where we had installed a crude light ballista built as part of our earlier plan goblin cast a weak spell that made him seem like just another hog i wanted him to stay out of it if possible i doubted the ballista would get used goblin and i raced upstairs to watch the road and the ridgeline to the east once he broke off which he had not done when he was supposed to silent would fake in the direction taken by the southerners retreat through the wood to that ridge watch what happened at the inn it was my hope that some of the limpers men would keep after the southerners i hadnt told those guys that i hoped they had sense enough to keep running ho goblin said theres silent he made it the men appeared briefly i could not tell who was who only three of them i muttered that meant four had not made it damn it had to work goblin said else they wouldnt be up there i did not feel reassured i hadnt had many shots at field command i hadnt learned to deal with the feelings that come when you know men have been killed trying to carry out your orders here they come riders left the woods coming up the shaker road amidst lengthening shadows i make it six men i said no seven they must not have gone after those guys looks like theyre all hurt element of surprise the limper with them can you tell no that one thats asa hell thats old shed on the third horse and the innkeeper next to last a slight positive then they were half as strong as they had been id lost only two of seven committed what do we do if the limper aint with them goblin asked take what comes to us silent had vanished off the far ridge there he is croaker in front of the innkeeper looks like hes unconscious that was too much to hope yet it did indeed look like the taken was out lets get downstairs i watched through a cracked shutter as they turned into the yard the only member of the group uninjured was asa his hands were bound to his saddle his feet to his stirrups one of the injured men dismounted released asa held a knife on him while he helped the others a variety of injuries were evident shed looked like he shouldnt be alive at all the innkeeper was in better shape just seemed to have been knocked around a lot they made asa and the fat man get the limper off his animal i nearly gave myself away then the taken was missing most of his right arm he had several additional wounds but of course he would recover if he remained protected by his allies the taken are tough asa and the fat man started toward the door limper sagged like a wet rope the man who had covered asa pushed the door open the limper wakened no he squeaked trap asa and the innkeeper dropped him asa began heeling and toeing it eyes closed the innkeeper whistled shrilly his dogs came raging out of the barn goblin and oneeye cut loose i jumped out and went for the limper as he tried to gain his feet my blade bit into the limpers shoulder above the stump of his right arm his remaining fist came up and brushed me across the belly the air exploded out of me i nearly passed out i settled to the ground heaving my guts out only vaguely aware of my surroundings the dogs boiled over the limpers men mauling them savagely several hit the taken he hammered them with his fist each blow leaving an animal dead goblin and oneeye charged out hit nim with everything they had he shed their spells like rainwater punched oneeye turned on goblin goblin ran the limper trundled after him weaving the surviving mastiffs snapping at his back goblin raced toward the pig shed he went sprawling before he reached it twitched feebly in the mire limper rolled up behind him fist raised for the kill pawnbrokers shaft split his breastbone stood three feet out of his back he stood there swaying a ragged little man in brown picking at the shaft his whole will seemed to focus upon that goblin wriggled away inside the shed pawn cranked the ballista back and dropped another javelin into its trough whomp this one ripped all the way through the limper it knocked him off his feet the dogs went for his throat i regained my breath i looked for my sword vaguely i was aware of screeching from a patch of blackberries along a ditch two hundred feet north a lone dog trotted back and forth snarling asa he had ducked into the only cover available i got my feet under me the fat man helped oneeye get up then snagged a fallen weapon we three closed in on the limper he lay in the mire twisted slightly sideways his mask slipped so we could see the ruined face it had concealed he could not believe what was happening feebly he waved at the dogs all for nothing i told him the papers havent been here for months and the fat man this is for my brother he swung his weapon he was so badly bruised and getting so stiff that he did not get much into it the limper tried to strike back he did not have anything left he realized that he was going to die after all those centuries after having survived the white roses and the anger of the lady after he had betrayed her in the battle at roses and in the forest of cloud his eyes rolled up and he went away and i knew he was yelling for mamas help kill him quick i said hes calling the lady we hacked and slashed and chopped the dogs snarled and bit he would not die even when we ran out of energy a spark of life remained lets drag him around front we did and i saw shed lying on the ground with men who used to be brothers in the black company i looked up at the waning light saw silent approaching followed by hagop and otto i felt a numb pleasure because those two had survived they had been best friends for as long as i could recall i could not picture one surviving without the other bullocks gone eh the fat man said yeah him and this shed you should have seen them they jumped into the road and pulled the sorcerer off his horse bullock chopped his arm off between them they killed four men bullock somebody split his head open like hitting a melon with a cleaver kingpin got trampled to death but he got his licks in i levered myself down beside shed oneeye did the same howd they catch you i asked the innkeeper too fat to run fast he managed a feeble smile never was meant to be a soldier i smiled what do you think oneeye a glance told me there was nothing i could do for shed oneeye shook his head goblin said two of these guys are still alive croaker what you want we should do take them inside ill patch them up they were brothers that the taken had twisted them and made them enemies did not make them less deserving of my help silent came up looming tall in the twilight he signed a maneuver worthy of the captain croaker right i stared at shed moved more than i thought i should be a man lay before me he had sunk as low as any id ever known then he had fought his way back and back and had become worthy a man far better than i for he had located his moral polestar and set his course by it though it had cost his life maybe just a little he had repaid his debt he did another thing by getting himself killed in a fight i did not consider his he became a sort of patron saint of mine an example for days to come he set a high standard in his last few days he opened his eyes before the end he smiled did we do it he asked we did it shed thanks to you and bullock good still smiling he closed his eyes hagop hollered hey croaker what you want to do about this asa creep asa was still in the blackberries yelling for help the dogs had the patch surrounded put a couple javelins in him oneeye muttered no shed said in a tiny whisper let him be he was my friend he tried to get back but they caught him let him go ah right shed hagop dig him out and turn him loose what you heard me i looked back at shed okay shed he didnt say anything he couldnt but he was smiling i got up and said at least somebody died the way he wanted otto get a damned shovel aw croaker get a goddamned shovel and get to work silent oneeye goblin inside we got plans to make the light was nearly gone by the lieutenants estimate it would be but hours before the lady reached meadenvil chapter fortynine on the move we need rest oneeye protested there wont be any rest till were dead i countered were on the other side now oneeye we did what the rebel couldnt weve done in the limper the last of the original taken shell be after us hard as soon as shes cleaned up these black castle leavings she has to if she doesnt get us fast every rebel in five thousand miles will get worked up to try something there are only two taken left and only whisper worth much yeah i know wishful thinking cant stop a man wishing croaker i stared at the necklace shed had worn i had to leave it for the lady yet the silver in it might become a lifesaver down the long road we had to travel i screwed up my courage and began digging out the eyes what the hell you doing going to leave these with the limper going to feed them to him i figure theyll hatch ha goblin said ironic fitting i thought it an interesting turn of justice give him back to the dominator and the lady will have to destroy him i like it grudgingly oneeye agreed thought you guys would go see if theyve got everybody buried only been ten minutes since they got back with the bodies all right go help i levered myself up and went to check on the men i had patched up i dont know if everyone hagop and otto brought back from the ambush site was dead when they got there they certainly were now kingpin had been dead for a long time though they had brought him to me to examine my patients were doing fine one was aware enough to be frightened i patted his arm and limped outside they had king in the ground now beside shed and bullock and the limpers boy they had buried earlier only two corpses remained unburied asa was making the dirt fly everyone else stood and watched till they saw me glowering whats the take i asked the fat man id had him strip the dead of valuables not a lot he showed me a hat filled with odds and ends take what you need to cover the damages you guys will need it more than me youre out a wagon and a team not to mention the dogs take what you need i can always rob somebody i dont like no one knew that i had filched sheds purse its weight had surprised me it would be my secret reserve take a couple horses too he shook his head im not getting caught with somebody elses animals after the dust settles and the prince starts looking for scapegoats he selected a few silver coins i got what i wanted okay youd better hide in the woods for a while the lady will come here shes nastier than the limper will do hagop if youre not going to dig go get the horses ready move i beckoned silent he and i dragged the limper to a shade tree out front silent tossed a rope over a limb i forced the eyes of the serpents down the takens throat we hoisted him up he turned slowly in the chill moonlight i rubbed my hands together and considered him took a while guy but somebody finally got you for ten years i had wanted to see him go down he had been the most inhuman of the taken asa came to me all buried croaker good thanks for the help i started toward the barn can i go with you guys i laughed please croaker dont leave me here where i dont give a damn asa but dont expect me to look out for you and dont try any slick tricks id as soon kill you as look at you thanks croaker he raced ahead hastily saddled another horse oneeye looked at me and shook his head mount up men lets go find raven though we pushed hard we were not twenty miles south of the inn when something hit my mind like a fighters fist a golden cloud materialized radiating anger you have exhausted my patience physician you exhausted mine a long time ago youll rue this murder ill exult in it its the first decent thing ive done this side of the sea of torments go find your castle eggs leave me alone were even oh no you will hear from me again as soon as i close the last door on my husband dont press your luck old witch im ready to get out of the game push and ill learn tellekurre that caught her from the blind side ask whisper what she lost in the forest of cloud and hoped to recover in meadenvil then reflect upon what an angry croaker could do with it if he knew where to find it there was a vertiginous moment as she withdrew i found my companions looking at me weirdly just saying goodbye to my girl i told them we lost asa in shaker we took a day off there to prepare for the next leg and when it came time to leave asa was not to be seen nobody bothered looking for him on sheds behalf i left him with a wish for luck judging from his past he probably had it and all bad my farewell to the lady did not take three months to the day after the limpers fall as we were resting prior to hazarding the last range of hills between us and chimney the golden cloud visited me again this time the lady was less belligerent in fact she seemed mildly amused greetings physician i thought you might want to know for the sake of your annals that the threat of the black castle no longer exists every seed has been located and destroyed more amusement there is no way my husband can rise short of exhumation he is cut off totally incapable of communicating with his sympathizers a permanent army occupies the barrowland i could think of nothing to say it was no less than i had expected and had hoped she would accomplish for she was the lesser evil and i suspect remained possessed of a spark that had not committed itself to the darkness she had shown restraint on several occasions when she could have indulged her cruelty maybe if she felt unchallenged she would drift toward the light rather than farther toward the shadow i interviewed whisper with the eye stand clear croaker never before had she called me by name i sat up and took notice there was no amusement in her now stand clear of those papers of the girl girl what girl dont come the innocent i know you left a wider trail than you thought and even dead men answer questions for one who knows how they must be asked such of your company as remained when i returned to juniper told most of the story if you wish to live out your days in peace kill her if you dont i will along with anyone near her i dont know what youre talking about amusement again but a hard sort a malignant sort keep your annals physician i will be in touch i will keep you apprised of the advance of the empire puzzled i asked why because it amuses me behave yourself she faded away we went down into chimney tired men threequarters dead we found the lieutenant and the ship andlo darling who was living aboard with the company the lieutenant had taken employment with the private constabulary of a mercantile factor he added our names to the roll as soon as we recuperated we did not find raven raven had evaded reconciliation or confrontation with his old comrades by cheating his way out fate is a fickle bitch who dotes on irony after all he had been through all he had done all he had survived the very morning the lieutenant arrived he slipped on a wet marble diving platform in a public bath split his head open fell into the pool and drowned i refused to believe it it could not be true after what he had pulled up north i dug around i poked i pried but there were scores of people who had seen the body the most reliable witness of all darling was absolutely convinced in the end i had to give in this time no one would hear my doubts the lieutenant himself claimed to have seen and recognized the corpse as the flames of a pyre had risen about it the morning of his arrival it was there he had encountered darling and had brought her back into the keeping of the black company what could i say if darling believed it must be true raven could never lie to her nineteen days after our arrival in chimney there was another arrival which explained the ladys nebulous remark about interviewing only those she could find when she returned to juniper elmo rode into town with seventy men many brethren from the old days whom he had spirited out of juniper while all the taken were absent but journey and journey was in such a state of confusion due to conflicting orders from the lady that he let slip the true state of affairs in meadenvil he followed me down the coast so in two years the black company had crossed the breadth of the world from the nethermost east to the farthest west close to four thousand miles and in the process had come near destruction and had found a new purpose a new life we were now the champions of the white rose a bedraggled joke of a nucleus for the force legend destined to bring the lady down i did not believe a word of that but raven had told darling what she was and she at least was ready to play her part we could but try i hoisted a glass of wine in the masters cabin elmo silent oneeye goblin the lieutenant and darling raised theirs above men prepared to cast off elmo had brought the company treasure chest we had no need to work i proposed my toast to the twentynine years twentynine years according to legend it would be that long before the great comet returned and fortune would smile upon the white rose they responded the twentynine years i thought i detected the faintest hint of gold in the comer of my eye felt the faintest hint of amusement
