chapter one beta gareth climbed out of the freezer he knocked a few small pieces of ice from his clothes and stood up he shook his head a freezer technician was standing next to him she was wearing a silver metal suit name gareth gareth palmer number beta job garden technician class four what are six threes eighteen and nine fours nine fours are thirtysix where are you on the new adventurer where are we going to the star orelia planet five the freezer technician put down her pen she turned to the doctor hes all right no problems she turned back to gareth youre ok beta you can go to your room dinner will be in forty minutes report for work at hours gareth walked out of the freezer room he was always a little nervous it didnt happen very often but every two or three months someone didnt wake up or they did wake up but they couldnt remember who they were or what they were doing he thought about philip philip was a garden technician too when he woke up last year he was like a baby he couldnt speak or feed himself they put him in the hospital for tests but there was nothing they could do they had to kill him there was no room on a starship for passengers gareth hurried to his room he wanted a shower that was always the first thing you wanted after two weeks in the freezer he found his room stopped and looked at the sign on the door room alpha beta he opened the door and went in the room as usual was empty he took his key from his pocket and opened his cupboard he took out a work suit and laid it on the bed and then he took off the metal freezer suit and put it in the cupboard he got in the shower and turned on the hot water he felt better immediately he stood in the shower for two minutes then the shower turned itself off two minutes was the longest time you could have in the shower then he saw something in the bottom of the shower tray a little piece of gold metal he picked it up it was an earring a small gold earring alpha he said to himself so alpha is a woman he smiled he had never met alpha of course she was in the freezer now she was going to be there for two weeks then gareth had to go to the freezer and alpha could come back to the room for her two weeks alpha and beta workers never met there were a lot of rules you couldnt leave anything in the room everything had to go in your cupboard nobody ever asked about the other workers it was easier gareth put on his work suit he put the earring on the table he looked at it for a minute he knew nothing about alpha they had used the same room for three years now and they were going to use it for seven or eight years more he didnt know what she looked like how old she was or what she did chapter two the new adventurer the new adventurer was a type d starship all type starships worked on a twoshift system there were two shifts of workers and each shift spent two weeks in the freezer then two weeks at work during the time in the freezer you didnt get older so that after a tenyear journey through space you were only five years older the journey to orelia five took ten years each way most of the people on the starship would stay on orelia five but you could return to earth if you wanted to without the freezers people would be more than twenty years older when they got back the freezers cut this time in half scientists on earth were working on faster starships and they were working on better freezers too two weeks was the longest safe time in the type freezer in the tenyear journey to orelia five about one per cent of the starships crew would die in the freezers when the scientists tried four weeks more than thirty per cent died at six weeks it was one hundred per cent so they used two shuts alpha workers were awake for weeks and beta workers were awake for weeks and a few of the crew the two captains the most important officers and the freezer technicians worked a different shift they were awake either for weeks and or for weeks and the biggest problem was the time in space everyone knew about the first type starship it left the earth in on a year journey to the centauri star system but when it arrived in it found thousands of earth people were already there the first starship that arrived on centauri was a type which left earth in and arrived on centauri in between and scientists discovered the hyperdrive engine which was much faster than the old type and type starships the second ship to arrive on centauri was a type which left earth in then a type which left in last of all was the type from you didnt know what was going to happen because it was impossible for hyperdrive starships to communicate with the earth perhaps when gareths type starship arrived on orelia five they would find that a type or was already there chapter three who is alpha gareth reported for work in the gardens at hours the gardens were one of the most important parts of the starship they had plants from earth for the new colonies on orelia five and they also produced food for the starship the plants cleaned the air on the spaceship and produced oxygen gareth walked over to his control desk gareth controlled the oranges and lemons he looked at the computer terminal everything was all right alpha had done a good job during his two weeks he thought about alpha he didnt know what her job was he pushed some buttons on the computer a list of garden technicians appeared he read it quickly so she wasnt a garden technician then he couldnt get information about any other jobs he walked over to the orangefarming area the trees were very small less than two metres high but each tree had more than a hundred oranges on it gardening and farming were two of the most important sciences there were millions of people in the star colonies and food had to be produced very quickly in small areas gareth looked at the water pipes they were all right he was still thinking about alpha he wanted to know more about her gareth finished work at hours on earth was night time in space it wasnt important he went back to his room and changed his clothes it was time for a meal restaurant area number three was nearly full when gareth arrived he took a tray and went to sit at a table with some friends mohamed and hiroshi they were starship hyperdrive technicians hi he said im happy to see youre both awake again it was a good day said hiroshi everybody woke up how do you know asked gareth when there was an accident in the freezer room it was usually a secret ive got a girlfriend in the freezer room said hiroshi she told me they finished their meal and went to the sports area there was a football match at between area and area they all wanted to watch it they sat down next to a tall woman they didnt know her but she was wearing a freezer technicians uniform area won the match easily thats the best score ive ever seen said mohamed the tall woman smiled you werent here last week she said the alpha team from area scored fifteen gareth thought for a moment of course the officers and freezer technicians worked different shifts from everyone else so they met people from the alpha shift and the beta shift he turned to the woman er you dont know alpha do you he said she laughed there are people on each shift she said anyway i can never remember numbers whats his name er alpha is a woman he said ok whats her name said the woman i dont know said gareth he felt stupid what does she look like i dont know said gareth again i dont know anything about her the woman looked at gareth then why are you asking about her you shouldnt ask about people on the alpha shift you know mohamed got up come on gareth lets go and have a coffee he said they sat down in one of the coffee rooms near the sports area mohamed looked at gareth for a moment whos the mystery woman he said oh shes the one that has the same room as me said gareth how do you know that shes a woman said mohamed gareth told him about the earring mohamed looked worried gareth you know you shouldnt ask questions about her if that freezer technician reports your conversation youll be in trouble why said gareth oh come on gareth you know the rules as well as i do said mohamed yes i know the rules said gareth i know them but i dont understand them why shouldnt i ask about her hiroshi moved forward i dont really understand either he said but they always keep the two shifts apart on starships i think its because there are of us on each shift and were locked up together for ten years when we arrive on orelia five therell be new faces faces that we arent bored with yes said mohamed it may not be very important but its like all the rules on a starship you have to obey all the rules one hundred per cent if we question the rules it will be impossible to go on so we must obey with no questions at all said gareth you know that gareth said hiroshi we all knew that before we left earth forget about this alpha woman said mohamed really its the best thing to do chapter four problems in the freezer room it was the last day of the beta shift gareth was in his room in half an hour it was going to be time to go to the freezer room gareth got into the shower very carefully he put the earring on the shower tray where he had found it then he took a small white flower and put it down next to the earring he hoped the cleaners would be too lazy to check the shower they hadnt checked it last month the small flower was from a lemon tree if the cleaners found it there would be trouble it was forbidden to pick flowers from the garden area nobody had seen gareth when he picked it earlier in the day when gareth got to the freezer room the door was closed a starship policeman was standing outside youll have to wait for a few minutes said the policeman were having a small problem gareth could hear screams from inside the room whats wrong he said i shouldnt tell you said the policeman but its one of the cooks he doesnt want to go in the freezer hes frightened he says he wants to stay awake until we get to orelia five whats happening said gareth what do you think said the policeman were putting him in the freezer if hes still making trouble when he wakes up in two weeks well have to well you know what well have to do gareth knew five minutes later the door opened gareth went in and walked towards the freezers he climbed into one before he started to fall asleep he thought about alpha i wonder if she uses the same freezer too two weeks later as soon as gareth left the freezer room he hurried to his room he closed the door and walked round the room it looked empty as usual he looked in the shower no earring nothing he had his shower he felt sad what had he been hoping to find he didnt really know he got out of the shower and went over to the sink he wanted a drink of water he turned on the tap nothing happened for a second then the water came out suddenly a piece of paper came out with the water he picked it up it was wet he sat on the bed and looked at it dear beta thank you for finding my earring and thank you for the flower you mustnt do anything like that again its dangerous for you ive often wondered about you i dont know anything about you i know you are a man you didnt clean the sink very well after you shaved and the cleaners are not very careful in this area of the ship well well meet on orelia five until then good luck best wishes alpha gareth read the note several times it was dangerous for her too he should throw the note away but he couldnt now he really wanted to know about alpha he went for dinner as he walked into the restaurant area he saw the policeman again hello he said what happened to the cook the policeman looked round quickly be quiet he said ill be in trouble its forbidden for me to talk about it lets just say there was a problem with his freezer he didnt wake up you mean they killed him said gareth i didnt say that there was a problem with his freezer and you should forget this conversation im going to forget it gareth thought for a long time about the note on the last day of his shift he sat in his cabin and wrote to alpha dear alpha can i call you or can i call you by your real name im gareth palmer and im a garden technician im and i come from london in the united european district on earth this is my first space trip and im going to stay on orelia five so its probably my last space trip too i dont know why i want to know about you but i do but i dont want you to do anything dangerous you know what happens to people who break the rules be careful very best wishes gareth gareth put the note carefully into the tap he was smiling as he went to the freezer room he wanted the next two weeks to pass quickly chapter five an educational program gareth nearly got into trouble when he got out of i the freezer two weeks later as usual the freezer technician asked him questions when she said name he said gareth palmer but when she said number he replied alpha because that was what he had been thinking about he quickly said no sorry i mean beta but he had to have half an hour of tests he hated the tests they didnt hurt but he wanted to hurry to his room as quickly as he could at last the doctor said that he was all right and he could go he went to the sink at once it was there he read it immediately dear gareth this is stupid and wrong but i want to know about you too i had to write this note my names sara lopez and i was born on centauri three im and im an educational technician i work on the selfstudy computer programs and my special area is the history of space exploration i wrote the new program on the history of the centauri colonies its in the library now i finished it this week you should look at it especially the piece on the first colony in write again best wishes sara gareth smiled as soon as he finished dinner he hurried to the selfstudy library he walked along the row of people in the library until he found a computer terminal that no one was using he put his things on the chair and went over to the library technician hello he said im interested in the history of the centauri colony have you got anything let me see she said i think theres a new educational program she gave him a small green disk he walked back to his terminal hiroshi was standing there hi gareth he said what are you doing with a green disk green disks are history arent they i didnt know you were interested in history er yes i am said gareth what are you doing im looking at a program about japan my greatgreatgrandfather was japanese he was the first one in our family that went into space you know hiroshi went to a computer terminal on the other side of the room gareth sat down put on the headphones and put the disk into the computer the program was very exciting gareth watched the hologram pictures of the first starship landing he asked the computer to move to he saw a hologram of the main city on centauri and listened to the computer voice suddenly he sat up the computer voice was saying and now entertainment the first centauri television station opened in january the first programmes were old videos from earth in may they showed the first programme that was made on centauri it was a comedy and it was called gareth i think i love you the centauri television station made many tv programmes after that and they were popular everywhere sara she wrote the computer program gareth went over to the desk and got some more programs television in the rd century a short history of centauri television on centauri and some others there was nothing on any of them about gareth i think i love you it was a secret message to him gareth spent hours on saras program during that shift there were no other messages but while he was watching the program he thought about sara all the time he could meet her in seven or eight years but how could he meet her before then the next day he returned to the selfstudy library he asked the library technician about programs on centauri she didnt seem very interested but ive got a lot of questions about it i want to speak to the education technician that wrote the program is she or he an alpha or a beta ive got no idea but you must have some information theres only one selfstudy library the library technician pushed a few buttons on her terminal the person that wrote the program was a sara lopez we only have the name but ive never met her so im sure shes an alpha of course you cant speak to her no of course not could i leave a message well thats forbidden its a question about the program thats all right gareth left a message dear programmer i am interested in the history of television on centauri your program talks about television in i saw a programme from centauri once it
