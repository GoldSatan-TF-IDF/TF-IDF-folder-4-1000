josh and i hated our new house sure it was big it looked like a mansion compared to our old house it was a tall redbrick house with a sloping black roof and rows of windows framed by black shutters its so dark i thought studying it from the street the whole house was covered in darkness as if it were hiding in the shadows of the gnarled old trees that bent over it it was the middle of july but dead brown leaves blanketed the front yard our sneakers crunched over them as we trudged up the gravel driveway tall weeds poked up everywhere through the dead leaves thick clumps of weeds had completely overgrown an old flower bed beside the front porch this house is creepy i thought unhappily josh must have been thinking the same thing looking up at the old house we both groaned loudly mr dawes the friendly young man from the local real estate office stopped near the front walk and turned around everything okay he asked staring first at josh then at me with his crinkly blue eyes josh and amanda arent happy about moving dad explained tucking his shirttail in dad is a little overweight and his shirts always seem to be coming untucked its hard for kids my mother added smiling at mr dawes her hands shoved into her jeans pockets as she continued up to the front door you know leaving all of their friends behind moving to a strange new place strange is right josh said shaking his head this house is gross mr dawes chuckled its an old house thats for sure he said patting josh on the shoulder it just needs some work josh dad said smiling at mr dawes no one has lived in it for a while so itll take some fixing up look how big it is mom added smoothing back her straight black hair and smiling at josh well have room for a den and maybe a rec room too youd like that wouldnt you amanda i shrugged a cold breeze made me shiver it was actually a beautiful hot summer day but the closer we got to the house the colder i felt i guessed it was because of all the tall old trees i was wearing white tennis shorts and a sleeveless blue tshirt it had been hot in the car but now i was freezing maybe itll be warmer in the house i thought how old are they mr dawes asked mom stepping onto the front porch amanda is twelve mom answered and josh turned eleven last month they look so much alike mr dawes told mom i couldnt decide if that was a compliment or not i guess its true josh and i are both tall and thin and have curly brown hair like dads and dark brown eyes everyone says we have serious faces i really want to go home josh said his voice cracking i hate this place my brother is the most impatient kid in the world and when he makes up his mind about something thats it hes a little spoiled at least i think so whenever he makes a big fuss about something he usually gets his way we may look alike but were really not that similar im a lot more patient than josh is a lot more sensible probably because im older and because im a girl josh had hold of dads hand and was trying to pull him back to the car lets go come on dad lets go i knew this was one time josh wouldnt get his way we were moving to this house no doubt about it after all the house was absolutely free a greatuncle of dads a man we didnt even know had died and left the house to dad in his will ill never forget the look on dads face when he got the letter from the lawyer he let out a loud whoop and began dancing around the living room josh and i thought hed flipped or something my greatuncle charles has left us a house in his will dad explained reading and rereading the letter its in a town called dark falls huh josh and i cried wheres dark falls dad shrugged i dont remember your uncle charles mom said moving behind dad to read the letter over his shoulder neither do i admitted dad but he mustve been a great guy wow this sounds like an incredible house he grabbed moms hands and began dancing happily with her across the living room dad sure was excited hed been looking for an excuse to quit his boring office job and devote all of his time to his writing career this house absolutely free would be just the excuse he needed and now a week later here we were in dark falls a fourhour drive from our home seeing our new house for the first time we hadnt even gone inside and josh was trying to drag dad back to the car josh stop pulling me dad snapped impatiently trying to tug his hand out of joshs grasp dad glanced helplessly at mr dawes i could see that he was embarrassed by how josh was carrying on i decided maybe i could help let go josh i said quietly grabbing josh by the shoulder we promised wed give dark falls a chance remember i already gave it a chance josh whined not letting go of dads hand this house is old and ugly and i hate it you havent even gone inside dad said angrily yes lets go in mr dawes urged staring at josh im staying outside josh insisted he can be really stubborn sometimes i felt just as unhappy as josh looking at this dark old house but id never carry on the way josh was josh dont you want to pick out your own room mom asked no josh muttered he and i both glanced up to the second floor there were two large bay windows side by side up there they looked like two dark eyes staring back at us how long have you lived in your present house mr dawes asked dad dad had to think for a second about fourteen years he answered the kids have lived there for their whole lives moving is always hard mr dawes said sympathetically turning his gaze on me you know amanda i moved here to dark falls just a few months ago i didnt like it much either at first but now i wouldnt live anywhere else he winked at me he had a cute dimple in his chin when he smiled lets go inside its really quite nice youll be surprised all of us followed mr dawes except josh are there other kids on this block josh demanded he made it sound more like a challenge than a question mr dawes nodded the schools just two blocks away he said pointing up the street see mom quickly cut in a short walk to school no more long bus rides every morning i liked the bus josh insisted his mind was made up he wasnt going to give my parents a break even though wed both promised to be openminded about this move i dont know what josh thought he had to gain by being such a pain i mean dad already had plenty to worry about for one thing he hadnt been able to sell our old house yet i didnt like the idea of moving but i knew that inheriting this big house was a great opportunity for us we were so cramped in our little house and once dad managed to sell the old place we wouldnt have to worry at all about money anymore josh should at least give it a chance thats what i thought suddenly from our car at the foot of the driveway we heard petey barking and howling and making a fuss petey is our dog a white curlyhaired terrier cute as a button and usually wellbehaved he never minded being left in the car but now he was yowling and yapping at full volume and scratching at the car window desperate to get out petey quiet quiet i shouted petey usually listened to me but not this time im going to let him out josh declared and took off down the driveway toward the car no wait dad called but i dont think josh could hear him over peteys wails might as well let the dog explore mr dawes said its going to be his house too a few seconds later petey came charging across the lawn kicking up brown leaves yipping excitedly as he ran up to us he jumped on all of us as if he hadnt seen us in weeks and then to our surprise he started growling menacingly and barking at mr dawes petey stop mom yelled hes never done this dad said apologetically really hes usually very friendly he probably smells something on me another dog maybe mr dawes said loosening his striped tie looking warily at our growling dog finally josh grabbed petey around the middle and lifted him away from mr dawes stop it petey josh scolded holding the dog up close to his face so that they were nosetonose mr dawes is our friend petey whimpered and licked joshs face after a short while josh set him back down on the ground petey looked up at mr dawes then at me then decided to go sniffing around the yard letting his nose lead the way lets go inside mr dawes urged moving a hand through his short blond hair he unlocked the front door and pushed it open mr dawes held the screen door open for us i started to follow my parents into the house ill stay out here with petey josh insisted from the walk dad started to protest but changed his mind okay fine he said sighing and shaking his head im not going to argue with you dont come in you can live outside if you want he sounded really exasperated i want to stay with petey josh said again watching petey nose his way through the dead flower bed mr dawes followed us into the hallway gently closing the screen door behind him giving josh a final glance hell be fine he said softly smiling at mom he can be so stubborn sometimes mom said apologetically she peeked into the living room im really sorry about petey i dont know what got into that dog no problem lets start in the living room mr dawes said leading the way i think youll be pleasantly surprised by how spacious it is of course it needs work he took us on a tour of every room in the house i was beginning to get excited the house was really kind of neat there were so many rooms and so many closets and my room was huge and had its own bathroom and an oldfashioned window seat where i could sit at the window and look down at the street i wished josh had come inside with us if he could see how great the house was inside i knew hed start to cheer up i couldnt believe how many rooms there were even a finished attic filled with old furniture and stacks of old mysterious cartons we could explore we must have been inside for at least half an hour i didnt really keep track of the time i think all three of us were feeling cheered up well i think ive shown you everything mr dawes said glancing at his watch he led the way to the front door wait i want to take one more look at my room i told them excitedly i started up the stairs taking them two at a time ill be down in a second hurry dear im sure mr dawes has other appointments mom called after me i reached the secondfloor landing and hurried down the narrow hallway and into my new room wow i said aloud and the word echoed faintly against the empty walls it was so big and i loved the bay window with the window seat i walked over to it and peered out through the trees i could see our car in the driveway and beyond it a house that looked a lot like ours across the street im going to put my bed against that wall across from the window i thought happily and my desk can go over there ill have room for a computer now i took one more look at my closet a long walkin closet with a light in the ceiling and wide shelves against the back wall i was heading to the door thinking about which of my posters i wanted to bring with me when i saw the boy he stood in the doorway for just a second and then he turned and disappeared down the hall josh i cried hey come look with a shock i realized it wasnt josh for one thing the boy had blond hair hey i called and ran to the hallway stopping just outside my bedroom door looking both ways whos here but the long hall was empty all of the doors were closed whoa amanda i said aloud was i seeing things mom and dad were calling from downstairs i took one last look down the dark corridor then hurried to rejoin them hey mr dawes i called as i ran down the stairs is this house haunted he chuckled the question seemed to strike him funny no sorry he said looking at me with those crinkly blue eyes no ghost included a lot of old houses around here are said to be haunted but im afraid this isnt one of them i i thought i saw something i said feeling a little foolish probably just shadows mom said with all the trees this house is so dark why dont you run outside and tell josh about the house dad suggested tucking in the front of his shirt your mom and i have some things to talk over with mr dawes yes master i said with a little bow and obediently ran out to tell josh all about what he had missed hey josh i called eagerly searching the yard josh my heart sank josh and petey were gone josh josh first i called josh then i called petey but there was no sign of either of them i ran down to the bottom of the driveway and peered into the car but they werent there mom and dad were still inside talking with mr dawes i looked along the street in both directions but there was no sign of them josh hey josh finally mom and dad came hurrying out the front door looking alarmed i guess they heard my shouts i cant find josh or petey i yelled up to them from the street maybe theyre around back dad shouted down to me i headed up the driveway kicking away dead leaves as i ran it was sunny down on the street but as soon as i entered our yard i was back in the shade and it was immediately cool again hey josh josh where are you why did i feel so scared it was perfectly natural for josh to wander off he did it all the time i ran full speed along the side of the house tall trees leaned over the house on this side blocking out nearly all of the sunlight the backyard was bigger than id expected a long rectangle that sloped gradually down to a wooden fence at the back just like the front this yard was a mass of tall weeds poking up through a thick covering of brown leaves a stone birdbath had toppled onto its side beyond it i could see the side of the garage a dark brick building that matched the house hey josh he wasnt back here i stopped and searched the ground for footprints or a sign that he had run through the thick leaves well out of breath dad came jogging up to me no sign of him i said surprised at how worried i felt did you check the car he sounded more angry than worried yes its the first place i looked i gave the backyard a last quick search i dont believe josh would just take off i do dad said rolling his eyes you know your brother when he doesnt get his way maybe he wants us to think hes run away from home he frowned where is he mom asked as we returned to the front of the house dad and i both shrugged maybe he made a friend and wandered off dad said he raised a hand and scratched his curly brown hair i could tell that he was starting to worry too weve got to find him mom said gazing down to the street he doesnt know this neighborhood at all he probably wandered off and got lost mr dawes locked the front door and stepped down off the porch pocketing the keys he couldnt have gotten far he said giving mom a reassuring smile lets drive around the block im sure well find him mom shook her head and glanced nervously at dad ill kill him she muttered dad patted her on the shoulder mr dawes opened the trunk of the small honda pulled off his dark blazer and tossed it inside then he took out a widebrimmed black cowboy hat and put it on his head hey thats quite a hat dad said climbing into the front passenger seat keeps the sun away mr dawes said sliding behind the wheel and slamming the car door mom and i got in back glancing over at her i saw that mom was as worried as i was we headed down the block in silence all four of us staring out the car windows the houses we passed all seemed old most of them were even bigger than our house all of them seemed to be in better condition nicely painted with neat welltrimmed lawns i didnt see any people in the houses or yards and there was no one on the street it certainly is a quiet neighborhood i thought and shady the houses all seemed to be surrounded by tall leafy trees the front yards we drove slowly past all seemed to be bathed in shade the street was the only sunny place a narrow gold ribbon that ran through the shadows on both sides maybe thats why its called dark falls i thought where is that son of mine dad asked staring hard out the windshield ill kill him i really will mom muttered it wasnt the first time she had said that about josh we had gone around the block twice no sign of him mr dawes suggested we drive around the next few blocks and dad quickly agreed hope i dont get lost im new here too mr dawes said turning a corner hey theres the school he announced pointing out the window at a tall redbrick building it looked very oldfashioned with white columns on both sides of the double front doors of course its closed now mr dawes added my eyes searched the fencedin playground behind the school it was empty no one there could josh have walked this far mom asked her voice tight and higher than usual josh doesnt walk dad said rolling his eyes he runs well find him mr dawes said confidently tapping his fingers on the wheel as he steered we turned a corner onto another shady block a street sign read cemetery drive and sure enough a large cemetery rose up in front of us granite gravestones rolled along a low hill which sloped down and then up again onto a large flat stretch also marked with rows of low grave markers and monuments a few shrubs dotted the cemetery but there werent many trees as we drove slowly past the gravestones passing by in a blur on the left i realized that this was the sunniest spot i had seen in the whole town theres your son mr dawes pointing out the window stopped the car suddenly oh thank goodness mom exclaimed leaning down to see out the window on my side of the car sure enough there was josh running wildly along a crooked row of low white gravestones whats he doing here i asked pushing open my car door i stepped down from the car took a few steps onto the grass and called to him at first he didnt react to my shouts he seemed to be ducking and dodging through the tombstones he would run in one direction then cut to the side then head in another direction why was he doing that i took another few steps and then stopped gripped with fear i suddenly realized why josh was darting and ducking like that running so wildly through the tombstones he was being chased someone or something was after him then as i took a few reluctant steps toward josh watching him bend low then change directions his arms outstretched as he ran i realized i had it completely backward josh wasnt being chased josh was chasing he was chasing after petey okay okay so sometimes my imagination runs away with me running through an old graveyard like this even in bright daylight its only natural that a person might start to have weird thoughts i called to josh again and this time he heard me and turned around he looked worried amanda come help me he cried josh whats the matter i ran as fast as i could to catch up with him but he kept darting through the gravestones moving from row to row help josh whats wrong i turned and saw that mom and dad were right behind me its petey josh explained out of breath i cant get him to stop i caught him once but he pulled away from me petey petey dad started calling the dog but petey was moving from stone to stone sniffing each one then running to the next how did you get all the way over here dad asked as he caught up with my brother i had to follow petey josh explained still looking very worried he just took off one second he was sniffing around that dead flower bed in our front yard the next second he just started to run he wouldnt stop when i called wouldnt even look back he kept running till he got here i had to follow i was afraid hed get lost josh stopped and gratefully let dad take over the chase i dont know what that dumb dogs problem is he said to me hes just weird it took dad a few tries but he finally managed to grab petey and pick him up off the ground our little terrier gave a halfhearted yelp of protest then allowed himself to be carried away we all trooped back to the car on the side of the road mr dawes was waiting by the car maybe youd better get a leash for that dog he said looking very concerned peteys never been on a leash josh protested wearily climbing into the backseat well we might have to try one for a while dad said quietly especially if he keeps running away dad tossed petey into the backseat the dog eagerly curled up in joshs arms the rest of us piled into the car and mr dawes drove us back to his office a tiny white flatroofed building at the end of a row of small offices as we rode i reached over and stroked the back of peteys head why did the dog run away like that i wondered petey had never done that before i guessed that petey was also upset about our moving after all petey had spent his whole life in our old house he probably felt a lot like josh and i did about having to pack up and move and never see the old neighborhood again the new house the new streets and all the new smells must have freaked the poor dog out josh wanted to run away from the whole idea and so did petey anyway that was my theory mr dawes parked the car in front of his tiny office shook dads hand and gave him a business card you can come by next week he told mom and dad ill have all the legal work done by then after you sign the papers you can move in anytime he pushed open the car door and giving us all a final smile prepared to climb out compton dawes mom said reading the white business card over dads shoulder thats an unusual name is compton an old family name mr dawes shook his head no he said im the only compton in my family i have no idea where the name comes from no idea at all maybe my parents didnt know how to spell charlie chuckling at his terrible joke he climbed out of the car lowered the wide black stetson hat on his head pulled his blazer from the trunk and disappeared into the small white building dad climbed behind the wheel moving the seat back to make room for his big stomach mom got up front and we started the long drive home i guess you and petey had quite an adventure today mom said to josh rolling up her window because dad had turned on the air conditioner i guess josh said without enthusiasm petey was sound asleep in his lap snoring quietly youre going to love your room i told josh the whole house is great really josh stared at me thoughtfully but didnt answer i poked him in the ribs with my elbow say something did you hear what i said but the weird thoughtful look didnt fade from joshs face the next couple of weeks seemed to crawl by i walked around the house thinking about how id never see my room again how id never eat breakfast in this kitchen again how id never watch tv in the living room again morbid stuff like that i had this sick feeling when the movers came one afternoon and delivered a tall stack of cartons time to pack up it was really happening even though it was the middle of the afternoon i went up to my room and flopped down on my bed i didnt nap or anything i just stared at the ceiling for more than an hour and all these wild unconnected thoughts ran through my head like a dream only i was awake i wasnt the only one who was nervous about the move mom and dad were snapping at each other over nothing at all one morning they had a big fight over whether the bacon was too crispy or not in a way it was funny to see them being so childish josh was acting really sullen all the time he hardly spoke a word to anyone and petey sulked too that dumb dog wouldnt even pick himself up and come over to me when i had some table scraps for him i guess the hardest part about moving was saying goodbye to my friends carol and amy were away at camp so i had to write to them but kathy was home and she was my oldest and best friend and the hardest to say goodbye to i think some people were surprised that kathy and i had stayed such good friends for one thing we look so different im tall and thin and dark and shes fairskinned with long blonde hair and a little chubby but weve been friends since preschool and best best friends since fourth grade when she came over the night before the move we were both terribly awkward kathy you shouldnt be nervous i told her youre not the one whos moving away forever its not like youre moving to china or something she answered chewing hard on her bubble gum dark falls is only four hours away amanda well see each other a lot yeah i guess i said but i didnt believe it four hours away was as bad as being in china as far as i was concerned i guess we can still talk on the phone i said glumly she blew a small green bubble then sucked it back into her mouth yeah sure she said pretending to be enthusiastic youre lucky you know moving out of this crummy neighborhood to a big house its not a crummy neighborhood i insisted i dont know why i was defending the neighborhood i never had before one of our favorite pastimes was thinking of places wed rather be growing up school wont be the same without you she sighed curling her legs under her on the chair whos going to slip me the answers in math i laughed i always slipped you the wrong answers but it was the thought that counted kathy said and then she groaned ugh junior high is your new junior high part of the high school or part of the elementary school i made a disgusted face everythings in one building its a small town remember theres no separate high school at least i didnt see one bummer she said bummer was right we chatted for hours until kathys mom called and said it was time for her to come home then we hugged i had made up my mind that i wouldnt cry but i could feel the big hot tears forming in the corners of my eyes and then they were running down my cheeks im so miserable i wailed i had planned to be really controlled and mature but kathy was my best friend after all and what could i do we made a promise that wed always be together on our birthdays no matter what wed force our parents to make sure we didnt miss each others birthdays and then we hugged again and kathy said dont worry well see each other a lot really and she had tears in her eyes too she turned and ran out the door the screen door slammed hard behind her i stood there staring out into the darkness until petey came scampering in his toenails clicking across the linoleum and started to lick my hand the next morning moving day was a rainy saturday not a downpour no thunder or lightning but just enough rain and wind to make the long drive slow and unpleasant the sky seemed to get darker as we neared the new neighborhood the heavy trees bent low over the street slow down jack mom warned shrilly the street is really slick but dad was in a hurry to get to the house before the moving van did theyll just put the stuff anywhere if were not there to supervise he explained josh beside me in the backseat was being a real pain as usual he kept complaining that he was thirsty when that didnt get results he started whining that he was starving but we had all had a big breakfast so that didnt get any reaction either he just wanted attention of course i kept trying to cheer him up by telling him how great the house was inside and how big his room was he still hadnt seen it but he didnt want to be cheered up he started wrestling with petey getting the poor dog all worked up until dad had to shout at him to stop lets all try really hard not to get on each others nerves mom suggested dad laughed good idea dear dont make fun of me she snapped they started to argue about who was more exhausted from all the packing petey stood up on his hind legs and started to howl at the back window cant you shut him up mom screamed i pulled petey down but he struggled back up and started howling again hes never done this before i said just get him quiet mom insisted i pulled petey down by his hind legs and josh started to howl mom turned around and gave him a dirty look josh didnt stop howling though he thought he was a riot finally dad pulled the car up the driveway of the new house the tires crunched over the wet gravel rain pounded on the roof home sweet home mom said i couldnt tell if she was being sarcastic or not i think she was really glad the long car ride was over at least we beat the movers dad said glancing at his watch then his expression changed hope theyre not lost its as dark as night out there josh complained petey was jumping up and down in my lap desperate to get out of the car he was usually a good traveler but once the car stopped he wanted out immediately i opened my car door and he leaped onto the driveway with a splash and started to run in a wild zigzag across the front yard at least someones glad to be here josh said quietly dad ran up to the porch and fumbling with the unfamiliar keys managed to get the front door open then he motioned for us to come into the house mom and josh ran across the walk eager to get in out of the rain i closed the car door behind me and started to jog after them but something caught my eye i stopped and looked up to the twin bay windows above the porch i held a hand over my eyebrows to shield my eyes and squinted through the rain yes i saw it a face in the window on the left the boy the same boy was up there staring down at me wipe your feet dont track mud on the nice clean floors mom called her voice echoed against the bare walls of the empty living room i stepped into the hallway the house smelled of paint the painters had just finished on thursday it was hot in the house much hotter than outside this kitchen light wont go on dad called from the back did the painters turn off the electricity or something how should i know mom shouted back their voices sounded so loud in the big empty house mom theres someone upstairs i cried wiping my feet on the new welcome mat and hurrying into the living room she was at the window staring out at the rain looking for the movers probably she spun around as i came in what theres a boy upstairs i saw him in the window i said struggling to catch my breath josh entered the room from the back hallway hed probably been with dad he laughed is someone already living here theres no one upstairs mom said rolling her eyes are you two going to give me a break today or what what did i do josh whined listen amanda were all a little on edge today mom started but i interrupted her i saw his face mom in the window im not crazy you know says who josh cracked amanda mom bit her lower lip the way she always did when she was really exasperated you saw a reflection of something of a tree probably she turned back to the window the rain was coming down in sheets now the wind driving it noisily against the large picture window i ran to the stairway cupped my hands over my mouth and shouted up to the second floor whos up there no answer whos up there i called a little louder mom had her hands over her ears amanda please josh had disappeared through the dining room he was finally exploring the house theres someone up there i insisted and impulsively i started up the wooden stairway my sneakers thudding loudly on the bare steps amanda i heard mom call after me but i was too angry to stop why didnt she believe me why did she have to say it was a reflection of a tree i saw up there i was curious i had to know who was upstairs i had to prove mom wrong i had to show her i hadnt seen a stupid reflection i guess i can be pretty stubborn too maybe its a family trait the stairs squeaked and creaked under me as i climbed i didnt feel at all scared until i reached the secondfloor landing then i suddenly had this heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach i stopped breathing hard leaning on the banister who could it be a burglar a bored neighborhood kid who had broken into an empty house for a thrill maybe i shouldnt be up here alone i realized maybe the boy in the window was dangerous anybody up here i called my voice suddenly trembly and weak still leaning against the banister i listened and i could hear footsteps scampering across the hallway no not footsteps the rain thats what it was the patter of rain against the slateshingled roof for some reason the sound made me feel a little calmer i let go of the banister and stepped into the long narrow hallway it was dark up here except for a rectangle of gray light from a small window at the other end i took a few steps the old wooden floorboards creaking noisily beneath me anybody up here again no answer i stepped up to the first doorway on my left the door was closed the smell of fresh paint was suffocating there was a light switch on the wall near the door maybe its for the hall light i thought i clicked it on but nothing happened anybody here my hand was trembling as i grabbed the doorknob it felt warm in my hand and damp i turned it and taking a deep breath pushed open the door i peered into the room gray light filtered in through the bay window a flash of lightning made me jump back the thunder that followed was a dull distant roar slowly carefully i took a step into the room then another no sign of anyone this was a guest bedroom or it could be joshs room if he decided he liked it another flash of lightning the sky seemed to be darkening it was pitchblack out there even though it was just after lunchtime i backed into the hall the next room down was going to be mine it also had a bay window that looked down on the front yard was the boy i saw staring down at me in my room i crept down the hall letting my hand run along the wall for some reason and stopped outside my door which was also closed taking a deep breath i knocked on the door whos in there i called i listened silence then a clap of thunder closer than the last i froze as if i were paralyzed holding my breath it was so hot up here hot and damp and the smell of paint was making me dizzy i grabbed the doorknob anybody in there i started to turn the knob when the boy crept up from behind and grabbed my shoulder i couldnt breathe i couldnt cry out my heart seemed to stop my chest felt as if it were about to explode with a desperate terrified effort i spun around josh i shrieked you scared me to death i thought he let go of me and took a step back gotcha he declared and then started to laugh a highpitched laugh that echoed down the long bare hallway my heart was pounding hard now my forehead throbbed youre not funny i said angrily i shoved him against the wall you really scared me he laughed and rolled around on the floor hes really a sicko i tried to shove him again but missed angrily i turned away from him just in time to see my bedroom door slowly swinging open i gasped in disbelief and froze gaping at the moving door josh stopped laughing and stood up immediately serious his dark eyes wide with fright i could hear someone moving inside the room i could hear whispering excited giggles who whos there managed to stammer in a high little voice i didnt recognize the door creaking loudly opened a hit more then started to close whos there i demanded a bit more forcefully again i could hear whispering someone moving about josh had backed up against the wall and was edging away toward the stairs he had an expression on his face id never seen before sheer terror the door creaking like a door in a movie haunted house closed a little more josh was nearly to the stairway he was staring at me violently motioning with his hand for me to follow but instead i stepped forward grabbed the doorknob and pushed the door open hard it didnt resist i let go of the doorknob and stood blocking the doorway whos there the room was empty thunder crashed it took me a few seconds to realize what was making the door move the window on the opposite wall had been left open several inches the gusting wind through the open window must have been opening and closing the door i guessed that also explained the other sounds i heard inside the room the sounds i thought were whispers who had left the window open the painters probably i took a deep breath and let it out slowly waiting for my pounding heart to settle down to normal feeling a little foolish i walked quickly to the window and pushed it shut amanda are you all right josh whispered from the hallway i started to answer him but then i had a better idea he had practically scared me to death a few minutes before why not give him a little scare he deserved it so i didnt answer him i could hear him take a few timid steps closer to my room amanda amanda you okay i tiptoed over to my closet pulled the door open a third of the way then i laid down flat on the floor on my back with my head and shoulders hidden inside the closet and the rest of me out in the room amanda josh sounded very scared ohhhhh i moaned loudly i knew when he saw me sprawled on the floor like this hed totally freak out amanda whats happening he was in the doorway now hed see me any second now lying in the dark room my head hidden from view the lightning flashing impressively and the thunder cracking outside the old window i took a deep breath and held it to keep from giggling amanda he whispered and then he must have seen me because he uttered a loud huh and i heard him gasp and then he screamed at the top of his lungs i heard him running down the hall to the stairway shrieking mom dad and i heard his sneakers thudding down the wooden stairs with him screaming and calling all the way down i snickered to myself then before i could pull myself up i felt a rough warm tongue licking my face petey he was licking my cheeks licking my eyelids licking me frantically as if he were trying to revive me or as if to let me know that everything was okay oh petey petey i cried laughing and throwing my arms around the sweet dog stop youre getting me all sticky but he wouldnt stop he kept on licking fiercely the poor dog is nervous too i thought come on petey shape up i told him holding his panting face away with both my hands theres nothing to be nervous about this new place is going to be fun youll see that night i was smiling to myself as i fluffed up my pillow and slid into bed i was thinking about how terrified josh had been that afternoon how frightened he looked even after i came prancing down the stairs perfectly okay how angry he was that id fooled him of course mom and dad didnt think it was funny they were both nervous and upset because the moving van had just arrived an hour late they forced josh and me to call a truce no more scaring each other its hard not to get scared in this creepy old place josh muttered but we reluctantly agreed not to play any more jokes on each other if we could possibly help it the men complaining about the rain started carrying in all of our furniture josh and i helped show them where we wanted stuff in our rooms they dropped my dresser on the stairs but it only got a small scratch the furniture looked strange and small in this big house josh and i tried to stay out of the way while mom and dad worked all day arranging things emptying cartons putting clothes away mom even managed to get the curtains hung in my room what a day now a little after ten oclock trying to get to sleep for the first time in my new room i turned onto my side then onto my back even though this was my old bed i couldnt get comfortable everything seemed so different so wrong the bed didnt face the same direction as in my old bedroom the walls were bare i hadnt had time to hang any of my posters the room seemed so large and empty the shadows seemed so much darker my back started to itch and then i suddenly felt itchy all over the bed is filled with bugs i thought sitting up but of course that was ridiculous it was my same old bed with clean sheets i forced myself to settle back down and closed my eyes sometimes when i cant get to sleep i count silently by twos picturing each number in my mind as i think it it usually helps to clear my mind so that i can drift off to sleep i tried it now burying my face in the pillow picturing the numbers rolling past i yawned loudly still wide awake at twotwenty im going to be awake forever i thought im never going to be able to sleep in this new room but then i must have drifted off without realizing it i dont know how long i slept an hour or two at the most it was a light uncomfortable sleep then something woke me i sat straight up startled despite the heat of the room i felt cold all over looking down to the end of the bed i saw that i had kicked off the sheet and light blanket with a groan i reached down for them but then froze i heard whispers someone was whispering across the room who whos there my voice was a whisper too tiny and frightened i grabbed my covers and pulled them up to my chin i heard more whispers the room came into focus as my eyes adjusted to the dim light the curtains the long sheer curtains from my old room that my mother had hung that afternoon were fluttering at the window so that explained the whispers the billowing curtains must have woken me up a soft gray light floated in from outside the curtains cast moving shadows onto the foot of my bed yawning i stretched and climbed out of bed i felt chilled all over as i crept across the wooden floor to close the window as i came near the curtains stopped billowing and floated back into place i pushed them aside and reached out to close the window oh i uttered a soft cry when i realized that the window was closed but how could the curtains flutter like that with the window closed i stood there for a while staring out at the grays of the night there wasnt much of a draft the window seemed pretty airtight had i imagined the curtains billowing were my eyes playing tricks on me yawning i hurried back through the strange shadows to my bed and pulled the covers up as high as they would go amanda stop scaring yourself i scolded when i fell back to sleep a few minutes later i had the ugliest most terrifying dream i dreamed that we were all dead mom dad josh and me at first i saw us sitting around the dinner table in the new dining room the room was very bright so bright i couldnt see our faces very well they were just a bright white blur but then slowly slowly everything came into focus and i could see that beneath our hair we had no faces our skin was gone and only our graygreen skulls were left bits of flesh clung to my bony cheeks there were only deep black sockets where my eyes had been the four of us all dead sat eating in silence our dinner plates i saw were filled with small bones a big platter in the center of the table was piled high with graygreen bones humanlooking bones and then in this dream our disgusting meal was interrupted by a loud knocking on the door an insistent pounding that grew louder and louder it was kathy my friend from back home i could see her at our front door pounding on it with both fists i wanted to go answer the door i wanted to run from the dining room and pull open the door and greet kathy i wanted to talk to kathy i wanted to tell her what had happened to me to explain that i was dead and that my face had fallen away i wanted to see kathy so badly but i couldnt get up from the table i tried and tried but i couldnt get up the pounding on the door grew louder and louder until it was deafening but i just sat there with my gruesome family picking up bones from my dinner plate and eating them i woke up with a start the horror of the dream still with me i could still hear the pounding in my ears i shook my head trying to chase the dream away it was morning i could tell from the blue of the sky outside the window oh no the curtains they were billowing again flapping noisily as they blew into the room i sat up and stared the window was still closed ill take a look at the window there must be a draft or a leak or something dad said at breakfast he shoveled in another mouthful of scrambled eggs and ham but dad its so weird i insisted still feeling scared the curtains were blowing like crazy and the window was dosed there might be a pane missing dad suggested amanda is a pain josh cracked his idea of a really witty joke dont start with your sister mom said putting her plate down on the table and dropping into her chair she looked tired her black hair usually carefully pulled back was disheveled she tugged at the belt on her bathrobe whew i dont think i slept two hours last night neither did i i said sighing i kept thinking that boy would show up in my room again amanda youve really got to stop this mom said sharply boys in your room curtains blowing you have to realize that youre nervous and your imagination is working overtime but mom i started maybe a ghost was behind the curtains josh said teasing he raised up his hands and made a ghostly oooooooh wail whoa mom put a hand on joshs shoulder remember what you promised about scaring each other its going to be hard for all of us to adjust to this place dad said you may have dreamed about the curtains blowing amanda you said you had bad dreams right the terrifying nightmare flashed back into my mind once again i saw the big platter of bones on the table i shivered its so damp in here mom said a little sunshine will help dry the place out dad said i peered out the window the sky had turned solid gray trees seemed to spread darkness over our backyard wheres petey i asked out back mom replied swallowing a mouthful of eggs he got up early too couldnt sleep i guess so i let him out what are we doing today josh asked he always needed to know the plan for the day every detail mainly so he could argue about it your father and i still have a lot of unpacking to do mom said glancing to the back hallway which was cluttered with unopened cartons you two can explore the neighborhood see what you can find out see if there are any other kids your age around in other words you want us to get lost i said mom and dad both laughed youre very smart amanda but i want to help unpack my stuff josh whined i knew hed argue with the plan just like always go get dressed and take a long walk dad said take petey with you okay and take a leash for him i left one by the front stairs what about our bikes why cant we ride our bikes josh asked theyre buried in the back of the garage dad told him youll never be able to get to them besides you have a flat tire if i cant ride my bike im not going out josh insisted crossing his arms in front of his chest mom and dad had to argue with him then threaten him finally he agreed to go for a short walk i finished my breakfast thinking about kathy and my other friends back home i wondered what the kids were like in dark falls i wondered if id be able to find new friends real friends i volunteered to do the breakfast dishes since mom and dad had so much work to do the warm water felt soothing on my hands as i sponged the dishes clean i guess maybe im weird i like washing dishes behind me from somewhere in the front of the house i could hear josh arguing with dad i could just barely make out the words over the trickle of the tap water your basketball is packed in one of these cartons dad was saying then josh said something then dad said how should know which one then josh said something then dad said no i dont have time to look now believe it or not your basketball isnt at the top of my list i stacked the last dish onto the counter to drain and looked for a dish towel to dry my hands there was none in sight i guess they hadnt been unpacked yet wiping off my hands on the front of my robe i headed for the stairs ill be dressed in five minutes i called to josh who was still arguing with dad in the living room then we can go out i started up the front stairs and then stopped above me on the landing stood a strange girl about my age with short black hair she was smiling down at me not a warm smile not a friendly smile but the coldest most frightening smile i had ever seen a hand touched my shoulder i spun around it was josh im not going for a walk unless i can take my basketball he said josh please i looked back up to the landing and the girl was gone i felt cold all over my legs were all trembly i grabbed the banister dad come here please i called joshs face filled with alarm hey i didnt do anything he shouted no its its not you i said and called dad again amanda im kind of busy dad said appearing below at the foot of the stairs already perspiring from uncrating living room stuff dad i saw somebody i told him up there a girl i pointed amanda please he replied making a face stop seeing things okay theres no one in this house except the four of us and maybe a few mice mice josh asked with sudden interest really where dad i didnt imagine it i said my voice cracking i was really hurt that he didnt believe me amanda look up there dad said gazing up to the landing what do you see i followed his gaze there was a pile of my clothes on the landing mom must have just unpacked them its just clothes dad said impatiently its not a girl its clothes he rolled his eyes sorry i said quietly i repeated it as i started up the stairs sorry but i didnt really feel sorry i felt confused and still scared was it possible that i thought a pile of clothes was a smiling girl no i didnt think so im not crazy and i have really good eyesight so then what was going on i opened the door to my room turned on the ceiling light and saw the curtains billowing in front of the bay window oh no not again i thought i hurried over to them this time the window was open who opened it mom i guessed warm wet air blew into the room the sky was heavy and gray it smelled like rain turning to my bed i had another shock someone had laid out an outfit for me a pair of faded jeans and a pale blue sleeveless tshirt they were spread out side by side at the foot of the bed who had put them there mom i stood at the doorway and called to her mom mom did you pick out clothes for me i could hear her shout something from downstairs but i couldnt make out the words calm down amanda i told myself calm down of course mom pulled the clothes out of course mom put them there from the doorway i heard whispering in my closet whispering and hushed giggling behind the closet door this was the last straw whats going on here i yelled at the top of my lungs i stormed over to the closet and pulled open the door frantically i pushed clothes out of the way no one in there mice i thought had i heard the mice that dad was talking about ive got to get out of here i said aloud the room i realized was driving me crazy no i was driving myself crazy imagining all of these weird things there was a logical explanation for everything everything as i pulled up my jeans and fastened them i said the word logical over and over in my mind i said it so many times that it didnt sound like a real word anymore calm down amanda calm down i took a deep breath and held it to ten boo josh cut it out you didnt scare me i told him sounding more cross than i had meant to lets get out of here he said staring at me from the doorway this place gives me the creeps huh you too i exclaimed whats your problem he started to say something then stopped he suddenly looked embarrassed forget it he muttered no tell me i insisted what were you going to say he kicked at the floor molding i had a really creepy dream last night he finally admitted looking past me to the fluttering curtains at the window a dream i remembered my horrible dream yeah there were these two boys in my room and they were mean what did they do i asked i dont remember josh said avoiding my eyes i just remember they were scary and what happened i asked turning to the mirror to brush my hair i woke up he said and then added impatiently come on lets go did the boys say anything to you i asked no i dont think so he answered thoughtfully they just laughed laughed well giggled sort of josh said i dont want to talk about it anymore he snapped are we going for this dumb walk or not okay im ready i said putting down my brush taking one last look in the mirror lets go on this dumb walk i followed him down the hall as we passed the stack of clothes on the landing i thought about the girl i had seen standing there and i thought about the boy in the window when we first arrived and the two boys josh had seen in his dream i decided it proved that josh and i were both really nervous about moving to this new place maybe mom and dad were right we were letting our imaginations run away with us it had to be our imaginations i mean what else could it be a few seconds later we stepped into the backyard to get petey he was as glad to see us as ever leaping on us with his muddy paws yapping excitedly running in frantic circles through the leaves it cheered me up just to see him it was hot and muggy even though the sky was gray there was no wind at all the heavy old trees stood as still as statues we headed down the gravel driveway toward the street our sneakers kicking at the dead brown leaves petey running in zigzags at our sides first in front of us then behind at least dad hasnt asked us to rake all these old leaves josh said he will i warned i dont think hes unpacked the rake yet josh made a face we stood at the curb looking up at our house the two secondfloor bay windows staring back at us like eyes the house next door i noticed for the first time was about the same size as ours except it was shingle instead of brick the curtains in the living room were drawn shut some of the upstairs windows were shuttered tall trees cast the neighbors house in darkness too which way josh asked tossing a stick for petey to chase i pointed up the street the school is up that way i said lets check it out the road sloped uphill josh picked up a small tree branch from the side of the road and used it as a walking stick petey kept trying to chew on it while josh walked we didnt see anyone on the street or in any of the front yards we passed no cars went by i was beginning to think the whole town was deserted until the boy stepped out from behind the low ledge he popped out so suddenly both josh and i stopped in our tracks hi he said shyly giving us a little wave hi josh and i answered at the same time then before we could pull him back petey ran up to the boy sniffed his sneakers and began snarling and barking the boy stepped back and raised his hands as if he were protecting himself he looked really frightened petey stop i cried josh grabbed the dog and picked him up but he kept growling he doesnt bite i told the boy he usually doesnt bark either im sorry thats okay the boy said staring at petey who was squirming to get out of joshs arms he probably smells something on me petey stop i shouted the dog wouldnt stop squirming you dont want the leash do you the boy had short wavy blond hair and very pale blue eyes he had a funny turnedup nose that seemed out of place on his seriouslooking face he was wearing a maroon longsleeved sweatshirt despite the mugginess of the day and black straightlegged jeans he had a blue baseball cap stuffed into the back pocket of his jeans im amanda benson i said and this is my brother josh josh hesitantly put petey back on the ground the dog yipped once stared up at the boy whimpered softly then sat down on the street and began to scratch himself im ray thurston the boy said stuffing his hands into his jeans pockets still staring warily at petey he seemed to relax a little though seeing that the dog had lost interest in barking and growling at him i suddenly realized that ray looked familiar where had i seen him before where i stared hard at him until i remembered and then i gasped in sudden fright ray was the boy the boy in my room the boy in the window you i stammered accusingly you were in our house he looked confused huh you were in my room right i insisted he laughed i dont get it he said in your room petey raised his head and gave a low growl in rays direction then he went back to his serious scratching i thought i saw you i said beginning to feel a little doubtful maybe it wasnt him maybe i havent been in your house in a long time ray said looking down warily at petey a long time yeah i used to live in your house he replied huh josh and i stared at him in surprise our house ray nodded when we first moved here he said he picked up a flat pebble and heaved it down the street petey growled started to chase it changed his mind and plopped back down on the street his stub of a tail wagging excitedly heavy clouds lowered across the sky it seemed to grow darker where do you live now i asked ray tossed another stone then pointed up the road did you like our house josh asked ray yeah it was okay ray told him nice and shady you liked it josh cried i think its gross its so dark and petey interrupted he decided to start barking at ray again running up till he was a few inches in front of ray then backing away ray took a few cautious steps back to the edge of the curb josh pulled the leash from the pocket of his shorts sorry petey he said i held the growling dog while josh attached the leash to his collar hes never done this before really i said apologizing to ray the leash seemed to confuse petey he tugged against it pulling josh across the street but at least he stopped barking lets do something josh said impatiently like what ray asked relaxing again now that petey was on the leash we all thought for a while maybe we could go to your house josh suggested to ray ray shook his head no i dont think so he said not now anyway where is everyone i asked looking up and down the empty street its really dead around here huh he chuckled yeah i guess you could say that he said want to go to the playground behind the school yeah okay i agreed the three of us headed up the street ray leading the way me walking a few feet behind him josh holding his tree branch in one hand the leash in the other petey running this way then that giving josh a really hard time we didnt see the gang of kids till we turned the corner there were ten or twelve of them mostly boys but a few girls too they were laughing and shouting shoving each other playfully as they came toward us down the center of the street some of them i saw were about my age the rest were teenagers they were wearing jeans and dark tshirts one of the girls stood out because she had long straight blonde hair and was wearing green spandex tights hey look a tall boy with slickedback black hair cried pointing at us seeing ray josh and me they grew quiet but didnt stop moving toward us a few of them giggled as if they were enjoying some kind of private joke the three of us stopped and watched them approach i smiled and waited to say hi petey was pulling at his leash and barking his head off hi guys the tall boy with the black hair said grinning the others thought this was very funny for some reason they laughed the girl in the green tights gave a short redhaired boy a shove that almost sent him sprawling into me hows it going ray a girl with short black hair asked smiling at ray not bad hi guys ray answered he turned to josh and me these are some of my friends theyre all from the neighborhood hi i said feeling awkward i wished petey would stop barking and pulling at his leash like that poor josh was having a terrible time holding onto him this is george carpenter ray said pointing to the short redhaired boy who nodded and jerry franklin karen somerset bill gregory he went around the circle naming each kid i tried to remember all the names but of course it was impossible how do you like dark falls one of the girls asked me i dont really know i told her its my first day here really it seems nice some of the kids laughed at my answer for some reason what kind of dog is that george carpenter asked josh josh holding tight to the leash handle told him george stared hard at petey studying him as if he had never seen a dog like petey before karen somerset a tall pretty girl with short blonde hair came up to me while some of the other kids were admiring petey you know i used to live in your house she said softly what i wasnt sure id heard her correctly lets go to the playground ray said interrupting no one responded to rays suggestion they grew quiet even petey stopped barking had karen really said that she used to live in our house i wanted to ask her but she had stepped back into the circle of kids the circle my mouth dropped open as i realized they had formed a circle around josh and me i felt a stab of fear was i imagining it was something going on they all suddenly looked different to me they were smiling but their faces were tense watchful as if they expected trouble two of them i noticed were carrying baseball bats the girl with the green tights stared at me looking me up and down checking me out no one said a word the street was silent except for petey who was now whimpering softly i suddenly felt very afraid why were they staring at us like that or was my imagination running away with me again i turned to ray who was still beside me he didnt seem at all troubled but he didnt return my gaze hey guys i said whats going on i tried to keep it light but my voice was a little shaky i looked over at josh he was busy soothing petey and hadnt noticed that things had changed the two boys with baseball bats held them up waist high and moved forward i glanced around the circle feeling the fear tighten my chest the circle tightened the kids were closing in on us the black clouds overhead seemed to lower the air felt heavy and damp josh was fussing with peteys collar and still didnt see what was happening i wondered if ray was going to say anything if he was going to do anything to stop them but he stayed frozen and expressionless beside me the circle grew smaller as the kids closed in i realized id been holding my breath i took a deep breath and opened my mouth to cry out hey kids whats going on it was a mans voice calling from outside the circle everyone turned to see mr dawes coming quickly toward us taking long strides as he crossed the street his open blazer flapping behind him he had a friendly smile on his face whats going on he asked again he didnt seem to realize that the gang of kids had been closing in on josh and me were heading to the playground george carpenter told him twirling the bat in his hand you know to play softball good deal mr dawes said pulling down his striped tie which had blown over his shoulder he looked up at the darkening sky hope you dont get rained out several of the kids had backed up they were standing in small groups of two and three now the circle had completely broken up is that bat for softball or hardball mr dawes asked george george doesnt know another kid replied quickly hes never hit anything with it the kids all laughed george playfully menaced the kid pretending to come at him with the bat mr dawes gave a little wave and started to leave but then he stopped and his eyes opened wide with surprise hey he said flashing me a friendly smile josh amanda i didnt see you there good morning i muttered i was feeling very confused a moment ago id felt terribly scared now everyone was laughing and kidding around had i imagined that the kids were moving in on us ray and josh hadnt seemed to notice anything peculiar was it just me and my overactive imagination what would have happened if mr dawes hadnt come along how are you two getting along in the new house mr dawes asked smoothing back his wavy blond hair okay josh and i answered together looking up at mr dawes petey began to bark and pull at the leash mr dawes put an exaggerated hurt expression on his face im crushed he said your dog still doesnt like me he bent over petey hey dog lighten up petey barked back angrily he doesnt seem to like anybody today i told mr dawes apologetically mr dawes stood back up and shrugged cant win em all he started back to his car parked a few yards down the street im heading over to your house he told josh and me just want to see if theres anything i can do to help your parents have fun kids i watched him climb into his car and drive away hes a nice guy ray said yeah i agreed i was still feeling uncomfortable wondering what the kids would do now that mr dawes was gone would they form that frightening circle again no everyone started walking heading down the block to the playground behind the school they were kidding each other and talking normally and pretty much ignored josh and me i was starting to feel a little silly it was obvious that they hadnt been trying to scare josh and me i must have made the whole thing up in my mind i must have at least i told myself i hadnt screamed or made a scene at least i hadnt made a total fool of myself the playground was completely empty i guessed that most kids had stayed inside because of the threatening sky the playground was a large flat grassy field surrounded on all four sides by a tall metal fence there were swings and slides at the end nearest the school building there were two baseball diamonds on the other end beyond the fence i could see a row of tennis courts also deserted josh tied petey to the fence then came running over to join the rest of us the boy named jerry franklin made up the teams ray and i were on the same team josh was on the other as our team took the field i felt excited and a little nervous im not the best softball player in the world i can hit the ball pretty well but in the field im a complete klutz luckily jerry sent me out to right field where not many balls are hit the clouds began to part a little and the sky got lighter we played two full innings the other team was winning eight to two i was having fun i had only messed up on one play and i hit a double my first time at bat it was fun being with a whole new group of kids they seemed really nice especially the girl named karen somerset who talked with me while we waited for our turn at bat karen had a great smile even though she wore braces on all her teeth up and down she seemed very eager to be friends the sun was coming out as my team started to take the field for the beginning of the third inning suddenly i heard a loud shrill whistle i looked around until i saw that it was jerry franklin blowing a silver whistle everyone came running up to him wed better quit he said looking up at the brightening sky we promised our folks remember that wed be home for lunch i glanced at my watch it was only eleventhirty still early but to my surprise no one protested they all waved to each other and called out farewells and then began to run i couldnt believe how fast everyone left it was as if they were racing or something karen ran past me like the others her head down a serious expression on her pretty face then she stopped suddenly and turned around nice meeting you amanda she called back we should get together sometime great i called to her do you know where i live i couldnt hear her answer very well she nodded and i thought she said yes i know it i used to live in your house but that couldnt have been what she said several days went by josh and i were getting used to our new house and our new friends the kids we met every day at the playground werent exactly friends yet they talked with josh and me and let us on their teams but it was really hard to get to know them in my room i kept hearing whispers late at night and soft giggling but i forced myself to ignore it one night i thought i saw a girl dressed all in white at the end of the upstairs hall but when i walked over to investigate there was just a pile of dirty sheets and other bedclothes against the wall josh and i were adjusting but petey was still acting really strange we took him with us to the playground every day but we had to leash him to the fence otherwise hed bark and snap at all the kids hes still nervous being in a new place i told josh hell calm down but petey didnt calm down and about two weeks later we were finishing up a softball game with ray and karen somerset and jerry franklin and george carpenter and a bunch of other kids when i looked over to the fence and saw that petey was gone somehow he had broken out of his leash and run away we looked for hours calling petey wandering from block to block searching front yards and backyards empty lots and woods then after circling the neighborhood twice josh and i suddenly realized we had no idea where we were the streets of dark falls looked the same they were all lined with sprawling old brick or shingle houses all filled with shady old trees i dont believe it were lost josh said leaning against a tree trunk trying to catch his breath that stupid dog i muttered my eyes searching up the street why did he do this hes never run away before i dont know how he got loose josh said shaking his head then wiping his sweaty forehead with the sleeve of his tshirt i tied him up really well hey maybe he ran home i said the idea immediately cheered me up yeah josh stepped away from the tree and headed back over to me ill bet youre right amanda hes probably been home for hours wow weve been stupid we shouldve checked home first lets go well i said looking around at the empty yards we just have to figure out which way is home i looked up and down the street trying to figure out which way wed turned when we left the school playground i couldnt remember so we just started walking luckily as we reached the next corner the school came into sight we had made a full circle it was easy to find our way from there passing the playground i stared at the spot on the fence where petey had been tied that troublemaking dog hed been acting so badly ever since we came to dark falls would he be home when we got there i hoped so a few minutes later josh and i were running up the gravel driveway calling the dogs name at the top of our lungs the front door burst open and mom her hair tied in a red bandanna the knees of her jeans covered with dust leaned out she and dad had been painting the back porch where have you two been lunchtime was two hours ago josh and i both answered at the same time is petey here weve been looking for petey is he here moms face filled with confusion petey i thought he was with you my heart sank josh slumped to the driveway with a loud sigh sprawling flat on his back in the gravel and leaves you havent seen him i asked my trembling voice showing my disappointment he was with us but he ran away oh im sorry mom said motioning for josh to get up from the driveway he ran away i thought youve been keeping him on a leash youve got to help us find him josh pleaded not budging from the ground get the car weve got to find him right now im sure he hasnt gotten far mom said you must be starving come in and have some lunch and then well no right now josh screamed whats going on dad his face and hair covered with tiny flecks of white paint joined mom on the front porch josh whats all the yelling we explained to dad what had happened he said he was too busy to drive around looking for petey mom said shed do it but only after we had some lunch i pulled josh up by both arms and dragged him into the house we washed up and gulped down some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches then mom took the car out of the garage and we drove around and around the neighborhood searching for our lost pet with no luck no sign of him josh and i were miserable heartbroken mom and dad called the local police dad kept saying that petey had a good sense of direction that hed show up any minute but we didnt really believe it where was he the four of us ate dinner in silence it was the longest most horrible evening of my life i tied him up really good josh repeated close to tears his dinner plate still full dogs are great escape artists dad said dont worry hell show up some night for a party mom said glumly id completely forgotten that they were going out some neighbors on the next block had invited them to a big potluck dinner party i sure dont feel like partying either dad said with a sigh im beat from painting all day but i guess we have to be neighborly sure you kids will be okay here yeah i guess i said thinking about petey i kept listening for his bark listening for scratching at the door but no the hours dragged by petey still hadnt shown up by bedtime josh and i both slinked upstairs i felt really tired weary from all the worrying and the running around and searching for petey i guess but i knew id never be able to get to sleep in the hall outside my bedroom door i heard whispering from inside my room and quiet footsteps the usual sounds my room made i wasnt at all scared of them or surprised by them anymore without hesitating i stepped into my room and clicked on the light the room was empty as i knew it would be the mysterious sounds disappeared i glanced at the curtains which lay straight and still then i saw the clothes strewn all over my bed several pairs of jeans several tshirts a couple of sweatshirts my only dressup skirt thats strange i thought mom was such a neat freak if she had washed these things she surely would have hung them up or put them into dresser drawers sighing wearily i started to gather up the clothes and put them away i figured that mom simply had too much to do to be bothered she had probably washed the stuff and then left it here for me to put away or she had put it all down planning to come back later and put it away and then got busy with other chores half an hour later i was tucked into my bed wide awake staring at the shadows on the ceiling some time after that i lost track of the time i was still wide awake still thinking about petey thinking about the new kids id met thinking about the new neighborhood when i heard my bedroom door creak and swing open footsteps on the creaking floorboards i sat up in the darkness as someone crept into my room amanda ssshh its me alarmed it took me a few seconds to recognize the hushed whisper josh what do you want what are you doing in here i gasped as a blinding light forced me to cover my eyes oops sorry josh said my flashlight i didnt mean to ow thats bright i said blinking he aimed the powerful beam of white light up at the ceiling yeah its a halogen flashlight he said well what do you want i asked irritably i still couldnt see well i rubbed my eyes but it didnt help i know where petey is josh whispered and im going to go get him come with me huh i looked at the little clock on my bed table its after midnight josh so it wont take long really my eyes were nearly normal by now staring at josh in the light from the halogen flashlight i noticed for the first time that he was fully dressed in jeans and a longsleeved tshirt i dont get it josh i said swinging around and putting my feet on the floor we looked everywhere where do you think petey is in the cemetery josh answered his eyes looked big and dark and serious in the white light huh thats where he ran the first time remember when we first came to dark falls he ran to that cemetery just past the school now wait a minute i started we drove past it this afternoon but we didnt look inside hes there amanda i know he is and im going to go get him whether you come or not josh calm down i said putting my hands on his narrow shoulders i was surprised to discover that he was trembling theres no reason for petey to be in that cemetery thats where he went the first time josh insisted he was looking for something there that day i could tell i know hes there again amanda he pulled away from me are you coming or not my brother has to be the stubbornest most headstrong person in the world josh youre really going to walk into a strange cemetery so late at night i asked im not afraid he said shining the bright light around my room for a brief second i thought the light caught someone lurking behind the curtains i opened my mouth to cry out but there was no one there you coming or not he repeated impatiently i was going to say no but then glancing at the curtains i thought its probably no more spooky out there in that cemetery than it is here in my own bedroom yeah okay i said grudgingly get out of here and let me get dressed okay he whispered turning off the flashlight plunging us into blackness meet me down at the end of the driveway josh one quick look at the cemetery then we hurry home got it i told him yeah right well be home before mom and dad get back from that party he crept out i could hear him making his way quickly down the stairs this is the craziest idea ever i told myself as i searched in the darkness for some clothes to pull on and it was also kind of exciting josh was wrong no doubt about it petey wouldnt be hanging around in that cemetery now why on earth should he but at least it wasnt a long walk and it was an adventure something to write about to kathy back home and if josh happened to be right and we did manage to find poor lost petey well that would be great too a few minutes later dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt i crept out of the house and joined josh at the bottom of the driveway the night was still warm a heavy blanket of clouds covered the moon i realized for the first time that there were no streetlights on our block josh had the halogen flashlight on aimed down at our feet you ready he asked dumb question would i be standing there if i werent ready we crunched over dead leaves as we headed up the block toward the school from there it was just two blocks to the cemetery its so dark i whispered the houses were black and silent there was no breeze at all it was as if we were all alone in the world its too quiet i said hurrying to keep up with josh no crickets or anything are you sure you really want to go to the cemetery im sure he said his eyes following the circle of light from the flashlight as it bumped over the ground i really think petey is there we walked in the street keeping close to the curb we had gone nearly two blocks the school was just coming into sight on the next block when we heard the scraping steps behind us on the pavement josh and i both stopped he lowered the light we both heard the sounds i wasnt imagining them someone was following us josh was so startled the flashlight tumbled from his hand and clattered onto the street the light flickered but didnt go out by the time josh had managed to pick it up our pursuer had caught up to us i spun around to face him my heart pounding in my chest ray what are you doing here josh aimed the light at rays face but ray shot his arms up to shield his face and ducked back into the darkness what are you two doing here he cried sounding almost as startled as i did you you scared us josh said angrily aiming the flashlight back down at our feet sorry ray said i wouldve called out but i wasnt sure it was you josh has this crazy idea about where petey might be i told him still struggling to catch my breath thats why were out here what about you josh asked ray well sometimes i have trouble sleeping ray said softly dont your parents mind you being out so late i asked in the glow from the flashlight i could see a wicked smile cross his face they dont know are we going to the cemetery or not josh asked impatiently without waiting for an answer he started jogging up the road the light bobbing on the pavement in front of him i turned and followed wanting to stay close to the light where are you going ray called hurrying to catch up the cemetery i called back no ray said youre not his voice was so low so threatening that i stopped what youre not going there ray repeated i couldnt see his face it was hidden in darkness but his words sounded menacing hurry josh called back to us he hadnt slowed down he didnt seem to notice the threat in rays words stop josh ray called it sounded more like an order than a request you cant go there why not i demanded suddenly afraid was ray threatening josh and me did he know something we didnt or was i making a big deal out of nothing once again i stared into the darkness trying to see his face youd be nuts to go there at night he declared i began to think i had misjudged him he was afraid to go there thats why he was trying to stop us are you coming or not josh demanded getting farther and farther ahead of us i dont think we should ray warned yes hes afraid i decided i only imagined that he was threatening us you dont have to but we do josh insisted picking up his speed no really ray said this is a bad idea but now he and i were running side by side to catch up with josh peteys there josh said i know he is we passed the dark silent school it seemed much bigger at night joshs light flashed through the low tree branches as we turned the corner onto cemetery drive wait please ray pleaded but josh didnt slow down neither did i i was eager to get there and get it over with i wiped my forehead with my sleeve the air was hot and still i wished i hadnt worn long sleeves i felt my hair it was dripping wet the clouds still covered the moon as we reached the cemetery we stepped through a gate in the low wall in the darkness i could see the crooked rows of gravestones joshs light traveled from stone to stone jumping up and down as he walked petey he called suddenly interrupting the silence hes disturbing the sleep of the dead i thought feeling a sudden chill of fear dont be silly amanda petey i called too forcing away my morbid thoughts this is a very bad idea ray said standing very close to me petey petey josh called i know its a bad idea i admitted to ray but i didnt want josh to come here by himself but we shouldnt be here ray insisted i was beginning to wish hed go away no one had forced him to come why was he giving us such a hard time hey look at this josh called from several yards up ahead my sneakers crunching over the soft ground i hurried between the rows of graves i hadnt realized that we had already walked the entire length of the graveyard look josh said again his flashlight playing over a strange structure built at the edge of the cemetery it took me a little while to figure out what it was in the small circle of light it was so unexpected it was some kind of theater an amphitheater i guess youd call it circular rows of bench seats dug into the ground descending like stairs to a low stagelike platform at the bottom what on earth i exclaimed i started forward to get a closer look amanda wait lets go home ray called he grabbed at my arm but i hurried away and he grabbed only air weird who would build an outdoor theater at the edge of a cemetery i asked i looked back to see if josh and ray were following me and my sneaker caught against something i stumbled to the ground hitting my knee hard ow what was that josh shone the light on it as i climbed slowly painfully to my feet i had tripped over an enormous upraised tree root in the flickering light i followed the gnarled root over to a wide old tree several yards away the huge tree was bent over the strange belowground theater leaning at such a low angle that it looked likely to topple over at any second big clumps of roots were raised up from the ground overhead the trees branches heavy with leaves seemed to lean to the ground timberrr josh yelled how weird i exclaimed hey ray what is this place its a meeting place ray said quietly standing close beside me staring straight ahead at the leaning tree they use it sort of like a town hall they have town meetings here in the cemetery i cried finding it hard to believe lets go ray urged looking very nervous all three of us heard the footsteps they were behind us somewhere in the rows of graves we turned around joshs light swept over the ground petey there he was standing between the nearest row of low stone grave markers i turned happily to josh i dont believe it i cried you were right petey petey josh and i both started running toward our dog but petey arched back on his hind legs as if he were getting ready to run away he stared at us his eyes red as jewels in the light of the flashlight petey we found you i cried the dog lowered his head and started to trot away petey hey come back dont you recognize us with a burst of speed josh caught up with him and grabbed him up off the ground hey petey whats the matter fella as i hurried over josh dropped petey back to the ground and stepped back ooh he stinks what i cried petey he stinks he smells like a dead rat josh held his nose petey started to walk slowly away josh he isnt glad to see us i wailed he doesnt even seem to recognize us look at him it was true petey walked to the next row of gravestones then turned and glared at us i suddenly felt sick what had happened to petey why was he acting so differently why wasnt he glad to see us i dont get it josh said still making a face from the odor the dog gave off usually if we leave the room for thirty seconds he goes nuts when we come back wed better go ray called he was still at the edge of the cemetery near the leaning tree petey whats wrong with you i called to the dog he didnt respond dont you remember your name petey petey yuck what a stink josh exclaimed weve got to get him home and give him a bath i said my voice was shaking i felt really sad and frightened maybe this isnt petey josh said thoughtfully the dogs eyes again glared red in the beam of light its him all right i said quietly look hes dragging the leash go get him josh and lets go home yow get him josh cried he smells too bad just grab his leash you dont have to pick him up i said no you josh was being stubborn again i could see that i had no choice okay i said ill get him but ill need the light i grabbed the flashlight from joshs hand and started to run toward petey sit petey sit i ordered it was the only command petey ever obeyed but he didnt obey it this time instead he turned and trotted away holding his head down low petey stop petey come on i yelled exasperated dont make me chase you dont let him get away josh yelled running up behind me i moved the flashlight from side to side along the ground where is he petey petey josh called sounding shrill and desperate i couldnt see him oh no dont tell me weve lost him again i said we both started to call him whats wrong with that mutt i cried i moved the beam of light down one long row of gravestones then moving quickly down the next no sign of him we both kept calling his name and then the circle of light came to rest on the front of a granite tombstone reading the name on the stone i stopped short and gasped josh look i grabbed joshs sleeve i held on tight huh whats wrong his face filled with confusion look the name on the gravestone it was karen somerset josh read the name he stared at me still confused thats my new friend karen the one i talk to on the playground every day i said huh it must be her grandmother or something josh said and then added impatiently come on look for petey no look at the dates i said to him we both read the dates under karen somersets name it cant be her mother or grandmother i said keeping the beam of light on the stone despite my trembling hand this girl died when she was twelve my age and karen is twelve too she told me amanda josh scowled and looked away but i took a few steps and beamed the light onto the next gravestone there was a name on it id never heard before i moved on to the next stone another name id never heard amanda come on josh whined the next gravestone had the name george carpenter on it josh look its george from the playground i called amanda we have to get petey he insisted but i couldnt pull myself away from the gravestones i went from one to the next moving the flashlight over the engraved letters to my growing horror i found jerry franklin and then bill gregory all the kids we had played softball with they all had gravestones here my heart thudding i moved down the crooked row my sneakers sinking into the soft grass i felt numb numb with fear i struggled to hold the light steady as i beamed it onto the last stone in the row ray thurston huh i could hear josh calling me but i couldnt make out what he was saying the rest of the world seemed to fall away i read the deeply etched inscription again ray thurston i stood there staring at the letters and numbers i stared at them till they didnt make sense anymore until they were just a gray blur suddenly i realized that ray had crept up beside the gravestone and was staring at me ray i managed to say moving the light over the name on the stone ray this one is you his eyes flared glowing like dying embers yes its me he said softly moving toward me im so sorry amanda i took a step back my sneakers sinking into the soft ground the air was heavy and still no one made a sound nothing moved dead im surrounded by death i thought then frozen to the spot unable to breathe the darkness swirling around me the gravestones spinning in their own black shadows i thought what is he going to do to me ray i managed to call out my voice sounded faint and far away ray are you really dead im sorry you werent supposed to find out yet he said his voice floating low and heavy on the stifling night air but how i mean i dont understand i looked past him to the darting white light of the flashlight josh was several rows away almost to the street still searching for petey petey i whispered dread choking my throat my stomach tightening in horror dogs always know ray said in a low flat tone dogs always recognize the living dead thats why they have to go first they always know you mean peteys dead i choked out the words ray nodded they kill the dogs first no i screamed and took another step back nearly losing my balance as i bumped into a low marble gravestone i jumped away from it you werent supposed to see this ray said his narrow face expressionless except for his dark eyes which revealed real sadness you werent supposed to know not for another few weeks anyway im the watcher i was supposed to watch to make sure you didnt see until it was time he took a step toward me his eyes lighting up red burning into mine were you watching me from the window i cried was that you in my room again he nodded yes i used to live in your house he said taking another step closer forcing me back against the cold marble stone im the watcher i forced myself to look away to stop staring into his glowing eyes i wanted to scream to josh to run and get help but he was too far away and i was frozen there frozen with fear we need fresh blood ray said what i cried what are you saying the town it cant survive without fresh blood none of us can youll understand soon amanda youll understand why we had to invite you to the house to the dead house in the darting zigzagging beam of light i could see josh moving closer heading our way run josh i thought run away fast get someone get anyone i could think the words why couldnt i scream them rays eyes glowed brighter he was standing right in front of me now his features set hard and cold ray even through my jeans the marble gravestone felt cold against the back of my legs i messed up he whispered i was the watcher but i messed up ray what are you going to do his red eyes flickered im really sorry he started to raise himself off the ground to float over me i could feel myself start to choke i couldnt breathe i couldnt move i opened my mouth to call out to josh but no sound came out josh where was he i looked down the rows of gravestones but couldnt see his light ray floated up a little higher he hovered over me choking me somehow blinding me suffocating me im dead i thought dead now im dead too and then suddenly light broke through the darkness the light shone in rays face the bright white halogen light whats going on josh asked in a highpitched nervous voice amanda whats happening ray cried out and dropped back to the ground turn that off turn it off he screeched his voice a shrill whisper like wind through a broken windowpane but josh held the bright beam of light on ray whats going on what are you doing i could breathe again as i stared into the light i struggled to stop my heart from pounding so hard ray moved his arms to shield himself from the light but i could see what was happening to him the light had already done its damage rays skin seemed to be melting his whole face sagged then fell dropping off his skull i stared into the circle of white light unable to look away as rays skin folded and drooped and melted away as the bone underneath was revealed his eyeballs rolled out of their sockets and fell silently to the ground josh frozen in horror somehow held the bright light steady and we both stared at the grinning skull its dark craters staring back at us oh i shrieked as ray took a step toward me but then i realized that ray wasnt walking he was falling i jumped aside as he crumpled to the ground and gasped as his skull hit the top of the marble gravestone and cracked open with a sickening splat come on josh shouted amanda come on he grabbed my hand and tried to pull me away but i couldnt stop staring down at ray now a pile of bones inside a puddle of crumpled clothes amanda come on then before i even realized it i was running running beside josh as fast as i could down the long row of graves toward the street the light flashed against the blur of gravestones as we ran slipping on the soft dewcovered grass gasping in the still hot air weve got to tell mom and dad got to get away from here i cried they they wont believe it josh said as we reached the street we kept running our sneakers thudding hard against the pavement im not sure i believe it myself theyve not to believe us i told him if they dont well drag them out of that house the white beam of light pointed the way as we ran through the dark silent streets there were no streetlights no lights on in the windows of the houses we passed no car headlights such a dark world we had entered and now it was time to get out we ran the rest of the way home i kept looking back to see if we were being followed but i didnt see anyone the neighborhood was still and empty i had a sharp pain in my side as we reached home but i forced myself to keep running up the gravel driveway with its thick blanket of dead leaves and onto the front porch i pushed open the door and both josh and i started to scream mom dad where are you silence we ran into the living room the lights were all off mom dad are you here please be here i thought my heart racing the pain in my side still sharp please be here we searched the house they werent home the potluck party josh suddenly remembered can they still be at that party we were standing in the living room both of us breathing hard the pain in my side had let up just a bit i had turned on all the lights but the room still felt gloomy and menacing i glanced at the clock on the mantel nearly two in the morning they should be home by now i said my voice shaky and weak where did they go did they leave a number josh was already on his way to the kitchen i followed him turning on lights as we went we went right to the memo pad on the counter where mom and dad always leave us notes nothing the pad was blank weve got to find them josh cried he sounded very frightened his wide eyes reflected his fear we have to get away from here what if something has happened to them thats what i started to say but i caught myself just in time i didnt want to scare josh any more than he was already besides hed probably thought of that too should we call the police he asked as we walked back to the living room and peered out the front window into the darkness i dont know i said pressing my hot forehead against the cool glass i just dont know what to do i want them to be home i want them here so we can all leave whats your hurry a girls voice said from behind me josh and i both cried out and spun around karen somerset was standing in the center of the room her arms crossed over her chest but youre dead i blurted out she smiled a sad smile a bitter smile and then two more kids stepped in from the hallway one of them clicked off the lights too bright in here he said they moved next to karen and another kid jerry franklin another dead kid appeared by the fireplace and i saw the girl with short black hair the one i had seen on the stairs move beside me by the curtains they were all smiling their eyes glowing dully in the dim light all moving in on josh and me what do you want i screamed in a voice i didnt even recognize what are you going to do we used to live in your house karen said softly huh i cried we used to live in your house george said and now guess what jerry added now were dead in your house the others started to laugh crackling dry laughs as they all closed in on josh and me theyre going to kill us josh cried i watched them move forward in silence josh and i had backed up to the window i looked around the dark room for an escape route but there was nowhere to run karen you seemed so nice i said the words just tumbled out i hadnt thought before i said them her eyes glowed a little brighter i was nice she said in a glum monotone until i moved here we were all nice george carpenter said in the same low monotone but now were dead let us go josh cried raising his hands in front of him as if to shield himself please let us go they laughed again the dry hoarse laughter dead laughter dont be scared amanda karen said soon youll be with us thats why they invited you to this house huh i dont understand i cried my voice shaking this is the dead house this is where everyone lives when they first arrive in dark falls when theyre still alive this seemed to strike the others as funny they all snickered and laughed but our greatuncle josh started karen shook her head her eyes glowing with amusement no sorry josh no greatuncle it was just a trick to bring you here once every year someone new has to move here other years it was us we lived in this house until we died this year its your turn we need new blood jerry franklin said his eyes glowing red in the dim light once a year you see we need new blood moving forward in silence they hovered over josh and me i took a deep breath a last breath perhaps and shut my eyes and then i heard the knock on the door a loud knock repeated several times i opened my eyes the ghostly kids all vanished the air smelled sour josh and i stared at each other dazed as the loud knocking started again its mom and dad josh cried we both ran to the door josh stumbled over the coffee table in the dark so i got to the door first mom dad i cried pulling open the door where have you been i reached out my arms to hug them both and stopped with my arms in the air my mouth dropped open and i uttered a silent cry mr dawes josh exclaimed coming up beside me we thought oh mr dawes im so glad to see you i cried happily pushing open the screen door for him kids youre okay he asked eyeing us both his handsome face tight with worry oh thank god he cried i got here in time mr dawes i started feeling so relieved i had tears in my eyes i he grabbed my arm theres no time to talk he said looking behind him to the street i could see his car in the driveway the engine was running only the parking lights were on ive got to get you kids out of here while theres still time josh and i started to follow him then hesitated what if mr dawes was one of them hurry mr dawes urged holding open the screen door gazing nervously out into the darkness i think were in terrible danger but i started staring into his frightened eyes trying to decide if we could trust him i was at the party with your parents mr dawes said all of a sudden they formed a circle everyone around your parents and me they they started to close in on us just like when the kids started to close in on josh and me i thought we broke through them and ran mr dawes said glancing to the driveway behind him somehow the three of us got away hurry weve all got to get away from here now josh lets go i urged then i turned to mr dawes where are mom and dad come on ill show you theyre safe for now but i dont know for how long we followed him out of the house and down the driveway to his car the clouds had parted a sliver of moon shone low in a pale early morning sky theres something wrong with this whole town mr dawes said holding the front passenger door open for me as josh climbed into the back i slumped gratefully into the seat and he slammed the door shut i know i said as he slid behind the wheel josh and i we both weve got to get as far away as we can before they catch up with us mr dawes said backing down the drive quickly the tires sliding and squealing as he pulled onto the street yes i agreed thank goodness you came my house its filled with kids dead kids and so youve seen them mr dawes said softly his eyes wide with fear he pushed down harder on the gas pedal as i looked out into the purple darkness a low orange sun began to show over the green treetops where are our parents i asked anxiously theres a kind of outdoor theater next to the cemetery mr dawes said staring straight ahead through the windshield his eyes narrow his expression tense its built right into the ground and its hidden by a big tree i left them there i told them not to move i think theyll be safe i dont think anyonell think to look there weve seen it josh said a bright light suddenly flashed on in the backseat whats that mr dawes asked looking into the rearview mirror my flashlight josh answered clicking it off i brought it just in case but the sun will be up soon i probably wont need it mr dawes hit the brake and pulled the car to the side of the road we were at the edge of the cemetery i climbed quickly out of the car eager to see my parents the sky was still dark streaked with violet now the sun was a dark orange balloon just barely poking over the trees across the street beyond the jagged rows of gravestones i could see the dark outline of the leaning tree that hid the mysterious amphitheater hurry mr dawes urged closing his car door quietly im sure your parents are desperate to see you we headed across the street halfwalking halfjogging josh swinging the flashlight in one hand suddenly at the edge of the cemetery grass josh stopped petey he cried i followed his gaze and saw our white terrier walking slowly along a slope of gravestones petey josh yelled again and began running to the dog my heart sank i hadnt had a chance to tell josh what ray had revealed to me about petey no josh i called mr dawes looked very alarmed we dont have time we have to hurry he said to me then he began shouting for josh to come back ill go get him i said and took off running as fast as i could along the rows of graves calling to my brother josh josh wait up dont dont go after him josh petey is dead josh had been gaining on the dog which was ambling along sniffing the ground not looking up not paying any attention to josh then suddenly josh tripped over a low grave marker he cried out as he fell and the flashlight flew out of his hand and clattered against a gravestone i quickly caught up with him josh are you okay he was lying on his stomach staring straight ahead josh answer me are you okay i grabbed him by the shoulders and tried to pull him up but he kept staring straight ahead his mouth open his eyes wide josh look he said finally i breathed a sigh of relief knowing that josh wasnt knocked out or something look he repeated and pointed to the gravestone he had tripped over i turned and squinted at the grave i read the inscription silently mouthing the words as i read compton dawes rip my head began to spin i felt dizzy i steadied myself holding onto josh compton dawes it wasnt his father or his grandfather he had told us he was the only compton in his family so mr dawes was dead too dead dead dead dead as everyone else he was one of them one of the dead ones josh and i stared at each other in the purple darkness surrounded surrounded by the dead now what i asked myself now what get up josh i said my voice a choked whisper weve got to get away from here but we were too late a hand grabbed me firmly by the shoulder i spun around to see mr dawes his eyes narrowing as he read the inscription on his own gravestone mr dawes you too i cried so disappointed so confused so scared me too he said almost sadly all of us his eyes burned into mine this was a normal town once and we were normal people most of us worked in the plastics factory on the outskirts of town then there was an accident something escaped from the factory a yellow gas it floated over the town so fast we didnt see it didnt realize and then it was too late and dark falls wasnt a normal town anymore we were all dead amanda dead and buried but we couldnt rest we couldnt sleep dark falls was a town of living dead what what are you going to do to us i managed to ask my knees were trembling so hard i could barely stand a dead man was squeezing my shoulder a dead man was staring hard into my eyes standing this close i could smell his sour breath i turned my head but the smell already choked my nostrils where are mom and dad josh asked climbing to his feet and standing rigidly across from us glaring accusingly at mr dawes safe and sound mr dawes said with a faint smile come with me its time for you to join them i tried to pull away from him but his hand was locked on my shoulder let go i shouted his smile grew wider amanda it doesnt hurt to die he said softly almost soothingly come with me no josh shouted and with sudden quickness he dived to the ground and picked up his flashlight yes i cried shine it on him josh the light could save us the light could defeat mr dawes as it had ray the light could destroy him quick shine it on him i pleaded josh fumbled with the flashlight then pointed it toward mr dawess startled face and clicked it on nothing no light it its broken josh said i guess when it hit the gravestone my heart pounding i looked back at mr dawes the smile on his face was a smile of victory nice try mr dawes said to josh the smile faded quickly from his face close up he didnt look so young and handsome his skin i could see was dry and peeling and hung loosely beneath his eyes lets go kids he said giving me a shove he glanced up at the brightening sky the sun was raising itself over the treetops josh hesitated i said lets go mr dawes snapped impatiently he loosened his grip on my shoulder and took a menacing step toward josh josh glanced down at the worthless flashlight then he pulled his arm back and heaved the flashlight at mr dawess head the flashlight hit its target with a sickening crack it hit mr dawes in the center of his forehead splitting a large hole in the skin mr dawes uttered a low cry his eyes widened in surprise dazed he reached a hand up to the hole where a few inches of gray skull poked through run josh i cried but there was no need to tell him that he was already zigzagging through the rows of graves his head ducked low i followed him running as fast as i could glancing back i saw mr dawes stagger after us still holding his ripped forehead he took several steps then abruptly stopped staring up at the sky its too bright for him i realized he has to stay in the shade josh had ducked down behind a tall marble monument old and slightly tilted cracked down the middle i slid down beside him gasping for breath leaning on the cool marble we both peered around the sides of the monument mr dawes a scowl on his face was heading back toward the amphitheater keeping in the shadows of the trees he hes not chasing us josh whispered his chest heaving as he struggled to catch his breath and stifle his fear hes going back the sun is too bright for him i said holding onto the side of the monument he must be going to get mom and dad that stupid flashlight josh cried never mind that i said watching mr dawes until he disappeared behind the big leaning tree what are we going to do now i dont know shhh look josh poked me hard on the shoulder and pointed whos that i followed his stare and saw several dark figures hurrying through the rows of tombstones they seemed to have appeared from out of nowhere did they rise out of the graves walking quickly seeming to float over the green sloping ground they headed into the shadows all were walking in silence their eyes straight ahead they didnt stop to greet one another they strode purposefully toward the hidden amphitheater as if they were being drawn there as if they were puppets being pulled by hidden strings whoa look at them all josh whispered ducking his head back behind the marble monument the dark moving forms made all the shadows ripple it looked as if the trees the gravestones the entire cemetery had come to life had started toward the hidden seats of the amphitheater there goes karen i whispered pointing and george and all the rest of them the kids from our house were moving quickly in twos and threes following the other shadows as silent and businesslike as everyone else everyone was here except ray i thought because we killed ray we killed someone who was already dead do you think mom and dad are really down in that weird theater josh asked interrupting my morbid thoughts his eyes on the moving shadows come on i said taking joshs hand and pulling him away from the monument weve got to find out we watched the last of the dark figures float past the enormous leaning tree the shadows stopped moving the cemetery was still and silent a solitary crow floated high above in the clear blue cloudless sky slowly josh and i edged our way toward the amphitheater ducking behind gravestones keeping low to the ground it was a struggle to move i felt as if i weighed five hundred pounds the weight of my fear i guess i was desperate to see if mom and dad were there but at the same time i didnt want to see i didnt want to see them being held prisoner by mr dawes and the others i didnt want to see them killed the thought made me stop i reached out an arm and halted josh we were standing behind the leaning tree hidden by its enormous clump of upraised roots beyond the tree down in the theater below i could hear the low murmur of voices are mom and dad there josh whispered he started to poke his head around the side of the bent tree trunk but i cautiously pulled him back be careful i whispered dont let them see you theyre practically right beneath us but ive got to know if mom and dad are really here he whispered his eyes frightened pleading me too i agreed we both leaned over the massive trunk the bark felt smooth under my hands as i gazed into the deep shadows cast by the tree and then i saw them mom and dad they were tied up backtoback standing in the center of the floor at the bottom of the amphitheater in front of everyone they looked so uncomfortable so terrified their arms were tied tightly down at their sides dads face was bright red moms hair was all messed up hanging wildly down over her forehead her head bowed squinting into the darkness cast by the tree i saw mr dawes standing beside them along with another older man and i saw that the rows of long benches built into the ground were filled with people not a single empty space everyone in town must be here i realized everyone except josh and me theyre going to kill mom and dad josh whispered grabbing my arm squeezing it in fear theyre going to make mom and dad just like them then theyll come after us i said thinking out loud staring through the shadows at my poor parents both of them had their heads bowed now as they stood before the silent crowd both of them were awaiting their fates what are we going to do josh whispered huh i was staring so hard at mom and dad i guess i momentarily blanked out what are we going to do josh repeated urgently still holding desperately to my arm we cant just stand here and i suddenly knew what we were going to do it just came to me i didnt even have to think hard maybe we can save them i whispered backing away from the tree maybe we can do something josh let go of my arm he stared at me eagerly were going to push this tree over i whispered with so much confidence that i surprised myself were going to push the tree over so the sunlight will fill the amphitheater yes josh cried immediately look at this tree its practically clown already we can do it i knew we could do it i dont know where my confidence came from but i knew we could do it and i knew we had to do it fast peering over the top of the trunk again struggling to see through the shadows i could see that everyone in the theater had stood up they were all starting to move forward down toward mom and dad come on josh i whispered well take a running jump and push the tree over come on without another word we both took several steps back we just had to give the trunk a good hard push and the tree would topple right over the roots were already almost entirely up out of the ground after all one hard push thats all it would take and the sunlight would pour into the theater beautiful golden sunlight bright bright sunlight the dead people would all crumble and mom and dad would be saved all four of us would be saved come on josh i whispered ready he nodded his face solemn his eyes frightened okay lets go i cried we both ran forward digging our sneakers into the ground moving as fast as we could our arms outstretched and ready in a second we hit the tree trunk and pushed with all of our strength shoving it with our hands and then moving our shoulders into it pushing pushing pushing it didnt budge push i cried push it again josh let out an exasperated defeated sigh i cant amanda i cant move it josh i glared at him he backed up to try again below i could hear startled voices angry voices quick i yelled push we hurtled into the tree trunk with our shoulders both of us grunting from the effort our muscles straining our faces bright red push keep pushing the veins at my temples felt about to pop was the tree moving no it gave a little but bounced right back the voices from below were getting louder we cant do it i cried so disappointed so frustrated so terrified we cant move it defeated i slumped over onto the tree trunk and started to bury my face in my hands i pulled back with a gasp when i heard the soft cracking sound the cracking sound grew louder until it was a rumble then a roar it sounded as if the ground were ripping apart the old tree fell quickly it didnt have far to fall but it hit with a thundering crash that seemed to shake the ground i grabbed josh and we both stood in amazement and disbelief as bright sunlight poured into the amphitheater the cries went up instantly horrified cries angry cries frantic cries the cries became howls howls of pain of agony the people in the amphitheater the living dead caught in the golden light began scrambling over one another screeching pulling climbing pushing trying to claw their way to shade but it was too late their skin began to drop off their bones and as i stared openmouthed they crumbled to powder and dissolved to the ground their clothes disintegrating along with them the painful cries continued to ring out as the bodies fell apart the skin melted away the dry bones collapsed i saw karen somerset staggering across the floor i saw her hair fall to the ground in a heap revealing the dark skull underneath she cast a glance up at me a longing look a look of regret and then her eyeballs rolled out of their sockets and she opened her toothless mouth and she cried thank you amanda thank you and collapsed josh and i covered our ears to shut out the ghastly cries we both looked away unable to keep watching the entire town fall in agony and crumble to powder destroyed by the sun the clear warm sun when we looked back they had all disappeared mom and dad were standing right where they had been tied backtoback their expressions a mixture of horror and disbelief mom dad i cried ill never forget their smiles as josh and i ran forward to free them it didnt take our parents long to get us packed up and to arrange for the movers to take us back to our old neighborhood and our old house i guess its lucky after all that we couldnt sell the old place dad said as we eagerly piled into the car to leave dad backed down the driveway and started to roar away stop i cried suddenly im not sure why but i had a sudden powerful urge to take one last look at the old house as both of my parents called out to me in confusion i pushed open the door and jogged back to the driveway standing in the middle of the yard i stared up at the house silent empty still covered in thick layers of bluegray shadows i found myself gazing up at the old house as if i were hypnotized i dont know how long i stood there the crunch of tires on the gravel driveway snapped me out of my spell startled i turned to see a red station wagon parked in the driveway two boys about joshs age jumped out of the back their parents followed staring up at the house they didnt seem to notice me here we are kids the mother said smiling at them our new house it doesnt look new it looks old one of the boys said and then his brothers eyes widened as he noticed me who are you he demanded the other members of his family turned to stare at me oh i uh his question caught me by surprise i could hear my dad honking his horn impatiently down on the street i uh used to live in your house i found myself answering and then i turned and ran full speed down to the street wasnt that mr dawes standing at the porch clipboard in hand i wondered catching a glimpse of a dark figure as i ran to the car no it couldnt be mr dawes up there waiting for them i decided it just couldnt be i didnt look back i slammed the car door behind me and we sped away
