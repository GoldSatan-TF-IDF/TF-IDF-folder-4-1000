chapter lacuna l lacuna was slogging through a blue funk it clung to her body making her seem prematurely middleaged it infused her clothing making it dowdy it smirched her face making wrinkles start to think of appearing it washed through her hair rinsing it dishwater dull in fact it permeated her whole life making her thirtyfour years old she had been young once she was sure of it she and her twin brother hiatus had been genuine mischief as children she remembered fondly how they had messed up the wedding of good magician humfrey and the gorgon when they were only three years old at that time their parents the zombie master and millie the ghost had been sharing the good magicians castle because it dated from the time eight hundred years before when their parents had first lived it had seemed only natural that the cute twins should carry the end of the brides long train but they had done more than that hiatus had made eyes ears and noses sprout from things that being his talent and lacuna had changed the print in the manual so that instead of saying things like until death do you part it had said the few measly years before you croak for some reason la question quest cunas mother had not found that very funny well lacuna was older now and could see her mothers point but it only reminded her how she herself had never married she would have settled for the worst of weddings for the sake of a good marriage or for a mediocre marriage instead of mediocre old maidenhood later they had moved to new castle zombie in southern xanth which had been fine she and hiatus had had separate rooms and had teased the poor zombies mercilessly somehow it seemed that the best of her life had been used up in childhood once she grew up and joined the adult conspiracy her life had become a time of tedium followed by a period of monotony trailed by an age of boredom working into years of sheer unmitigated blah finally the funk had set in and now she was fed up to her tired eyeballs with it so she was doing something about it she was visiting the good magician with a question now she came to the region of the good magicians castle it was not as she remembered it because it kept changing she understood that and was not put off she knew that she would have to brave three challenges before she could get in and see the good magician at least they should be interesting a low jungle surrounded the castle the magic path she was on led right up to it then petered out in a thicket of hands and feet she recognized the type palmettos the palms were on stems their fingers splayed while the toes grew along the ground covering it up well such plants were generally harmless the palms could get a bit fresh when buxom young women brushed by them but they would probably just ignore lacuna still it was best to find a path through them because dangerous creatures could hide among them and attack the feet of someone who plowed blithely through so she walked to the side finding a space between plants in a moment her way was blocked again by thickly growing palmettos whose fingers clutched at her plain cloth skirt and whose toes tried to catch her dull shoed question quest feet she avoided these by turning to the side again but this wasnt getting her into the castle she was actually going away from it now she reversed her course and explored on the other side but seemingly promising avenues curled their way into dead ends preventing her from getting any closer to the castle how strange how could the magic path have been overgrown like this it was supposed to be enchanted tothen she realized that this was the first challenge she had to find her way through this thicket of hands and feet without getting into trouble it could have been worse she would really have hated walking over a potato patch and having all those eyes peer up under her skirt and wink at the dull color of her panties men never quite appreciated why women always cut the eyes out of potatoes first thing or maybe they did because when men got hold of potatoes they planted those eyes in the ground where they would grow into plants with more potatoes and more eyes fair enough there was always a solution to the challenges if the person had the wit to find it it had been that way in magician humfreys day and remained so in magician grey murphys day murphy had tried to run the castle without the challenges at first but had been overwhelmed by folk with questions and so had adopted humfreys policy he also now required a significant service for his answer which could be anything up to a year of mopping floors in the castle that tended to discourage frivolous questions well she was prepared to mop it wouldnt be any duller than her prior life but she doubted she would have to because she had something she believed grey murphy wanted very much the key to his freedom from cornpewter compewter was an evil machine made of pewter and glass and crockery and wires and things who sought to rule xanth compewter had two and a half great assets in this quest first the evil machine could change reality in its vicinity merely by printing question quest new situations on its screen second grey murphy was bound to serve cornpewter the moment he finished his service to good magician humfrey who was absent for the time being second and a half cornpewter had inanimate patience so it could wait a lifetime if need be and the moment humfrey returned pewter would have the service of a full magician and could more actively set about taking over xanth lacuna could do something about that and she thought grey murphy would be interested certainly his fiancee the princess ivy should be because she didnt quite dare marry grey until that little business was settled if notwell then lacuna would mop provided she could just get into the castle the more she tried to make progress toward it the more she seemed to make regress away from it the palmettos did not seem to move yet somehow they were always in her way where was the path through or was she supposed to get rid of them somehow to cut a path through she didnt have a suitable knife and her talent of printing wouldnt do for this so there had to be some other way she paused and pondered she was fairly well educated because there wasnt much point in changing print if a person didnt know what it meant to begin with she ought to be able to think of something then it came to her she was standing at yet another deadend pathlet having just about lost herself amidst the palmettos i think ill get out of this stupid patch of hands and feet she said loudly im tired of these pointing fingers and scuffled toes and pointless paths then she marched resolutely back the way she had come but almost immediately she encountered more palms and toes blocking her way out she had to turn aside trying to move directly away from the castle and not succeeding she made a snort of impatience and moved on looking for the outward path i know its here somewhere she muttered i came in on it after all question quest but somehow the way continued to elude her she moved faster as if trying to find her way out before the palms could change their positions and block her off but this didnt work either she only found herself driven back farther into the thicket the more she struggled to get through the farther back she was driven by the uncooperative paths finally she found the entire circle of palmetto between her and the magic path away from the good magicians castle she had only succeeded in passing through the thicket the wrong way well if thats the way you want it she said with irritation bordering on mirth she turned to face the castle having navigated the first challenge behind her the palms rustled and the toes scuffled in the dirt they were chagrined they had been outsmarted they had labored successfully to foil the route she said she wanted not being clever enough to see through her trick had they had brains as well as palms and toes it might have been a different matter but of course that was the nature of these challenges to find the weaknesses of them and successfully exploit those weaknesses to win through now she stood by the moat there was a boy of about ten swimming in it he looked ordinary except that his hair was blue that suggested that there was no moat monster or other threat in the water the drawbridge was down too so if this wasnt an illusion or trick she could cross without challenge that was just as well she didnt fancy getting wet she put a foot cautiously on the end of the drawbridge it was solid however a section of it might be illusion or have a trapdoor or something so she would proceed with excruciating care the worst challenges were the ones a person didnt expect something flew by just in front of her it appeared to be a ball of water it landed and splatted on the bank it was water she looked in the direction from which it had come question quest there was the boy scooping up another handful of water and forming it into a ball are you going to throw that at me she asked sure if you try to cross the moat im supposed to stop you you know oh so this is a challenge sure nothing personal you look like a nice lady it had been so long since anyone had said anything like that to lacuna that she almost blushed with pleasure but this was business a little ball of water wouldnt stop me then how about a big ball he scooped up a double armful and formed a ball of water as big as a beach ball you couldnt throw that she said for answer he heaved the ball over the drawbridge it just seemed to float up without much effort on his part such a mass could indeed knock her off the bridge well then ill just have to wade or swim across she said the boy swept his hand across the surface of the moat suddenly there were waves on the water cruising outward and lapping the bank he made another pass and the waves got larger they were formidable enough to make her hesitate your talent is water magic she said that is impressive whats your name ryver he scuffled a toe in the water he seemed shy now that she was getting personal so you must be serving a year for an answer yes if i may askwhy did you come to the good magician oh sure you can ask i asked him how i could find a good family to adopt me cause i want to be a real boy and i need a real family for that youre not real she asked surprised im not a real boy not a flesh one i mean im made of water question quest made of water now she was really curious you can work with water and control it but that doesnt mean youre not human i can work with water because i am water he said see then he dissolved his feet flowed away and his legs and the rest of his body up to the head i look like a boy but its all water id rather really be a boy and have water control as my talent and i will be if a family adopts me the good magician says she nodded so after your term of service is done you will set out on a search for a good family that wants a boy your age sure do you think ill find one he seemed so eager that she didnt want to dash his hope but it did seem doubtful most families preferred to raise their own tenyearold boys did the good magician say you would find one he said his book of answers said that i would if i did my job well and was polite to my elders so im doing those things he certainly was he was effectively stopping her from crossing the moat but he was being courteous about it warning her rather than hitting her with water and answering her questions he seemed like a nice boy well i hope thats right but meanwhile you know i have to find a way across despite your efforts yes i wish you luck but i have to stop you if i can if you try to swim and my waves make you start to drown ill save you i wouldnt want to hurt anybody i appreciate that there was no irony in her statement it was clear that this was a challenge not a duel to the death and ryver was just doing what he had to do she considered for a while and pondered for a bit and thought for a moment while ryver dissolved his head into water then reformed into a whole boy in question quest eluding clothing he looked completely real and she was sure he was real he just wasnt made of flesh if adoption into a human family enabled him to be transformed into flesh that would nice for him she understood that ordinary people were mostly water anyway ryver just took it farther she got a glimmer of a notion ryver can you read oh sure the sorceress ivy taught me to read she showed me how to start and then enhanced me into being competent thats her talent you know but you know most of the books they have at the castle are sort of dry pardon the term and not much fun if youre not into arcana lacuna had suspected as much it happens that my talent is changing print i can also make print appear where there was none and i can control what it says let me show you something interesting to read oh no he exclaimed i wont make a deal to let you get through thats not right dear boy she said i am not trying to bribe you im trying to trick you which is fair enough i am going to show you some print and if you dont find it interesting dont read it it wont work he said she glanced at the now calm surface of the moat abruptly words appeared on its surface sliding across from right to left forming a moving band of words they disappeared as they reached the left margin so that the whole moat wouldnt get covered with print once upon a time there was a water boy named ryver who wanted to be a flesh boy the rolling print said hey thats about me ryver exclaimed well actually its a standard story i just filled in your name to make it more interesting thats okay he continued reading because otherwise he would lose some of the moving words he was as she had suspected fascinated by references to question quest his own name many folk were especially if the references were complimentary it could work even better if the references were insulting but she lacked the gumption to write trash she poured it on now one day ryver was sitting by the bank of the moat watching the fish when a strange creature came by it was a dragon looking for a tasty flesh morsel to fry ha said the dragon l see you are just the kind of person i need come with me and i will give you an experience like none other kuhuh the live ryver grunted you wont fry me you vicious animal he was evidently getting into it lacuna heated up the script oh is that so the dragon snorted his breath scorching the plants by the bank lll huff and ill puff and lll fry your head off yeah firebrain id like to see you try it the real ryver said so the dragon huffed and it puffed and it blasted out such a blast of flame that the ground turned black and sparks flew from the stones and steam rose from the moat but it couldnt fry ryver because he was made of water then ryver made the water rise up and smack the dragon right in the face i guess that doused your furnace soggysnoot the boy cried happily well that made the dragon angry so it opened its jaws and charged it chomped ryver right through the center but its teeth had no effect because they couldnt chew water and ryver squirted jets of water in its eyes and ears the dragon hated that because nobody likes to have his ears washed the text continued and the boy kept reading avidly he didnt even notice that lacuna had crossed over the drawbridge that was all right she had left enough text question quest in the queue to hold him for half an hour she hadnt known how long it would take for him to be completely distracted so had put in plenty anyway she was pleased that someone really liked her writing she had learned to tell stories to children when she was babysitting and rather enjoyed it ryver was a perfect audience now she was across the moat but still outside the castle wall there was a door right before her she walked up and turned the handle but it didnt work the door was locked and she didnt have the key obviously she had to find the key this was the third challenge she looked around there was a fairly narrow path that circled the castle just inside the moat it was lined by bushes that resembled shelves their stems were vertical and their branches horizontal with the leaves filling in to complete the pattern they had squaredoff large berries that looked rather like books on the shelves a boy was sitting on the bank picking the berries and eating them he looked a lot like ryver who are you she inquired not really expecting an answer i am torrent ryvers twin brother could she believe that well maybe for now what sort of plants are these she asked they are library bushes he responded they have endless information which i get by eating the fruit this was almost too good to be true so she knew it probably wasnt true but she would find out then you must know where the key to that door is sure here it is he handed her a large wooden key she tried the key in the lock it wouldnt fit it was the wrong one she returned to the boy its not the right key where is the right one question quest on the other side of the castle she doubted it but proceeded on around there was a small metal key lying on the path she picked it up and walked back around to the door it didnt fit she looked at the boy who was still eating berries twice he had directed her to the wrong key he was obviously not telling the truth how could she make him tell the truth she decided to experiment torrent are you part of this challenge for me yes so you are supposed to misdirect me and prevent me from finding the key no and you do that by lying to me he hesitated and she knew why if he lied she would know it which would make the lie worthless but if he told the truth he wouldnt be misdirecting her no which meant that he did so you lied about your identity too you are ryver no then where is ryver hes not out there reading the print on the moat he looked back there and winced he must have had to tear himself away from it with the story unfinished he didnt answer which was answer enough and youre not supposed to be part of this challenge she said remembering that he had answered yes to that question before so it was a lie i can be if i want to be he said defensively and now youre telling the truth he hung his head you trapped me into it anyway it doesnt matter because its only about the challenge that i really had to lie why not just refuse to tell me anything about the keys because he stopped i cant tell you because lying has something to do with the solution she said catching on question quest no which means yes and the berriesdo they have anything to do with it too no so they do exactly what kind of berries are they poison hardly youve been eating them then a light flickered you were a truthful boy now youre an untruthful one youve been eating the berries you said they are libraries but i think they are lie berries they make you lie no and if i ate one it would make me lie no but its hard to lie if you dont know the truth so maybe the berries do have a lot of information so they know how to lie about it so die person who eats them knows the truth which he wont tell no she picked a berry and popped it into her mouth it was sickly sweet then she spoke the key is information coursed through her mind over mere she pointed to what she knew was the wrong key under a bush but now she knew where the right key was it was under the water at the edge of the moat hidden by mud she went there reached down and fished it out it was made of delicate stone then she took it to the door it fit and in a moment the door was unlocked she looked back at ryver who was staring sadly after her information sifted through her mind as she continued to feel the effect of the berry now she knew why he had come to join this challenge changing places with the gnome who was supposed to be eating the berries and doing the lying he was lonely he really did want to be part of a family and she as a passing human being was a step closer to die illusion of that than being alone was he was taking the opportunity to question quest be closer to her to interact with her even though it had to be negative she felt sorry for him she didnt say anything because she would be forced to lie until the effect of the berry wore off she turned and opened the door she had made it through the challenges and it had been interesting but she was not completely pleased she saw now that she was not the only one whose life was blah chapter handbasket i ivy was just inside the doorway waiting for her i knew you would make it through lacuna she exclaimed stepping in for a hug in the old days she had been one of the children lacuna had babysat and they had always gotten along well ivy was now an attractive young woman of twentyone and evidently happy in her relationship with grey murphy well im not glad to see you lacuna said then paused dismayed oops that lie berry i didnt eat oh thats all right the effect wears off quickly if you dont eat many i ate bushels which means you ate only one because if you had eaten bushels you would say the opposite come on i think grey is ready for you he doesnt look satisfied you must have an awkward question lacuna shrugged so that no lie would come from her mouth she followed ivy to the central chamber of the castle where the good magician awaited them grey was now a nondescript young man of twentytwo he was the son of evil magician murphy who dated from eight or nine centuries before but like the question quest zombie master and millie the ghost he had come to the present period of xanths history the senior murphy was no longer evil of course he had renounced that as a condition of being allowed to settle in this time he seldom used his power of cursing things so that they would go wrong in any way they could and only did it for beneficial effect that might seem contradictory but it wasnt if he cursed something evil than that evil person or thing went wrong and couldnt accomplish its malign purpose grey had never been evil of course but he had the liability of having to serve cornpewter because of the deal his parents had made long ago thinking it would never take effect his father couldnt curse the evil machine directly because he had made his deal with it to get out of xanth in the old days but had been able to curse the evil plot that had helped save greyuntil good magician humfrey returned grey stepped forward to shake lacunas hand that was one of the quaint mundane ways he retained it meant that he was greeting her in a friendly but not assuming way and expected the same attitude from her i dont suppose i can talk you out of asking your question he inquired plaintively magician my life is blah all i want to know is where in my dreary life i went wrong you mean thats it ivy asked yes then maybe ill know what to do about it ivy turned to grey that seems simple enough it isnt he said he glanced again at lacuna i would really rather you didnt ask it well i dont want to cause you distress but it seems little enough for me to ask considering that i made my way through your challenges and am prepared to offer a significant service grey frowned i am not yet completely proficient in the magic of information the good magician humfrey would know how to handle this much better than i do but there have been rumblings and they suggest question quest that your question is a lot more complicated for us both than it seems in fact they indicated that if i answer it the situation of xanth may change significantly i dont want to take the chance so with no malice toward you i must decline to answer grey ivy said appalled ive known lacuna all my life shes a good person she has such a simple question how can you do this i know just enough of humfreys magic now to know that this is best he said unhappily now if she cares to ask some other question no only this one lacuna said firmly then im sorry but she fixed him with an adult stare he was not yet so long beyond childhood as to be immune to its effect he scuffled his feet i did not come here to take no for an answer she said she might be dull but she knew her rights i insist tell me where did i go wrong grey obviously felt properly miserable but still he clung somehow to his position i wont it was time for the carrot she had learned how to wield stick and carrot it was a necessary secondary talent of all babysitters i have in mind a rather special service to repay you for your trouble well if i were to use your service im sure you could confuse other applicants by putting misleading printed messages on the walls but magician i can free you from your obligation to the evil machine even after magician humfrey returns both grey and ivy jumped you can do that ivy breathed with sheer faint hope i can go to cornpewter and change the print on its screen to say that grey murphys obligation is no longer in force since whats on that screen changes reality to conform that will be true there will be no further obligation question quest ivy turned to the good magician her eyes shining can she do that grey grey dived for a huge tome sitting on a table he leafed rapidly through it staring into the depths of its musty pages he paused then looked up yes it is here she can do it if she prints the right words on pewters screen if she has the nerve to broach the evil machine in its evil den there is one key word that must be used at the end or it wont be effective key word lacuna asked compile you mean to assemble something compile it has a special meaning for cornpewter it locks hi whatever has just been printed on its evil screen cornpewter can change anything except itself and this changes pewter itself i understand about this because of my experience with similar machines in mundania then ivy started grey raised his hands in surrender that is the one service i cannot refuse i will have to answer lacunas question lacuna smiled vastly relieved the truth was she wanted to free grey anyway because she knew how happy that would make ivy but it was best to do it this way very well grey said grimly turning the pages of the book of answers again i shall have to answer and hope the consequences are not as bad as they could be he found his place read the entry and looked up perplexed this is really of no practical use to you are you sure i am sure he sighed it says that you should have proposed to him thats no answer ivy protested it doesnt say whom or when i mean of course its all right for the girl to propose i asked grey to marry me and he accepted but question quest it is enough lacuna reassured her i know what it means if only i had thought of it who it was twelve years ago when i was greys age now he was veraon and his talent was making others experience vertigo certainly he made me feel that way but that was because i was infatuated with him he was a handsome man and a decent one i would have married him but he never quite asked me i think he was too shy i mean in those days i wasnt as dull as i am now later he married a mean woman who told him he had better if he knew what was good for him but she certainly wasnt good for him she made his life miserable i think that was her talent the stork never brought them any children probably because it knew they would have been miserable in that house lacuna shook her head sadly i can see it so clearly now now that i have the answer that was indeed where i went wrong he was humble thinking his talent to be of no value i know he would have accepted had i only thought to ask him but i didnt but what good does it do you to know that now when its twelve years too late ivy asked none except the private satisfaction of knowing my mistake the next time i meet a man i should marry ill ask him of course he probably wont accept since im middleaged now and not worth anyones notice let alone marriage but at least ivy was troubled grey i know thats all she asked but it just doesnt seem enough considering the service she is going to do for us she will free you from the bane of your life isnt there some way to free her from hers maybe to send her back so she can do it right i really dont think he said look in the book she insisted with that tone which only members of the female conspiracy could mistress he shrugged and turned the pages again he found question quest his place and stared itseems to be possible but possible lacuna exclaimed for me to change that bad decision yes but the details are so technical i cant understand them at all this book gets into programming language and it will take me years to figure out even part of it only humfrey who had a century to learn the nuances could fathom this answer then i must go ask humfrey lacuna said right after i do my service for you but humfrey is at an impossible address in the gourd grey protested and he doesnt want to be disturbed he must be doing something extremely important he will talk to me lacuna said confidently i was at his wedding actually hes in the anteroom to hell the awfulest region of the dream realm you would hardly care to go there oh yes i would if theres a way to change where i went wrong and make it rightwhy that would do for my life what i will do for yours magician tell me how to reach humfrey i really dont think but he didnt finish because ivy was fixing him with the stare another aspect of female magic you dont need to lacuna said i must do it if i have to give another service for that answer then ill gladly do it let me just go to cornpewter and take care of that then ill return here and grey sighed no if you feel that strongly about it i will help you visit humfrey without further charge i will do it now your service to me can wait well if youre sure im not sure but it seems it was mused fated ivy murmured im getting as bad as whats her name he said flustered question quest metria ivy said the demoness metria he agreed getting the wrong word he looked at lacuna anyway ill send you to see humfrey now but i warn you its not a pleasant trip my life is not a pleasant trip i could use some excitement well then you can go to hell lacuna was taken aback but in a handbasket he said thats where humfrey is and its the only way to go there if you dont belong oh for a moment she had been on the verge of mistaking his meaning folk from mundania could have some crude mundanian manners clinging to them but you can do that tomorrow ivy said you will want to rest here tonight no i dont think i do id rather go straight on and get the second answer from magician humfrey as you wish grey said he went to a locked cupboard unlocked it opened it and brought out a seated jar he unscrewed the lid and took out a tiny basket like a thimble made of wickerwork on a thread he flipped the thread up toward the ceiling and let go of the basket it hung there suspended from nothing this is the basket ivy said its one of the magic devices we found in humfreys collection he evidently used it and sent it back you will ride in it to hell but i cant fit in that little thing lacuna protested grey smiled your body will rest in a coffin just as humfreys does only your soul goes to hell dont worry your body will be quite safe here until you return to it ivy walked to a low solid bench she lifted its top and it came up manifesting as the lid to a plushly lined coffin lie down in here ivy said lacuna was beginning to have if not exactly second question quest thoughts firstandahalf thoughts sleep in a coffin but if it was the way to go then she had to do it she got into the coffin and lay on her back somehow this action made her feel even older and duller than she hoped she was grey put his finger behind the hanging tiny basket and pushed it toward her get into this lacuna wanted to protest but found herself floating up toward the basket which was rapidly expanding she caught its edge with her hands and climbed in it was now quite ample in size she could stand upright within it and peer over the edge and down she saw her huge body lying there in the coffin it looked every bit as blah as she had feared she turned to face the other way as she did so the basket began to move it was swinging along at the end of its rope which was firmly knotted to the stout handle the room indeed the entire good magicians castle seemed to have disappeared she was on her way the basket tilted and moved down lacuna clutched the edge with both hands she was passing through a region of shadows and clouds behind the clouds were vague flashes as of lightning making the outlines show momentarily some of the clouds resembled monstrous ugly faces as if cumulo fracto nimbus the meanest of clouds had posed for his portrait one of the clouds opened its big mouth and the basket swung right into it the scenery changed now there were things floating ranging from tiny acorns to huge acorn trees this was evidently the dream realm normally accessed through the peephole of a gourd it seemed there were other ways to visit it to hell in a handbasket who would have expected it at least it was interesting but some of the scenes through which she was passing were more than interesting they were grotesque there were human forms in various states of distress and animals who seemed lost and assorted objects that looked broken the stuff of troubled dreams spare props perhaps hanging here in limbo waiting to be question quest fashioned into truly unpleasant episodes for those sleepers who deserved them lacuna had seldom suffered from bad dreams that was part of the boredom of her being how could a person rate bad dreams if a person never did anything of doubtful validity then a vague face formed neither interesting nor dull of itself from its mouth poured numbers in scattered order these numbers grew larger as they moved becoming individual pictures they were odd indeed one was of a man walking along with two left feet making him pretty awkward another was a blue or purple horse actually she couldnt quite tell what color it was because it seemed to keep changing never being fixed a third was of a man whose head was a pile of animal manure suddenly lacuna caught on figures of speech she exclaimed in the realm of dreams they are literal a man with two left feet a horse of another color a dunghead these folk were worse off than she was which made her feel both better and guilty how awful it must be to be literal then abruptly the basket swung into a small chamber it bumped against the floor almost overturning and she had to scramble out she had arrived as she caught her balance she saw the basket swinging up and away oh she cried grabbing for it but she was too late she had lost her transport back but grey and ivy knew where she was surely they would send the handbasket back when they realized that it was empty she had to believe that she looked aroundand there sat old good magician humfrey in a hard wooden chair she recognized him instantly there was no mistaking the gnomelike features and great age of the little man he seemed to be snoozing that was all the rest of the chamber was bare except for another chair she sat in that chair there did not seem to be much else to do she smoothed out her dingy dress noting question quest that she wore the same clothing as usual despite being in spirit form now that was just as well she would not have liked to go naked to this infernal region though probably it was not the best place to keep secrets this surely was not hell itself because there was no fire it must be hells waiting room but why was humfrey still waiting here in fact what was he doing here anyway where was his family it had been ten years since the man had disappeared from his castle along with his wife and son leaving xanth in the lurch chex centaur had discovered his absence with her companions esk ogre and volney vole the challenges seemed to have been in the process of being set up for the three when the occupants of the castle had suddenly departed it was the great current mystery of xanth what had happened well perhaps that wasnt her business though she was as curious as the next person she had just one question which was her business with the magician she would just have to stifle her interest in the rest of his life she did not want to wake him from his snooze but she wasnt sure how long she could safely remain here if this was hells waiting room at any time a door could open and a demon could appear saying next in that bonechilling tone then either humfrey would be taken or she herself would either way her chance for her answer would be gone ahem she said politely one of humfreys eyelids flickered then both did his eyes popped open fixing on her lacuna what are you doing here you recognize me she asked startled of course i recognize you you babysat me when i had been youthened by overdosing on the water from the fountain of youth you were a rather sweet sixteen at the time quite unlike your present blah state she had forgotten how sharp he was on information of course he was the magician of information even question quest in his youthened state he had been very quick to learn things so after most of eighteen years without seeing her he had identified her present nature with dismaying facility i came to ask you a question she said im not answering questions now go to the castle murphys boy is supposed to be minding it he is he sent me here he said that only you could give me my answer why doesnt he have the book of answers there yes but he cant decipher the technical parts and my answer is there he nodded it does take most of a century to master the programming language i happen to know i did it taster because i had special training but hell get there in due course i cant wait a century she protested ive already gone from sweet sixteen to blah thirtyfour ill sink into dismal anonymity before another decade is out he glanced at her appraisingly more like six years six years a person is only allowed three great mistakes your first was in not marrying that young man your second was in turning thirty your third will be in turning forty and that will finish you as a potentially worthwhile female human being he certainly understood her situation magician grey murphy told me of the first mistake if i can change that ill be left with only two strikes against me and my life may become worthwhile the rules arent the same for married women thats why i came to you humfrey considered i suppose i might as well do something while im waiting here suppose i give you the coding so that you can show grey murphy how to get your answer from the book that would be fine she said question quest and what service will you do me in return what do you need i need to have the demon x h take notice of me he said ive been cooling my heels in this waiting room for ten years waiting for him to ask me what i want you mean youre not going to hell not exactly im here to take someone from hell then i can return with her to xanth with her who is she my wife the gorgon is in hell no shes waiting for me to get my business done here its rose im after rose is your wife but what about the gorgon what about her how can you have a wife in hell when the gorgon is your wife i married rose before but then its a long story he said shortly lacuna realized that humfrey must have done more than twiddle his thumbs in the century or so he had lived before meeting the gorgon rose must have been a wife who died but no matter how long it is if you bring rose back youll have two wives and thats not allowed in xanth who says it isnt queen irene when prince dolph got betrothed to two girls she said he could marry only one humfrey sighed that does complicate things but the queens word is law on matters of social protocol however inconvenient it may be her son must have been most upset he was she agreed but he finally worked it out he was young i am too old to adjust to such nonsense what am i going to do i cant leave rose in hell question quest you are asking me but youre the magician of information true i shall have to think about this i shall review my life and gain the perspective to make the right decision herein lies your service use your print to record my biography but i have nothing to print on she protested surprised print on the wall yes i could do that she agreed but what is the point of printing it why cant you just review your life in your head because my head isnt that big he snapped also im trying to attract the attention of the demon xfan and maybe the story of my life written on the wall will do it why do you want to see the demon x h i thought you were here to rescue your former wife i am but only the demon can authorize it lacuna nodded it was beginning to make partial sense and you have waited here all this time heating your heels being ignored by the demon why dont you take a break where its more interesting because the demon doesnt want to deal with me but then the demon may never take note of you no it is in the big book of universal rules the demon has to meet with his appointments before doing anything else so i shall wait here until he appears but all this timesurely you can afford some time off hes probably asleep and it wont make any difference humfrey fixed her with a steely gaze you dont understand the psychology of the demon x ih he will appear here the very instant i step out because the rules also say that if the demon appears and there is no person in the waiting room because the person didnt have the interest to remain then the appointment is vacated then he wont have to see me at all lacuna was appalled you mean the demon knows question quest you are here and is deliberately ignoring you hoping to catch you out and it has been this way for a decade exactly so i dont dare step out i was lucky the demon didnt realize when grey murphy and ivy tried to wake me in the dream coffin four years ago but i know i wont be able to get away with that again the demon may have been inattentive once but he never makes the same mistake twice now she knew why the good magician had disappeared and never even left word he had been unable to without risking the loss of his mission so he had remained here in this absolutely dull waiting room doing nothing waiting for the demon your recent life has been a worse blah than mine she exclaimed suffering a revelation what else is new he inquired sourly but stillsuppose the demon came this moment and said it was all right to take rose out of hell and back to xanth what about the gorgon for lacuna had known and liked the gorgon whose terror was all in her face not in her nature its bad enough trying to figure out what to do about grey murphy when i return the magician grumped it isnt right to send him back to mundania to avoid cornpewter oh thats no problem she said quickly i will free grey by changing the print on the evil machines screen he stared at her no wonder i overlooked that answer its obvious simply a matter of overwriting pewters directive and using the key command save and compile i could have given him that answer before she shrugged not wanting to annoy him further well if you are so good at seeing the obvious whats your solution to my problem of two wives she spread her hands maybe they could take turns question quest thats ridiculous he exploded it just might work if the queen doesnt interfere well if one wife is technically dead while the other is alive maybe queen irene couldnt object he sighed it may not come to that the demon xcan isnt going to grant my appeal anyway butbut then why because it would be unthinkable not to make the effort i was less experienced before and didnt consider such an approach but now it must be tried lacuna wondered what kind of a woman rose was to warrant such devotion from such a normally truculent man to sit in hells waiting room for a decade expecting a negative response she knew better but she couldnt help arguing a little more why wont the demon grant your appeal for the same reason he doesnt want to meet me its more complicated to deal with this matter than to ignore it the demon cares nothing for my convenience only for his own wouldnt it be easy for him just to hear your appeal and turn it down and be done with it he cant do that the rules say that he has to be fair if he is fair he may have to grant my appeal so he is avoiding me hoping i will give up and go without his hearing me the two were really in a contest of wills she saw humfrey wanted something that the demon xfan didnt want to give so they were locked in this endurance contest instead it was sad but it was also somewhat like humfreys own treatment of those who pestered him with questions at his castle he was being served as he served others probably he would not appreciate having that pointed out so she stifled whatever remark she might have been tempted to make how will he avoid granting your appeal if he has to play fair she asked he will cheat but question quest fairness is as the demon says it is he will give me a chance to gain my objective if i put my own soul on the line if i win i take rose if i lose i will be confined here with her then he will see that i lose but how can he very simply he will ask me a question that i as the magician of information should be able to answer it will be about some future event then he will see that whatever my answer it will happen otherwise thus i will lose then you really have no hope she said disturbed i have hope i have no chance you are throwing your life away for nothing and even if you should win youll still have the problem of two wives they wont take turns if they are both alive in xanth tell me something that isnt obvious she shook her head this just doesnt make sense so it would seem then she knew that he had a plan she couldnt imagine what it was but she had confidence in his information he would find a way through the rigged contestif he could only get the demons attention he couldnt tell her his plan because the demon might be listening and then would know how to foil it still she had one more question if the demon x th knows you are here and is ignoring you why should printing your life story make any difference wont he just ignore that too only up to a point my life story is true though much of it is unknown to all others except the demon it must be true i dare not falsify any part of it therefore it will be difficult for me to relate in places complete honesty is always painful and seldom advisable but at the point it catches up to the present and starts into the future its truth will be undefined i will be able to tell it as i hope it will be question quest but then you could say that you are going to rescue rose from hell by yourself and return to xanth precisely i will be able to define my own future therefore the demon must at that point come to meet me and deal with my appeal lest he lose it by default that was a most sophisticated strategy it was obvious that the good magician was much smarter than she was still she had a niggling confusion why didnt you tell your story before instead of waiting all this time the spoken word lacks the authority of the written word until you came i was unable to transcribe my autobiography to print but why didnt the demon stop me from coming here then i suspect you were too insignificant a detail for him to bother to keep track of had you been beautiful or smart or highly talented as my wives are he would have seen you coming now it is too late you are here how fortunate that i am so ordinary she said with a hint of a mixed feeling you are not ordinary lacuna you are dull you are almost completely uninteresting how you got to be a leading character in this story is almost beyond my significant resources to ascertain surely it was true that was why she had come here well we had better get on with it she said with a certain boring resignation she focused on the far wall and the print began to appear the story of the life history of the good magician humfrey the magician of information chapter one oh dont be so cumbersome humfrey snapped just title it question quest and start with chapter youve already wasted two chapters with your own dreary business may the muse of history forgive you question quest yes of course she agreed properly chastened what should the title of chapter be oh anything he said impatiently he began to dictate chapter anything i was born of wholesome parents in the year this calendar dates from xanths first wave of human colonization some few human folk had settled in xanth before then perhaps around the year but then xanth became an island there were not enough of them to maintain the population and they faded out by it was probably good riddance the main evidences of their presence are the crossbreeds they generated harpies cowboys werewolves mermaids and similar ilk later the isthmus was restored and more humans crossed over generating the centaurs but only with the first wave did human history become continuous so that was the year zero successive waves of human colonization from mundania brought shame to xanth until after the fourth wave in when magician roogna assumed power built castle roogna and ushered in xanths golden age castle roogna was deserted when king gromden died in and king yang took over the human influence in the peninsula slowly declined ushering in what was called xanths dark age had anyone noticed or cared before it was too late but this summation becomes tedious the tabular question quest history of xanth will be provided in an appendix for those few who are morbidly curious about the dead past however one good thing had happened recently the year before my birth magicianking ebnez adapted the deathstone into the shieldstone protecting xanth from further waves magician roogna had had the power to adapt living magic to his ends while magician ebnez adapted inanimate magic both were to have significant effect on human events this was to usher in a period of historical calm the twelfth wave became known as the lastwave because there were no more waves until when king trents mundane army settled peacefully in xanth thus it was my fortune to live in the most peaceful part of xanths dark age actually it was rather dull there is a blessing may you live in boring times i would rather have suffered the curse of interesting times i was the youngest of three children my older brother inherited the farm and my older sister was incurably bossy it therefore behooved me to set out alone for far adventures unfortunately the only trade i knew was what i had learned at home tic farming we grew tics which constantly twitched and harvested and bundled them for the clocks of other folk once in the clock the properly ripened tics measured the time without them the clocks had nothing but tocks and were useless but with them they proceeded in a steady line of ticktocks and kept good time there were few clocks in xanth because there were few people in xanth and my familys farm provided all the tics that were needed it would have been pointless to start up another such farm my training was useless in the outside realm i had one other liability i had unmitigated curiosity that was all i had no magic talent that i knew of in those days there was no requirement in that respect it was the later storm king who idiotically decreed that every citizen of xanth had to have a magic talent however minor the only real rule at this time was that only a magician could be king that dates from the question quest fourth wave and has generally worked well because only a magician has power to enforce his edicts so i as a talentless young man without athletic ability small of stature and unhandsome became one of the nonentities of xanth others neither knew nor cared what i was doing as long as i did not bother them so i walked from village to village exploring and looking around learning all i could about everything i could unobtrusively since villages were far apart most of my time was spent on the paths between them these paths were unkempt and often dangerous this was between the times of enchanted paths other than those set up for special purposes by tangle trees and the like during the golden age paths abounded and in the contemporary age they do too thats the advantage of a strong kingship i was fifteen years old and looked twelve sometimes folk took me for a gnome it had always been thus and i was used to it in fact it was an advantage at times because they didnt consider gnomes to be people and would speak as freely around them as around animals i perked my ears and closed my mouth and learned their secrets as a rule these were not worth knowing who was making a tryst with whose wife who was stealing from whom and who had most recently been eaten by the local dragon but i remembered their names and faces and secrets because of my insatiable desire to know everything knowable i had as it turned out an excellent memory which i buttressed by notes i made in my one possession of any value a notebook thus i would mark kelvinslew golden dragon or stileblue adept or zanethanatos or dariuscyng of hlahtar and the entire curious history of each person would be recalled when i read each note of course these were all inconsequential folk who never made any mark in xanth and were forgotten by all others but to me they were interesting who might guess what adventures they might have had or what success they might have question quest achieved if only they could have been delivered into more advantageous situations for that matter what might i myself have accomplished had i lived in a culture where curiosity was valued so it was that i found myself on the path leading from the gap village where i had lived so far to the land of the dragons only i did not know that at the time i was merely following the path of least resistance that was foolish as i was soon to learn because if the path of least resistance does not lead to the nearest tangle tree it leads to some equivalent disaster i heard a noise ahead it sounded like a dragon going after prey a sort of screaming and hissing followed by a dull thunk i ducked off the path knowing better than to be on the scene when a dragon was feeding but then i saw a shadow and a figure just above the trees it was a flying dragon dripping blood it was evidently done here i resumed my trek the best direction to travel was opposite that of a dragon and that was the way i was going anyway i rounded a turn entering a glade here i encountered two objects on the ground one was a unicorn writhing from a bad injury thrashing its horn about in pain the other was a girl i wasnt sure what to do about either unicorns like all equines except the centaurs were rare in xanth and i had seen one only twice before and only fleetingly girls were not as scarce but i had had little more contact with them outside my family and indeed my experience with my older sister had rather turned me off them it was hardly ideal traveling alone but it was better than being constantly bossed around the girl spied me help horntense she cried gesturing to the animal there she was bossing me already conditioned by a decade and a half of conditioning i had no choice but to obey i approached the unicorn it was a mare who appeared to have broken a foreleg there was also blood on her horn i hesitated because question quest a wounded animal can be as dangerous as a whole one but i saw that it was pain not threat which made her thrash for my attention she was hoping i could do something for her as it happened i could i had noticed some boneset herbs growing beside the path a short distance back i shall return i said and hurried away i broke into a run zooming along until i reached the herbs i had a spare bag in my knapsack which i drew forth i found a good plant took a stick and dug carefully around it i lifted it from the ground with its root and the earth around it in much the manner i would transplant a tic plant at least my experience as a farm boy was coming in handy i set it in the bag carefully i carried the bagged herb back down the path now i could not run lest i shake up the plant other plants might not care but a shaken boneset was not good i reached the glade the unicorn was now quiet the girl had dragged herself over and was cradling the animals head she spied me oh i was afraid you were gone i was just getting this plant i explained somewhat lamely though in truth the two of them were the lame ones the unicorn had a foreleg broken and the girl seemed to have turned an otherwise serviceable ankle it was beginning to swell do you know anything about healing she asked not much but i thought maybe this herb might help actually i was quite sure it would help but something about being near to the unicorn or maybe the girl made me less assertive a stupid plant she demanded horntense could make two bites of that dont eat it i protested alarmed this is boneset whats that a magic herb that sets bones let me plant it here so it can operate i felt more confidence having discovered that i knew something she didnt question quest i used my stick to dig a hole by the animals broken foreleg then i slid the herb into it and packed the earth around firmly now if i can touch the leg i said reaching for the unicorns injured extremity she did not shy away so i put my two hands on it and drew it slowly toward the plant i set it right beside the herb touching it immediately the bonesets leaves quivered its stems reached out and curled over the broken leg vines tightened around it suddenly they clenched and there was a muffled crack the unicorn emitted a squeal of agony and jerked her leg away what happened the girl cried it set the bone i explained thats the herbs magic she looked at the unicorns leg which was now unbroken it did she breathed barely believing the leg is better no its just reset it will take a few days to heal if i find the right herbs the animal shouldnt put much stress on it meanwhile shes not an animal the girl said crossly shes a unicorn it was no use arguing with a girl so i didnt try a unicorn i agreed that plantdo you think it would work on my ankle i shrugged it should if its broken at all she turned herself around and put her leg out i caught it and guided it to the boneset plant the stems took hold circling her foot and ankle tightening i saw that though her ankle was bruised and swelling her bare leg was rather nicely shaped under the dirt is it going to hurt she asked belatedly her arms and face were dirty too she had really sprawled in the dirt for a moment i said hold me then i had no experience holding girls and was awkward question quest i sort of kneeled beside her and put my arms around her shoulders she turned into me as she sat and put her head against my shoulder and her arms around my middle there was something quite soft about her chest the plant tightened there was a pop oh she gasped her arms clenching around me its done i said there must have been a small break but now its set but you shouldnt walk much on that foot until it heals it feels less worse already she said lifting her head from my shoulder and squeezing the dampness out of her eyes with the bends of her wrists but i shall have to walk i need to fetch food i can fetch food i said for no good reason i know how to find good things to eat oh would you she asked eagerly that made me feel good for even less reason i went out and cast about for things a girl would find edible i could get by on stewed slugs having verified that they were easy to catch and nutritious but i suspected she would not i was in luck there was a pie tree nearby and some milkweeds i brought an armful of pies and pods back the unicorn had climbed to its feet and was grazing she had the sense to keep weight off her hurt leg and seemed to be managing well enough on three hoofs the girl was now sitting with her back to an ironwood tree trying to brush herself off she had ratty brown hair and eyes to match but a slender waist and quite full hips she wore shorts under her skirt even so her legs were impressive she was probably a couple of years older than i and looked five years older not that it mattered i was only just recently noticing such features in girls and wasnt sure that the new perspective quite compensated for their bossiness anyway girls only laughed at me if they noticed me at all so i might as well ignore them back i brought my armful and set it down before her question quest oooo wonderful she exclaimed delighted this is just perfect foolishly numbed by this unexpected praise i said nothing sit down she urged we must eat this before it spoils why was i so glad to comply she started in the girl had the ability of her kind to eat and talk simultaneously weve never been introduced she said somehow while chewing a chunk of cherry pie my name is mareann my talent is summoning equines and making them mind whats your name and talent im humfrey ii dont seem to have a talent you mean you havent discovered it yet that must be what i mean no one had to have a magic talent but the great majority of folk did and i felt somewhat out of sorts well it will surely turn up im fifteen how old are you i gaped youre that young of course i am what about you imim fifteen too she glanced hard at me youre that old of course i am i echoed weakly in the face of her disbelief oh youre a gnome she said no im human just gnomelike oh im sorry but she didnt seem sorry she seemed doubtful she didnt want to question my word so she was stuck in an awkward mode i understood exactly how it was after a bit she looked around is there any water near here i mean a lake or river so we can clean up you have dirt on you and i must be a total sight i passed a river a way back but you wouldnt want to clean up with me there of course i would she said in her emphatic fe question quest male way or have i delayed your schedule too much already schedule you are going somewhere arent you and youd be just about there now if it wasnt for me and horntense oh no i was just going away from the gap village nowhere in particular the what village the gap you know the chasm no i dont know what chasm then i remembered there was a forget spell on the gap chasm i lived right beside it so was immune or so i then believed but she was from elsewhere so hadnt heard of it or had forgotten it if she had that was the nature of the ancient spell it was pointless to tell her much about it because she would only forget it again just a big crevice it doesnt matter my village doesnt matter either its just sort of there i want to go somewhere more interesting well where i came from is just as dull our village in on the bank of the sane jaunts river and the only interesting things there are the dragons and theyre dangerous dont i know that flying dragon almost got us i thought we were beyond their territory and relaxed but evidently not nowhere in xanth is beyond their territory i said i thought maybe there would be fewer of them the way i was going are you kidding its dragons galore country i was dismayed i guess im going the wrong way then well then turn about and go with me im not going anywhere either just away from home you want to travel with me i asked incredulously well you did help me and you seem harmless i have found that traveling alone isnt much fun and its sometimes dangerous if horatense hadnt managed to question quest spear that dragon with her horn before it got us we could both be dead now and you seem to know so much i mean you got the boneset plant and the pies and all youre a real blessing to a girl in distress i couldnt help it i was getting to like mareann i couldnt believe she was only my age but why should she lie it was true she was bossy but less so than i was used to and it really wasnt bothering me much now well if you want to i agreed trying to make it sound somewhat more reluctant than it was in those inexperienced days i cared what others thought of me i will summon you a unicorn she said brightly she put her fingers into her mouth and made a piercing whistle but in a long moment there was the sound of galloping hoofs then a unicorn stallion appeared help me stand mareann said i put my hands on her shoulders awkwardly and tried to lift her but it didnt work then she reached up with her arms and i took her hands and pulled and she came up smoothly she winced as her bad ankle took weight and leaned on me she was taller than i and fuller in the chest and hips but not actually heavier because her waist was smaller the unicorn slowed to a walk as he burst into the glade he approached our party cautiously i watched him with similar caution if a unicorn horn could spear a dragon it could do the same to me uland this is humfrey mareann said humfrey this is uland unicorn he will be your steed for now but i dont know how to ride a unicornor anything else i protested oh you dont need to know how unicorns are magic uland will teach you i remained dubious thethe river isnt far why dont we just walk but as i spoke i realized that that wouldnt do for her or maybe you should ride uland and horntense and i will walk question quest yes i suppose that is better mareann agreed help me up then hes too tali for me to mount readily again i was somewhat at a loss how was i supposed to put her up on the steed heave up on her hips like this silly she said she bent her left leg at the knee lift on this feeling hopeless i took hold of her leg avoiding the injured ankle i liftedand she heaved and suddenly swung up on the unicorns back she had somehow braced against me and done it and i hadnt quite seen it happen she looked down at me and laughed you dont have much experience for sure well i never claimed to i said nettled she was immediately contrite im sorry humfrey you just looked so startled it was comical please i dont want to offend you you are helping me a lot i like you this time i felt myself blushing she had apologized to me complimented me and said she liked me that was a bigger dose of positive expression than i had ever had from a girl before she must have noticed but she didnt comment that was a relief my sister would have baited me unmercifully trying to make me blush worse and probably succeeding i set off down the path toward the river i had passed homtense limped along behind me i wish i knew where there was a healing spring i said you and homtense could certainly use it a what mareann asked a healing spring our village elder has a vial of healing elixir which he traded for last year and when someone is injured we use a drop of that but those who know where such springs are keep it secret why so they can make gouging trade deals with others question quest thats disgusting i turned to face her thats the way it is but if i knew where one is i could get some elixir and make you and homtense better say ill bet the unicorns know mareann exclaimed they cant tel us of course but maybe uland would take you there but i said and at the same time the unicorn stallion snorted now stop that both of you mareann said severely she had the typically femalish talent for spot severity you dont want to ride humfrey and uland doesnt want to show you where the spring is but we can work this out he knows where it is yes didnt you see uland twitch his ear yes when i mentioned it but unicorns dont share secrets with our kind for which i cant blame them i hadnt seen i would have to learn the equine signals maybe we could give uland a bottle and but i saw that it wouldnt work the unicorn had no way to hold the bottle look uland mareann said it would really be a big help to homtense and me if we could get some of that healing elixir were both in pain even if we dont make a big thing of it suppose humfrey swears never to reveal to anyone else where the spring is would you take him then uland flicked his tail he wants to know whether you are to be trusted she translated well i dont know i said i mean yes i keep my word but i dont know how he would know that he can tell but its dangerous dangerous when a unicorn tests someone its pass or fail you either pass or youre dead i was dismayed i dont want to die suppose he makes a mistake question quest unicorns dont make that kind of mistake so if you agree to be tested i gulped well all right but i hope he knows what hes doing mareann slid down off the unicorns back she hopped to horntense and braced against her okay uland the stallion advanced on me i stood my ground not at all bravely he lowered his horn so that it bore directly on my chest with one shake of his head he could stab me through the heart now make your statement mareann said my what your agreement not to reveal the location of the spring to any other person oh i will not tell or show any other person where the healing spring you take me to is i said somewhat awkwardly uland thrust his head forward the horn plunged through my heart then it was outand i stood there feeling nothing except a burgeoning dose of panic but it was too late for that i was done for so fast i had never felt it uh i said even more awkwardly than before i made ready to collapse with whatever dignity i could muster youre not hurt mareann said i stared down at myself there was no wound no blood but you spoke the truth mareann said if you had lied that horn would have felt solid to you only truth blunts it now i understood weakkneed i resolved never to depart from the truth in anything get on uland mareann said he says it isnt far well wait here but i dont know how there was another truth she hobbled over bend your leg at the knee i stood beside the unicorn and bent my left leg as question quest she had she took hold of it now throw your right leg over as i heave she heaved and i lifted my right leg up and over the back of the unicorn suddenly i was up there precariously perched her hold had been like a ladder lifting me up now i understood how she had mounted with my help it wasnt magic but it was so neat a trick that it might as well have been uh thanks i said youre welcome she said and smiled up at me i felt dizzy she was so lovely when she did that then uland was moving hastily i grabbed a handful of his mane and hung on that seemed to be what was required i was riding to my amazement the unicorn was running like the wind and this was no cliche his feet seemed to be striking on air and he was going right through the forest as the wind does i saw leaves flutter with our passage yet it was perfectly smooth on his back i might as well have been on a boat on a fairly calm lake my fear of riding was quickly becoming pleasure but i suspected that it would not be like this on a less magical animal this is fun thank you i said uland wiggled an ear that meant yes i wasnt guessing i found that i really did understand his signals now that i was riding him that was surely magic i had not realized before just how wonderful unicorns were soon we came to a small pond in another glade it did not look special but the foliage near it was quite healthy uland stopped and i dismounted by putting my right leg back over and sliding off on my stomach mareann had done it more elegantly on her backside well i was a beginner and she had a better backside than i did i fished two bottles from my pack the only ones available i was sorry they werent larger this water would be invaluable but i would not use it to trade question quest anyway all i needed was enough for mareann and horntense i knelt to dip the first the bank under my knee gave way and i tumbled facefirst into the pond the bottles flew from my hand realizing what this would mean i made a desperate grab in air and caught one before i submerged the spring was deep i sank down down taking in a mouthful inadvertently then i remembered to try to swim and paddled my way back up my head broke the surface and i choked and gasped but i had the bottle and it was full i pulled myself out dripping then fished for the stopper my eye fell on uland he was shaking with equine laughter i had to laugh too i must have looked pretty foolish i still did really for my clothing was dripping and my hair was matted across my face how clumsy could a gnome like me get i put the sealed bottle into my wet knapsack then i approached the unicorn he was still too tall for me to mount from the ground and mareann wasnt here to boost me with her nice little hands maybe if you moved next to a rock i suggested he hooked his nose in the signal for jump i shrugged anything was worth a try i jumped and to my amazement sailed right up and onto his back how had that happened i had never before been able to jump like that my small gnarled legs were only good enough for modest performance yet this time they had responded like those of an athlete and my coordination had been perfect uland was racing like the wind again by the time i stopped being bemused we were back at the path where mareann and horntense waited i slid down this tune doing it expertly i have it i said youre all wet she exclaimed i fell in i said abashed question quest you fell into the healing spring you must be supremely healthy now and that was it i had been completely doused in the elixir even swallowing a mouthful i was healthy all over my muscles were working at their full potential i realized now that i could also see far more acutely than before and hear much better my whole body bristled with sheer fitness so leaps which had been impossible were now easy uland had known i brought out the bottle no save it mareann said just give me your shirt i got out of my knapsack and shirt she took the shirt and wrung it out over her extended leg a few drops fell on the ankle oh its working she exclaimed then standing firmly on both feet she turned to horntense she wrung out some more elixir on the unicorns leg immediately horntense put down the leg standing without pain mareann returned the shirt to me thank you so much humfrey she said we really appreciate it then she kissed me i was too stunned even to blush i felt as if i were floating an entire new view of girls was dawning on my limited outlook now lets go on to the river she said ill ride horntense you ride uland numbly i held her leg so she could mount then i went and jumped onto the stallion then we were at the river i was still trying to realize how i felt from that kiss mareann jumped down and started stripping off her clothes but i started my senses were in perfect health but my mind was boggling she turned to face me her shirt off we have come to know each other well enough in a short time and we are not going to do anything lascivious we never have and we wont now so its all right we can wash together wenot i said finding no straw to grasp question quest because the unicorns would go unicorns something fell into place the reason most people could not approach unicorns was that only childlike innocence was acceptable i was old enough to have the first hint of a notion of what the adult conspiracy was concealing but i had never had occasion to explore the matter until i did i would be able to approach unicorns that was the way of their kind and ours i dismounted and removed my clothing mareann and i swam together in the cool clear river as naked and innocent as a faun and nymph but my ungrateful background mind wished it could have been otherwise mareann had been shapely but dirty because of her fall now she was shapely and clean and to my eye lovely why are you staring at me she asked naively i never saw anyone so beautiful i said before i thought it was her turn to blush no one ever said that to me before thank you humfrey i realized with a pleasant shock that she was indeed my age her body was that of a grown woman while mine was that of a grown gnome but her experience in life was parallel to mine it was hard to imagine her being ridiculed for her proportions but evidently neither had she been praised she appreciated a sincere compliment just as much as i did that was a great comfort to know yet i also realized that it was a special type of interest i was finding in her and that it could in time lead to a good deal more than innocent compliments but i had the wit to keep that to myself this wasnt deceit it was courtesy and caution so we swam and washed and then ran around naked while we dried playing tag and finding fruit and nuts to eat and it was about as nice an hour as i could remember experiencing if this was the beginning of the rest of my life i was well satisfied chapter survey n low it was near evening we had better find a place to sleep mareann said i had planned to clamber into a suitable tree for the night i realized that more was required now she would never be mistaken for a gnome and a tree was hardly her style somehow this inconvenience did not bother me i saw a house a little farther back maybe the person who lives there will let us sleep on the floor we can get some pillows and a blanket she agreed we rode the unicorns and in a moment the distance which had taken me hours was covered and the house was before us in its small clearing among the weeds it was such a perfectly ordinary cabin that now i was uncertain sometimes things arent what they seem i said but what else can this be but a house she demanded do you think its going to eat us shamed by her unconcern i dismounted approached the house and knocked on the door it opened on its own revealing a fairly nice interior with a table a chair and a bed there was a pile of blankets on the bed and several pillows that was all i still did not quite trust question quest it that selfopening door was magic and too convenient tangle trees made their approaches inviting and seemed harmlessuntil the unwary creature was lured within their grasp this obviously was not such a tree but its manner was similar where is who lives here mareann asked coming up behind me i liked having her do that acting like a friend and her friendship was becoming important to me in fact my relationship with her was as devious and intriguing as my concern with this house for different reasons it seems to be empty i said theres no smell of occupancy for my nose was now healthy too and could detect far more than ever before then it must be just waiting for someone to live in it she said brightly well be here only a night but its perfect for that she pushed on past me and went inside i was not sanguine about this but couldnt let her chance it alone so went in with her nothing happened apparently this was indeed a house waiting for an occupant if it belonged to someone that person should not mind us using it briefly if we did no damage but suppose it did not belong to someone what then was its purpose i feared that we could not be sure that its purpose coincided with ours mareann told the unicorns that we wouldnt need them until morning and they departed it had to be nice having such a magic talent if only i had something similar i looked at the bed ill put some pillows on the floor for me i said oh dont be silly well share the bed of course i certainly had no objection i was gaining a whole nother perspective on girls i was getting to like being bossed i was discovering that it depended very much on which girl was doing the bossing and how i felt about her mareann was bossy in a pleasant and trusting manner question quest so she changed into her nightie which she had in her purse which like all such items was magical in its own way a purse always held more than was possible i knew enough to avert my gaze so as to avoid seeing her panties as i had when we washed together in the river it was all right to see a girl bare if she didnt mind but panties were something else at least so the adult conspiracy indicated i used my undershorts because nothing else had dried yet and we squeezed onto the bed under the blankets then mareann had a second thought you dont know how to summon the stork do you no i admitted good because thats the prime thing unicorns dont like im in no hurry to learn she settled back i unfortunately had my burden of curiosity i did want to know about the stork and about everything else in xanth but it was very nice lying so close and warm with mareann and if not learning the storksummoning ritual was the price of that then i too was in no hurry for now tell me about yourself she said i was surprised but dont you want to sleep arent you tired yes of course but i like to know something about the person i sleep with that seemed reasonable so i told her what little there was to know about my dull life and how i hoped to learn everything there was to know about xanth someday maybe if i was lucky the odd thing was she actually seemed interested i think thats very commendable humfrey im sure you will learn more about everything than anybody else does she snuggled against me relaxing she was marvelously soft and warm and nice to be next to andis it all right to learn something about you i asked hesitantly she laughed why of course humfrey if youre interested its not much i ran away from home question quest but you seem like such a nice girl i am a nice girl thats my problem my father said i was getting pretty grown up for my age and it was time for me to get married and learn about the stork he was going to marry me to the village bell maker but i didnt like the man because his bells make people stupid make them stupid i asked feeling that way myself yes real dumbbells maybe they just make folk unable to speak i forget either way i wasnt interested and if i had learned about the stork from him i would have lost my friends the unicorns of course i can summon other equines too but the unicorns are my favorites so i ran away i was glad she had now thank you humfrey she said but i didnt say anything i protested yes you did you distinctly twitched your ear i felt it against my cheek i had not realized that i was now using the language of the equines it must have come from my association with the unicorns and my improved health after my dunking in the healing spring that could have given me better control of my ears yes im sure thats it she said kissing the side of my head in the manner she might kiss a unicorn magic could be wonderful but as the darkness became complete something alarming happened the house abruptly tilted eeeeek mareann cried in perfectly feminine fashion grabbing onto me my first impulse was to leap out of bed and run outside but i couldnt because mareann was clutching me closely so i got hold of the edge of the bed instead in that manner anchoring us both my first instinct had been wrong anyway how could i have deserted the girl beside me the floor tilted back but that was not the end of it question quest the whole house was rising i saw the downward movement of trees in the moonlight beyond the window it was as if a giant were picking up the whole house then things steadied id better check i whispered drawing myself free of her clutch i loved the close contact but a deep suspicion was growing in me youre so brave she whispered back brave not that i knew of i just was doing what i had to do i scrambled away from bed and blankets and crossed the floor to the window as i did the house began to rock again almost throwing me off my feet i lunged to the window and caught hold of the sill while mareann screamed from the bed i peered out sure enough the house was in the air but it was not floating or being carried by a giant in the dusky deep shadows below i made out an enormous muscular thigh growing outof the side of the house i didnt need to see more i knew that this was the upper part of a great powerful leg and that it was a monstrous birds leg with giant claws on the foot i had heard of this type of thing but never expected to see it let alone be in it the house paused momentarily i took advantage of the moment to hurl myself back across the loom to the bed the bed table and chair were all firmly anchored to the floor now i understood why what did you see mareann asked eagerly grabbing onto me again chicken legs i said what the house has grown chicken legs and is running around its a werehouse it changes its nature at night you mean like a werewolf yes except that it doesnt eat people it just runs around it wont hurt us as long as we hang on but why i mean what does it do it just runs around and in the morning it will settle down in a new place maybe it gets its kicks from giving rides to folk like us i hoped i wasnt sure that it question quest was quite as innocent as that but since i didnt know otherwise it was pointless to alarm her the house began moving again now we could feel the pulse as the powerful legs walked the whole house shook as each foot struck the ground we were lucky that our knapsacks were firmly jammed under the bed so that they didnt slide around im getting motion sick mareann said bleakly um i wouldnt recommend that i said im not sure the house would like having uh you know on its floor ill stifle it she agreed hastily we clung to each other and the bed there was nothing else to do as the werehouse charged on through the night sometimes it paused to scratch at the ground sometimes it leaped and landed jarringly mostly it just kept going if this were anywhere else id really enjoy spending a night like this with you in my arms i said at one point i wonder if storksummoning can be worse than this she mused i hope not then we laughed somewhat sickly i dont know how much sleep either of us got but we did succeed in not getting sick in the morning the house settled down and we made haste to get out of it not even dressing at least it had not harmed us i had been right to avoid alarming mareann with my fell suspicion we carried our knapsacks and clothes bundled in our arms we found ourselves in the middle of an unfamiliar village the folk were just getting up and out they stared at us evidently they hadnt seen the house settle into place but they saw us clearly enough in underpants and nightie and generally disheveled the unicorns were not present they probably had no idea where the house had gone neither did we question quest uh where is this i inquired in my typically bright fashion this is the south village the nearest man said how did you get your house built so quickly it wasnt here last night and arent you two rather young to be indulging in that sort of sport are you sure you belong to the adult conspiracy i exchanged most of a glance with mareann then we turned as one and went back into the house it would remain fixed in the day we had been foolish to run out unprepared i had resolved always to tell the truth but i was discovering that there were occasions where the truth was nobody elses business it was a realization i would remember later in life when folk would pester me for information inside we dressed i turned my back so as not to see her don her panties mareann brought out a comb and sorted out her hair and then mine actually i thought she looked intriguing in her wild style but this was good too and i liked the way she fussed over me that was another truth best left unsaid since it behooved me not to prejudice her valuable innocence do you know anything about the south village she asked me as it happened i did thats where king ebnez lives the king he assumed the throne in the year he has been king for almost forty years his talent is adapting magic things he adapted the deathstone to the shieldstone to stop the waves so we dont get invaded anymore i knew that i mean this is the capital city there are no cities in xanth this is the capital village what are we doing here its where the werehouse brought us well south of the gap south of the what question quest thewell i dont exactly remember this was my first experience with the action of the forget spell because i had now been far and long enough away from the gap to lose my immunity anyway its in southem xanth and i fear it will be a long hard trek to return to the north can your unicorns find you here not the same ones but maybe it doesnt matter we wanted to travel to get away from our situations well we traveled farther and faster than we expected lets make something of it something of it i asked blankly lets go visit the king maybe he will have something for us to do but i dont know how to do anything yes you do youre very good at finding useful things but thats hardly a profession and i will keep house for you and help keep you warm at night suddenly i found myself persuaded so we went to visit king ebnez as it happened he was at home and not busy so he welcomed the company he was a portly man in his sixties with impressive sideburns under his crown he treated us to a very nice breakfast of greenberries from the greenberry fields and marshmallows fresh from the mallow marshes and what is your business here he inquired after we had pretty well stuffed ourselves humfrey would like employment mareann said immediately oh and what is your talent curiosity she said the king turned a bland eye on her and what is yours pretty miss summoning equines i said ebnez nodded so you would be able to travel readily yes mareann agreed and i will travel with him to keep his socks dry i realized that she did not question quest want to remain in a strange village alone for fear that some man might get the notion she was marriageable to be sure the king agreed his gentle gaze returned to me as it happens i have need of a surveyor you mean to find out things about people i asked hardly believing my luck yes that is why i asked the werehouse to bring in good prospects your talent of curiosity is a good recommendation and your wifes talent complements it nicely oh shes not my wife i said surprised not yet mareann said quickly she was not about to let a good job slip away on a technicality or to let strangers thinkshe was unattached i might have objected but found i had nothing to which to object the thought of spending more time with her appealed even if it did seem likely to compromise her innocence in this manner i became the royal surveyor it was to be a more significant position than i realized at first it was an excellent job mareann summoned winged horses for us to ride and that was a marvelous experience in itself we flew up high above the south village and the villagers gaped thinking i must be a magician to compel the service of a woman who had such power mareann for her own reason did not discourage this impression she wanted folk to believe that i had powerful magic i didnt like this seeming misrepresentation for honesty still seemed to me to be the best policy but she pointed out that i was not being dishonest i was merely being polite by failing to disabuse others of their errors so we compromised if anyone asked i replied that i was no magician if anyone didnt ask i didnt volunteer the information it was much the same with respect to our mutual status as nonmembers of the adult conspiracy i spent some private time pondering the shadesofgray ethics involved and concluded that it was not question quest property my business what others thought if there was a foible such as in the manner a village girl made herself seem beautiful by applying charcoal to her eyebrows and redberry juice to her lips it was not my place to expose it unless i was specifically asked it was best to leave folk with their illusions of whatever nature especially if i wanted to get along with them this developing attitude of mine stood me in excellent stead in the course of my work because i needed the cooperation of all whom i encountered my job was to survey all the human folk of xanth and to compile a list of their magic talents the king was especially interested in the more powerful talents in fact he hoped to turn up some magiciancaliber talents in young folk who might be potential kings since only a magician could be king at present none was known and ebnez was getting old he was sixtysix and not in perfect health i offered him some of the healing elixir i had but he declined he did not trust drugs i disagreed believing that anything beneficial should be used but it was not my place to argue with a king so i concentrated on doing my job and kept my opinion to myself that too was an excellent discipline i started with the southern tip of xanth and worked my way north there were not a great many people in the peninsula but they were scattered across it and were hidden in glades and crannies so it was slow work i knew that if i missed even one that one might turn out to be the magician ebnez was looking for and so i would have failed the major purpose of my survey so i didnt expect it to be easy but it turned out to be more difficult in several ways than i had anticipated let me describe the first example of many we flew down past the dread region of madness and i shivered to think that i would have to survey that too in due course we passed lake ogrechobee as wide and shallow as an ogres mind and mount rushmost where the winged monsters gathered then on past question quest mount parnassus where the fabulous tree of seeds grew there i had my second qualm would i have to interview the maenads the wild women who roved its slopes i feared i would for it was not safe to assume that they had no magic other than blood lust then we were over the everglades which stretched on forever as it was their intent to lose anyone who ventured into them it was wise never to underestimate the perversity of the inanimate finally we came to the coast and flew beyond it to centaur isle we landed in the central square of the main centaur city an elder of the centaurs trotted out to meet us he was a powerful figure of man and horse partbreeds are not welcome here he said gruffly but im doing a survey i said we dont care what youre doing two of you are human and two of you are winged horses you are all partbreeds and we prefer to keep our isle pure please depart at your earliest convenience i was baffled by this attitude the centaurs i had encountered on the mainland were reasonably sociable creatures if treated with respect im doing it for the king of xanth i said he wants to know the magic talent of every person in the peninsula centaurs have no magic the centaur said coldly i saw that i had inadvertently added insult to ignorance fortunately mareann had quicker wits than i we know that sir but we thought that there may be among you some inferior humans and if we can survey them quickly we can soon begone and the king will be satisfied and no one will bother you again the elder turned an appraising eye on her mareann smiled at him mentioned illusion when she smiled she seemed to become twice as pretty as she was it is an effect i have since noticed in others too incidental magic independent of their particular talents seated on the winged horse as she was in that moment she rather resembled a fetching lady centaur had i been the object of that smile i would have melted halfway question quest into the ground the elder was too haughty to go to that extreme but he couldnt help softening somewhat at the edges after all he was part equine and she had power over equines making them want to do her will there are a few servants among us he conceded very well i shall assign chrissy to guide you during your brief stay here chrissy centaur trotted up at the elders signal she was a lovely creature of about our own age with hair that trailed back from her head and merged seamlessly with her mane her full bare breasts were impressive in the human manner and her brown hide was nice in the equine manner i could see that the winged horses were admiring her flanks in much the same manner i was admiring her forepart centaurs wore no unfunctional clothing and they considered modesty unfunctional hello she said shyly hello mareann and i said together show them our humans the elder said and trotted off oh how nice to have someone visit our humans chrissy said im sure they get lonely sometimes here thus my survey commenced the few men and women on the isle were indeed servants and their talents were minimal what are called the spotonawal variety some magic is truly potent such as the ability to shatter a big rock into a thousand parts some is next to nothing such as making a faint discoloration appear on a wall most human beings have magic but few have strong magic and the folk here were evidently the ones who had nothing better to do than serve centaurs they cleaned out stalls and swept off roofs and did the other things that were beneath the dignity of centaurs and seemed as satisfied as might be expected but in the way of servants they knew secret things and one thing they said gave me a peculiar doubt you know the centaurs say they have no magic a scullery maid confided when chrissy centaur was off rounding question quest up another human but i think they do they just wont admit it they think that the possession of a magic talent is obscene that was one of the ironies of the centaur persuasion centaurs performed natural functions of all types freely in public having no sense of modesty about them but magic was something they girt about with social restrictions they tolerated it in what they considered to be inferior creatures and did use magic objects but that was the limit any person who wanted to remain on an amicable footing with centaurs learned as i did to honor this foible scrupulously if the centaurs had magic talents then i should be listing those too but if they refused to admit it how could i was my survey impossible to complete properly this ushered in another notion i had been thinking only of full human beingsbut what of the crossbreeds centaurs werent the only ones what about the harpies and merfolk and fauns in fact what about the elves and ogres and goblins they were all human in their distant fashions and might have magic talents just how big was this survey likely to become well in a few days we flew back to the south village and i made my first report to king ebnez so do you want to to try to question all the part humans too i inquired the king pondered i doubt that the human population would accept a parthuman king at this time so perhaps you should query only the full humans specifically but make incidental note of the others as you come across them it could be advantageous to know more thoroughly what other creatures inhabit xanth and of what magic they might be capable that seemed like an excellent compromise to me and my respect for king ebnezs judgment grew his four decades of kingship had evidently taught him something still it was a busy enough time i discovered that question quest asking questions of people was only the easy part of it first i had to find them and to protect myself from problems along the way i learned caution when we entered the everglades thinking that i had memorized the pattern of geography there and promptly got lost only the fact that we could fly up out of them saved us and even that was chancy because an evil cioud moved in and made a storm forcing us to remain for several cold wet hours on the swampy ground with encroaching allegories and hypotenuses and other dangerous creatures i really didnt mind hugging mareann for warmth but the horses were annoyed because their wing feathers got soaked then there was mount parnassus i concluded that the maenads were human beings so should be surveyed but i knew it was dangerous to approach them because it was their notion to eat stray men how could i safely handle this maybe if you stay on the horse mareann suggested and take off the moment they charge too risky i understand they can move very quickly when theyre hungry and theyre always hungry she nodded agreement we would have to think of something else meanwhile we checked a human settlement near the base of the mountain it turned out to be the supply depot for the temple of the oracle near a cave or vent from which magic vapors issued young woman called pythia sniffed these vapors and uttered sheer gibberish which the priests then interpreted to answer the questions of visitors sometimes the great python forgot himself so far as to eat one of the pythia and then a replacement was needed and so another girl would come from the village they really werent eager for such employment but it was as they put it the only game in town and their families needed the favor of the folk of mount parnassus the average family of xanth at this time was peasantly poor as befitted the latter stage of the dark age any way to gain suste question quest nance was grudgingly welcome especially when the local fruit and berry patches were picked out and pie trees were between pies that gave mareann an idea why dont we go ask the oracle she asked if the answers are always accurate when duly interpreted we can find out how to survey the maenads i wasnt sure about this approach but she smiled at me and as usual i went along with her she was learning to use her innocence effectively so we flew to the palace of the oracle it was nice enough looking though in disrepair with a number of stones fallen it was actually at the base of mount parnassus but neither the maenads nor the python seemed to be around at the moment to our relief we talked with the head priest certainly we can answer your question he said confidently what will you proffer in payment payment for a moment i was blank surely you did not expect to achieve this valuable information for nothing i had indeed had some such notion but hesitated to admit it what do you normally charge what do you have i didnt like the direction this was going i dont really have anything im just trying to do a survey for the king what manner of survey i am cataloging all the human talents of xanth now that is interesting he said stroking his beard you will surely pick up much incidental information yes quite a bit but suppose we do it on commission on what we shall give you your answer in return you will give us half of what you profit from it half of my information exactly more specifically you will share what you question quest learn with us that can be interpreted as all your benefit but also as nothing because you retain what you share it seems fair to call it an equal measure i looked at mareann does this make sense to you it seems like a big price for one answer she said but if you keep all you share then its not a painful price still i distrust it lets put a time limit on it a time limit the priest said shocked somehow that made me feel better one year i said ten years he responded instantly so he would bargain i knew how to do that we pulled back and forth and wound up where we both knew we would five years it still seemed expensive but at least it wasnt forever i really appreciated mareanns caution so the pythia a girl very like the ones we had interviewed in the village took her perch over the fuming crack in the mountain and i stepped up and asked my question how can i interview dangerous folk without danger for it occurred to me that there might be awkward interviews elsewhere than parnassus i figured i might as well get as much for my answer as i could the maiden took a deep breath of fume and kicked her legs so that her skirt lifted in a manner that made me that much more eager to get into the adult conspiracy she let out a stream of indecipherable whatever punctuated by expressions i didnt catch maybe i would have understood it better if my attention hadnt been partly distracted by those legs the priests then made notes and conferred privately after a bit they emerged to give me my interpreted answer demon conquest i had somehow expected something else what do demons have to do with this we dont know the priest said we merely know that this is the answer you sought do not forget to pay for it question quest for this i had yielded a share of all my information for the next five years i dont even know whether im supposed to beat a demon or the demon is supposed to beat me i complained that is a matter of indifference to us the priest said now please clear out there may be another client on the way we mounted our horses and took off mareann was no better pleased than i perhaps she had noticed me looking at the pythias legs mareanns own legs were just as good of course but in her innocence she made no secret of them so they were less exciting we returned to the village for the night how was it the villagers asked they told me demon conquest i said angrily for this i have to give them all my information for five years heads nodded that is the kind of bargain they drive why didnt you warn me that their answer would be no good but it is good it is only your understanding that is bad once you understand it it will help you a lot well right now we need a place for the night i said sourly i have a spare bed for you and your wife a matron said and feed for your horses if you will have them give my children a ride i looked at mareann she nodded done the children squealed with delight as the horses took them up over the trees and around but i saw tears in mareanns eyes when we were alone in the bed i asked her about that for she was normally cheerful i would like to have children like that she said i never realized how appealing they are when theyre having fun but you can have children i said all you have to do is question quest summon the stork she finished bleakly and lose my unicorns we werent using the unicorns now but i appreciated her point she faced a most expensive tradeoff i knew how painful that could be now i put ray free arm around her im sorry mare ann she wept into my shoulder and i felt very protective the price of innocence was becoming apparent chapter dana f shape loomed excuse me please i think you have the wrong room i said annoyed by the interruption this bed is occupied i had never really liked cold nights before but now i delighted in them for they brought mare ann innocently close for warmth a third person in the bed would have been too much warmth however you are the one who went to the oracle today it was a girl i could tell by the dulcet voice my irritation surprisingly began to fade perhaps more warmth would be satisfactory still i kept my voice reasonably sharp yes but right now we prefer not to converse with others and they told you something about demons mare ann tuned in to the proceedings who are you i am dana i may be able to help you interpret that answer suddenly both of us were interested we sat up in the bed making room for another how so i asked she sat beside me it was mostly dark but i could tell by the way she shifted her weight and the touch of her thigh against mine and her musky perfume that she question quest was an attractive woman if only i had a better notion what a grown man might do with such a creature i know something about demons you know what demon conquest means mareann asked eagerly no but i can inquire if you wish how can you do that i know the demons they will tell me if they plan to conquer anything soon you know demons i asked arent they mean folk they can be dana agreed but they cant hurt me why not i asked becoming quite curious about this strange woman because i am a demoness myself mareann and ijumped you i asked now trying to edge away from her a demon or demoness could assume any form including that of a person but that did not mean that there was any other resemblance to a person demons were completely callous to the welfere of living folk we dont seek any quarrel with you nor i with you dana said you see i have a problem and i thought we might be able to help each other how can a demoness have a problem i asked marveling at how much like a living person she seemed her body was warm not cold and solid rather than vaporous this was my first direct contact with this species and it was surprising me in unexpected ways you can assume any shape you desire and you dont have to eat or sleep unless you want to my problem is that i have a conscience but demons dont have souls so they cant have consciences i protested i mean they are made of soul material so maybe its bodies they lack but the effect i broke off because it was pointless to babble question quest about the nature of demons to a demoness she would quickly discover how little i knew about her kind i have a soul but i dont know how it happened maybe a soul got loose from a mortal and i got caught in it or it got caught in me i was a normal carefree female demon and then suddenly i wasnt because i was concerned about right and wrong i could no longer play the demon games because many of them arent nice so i went to the oracle to ask how to get rid of the soul and the priest made me bring a basket of precious stones from the earth in payment and then they told me that i would have to marry the king of xanth marry the king i exclaimed ebnez would never marry a demoness demons have been banned from association with kings ever since one messed up king gromden in the seventh century yes the answer does not seem to be of much use to me dana said sadly i thought if i helped you you might tell the king im not such a bad sort and maybe he would change the rule and i shook my head king ebnez is a very righteous man i could tell him but theres really no hope of that is all i can ask of you to tell him she said in return i will do anything you want provided it does not violate my conscience how do we know you really have a soul mareann demanded i mean demons cant be trusted about anything maybe a unicorn could tell if shes innocent i said dana laughed im not innocent i was a normal demoness for centuries before i got souled i couldnt get near a unicorn well we cant afford to trust you without proof mareann said theres a soul sniffer in the north village dana said i will fly there with you if you wish question quest exactly how can you help us i asked the north village was a long way away and this might just be a demon ruse to make us waste our time with a long trip or to lure us into some trap it will have to be more than just asking the demons whether they plan to attack i understand you are doing a survey yes and that you expect trouble trying to talk with the maenads yes thats why we went to the oracle i could assume your likeness and question the maenads or anyone else you wish they can not hurt me suddenly she was making sense lets go to that magic sniffer tomorrow mareann said if dana proves out she can be a big help so it was decided the demoness faded out and we slept warmly next morning we mounted the horses and flew swiftly north and dana paced us in the form of an extinct reptilian bird needing no steed she resumed human form when we landed so that no one would know her for what she was there was indeed a soul sniffer at the north village which was in other respects a thoroughly unremarkable hamlet but it wasnt a person or animal as i had expected it was a place go down the path to the west to the key stone copse the village elder told us there is a key there which only a person with a soul can use to open the door thats all i asked just a door just a door the man agreed whats beyond it were not sure youre not sure i found this hard to believe havent you gone there to see there used to be a nice valley with wonderful orangeberry patches our women and children went often to pick them but the last three who went two months question quest ago did not return we fear that the door has become oneway so we are now staying clear of it but maybe those folk are in trouble i said someone should go and see he merely shrugged and turned away so much for community spirit sometimes i wonder whether souls are as positive as they are supposed to be mareann muttered maybe his has gotten old and worn we rode the horses along the path to the west soon we came to a dense thicket whose trees and thorny branches were so tangled that we could not see through and certainly could not pass the only possible way through was a stone door set in it on a hook on the door hung a large wooden key i lifted the key from its hook and paused suppose they only think this is limited to folk with souls maybe anyone can use it and its no real test oh its valid dana said all the demons know of it but youre a demon and you could be lyingno offense i said no offense she agreed i could bring a friend to test itanother demoness i wasnt sure about this but had nothing better to offer i replaced the key do it she disappeared in a moment she reappeared beside her was another demoness who was just as shapely in her human form male demons i understood delighted in horrendous fearsome forms while female demons preferred voluptuous partly clothed forms my experience was confirming the latter case this is my friend metria dana said im not your friend metria protested demons dont have friends demons without souls dont have friends dana said perhaps i should say that i am your friend because i will not betray you but you are not my friend question quest because you will betray me in the normal demon fashion thats right metria agreed how can you look at your cat in the mirror talking like that look at my what your feline tiger torn kitty my puss whatever you arent talking like a demon at all yes but im trying to get rid of my soul by helping these good human folk i appreciate your coming here to i came only because theres a chance to make fools of you and these mortal idiots i love a good laugh at someone elses expense dana turned to me i chose d metria because she always tells the truth as you can see but how can she be truthful when she has no soul tasked a soul does not necessarily make one truthful dana said many human folk are liars it merely gives them a conscience so that they suffer when they do wrong yes i find that the truth is the sharpest knife with which to cut people metria said nothing shakes folks values like the truth i looked at mareann she spread her hands it was evident that our values were being shaken well lets get on with it i said i reached for the key again wait we should have the demons try it first mareann said its dana who is being tested not us dana reached for the key no metria should try it first i said fine with me metria said she reached for the key her fingers closed on it but passed right through it i cant seem to get a tentacle on this thing she said disconcerted a what i asked appendage extremity limb mitt paw question quest oh a hand i said whatever this key is an illusion i cant touch it at all thats the way it works dana said i thought you understood metria glared at her you may be an old bag of a century or two but i appeared only a decade or two ago i never heard of a phantom key dana glanced at us she tells the truth about everything except her age thats not considered lying in females of course it isnt metria agreed women have a right to be any age they want thats true mareann said i kept my mouth shut not wanting to admit to having been ignorant about this female privilege well you try it metria said glaring at dana dana reached for the key her fingers closed on it she lifted it from the hook she brought it down to the lock wait i said let me make sure that really is the key i held out my hand dana gave it to me i brought it to the lock inserted it and turned it it resisted seeming to want to come back out of the lock without completing its action as if there were a spring behind it i pushed it in farther and maintained pressure so as to complete the turn the door moved without moving that is it fogged out and i stumbled through because i had been pushing against the key in a moment i was through yet the door remained in place i caught my balance and turned back there was the door i put my hand against it and found it solid the key was gone from my hand but there it was hung up on the hook on this side of the door it had magically returned after being used but if it was now on this side then what was on the other side coula only one person be on this side at a time question quest i reached for the keyand had to jump back because dana demoness suddenly popped through colliding with me it was a painless collision because she was marvelously well padded in front oops she said and turned to smoke i smelled her pleasant essence as it brushed by my nose then she reformed a bit away it changed so fast i knew the feeling but i had another question the keyhow could you use it when it was on this side it was back on its hook on the other side she said there must be two keys mareanns alone with demetria i said starting to be alarmed metria doesnt hurt folk physically she does it ail verbally or with illusion shes probably tired of this game now dana looked around odd that we cant get through that thicket wall normally solid things are no barrier to demons there must be special magic here making it a demonproof glade then mareann stumbled through i caught her before she fell it was so she started i know i finished then the three of us turned to look at where we were the thicket arched up high overhead forming a dome that blocked the direct rays of the sun without cutting off the light brilliance wafted down to touch the ground on the ground orangeberry bushes grew covered with fat berries what a lovely place mareann exclaimed lets eat some berries before we depart we walked to the bushes and started picking and eating dana did too i never realized what fun eating could be she said of course the food does me no good so i shouldnt waste it what happens to what you eat i asked my curiosity manifesting again i just hold it inside me as long as im solid when i turn vaporous she fogged it drops out sure enough a pile of chewed berries plopped to the ground question quest we picked and ate with a will the berries were delicious then mareann screamed what i asked hurrying over to join her she pointed there lying half hidden under the bushes was a collection of bones dana came across oops she said those are human bones now we know what happened to those last three villagers they died here are the berries poisonous i asked abruptly horrified for more than one reason not that i know of dana said we demons are pretty good with poisons and i didnt taste any then what made them die mareann asked shuddering maybe theres an ogre in here i said looking around much more nervously than before lets get out of here mareann said we started back toward the door but there between it and ourselves was a pack of ferocious animals they had the heads of wolves and the bodies of spiders and were about half man height wolf spiders dana exclaimed they cant hurt me but they are surely dangerous to you now we know how the villagers died i said grimly feeling for my knife but it seemed quite inadequate to the defense five spiders advanced in the line one remained behind to guard the stone door evidently they were experienced in trapping prey their technique and the bones indicated mat mareann clung to me oh humfrey what can we do i cant summon the horses here they cant get in i drew my knife it seemed even less adequate than before for one thing i was no fighter and for another the blade was only as long as one of the enemy fangs even if i got in a lethal strike that would stop only one spider could we flee no the glade was entirely enclosed this was an ideal hunting ground for the wolf spiders question quest we would just have to fight and die as the villagers had before us stay behind me i said maybe ill be able to occupy them long enough for you to sneak to the door it was an almost futile hope but the best that offered oh humfrey i love you she said you two are acting as if im not here dana said both of you get behind me numbly we did so she assumed the form of a fierce firebreathing dragon she swung her head toward the nearest spider and fired out a jet of flame but the spider merely leaped aside and the flame missed meanwhile the others closed in from the sides it was obvious that not even a dragon could stop them all a dragon could not guard all sides at once a basilisk i whispered can you do that shield your eyes the dragon whispered back then it became a tiny lizard with wings mare ann and i clapped our hands to our eyes it was death to meet the gaze of a bask but could the demoness actually kill with her glance fire was essentially nonmagical and she could generate that by forming the innards of a dragon but the death glance was magical and demons didnt possess that type of magic if the spiders caught on the basilisk hissed and swung its little head toward the spiders the spiders did several double takes then scrambled out of the way the bluff was working then one spider perhaps a smidgen smarter than the rest balked he had seen the demoness and then the dragon and then the bask he was catching on that it might be illusion if he called the bluff we would be in trouble again danabask glared at him he met her gaze he did not die he opened his wolf mouth to sound the charge i took the gamble of my life i hurled my knife at the creature i had never been good at throwing either but what else was there the knife whistled straight and true it plunged right question quest into the opened wolf mouth and stuck in the throat beyond i was amazed how could i have performed such a feat i was neither a knife fighter nor a thrower i had made my effort from unwitting desperation then i remembered my dunking in the healing spring i was superhealthy now my body worked perfectly as it never had before it did exactly what i wanted it toand i had wanted it to throw that knife hard and fast into the wolf mouth striking with the point i had underestimated my physical capacity the spider gave a whine of agony and collapsed the others turned to look they saw their packmate dropping dead the basilisks tiny grim head swung toward the spiders they spooked they almost scrambled over each other in their eagerness to flee they ran for the thicket wall and jammed into a niche in it we followed there was a twisted passage amidst the thicket partly between tree trunks and partly between stray stones that led through to the other side this was how the wolf spiders had gotten in bypassing the thorns and the magic door once inside they had made of the protected refuge a hunting ground we gathered stray branches and pulled thorny vines into the aperture we made it tight again so that no creature could get through of course it would be possible for the wolf spiders to clear it out again but i doubted that they would because they believed that this was now the hunting ground of a basilisk the pack would surely hunt elsewhere in the future i went to the fallen spider and reached into its terrible mouth and pulled out my gory knife i wiped it as clean as i could on the ground then we went to the door and used the key to exit one at a time i think you are a pretty brave mortal dana said to me that was an excellent shot with the knife and exactly what i needed to foster the illusion i think you do have a soul i replied if the key question quest didnt prove it the way you defended us did an ordinary demon would have laughed and let the wolf spiders tear us apart true but i wasnt thinking about the proof of my soul at the time neither was i we smiled at each other then mareann summoned the winged horses and we took off for mount parnassus we proceeded with the survey dana didnt even have to assume my form she merely used the one she was comfortable with which was an ethereally beautiful young woman and interviewed the maenads while we waited at the village we would not have been able to fly to the maenads anyway it turned out that the oracle was as close to the mountain as we could go by air because the simurgh the huge ancient bird who guarded the mountain and especially the great tree of seeds did not permit other flyers there the maenads had only one talent vicious beauty that did seem to make sense we surveyed the others in the region and went on in the following weeks dana was increasingly helpful both as interviewer and as guard things we had feared before were no longer a threat because it seemed that we had a dragon guarding us or worse in due course we returned to the south village and i made my first substantial report to king ebnez so while there is much of interest in this region of southern xanth i concluded as yet i have found no magiciancaliber talents he nodded gravely there is much of xanth remaining write up your report and save it for the information will surely be useful in the future keep doing the survey until all of xanth has been recorded you are doing excellent work thank you your majesty there is one other thing question quest by all means you wish riches or power no nothing like that i am getting the only thing i truly crave which is information i do have to share it with the oracle but that turns out to be simple enough though their answer was useless to me no i have a plea to make for another person which i fear you will not receive well i will make the effort he said with a gentle smile a demoness is helping us she has facilitated my effort greatly and she saved my life at one point she has a soul and wishes to be rid of it so that she can revert to the normal nature of her kind but to do that she must marry you ebnez had been listening patiently and tolerantly but at this point his jaw went slack he coughed after a moment he recovered himself i am afraid that is out of the question not only am i disinclined to marry this late in life there is a proscription against the association of demons with kings dating from i told her that your majesty but i promised to make her plea if she helped me and she has helped me she really seems to be a very nice creature perhaps some day there will be a king who has the confidence to vacate the proscription it is within the kingly authority but i am not that one i shall tell her i said unsurprised hold he said in his kingly fashion you say she is truly helping you in the survey yes i fear i could not complete it without her and if she receives an absolute refusal she will have no reason to continue the work yes your majesty then it would not be expedient to turn her down absolutely i will lift the proscription to the extent of allowing her to appear in my presence but i will not marry her tell her only that i am considering the matter but is that honest your majesty i mean if you have no intent question quest perhaps she will change my mind we can not be certain what the future holds i realized that this was a good compromise the king had no intention of marrying dana now but perhaps next year he would see it another way dana was certainly winsome enough and had a nice personality thank you i said i shall tell her i had learned another lesson about diplomacy and the ways of getting things done i told her dana was heartened if that term could apply to a creature who had no heart this is more progress than i feared possible she said i shall continue to help you and perhaps i can meet the king when you next report to him i know he has no interest in marrying a stranger so it was we interviewed the fauns and nymphs and the curse fiends of lake ogrechobee and we penetrated the region of madness and interviewed the folk of the magic dust village we discovered a truly unusual creature there a centaurpede like a centaur but with a hundred pairs of legs her name was margaret and she was without price when the dust villagers had to travel somewhere they could all ride a single steed the winged horses were a great help and the unicorns and sometimes the sea horses of the ocean and i loved and needed mare ann both for the survey and as a man but of course she valued her innocence and i understood about that but dana was a great help also and i liked her too and she had no compunctions about innocence if it werent for my conscience and the practical matter of unicorns i would seduce you in a moment she told me candidly i know all about the adult conspiracy and could initiate you into it in approximately ninety seconds but as long as you love mareann and she loves you i will not do it thank you i said somewhat awkwardly i was question quest getting really curious about the secrets that the adults guarded so rigorously and such easy access to them was quite tempting but not if it ruined my relationship with mareann meanwhile we made periodic reports to king ebnez i found many interesting things but no magiciancaliber talents to our mutual regret dana met the king and was very polite to him and he was increasingly nice to her it was possible that he was slowly changing his mind about the prospect of marriage it was said that a demoness could make a man deliriously happy if she chose and dana was eager to do just that for him but he worried about appearances and propriety and just what she would do if she succeeded in getting rid of her soul and remained cautious three years went by and i aged from late fifteen to early nineteen and mareann did something similar dana did not change demons are pretty much eternal we tracked down the human folk living near the dragons and near the centaurs of central xanth and near the five great elements of northern xanth we also interviewed elves and goblins for it turned out that they were of human derivation and had souls and some did have individual magic talents my notes were becoming voluminous and also my collection of useful artifacts my bottle of healing elixir was only the first of a multitude i was filling a room with bottles each containing something magical and moderately wonderful whenever king ebnez needed an item or specialized bit of information he asked me and i was increasingly likely to have a vial of something that answered his need folk were calling me the magician of information and both mareann and king ebnez prevailed on me to hurt no feelings by disabusing them of this status we were in the final stage of the survey going through the isthmus of northwestern xanth when we received a message return to the south village at once alarmed we did so our worst fear was realized king ebnez was dying question quest dana was stricken as much as we were for she had made a significant impression on him and it seemed likely that in another year or so he would relent and marry her and allow her to make him deliriously happy after all that feet that his life was nearing its end didnt matter it only meant that he had less to lose if he was not satisfied with her delirium now it seemed he had waited too long and her long effort would be wasted he insisted on talking to me alone he smiled when he saw me and i tried to smile back but the signs of his demise were on him and dark vultures perched on the roof of his house please your majesty let me give you some healing elixir i urged him then i can go fetch some water from the fountain of youth which i discovered serendipitously in the course of my survey and that will make you young again he shook his head feebly no you must not give the water of youth to any other person not of your immediate family he said use it for yourself only it is not right to interfere with the natural process i had to promise of course it would be a long time before i had any need of such water myself considering my excellent health though i had hoped that mare ann would take some when she got old but the word of a king must be obeyed and besides he was probably making sense i would not give either youth elixir or information about the location of the fountain to any person not of my family but worse was coming have you found a magician no not even any talent close to it you are the only one in xanth i think your majesty then a desperate measure is called for i shall be dead within the hour and xanth must have a king more particularly it must have a king who will carry on the proper traditions of the role and who will continue the good works i have tried to do we have the potential to bring xanth out of the dark age if continuity is maintained question quest yes it must be maintained i agreed the survey was only one of this kings endeavors he was trying to see that every human being had a reasonable livelihood and was secure from the depredations of trolls and dragons he was causing enchanted paths to be made along which folk could walk in peace without molestation already it was possible to travel north and south from the south village a considerable distance safely and houses were being made along these paths so that folk could come in to trade in the village without fear the king hoped that such a network would be extended throughout xanth eventually and i liked the idea too there is so much good to be done so you must live to do it your majesty and just a few drops of elixir no he said showing uncharacteristic anger no my time is done since we have no magician to assume the throne we shall simply have to make one as king i am the final authority on who is and is not a magician in due course we shall have to set up a committee or council of elders for this purpose that is one of the reforms you shall see to i dont understand your majesty indeed i was perplexed and feared he was becoming incoherent i hereby declare he said and coughed again worse than before sounding really bad that you are the magician of information and as such the only person qualified to assume the crown but your majesty i protested stunned i am not his rheumy eye fixed me with its fading glare do you charge me with lying humfrey no of course not the kings word is law but then take the crown use it well until you find another magician to whom to pass it along but i said helplessly take it he said his withered hand clutched mine promise question quest i was stuck for it his glare would not let me go i promise i whispered only then did his eyes close and his grip relax he was dead chapter king i emerged from the death chamber carrying the crown in my hands mareann and dana and the kings attendants stared the king is dead i said i am the new king the magician of information of course an attendant said he was grooming you for it throughout i looked miserably at mareann and dana they knew the truth they could spare me this awful thing by speaking out but both bowed their heads your majesty mareann said dana did not disagree i was indeed stuck for it the burial arrangements were routine in a day good king ebnez was buried and his house was mine but my travail had only begun mareann approached me you must marry she said it is a requirement for kings that is true i agreed and i want to many you there were tears in her eyes king humfrey i can not i love you but i love my innocence more i must depart to free you to marry another question quest no i cried i need you you need my talent with equines she said with much accuracy but if you will marry another quickly then i will stay and serve you i realized that to keep her near me i would have to do as she said but who else can i marry i asked plaintively ahem i looked it was dana demoness suddenly the meaning of the oracles message came clear you have to marry a king and i had to make a demon conquest why did you help me so loyally dana because i love you humfrey she said you did indeed make a conquest of me but you had no idea i would become king you had nothing to gain by loving me indeed i did not she agreed and my conscience prevented me from making my sentiment known to you because i would not want to disrupt your relationship with mareann so i focused on king ebnez and i would have married him had he wished and made him deliriously happy but my true love was always yours so i had more patience with his slow progress than otherwise because it gave me a pretext to continue working closely with you i had never suspected mareann had been the only woman on my mind my heart was numb with the shock of her refusal to marry me i had really appreciated danas help and perhaps had not questioned hermotive because i did not want to disrupt the arrangement i had willfully blinded myself to the obvious and that i realized was dangerous i would have to guard against that in the future especially now that i was king i suppose your soul enables you to love as normal demons can not i said continuing to work it out i was also postponing the question of marriage to a demoness for the moment yes friendship and love became possible for me she agreed and i must say they have their compen question quest sations i was frankly bored much of the time before i got the soul and sad after i had it but loving you has made me happy i still found this hard to accept i was of small stature and not handsome despite my excellent health i had helped mareann when she was injured and i understood about her need to preserve her innocence so the love between us seemed natural but the demoness was a creature as spectacular as she chose to be capable of impressing even a king why should she care about me when didi mean there must have been some event which when we worked together to fight the wolf spiders she said we performed so well jointly you understood how to do it being very intelligent and helped me to choose the right form and then you supported me to make it effective showing your courage i felt really good about that and it was wonderful because i had never felt either good or bad before then at the end you said you thought i did have a soul though we had both forgotten about that in the heat of the battle and we smiled at each other i never smiled at a man without ulterior reason before or had one smile at me who wasnt looking at my body we had true understanding and camaraderie and it was such a thrill and after that i had a similar thrill whenever i was near you maybe thats not love i havent had enough experience to know she was hi her fashion innocent she was old in the ways of the world but young in the ways of love that reassured me i did need a wife very well i will many you i was as yet not completely certain that this was wise remaining cognizant of the business about kings and demonesses but she had certainly done her part and seemed worthy oh thank you humfrey she exclaimed delighted is it all right for me to kiss you now go ahead mareann said without complete grace she had told me to marry someone else but question quest evidently retained feeling for me that gratified me in a shameful way youre betrothed now dana approached me and put her arms around me she was taller than i was but so was mareann she brought her face down and put her lips to mine and kissed me it was quite an experience i had kissed mareann and really liked it but i realized now that our kisses had been properly innocent danas kiss was improperly experienced love might be new to her but the ways of physical expression were highly familiar i discovered that not only did she have remarkably soft and pliable lips she had a tongue and i had never imagined using a tongue that way meanwhile her body was pressing close to me and herher front was making my front tingle i was beginning to get a hint of the kind of delight she was capable of giving a king my doubt was fading i settled into the kingship with perhaps no more than the usual complications there was a ceremony which the regular attendants got me through and folk came from wide and far to pay homage and take my measure and a new wardrobe was made for me the crown was adjusted to fit my head no one challenged my credentials as a magician apparently they accepted king ebnezs judgment maybe they knew as he had that somebody had to be king and that if there was no magician it had to be faked but this aspect bothered me it was mareann who brought me to reality on this score she was always near because as king i needed to ride in state and her ability with all equine creatures remained invaluable so as she introduced me to one of the few regular horses in xanth we talked privately i feel guilty i began about me dont you asked me to marry you and i declined the demoness is a good secondary choice that too thank you but also about the matter of question quest qualification you know i am no magician in fact i may not have a talent at all king ebnez said you were the magician of information the kings word is xanths law so thats what you are you cant change it just because hes dead yes but he needed someone to carry on his good work arent you going to do that yes to the best of my ability but it smacks so much of convenience i believe in the truth and the truth is the truth is that you dont know what your talent is you are smart and you are curious about everything and in the course of the survey you have collected more information and more incidental bottles of magic things than anybody else ever had before and as a result you have more actual power than king ebnez himself had if you need to tally up the number of apples available to feed hungry folk you have only to let your adder out of his bottle and that reptile will add up the total in an instant and it will be exactly correct if one of the monsters under the bed outgrows the bed and even starlight at night is too bright to allow it to come out you can use the darklight you found in northem xanth to flash darkness for it to travel to a larger bed no one else recognized its potential as you did if a maid loves a man who doesnt love her you can give her a few drops of love potion from the bottle you had the wit to collect from that love spring we almost stumbled into not that it would have made any difference to us we were already in love here she paused perhaps wrestling once more with her problem of innocence i knew the feeling ah this is because you have been constantly in search of knowledge and have achieved much who is to say that this is not your magic talent but anyone can look for things i protested weakly but few can find them not only do you seem to question quest find what you look for you find what you arent looking for and recognize it for its potential immediately so maybe thats a subtle talentso who says a talent has to be obvious maybe you werent a magician before but now you are and so you will continue as long as others believe it she was making amazing sense for an innocent still i ventured with one last effort can you prove you are not a magician she demanded i surrendered i could not from this time forward i was the magician of information and my qualms would simply have to find another home i mounted the spirited horse and mare ann told it to make me look good before other folk it was amazing what being mounted did for my appearance i actually seemed kingly dana brought me to another type of reality we were married with due pomp and she was beautiful as only an infernal female can be i still loved mareann and wished she was the one in the wedding gown but the knowledge of danas love was a considerable compensation and i was truly curious about the supposed delights hidden by the adult conspiracy in short i was not exactly suffering the first night of our marriage dana initiated me into the whole of the conspiracy right through the dread ellipsis i had mixed reactions in one sense i thought is that it there just didnt seem to be anything worth concealing from anyone mainly it was the rather straightforward act of signaling the stork and it seemed to me that there ought to be an easier way to do it but in another sense it was like entering a land of perpetual wonder i wanted her to show me the secret again and again and she did so and i knew that she had not been bluffing when she spoke of her ability to make a king deliriously happy but after that there was a barrier between mareann and me for i was a member of the conspiracy and she question quest remained innocent we pretended that nothing had changed but it had the love we had for each other became strained and began to cool and there was nothing we could do about it after a time when i was well established as king and was no longer dependent on her help mareann asked to go to another village to live and of course i agreed it was the quiet end of our romance and it hurt us both that was the first of my several heartbreaks dana did her best to console me and she was very good at it but the underlying sadness remained i was paying a penalty for being king and it was not one that others would understand i had everything except what i had wanted most a relationship with the woman i loved the business of being king was about like the adult conspiracy clothed with immense mystery grandeur and aura but rather ordinary in its private realization it consisted mainly of making longterm decisions about things most folk neither understood nor cared about like crop rotation so that the underlying soil was not depleted ive grown my cherry pie trees here for a generation the old peasant fanner would protest why should i break in a new field from scratch all i want is a better crop right here no use to try to explain that there was only so much magic dust in the soil which the pie trees drew on and that it was becoming exhausted and needed tune to replenish that was not the kind of concept he could handle so it had to be an imperious dictate he would shift locations because it was the will of the king that sort of nonsense he understood it was also largely ceremonial the king was expected to officiate at celebrations to cut the tapeworm at the opening of a new magic path and to express regrets when someone died he also had to maintain a small force of soldiers in case another wave should wash in from mundania though the shield guaranteed that there would be no such thing in practice it was a question quest system for making employment for young men who were unwilling to forage for themselves they got to don uniforms and look nice and they were useful for harassing stray dragons that started bothering villagers of course the dragons soon realized that the soldiers were more show than substance at which point i would have to go there with dragonbane and sprinkle it on the dragons tail so that he would go away dragonbane was such vilesmelling stuff that i had to hold my nose as i uncorked the bottle but it was worse for die dragon who would go into uncontrollable fits of sneezing as long as he smelled it he smelled it as long as any remained on his tail which meant he would finally fry his own tail to get rid of it and then he had to retire for a month or two of healing experienced dragons fled the moment they saw the bottle so it was pretty routine usually the villagers took it as proof of my power as a magician but i knew better the truth is i was soon just about bored into a gourd dana demoness could distract me only so much delightful as her distractions were thus in the guise of inspecting the kingdom i traveled actually i was resuming my quest for knowledge searching out oddments along the way adding to my growing collection this had the effect of enhancing my power as the magician of information so was a good thing i listened to the complaints of villagers throughout the kingdom and did what i could to alleviate them i was surprised when dana who liked to turn invisible and float surreptitiously through villages and eavesdrop on conversations informed me that i was becoming known as good king humfrey i really wasnt accomplishing much but i was listening and responding and apparently that was more than the folk were accustomed to in one village i encountered a young man who was quite smart like me he had a passion for knowledge but unlike me he didnt care unduly about magic the information he craved was historical he wanted to know everything that had happened through the ages of question quest xanth but no one else cared well cared i appoint you royal historian i said question the people about past events and make a compilation of what you learn for the royal records for this was what king ebnez had done for me with my survey of talents and it had been a great employment too bad it hadnt enabled me to find a true magician to inherit the throne incidentally what is your name e timber bram he said so it was that bram commenced what was to prove a significant effort he was the one who defined the dates of xanth that i have used here by his reckoning i became king in the year when i was nineteen years of age very well i would note the dates of the subsequent events of my life it provided a kind of framework that hadnt been there before i was proud of instituting this but i knew that no one else would care people were so uninterested in dates that the task of keeping the holiday calendar had finally fallen on the ogres who were too stupid to get out of it fortunately no one cared to argue about errors with ogres so there were few complaints about two years into my kingship dana had news for me i tried to prevent it humfrey but you were simply too healthy of course im healthy i said i fell in the healing spring if there is anything i have done which you regret tell me and i will undo it she shook her head smiling you can not undo this we have succeeded in summoning a baby boy from the stork well we sent several hundred signals i said one of them was bound to reach the stork demons can dampen out those signals she informed me this i tried to do why because i wanted to remain longer with you you may remain with me as long as you like you question quest have been excellent company and i look forward to many more signals but i fear that a delivery from the stork will complicate things i will be a father and you a mother that is wonderful news she did not argue but i could see that she was pensive fool that i was i did not think to ask her why i was too pleased with the notion of having a son even one who was half demon the storks are very firm on this they will not deliver a fully human baby to a mixed couple i had villages to visit so this time i went alone leaving dana home to await the stork the stork wasnt due for months but delivery dates were never quite certain and it would be a disaster if the stork came while the mother was absent we didnt have any cabbage leaves growing around our house so the baby might be set down anywhere unfortunately this left dana with nothing much to occupy her attention and she took to eating of course she had to eat some and remain solid so as to build up enough milk to nurse the baby milkweed pods were available but it was considered better to do it personally but she ate a lot and became quite fat i didnt say anything not wanting to have a bad scene before the stork arrived and perhaps scare it away but i intended to put her on a diet once the baby was safely with us then the stork did come with a beautiful human demon boy and i discovered disaster we had not understood the whole of the oracles answer we had forgotten danas original question she had wanted to rid herself of her soul now that soul went to the baby and dana was free of it she was abruptly also free of her conscience and her love for me well its been fun humfrey cant think why she said maybe some year ill return for one last good maybe not she used a term which caused the curtains to blush and which i think only an question quest angry harpy would understand it seemed to relate in a derogatory way to the process of stork summoning then she fogged into smoke and drifted away i was left with my halfbreed baby and no wife now i understood somewhat better than before why men were not supposed to associate with demons it was a hard lesson and my second significant disappointment i needed a new wife because the king was supposed to be married and because what i knew about caring for a baby could be tallied on the fingers of one foot as it happened there was a girl recently come of age who was smitten with the trappings of the kingship she always smiled at me when i walked through the south village and lifted her hem in a manner that indicated that she would love to learn something of stork summoning from me i was somewhat soured on storks at the moment but i needed a woman in a hurry would you be willing to adopt my son if i married you i asked her i would adopt an ogret if that was the price of marrying you your majesty she replied so i married the maiden taiwan and she took care of my son dafrey she was really very good about it and i came to like her well enough though it would not be proper to say that i loved her in due course i did do some stork signaling with her but the stork perhaps annoyed by the business with dana refused to acknowledge i cant say i was unduly upset about it perhaps i was afraid that she too would take off if she got a baby of her own i continued to travel because i kept absentmindedly walking into hanging diapers at home my wife was happy to have me travel that left more room in the house in the north village i discovered something truly significant a sixyearold boy who could generate thunderstorms i examined him carefully asking him to make small storms and big ones and he was glad to question quest oblige his mother didnt like him making storms inside the house but was surprised and pleased to see the king taking such an interest in him soon i was satisfied this was a magiciancaliber magic talent i had found my successor as king of xanth of course he would need training and it would be some time before he was ready but it was a great relief to know that i would not be stuck with this chore forever then a peculiar disaster struck it related ironically to my own home village and to my familys farm i had to hurry back to the gap village to get the story from my older brother the tics have mutated humboldt said they no longer wait peacefully for harvesting and for their own clocks now they scoot off on their own and make mischief elsewhere we dont know what to do but youre the magicianking you will know what to do i saw that i was stuck with an awful chore as it turned out awful was far too slight a word for it perhaps a variant of the word the demoness had used would adequately describe my sentiment but of course a king could never utter such an atrocity you see there were not just several mutated tics there were several major families of them each with many members reproducing wherever they found fertile soil that was all over xanth what had started in the gap village quickly spread to each cranny and nook they disrupted every type of human activity and were extremely annoying we started by burning the field humboldt hated to do it but it was the only way to be sure of eradicating the source of the mutant tics the other farmers of the gap village had to do the same to their extreme annoyance i was not called good king humfrey in that region thereafter unfortunately this was ineffective the mutant tics only sprouted again we had not realized that they had already escaped the neighborhood question quest and were now sprouting in the inaccessible jungles all around we had a major infestation i returned to the south village and pondered the matter i had a thinking cap i had found in my prior travels i donned this and cogitated considerably this produced an answer but a difficult one i would have to concentrate on each variety of tic separately and devise a way to eradicate it the process might require years but i was the king so it was my responsibility i decided to capture one of the wild tics so i could bring it home and study it and discover how to deal with its variety i got a net of the type used on the tic farm and a collection of bottles and mounted my trusty winged horse peggy that was a legacy of mareanns association she had told peggy to stay with me as long as i needed her and she was doing so and we got along well perhaps the feeling i retained for mareann communicated itself to the mare and so she was satisfied to be with me or maybe she was just a nice creature she was technically a winged monster but all that is technical is not necessarily true we flew back to the farm because i thought most of the tics should be close by there first i picked up a regular tic to use for comparison then i scoured the region watching for wild tics and managed to spy one i chased it down and netted it it jumped around madly it turned out to be a frantic always rushing around anyone it happened to land on would assume its characteristics and become similarly frantic this one certainly needed to be eliminated i squeezed it into a bottle and put it in my pack i flew home i had a chamber i had set up as a magic lab my main collection of items was there this was where i could work without being disturbed i brought out the bottle the frantic was a mere blur of activity buzzing around inside well i had a cure for that i brought out my vial of slowsand and sprinkled some on the bottle the frantic slowed right down because nothing moves rapidly around slowsand i had question quest to be careful not to get any on me because it would slow whatever part of me it touched there had been a time with the maiden taiwan when some of it had gotten on the bed and it took us two days and nights to get an hours sleep i had had to cancel the effect with some quicksand because it had gotten into the mattress and couldnt be removed now i was more careful with it experience was a solid teacher so now i used tongs to unstopper the bottle and slide the frantic out onto the table where i had a little circle of slowsand i was at normal speed but the tic was slow it looked like an ordinary tic with a round body and little legs the only thing different about it was that it was dashing madly around in slow motion i brought out the regular tic it sat there and twitched in the normal fashion once it got into a clock and encountered the locks it would turn to sound becoming invisible what was the difference between them what i needed to do was to find out how to change the troublesome one back into the normal one i had thought that one might have longer legs or shorter antennae but they looked the same only their actions distinguished them actually i realized it wouldnt do any good to fix this one tic there might be dozens of this variety out there reproducing their kind spreading out across xanth i couldnt catch them all i needed a way to nullify every one of them without having to bring them in to my lab that meant finding a way to change them back in the field so i had a greater challenge than i had thought i struggled with this problem for days i analyzed those two tics every which way but loose their only real difference seemed to be in personality neither of them spoke my language so i could not reason with the frantic and try to get it to change its ways and to persuade others of its kind to do likewise then i started experimenting with elixirs and this question quest finally gave me the key i mixed some healing elixir with some mute powder and doused the frantic with it this slowed it down and it became like the normal tic i added some multiplier potion so that it would keep increasing making more of itself then i let the muted frantic go it would associate with its own kind and each time it did so the other tic would be similarly muted by the multiplying potion i hoped it would take time but in due course all the frantics should be quiet i went out again this time i netted a critic this one was a real trial so youre the nitwit who thinks hes a king it said i wished this hadnt been the one to speak my language you have been doing a despicable job whatever gave you the idea you could govern xanth could do a better job than you with three legs and one feeler tied behind me in fact i dont see why they didnt make me king as i am so obviously superior to you you poor excuse for a gnome this one really needed stifling but the former mix of elixirs powders and potions had little effect on it it criticized the mix with disdain i could make a better concoction than that it said very well you do it i said giving it the ingredients but it refused i shall not soil my feet with common labor in fact i decline to do anything useful it is my business to tell all others what incompetents they are you first among them i could get to dislike this creature if i concentrated it had an attitude problem naturally it thought it was the rest of xanth with the problem and was not about to listen to any contrary view the only contrary views it tolerated were its own i feared i would pop a blood vessel or two before i was able to figure out a formula that would mute this critic for days it berated me for every evil its devious little mind could imagine if i hadnt already known that tics are bugs i would have realized it after being question quest bugged by this one but i finally fashioned a debug potion that turned it from a critic into an antic and that was the best i could do i let it go knowing that once the conversion had spread to all its cousins and they encountered people the wouldbe critics would perform antics instead that was not ideal but this had been one hard nut to crack incidentally i learned years later that some critics had drifted into mundania before being overtaken by antics there they spread recklessly and soon the whole of mundania was infested with them they had no natural enemies you see but they did their best to convert the rest of mundania to enemies they were having some success in this effort the last i heard the next tic i caught was a romantic i considered the matter and finally let it go untreated xanth would not be harmed by its influence so it went from tic to tic there was the politic who infected those with ambition and the lunatic who made folk crazy the heratic who was concerned with matters of faith and the drastic with its desperate measures they would none of them be missed some were interesting and more or less harmless like the aquatic and elastic the gymnastic was one of the nimblest but the acrobatic was similar the hardest one to figure out was the enigmatic the most difficult was the problematic and the wildest was the orgiastic i was annoyed by the bombastic and bored by the pedantic it was useless to argue with the dogmatic or to try to calm the emphatic i managed to turn the spastic into a static the largest was the gigantic and the most interesting the fantastic some were nuisances mainly to children like the arithmetic and grammatic the optic actually enabled folk to see better so i let it go untreated i had trouble distinguishing between the climatic and the climactic but there was nevertheless a significant difference i finally had to catch a characteristic to help me get them straight it turned out that one affected the weather and the other affected question quest great events sometimes these were similar but not always the more tics i treated the harder it became to locate and catch the remaining ones it took me months roaming the countryside to catch up to the rustic and then i didnt treat it as it was pleasantly harmless i had to search the upper floors of several houses before netting the attic and that too was wasted effort as it needed no cure it merely liked to seek out the highest place of a house and stay there getting pleasantly hot and dusty and forgotten when finally i had dealt with the last one i danced madly for joy gotcha a little voice said what you missed me i landed on you instead i am the ecstatic i was satisfied to concede that tics victory i checked into the routine of things and discovered that sixteen years had passed my son dafrey was now seventeen and was serving as an assistant to et bram my wife taiwan had filled out considerably the trinkets she made in her spare time were now to be found all over xanth the storm magician was now twentytwo with his powers at full strength it was time to retire i had never much liked being king and now there was a legitimate magician to succeed me i went to see the storm magician youre it i told him i quit he accepted this with excellent grace arrangements for the orderly transfer of power were made he preferred to remain in the north village and i had no objection the only reason i had remained in the south village was that had i moved home to the gap village no one would have remembered my edicts because of thewell i forget why but im sure i had good reason i assumed that the matron taiwan would accompany me to anonymity but discovered otherwise but all question quest my friends are here she protested i couldnt possibly leave them i yielded to the persuasion of her logic and we severed our marriage i cant say i was heartbroken we had gotten along well enough but we shared few interests and i no longer had a baby to be cared for so it was that i was uncrowned and went my way alone well not quite peggy my winged horse concluded that i still needed someone to look after me so she went along i sincerely appreciated her loyalty it made traveling so much easier chapter roogna a it first i was exhilarated by my freedom from the responsibility of the kingship this lasted about seven minutes i was also depressed by my freedom from marriage for i had become accustomed to the attentions of a woman this lasted about nine minutes then i was bored i decided to do something interesting that i had never had time for before locate the fabulous lost castle roogna it had disappeared from history after king gromden died and king yang moved away from it because of his demon love i now understood rather better than i liked how that sort of mischief happened the plain fact was that the average mans brain dulled when he saw the average woman and turned off completely when he saw a beautiful one he hardly cared what was in her mind except that he preferred it mostly empty a demoness could present the most luscious body and emptiest mind of all i had thought king gromden to have been a fool but now i knew that he was merely a man it was odd how castle roogna had disappeared after being so prominent it was almost as if some power didnt want it to be known but who would object to question quest the knowledge of a castle unless there was a concern that it would be pillaged in the absence of an occupying king well i would not pillage it i merely wanted to see it it was somewhere south of thethesomewhere south of the center of xanth not too far from the west stockade as i understood it because that was where king yang had gone and it was said that he had not gone far but yang had been the magician of spellcrafting who could have made a spell to jump him all the way across xanth so that was not certain something about this chain of thought bothered me and it was my nature to seek out any such bother because it could be a signal of something interesting yang no that wasnt it far side of xanth no south xanth maybe south of what i couldnt remember and that was it i had surveyed all of xanth how was it that part of it was blank in my mind i had no memory of ever being in the center of xanth yet surely i had been there many times in fact i had lived there as a child how could i have forgotten yet it remained blank i could not remember where i had lived as a child peggy fly north i said to my winged steed she turned gracefully in the air and bore north i continued to ponder as was my wont could my forgetting about the center of xanth have anything to do with the general forgetting of castle roogna soon we came to a huge fissure in the ground amazing how could such a thing be here and i not know it the thing was hardly new trees grew at its edge and down in its depths why it would be virtually impossible to travel across xanth lengthwise with this enormous natural barrier in the way peggy do you remember this chasm i asked she snorted no but now i was beginning to remember my home village was on its north side this was thethethe gap chasm it had been here forever or something question quest similar and itno one who didnt live here could there was a forget spell on it now that i was here i was recovering my lost knowledge but when i left it i would forget it again well i could deal with that i brought out my notepad and pencil and made a note gap chasm across central xanth forget spell on next time i thought about what i couldnt remember that note would help but now that i remembered i knew that this was not associated with the disappearance of castle roogna the gap chasm minded its own business i added a note castle roogna not in gap chasm turn south again peggy i said and the horse obligingly did so peggy was my only legacy of mareann but a handsome one i had never sought information about mareann after she left me and that kept my memory of her clean lovely and innocent probably nineteen years later she was no longer lovely and her innocence was somewhat strained an innocent woman of thirtyeight was not nearly as attractive as one of nineteen for reasons that most men understood and most women didnt but i had loved her and loved her yet in diminished degree had things been otherwise where would castle roogna most likely be well if it was unknown it was probably hidden from the air or inaccessible if peggy and i canvassed southern xanth we should either run across it or discover a region we could not explore indeed something like that must have happened when i surveyed xanth before i must have skipped by a region without realizing it that was the place to investigate in more detail we canvassed peggy rather enjoyed it i believe for she lived for flying i found it less delightful for my posterior was getting sore from all the riding and most of the territory we covered was already familiar peggy curved in flight ordinarily i would not have noticed for i trusted her judgment but my recent experience with thethesomething or other had alerted question quest me to unnoticeable things and my attention focused why had she curved when our normal pattern should have carried us straight forward i saw no storm cloud or dangerous mountain and no dragon was aloft nearby i was about to tell her to straighten out and fly right but i really didnt feel like arguing the case there was nothing interesting ahead another warning nag bothered me i was interested in everything how could i find any unknown thing uninteresting my talent was curiosity this just did not figure peggy fly over that boring jungle to the side i said she turned with an equine sigh and headed into itonly to turn away again soon there was now no doubt there was an aversion spell here just as there was a forget spell on the gap chasm i had no memory of such a chasm but trusted my note an aversion spell would have similar effect passing folk would not remember the region because they never entered it i tried to have peggy fly into it again but she began to sweat and her ears turned back and i knew she was becoming most uncomfortable she did not have my ornery nature she was a relatively innocent creature of the wild who stayed out of trouble by avoiding aversive things it would not be kind to push her further land and i will go on alone i said if i do not return you are free to do as you will i thank you for your years of loyal assistance she cocked an eye at me not liking this but descended and let me dismount she folded her wings and waited i assembled my pack which peggy had been carrying i did not relish the notion of proceeding alone on foot into an aversive jungle but i hoped that dragons and other monsters would also be avoiding it happy grazing i told the mare she pondered the matter then lowered her head to the grass which was rich here at the edge of the jungle question quest she had plenty to eat that wasnt her concern she knew i was being foolish and she felt guilty for letting me do this but she knew that she would have to let me get my own scrapes and learn my own hard lessons she was a very maternal mare i turned and plunged into the jungle i knew where to go because it was where i felt least inclined to go it had been a long time since i had done anything i less wanted to do yet perversely that was why i wanted to do it my orneriness paid off because after a while the aversion eased it was like diving into cold water the first shock was the worst i still did not like what i was doing but i could tolerate it i took things easy and kept going then i saw something interesting it was a snail it was racing across a glade then i saw another moving almost as quickly this was remarkable i had never seen snails move so rapidly i realized that this was that rarest of all sports events a crosscountry snail race normally folk did not watch one of these from start to finish unless obliged to for some reason such as punishment but these swift snails would complete the course in a fraction of the time regular snails would the region darkened and in a moment it was as black as night there were even stars overhead sailing along in their courses they reached the other side of the welkin and came to rest then the sun came up again something nagged my mind slowly it came to me why was everything moving so fast and slowly the answer came because i had slowed down i looked down in the time it took the sun to travel from quarter sky to half sky sure enough i was standing on a patch of sand that would be slowsand the world was proceeding at its normal pace it question quest seemed rapid to me only because my perspective had changed the aversion spell was not stopping me now i was encountering another type of magic someone had strewn patches of slowsand around and i had foolishly stepped into one i could step out of it of course but i would be a long time doing it meanwhile any other kind of mischief could be approaching i could try to step backward out of it or forward there was three times as much sand in front that would delay me a long time but if i retreated i might still have this barrier to traverse fortunately i had the remedy i had collected many useful things during my survey of xanth and during my tenure as king i had a fair assortment of them here in my pack i reached over my shoulder and fished for a bottle i wasted no time but the land darkened and brightened twice more while i did this i found my quicksand and sprinkled some on my feet it counteracted the slowsand and i was able to step forward out of the patch but i had lost three days fortunately i wasnt on a schedule as far as i knew and i wasnt hungry because my internal processes had been slowed too still i would have to be more careful i now had little doubt that i was in the vicinity of castle roogna i remembered that king roogna whose talent was adapting magic to his purpose had adapted many things to the defense of the castle his talent was similar to that of the later king ebnez except that roogna dealt with living magic while ebnez adapted inanimate magic of course sand needed no adaptation all it needed was to be there and it had its eifect how the king had managed to move it here far from its natural habitat i hesitated to guess but it had just about stopped my advance well onward time was not of the essence but peggy might be getting impatient for my return i remembered how so long ago mareann and i had spent question quest the night in the werehouse and been taken far afield in fact all the way across thetheacross somewhere to the south village the poor unicorns must have dutifully returned to discover only a bare patch of ground where the house had been had they neighed soulfully thinking us forever lost was peggy now fretting similarly having hoped for my return well within three days i regretted putting her through that i brushed by a nondescript bush there was a faint calling soundand suddenly my gut boiled up i grabbed for my trousers and yanked them down barely in time to let me squat my nether innards blew out their contents then i felt at ease and i realized what had happened i had touched a nature bush and been called by it this was its way of getting fertilizer a harmless ploybut had i not reacted quickly i would have soiled my trousers and been in a rather awkward situation i had been careless again i reassembled myself and stepped forward again there were other bushes but not of the same type still they were unfamiliar and i preferred to avoid them there was no telling what kind of magic they might have but there was a halfway solid line of them the leaves of one touching the leaves of its neighbors i could not pass without touching them so i took a running jump and sailed over them my excellent health had never abated and i could clear hurdles that would have been insurmountable in my youth before i fell in the healing spring the tip of one stem touched my foot suddenly i was spinning in the air tumbling out of control i came down turning like a wheel rolling down a grassy slope toward a muddy pond i had touched a tumbleweed i managed to stop my roll just before plunging into the mud i lifted my faceand there was someones bottom huge and smelly i wrinkled my nose against the odor of rotting cheese question quest then i got a better view and realized that this wasnt a mans bare posterior but a rounded stone with a vertical crevice in fact it was a chink of moon rock evidently fallen from the moon some time ago because the green cheese was far from fresh it had mooned me as was its nature i got up and turned my back on the moonstone i discovered that i had tumbled farther than i had supposed i was not only near mud i was surrounded by it and beyond it was a ring of open water in fact i was on an island in a pond how could i have gotten here without getting wet then i realized that this was another obstacle on the way to the castle there was an enchantment of some sort that was trying to stop me or turn me back now it had dumped me on this island possibly by flipping me through the air it wasnt trying to hurt me just to prevent me from going forward probably if i decided to give it up as a bad job i would have little trouble making my way out that explained why the castle had been forgotten someone wanted it left alone but who there werent any magicians or sorceresses in xanth except for the storm king and no other person would have either the desire for such privacy or the power of magic to enforce it i had been more or less bulling through and more or less not getting anywhere much it was time to start using my mind which was a good one when i gave it three quarters of a chance how could i learn more about this situation so as not to blunder worse after all i didnt want to have to face peggys i told you so snort i sat down on the moon rock which emitted more strong cheese smell in protest i took off my pack and rummaged through it for my small magic mirror i gazed at it for a moment considering whether to use it i remembered the problem associated with it this was an excellent mirror i had found in a de question quest serted graveyard most graveyards were deserted of course for some reason living folk did not care to spend much time in them but this one was really deserted even the ghosts were gone i wasnt sure what could frighten off a ghost and had hesitated to pursue the matter despite my curiosity there was probably excellent reason for the fright so i had picked up this little mirror what is your nature i had asked it first i am a magic mirror who can answer any question put well this was an excellent find but i was suspicious of the circumstance under which i had found it so i questioned it again what are the counterindications of your use i answer each question less accurately than the last for each possessor that gave me pause i could see that a living person might have used this mirror repeatedly not thinking to inquire about its liabilities and had his good fortune become bad fortune as the mirror gradually shaded from truth to lies finally it must have given him an answer that killed him such as perhaps telling him that there was a fortune here when in fact there had been a ghoul lurking in its favorite place that would account for the mirror being left in the graveyard but could this also account for the vanished ghosts yes because they could have addressed the mirror as it lay on the ground near their graves and they could have entertained themselves by asking it many questionsand finally it could have told them a ghost story which led them to a ghost town from which they had been unable to escape so i had asked this mirror no more questions but i had saved it because it was probably still fairly accurate for me when it became hopelessly inaccurate i could give it to someone else with due warning i had asked it only two questions how fast did its accuracy decline if i asked it how to get safely to question quest castle roogna and it gave me an answer that was mostly good but omitted news of one deadly threat what then i decided to wait for a situation where the accuracy of the answer would be more evident there were too many imponderables at the moment so perhaps i had wasted my time but that was my nature to pause every so often and reassess my situation it would be better if i did my pausing before getting into trouble so that i could assess instead of reassess but such wisdom and caution came only with hard experience i was not yet nearly as conservative as i would become in my maturity it had been better actually when i was married or with a female companion mareann had sort of nudged me in right directions and dana had always given me good advice while she had her soul and maiden taiwan had put things together for me very well even peggy my winged horse had guided me by significant wiggles of her ears when i threatened to do something of more than ordinary stupidity it had been a long tune since i had been truly on my own and by an odd coincidence the same time since i had been unusually thoughtless it was evident that i needed management in fact i probably needed another wife but after one love and two marriages i was not eager to do it again not unless i could have both together i really wished in retrospect that mareann had been willing to forgo her innocence and marry me but she had preserved it and the last i had heard of her she was in the business of providing mares for villages she would summon a suitable female horse for a settlement who would handle its affairs with such extreme discretion that they seemed nonexistent unicorns were able to serve only childrens settlements but any other mare could kick things off welt enough it seemed that every village wanted a competent mare the mare of the west stockade was said to have real horse sense but how could i have that where was the woman question quest whom i could both love and marry someone who was lovely without being determinedly innocent or of demon origin or dedicated to status rather than the man where was the potential great love of my life i lifted the mirror putting it away i caught the flash of an image in it the face of a beautiful young woman with a bright red rose in her hair i quickly straightened out the mirror and looked more closely but the image was gone the thing had been teasing me yet this was a questionanswering mirror and it could not do other than answer a question correctly or incorrectly i had asked it no question so how had it flashed me a picture i cogitated a bit realizing that there was a missing element here by and by i ran it down i had been thinking of my ideal woman i had been holding the magic mirror in my hand the thing must have flashed me a picture of that woman what the mirror wanted of course was to tempt me into asking a question the more questions it could make me ask the less accurate it would become until it became useless to me this was its way of getting rid of me either by giving me bad answers or by getting given away it wont work i said i wont fritter away what accuracy remains in you by asking an irrelevant question once i locate castle roogna and am satisfied then i can look for that woman i dont want to know about her now when the information may be at the expense of something i may need to know to save my life so stop trying to distract me you toobright piece of glass bold words but in fact that glimpse had struck through to my heart and i wanted to know who that woman was would i really meet her at some time in the future or was this a false image i was tempted to give up this foolish quest for castle roogna and go in search of the woman what mischief that mischievous mirror had done to my fancy question quest well on thinking was not doing me much good after all i fished out a repulsive spell that would protect me from attack by serpents allegories basilisks dragons and anything else of the reptilian persuasion i found another that guarded against insects of every type another that made fish lose their appetite and one to wilt plants from innocent poke berries to the huge deadly kraken weed one more that would cause mammals below the humanoid level to retreat in disgust that would spare me the awkwardness of bumping into a hypotenuse or worse finally a spell to spook birds from the cutest little hummingbirds through the ugliest big roc the thing was i could not know what threats lurked in the deep mud and water and did not care to find out the hard way so i guarded against them all it was a shame to expend so many spells at once when perhaps none were necessary but it would be foolish to gamble with my life i took off my clothes wadded them into my pack held it high and waded into the mud i was prepared for any creature that might wish to molest me in the water of course elves gnomes trolls ghouls and ogres were humanoid but i hadnt seen any of these in this vicinity and i did have other spells that would be effective against them this was the advantage of collecting magic things it had occurred to me that some of them might eventually be useful the mud sucked up around my feet and ankles and then pulled back with a disgusted sizzle the repulsive spells were affecting the small creatures lurking within it and the reaching roots of plants i continued slowly giving the whole mud puddle time to spread the word satisfied that most creatures would prefer to get out of my way before i got to them my leading foot came down into a sudden hole and suddenly i was waist deep in mud yes that was a standard ploy of mud puddles they tried to look shallow then they would snare someone who believed it question quest but it did this wallow no good because nothing would touch me i forged on through the mud until it thinned and became muddy water i was now chest deep and my toes were sliding along the bottom with luck i wouldnt encounter another hole i hoped this muck had learned the futility of that device so i could slowly forge through and out and finally scramble onto the far bank and be on my way toward the castle which probably wasnt very far away now for somewhere in the course of my pondering a background throught had been percolating and now it was rising slowly to the surface of my mind where it could be seen it was this it might be the castle itself that was trying to keep folk out king roogna had adapted a lot of living magic around the castle and in the course of several centuries that magic could have coalesced into a halfway unified effort without king roogna to tell it no it had decided that any person who was not him was to be kept out it had gotten quite effective and i might be the first person to overcome it that would be very nice then something caught my ankle and pulled what was this my assorted spells should keep all enemies at bay i looked down but could see nothing in the swirling opacity this water was clear as mud by no coincidence now something was tugging on my other ankle it did not feel like a tentacle it was more like a webbed foot then i realized what it was my spells had not included the amphibians this was an undertoad a waterdwelling toad that crept along the bottom and hauled waders under here i was with my hands occupied holding up my packful of clothes and spells which i didnt want to get wet and this thing was out to draw me down and drown me i tried to get away but when i lifted one foot the question quest other was jerked out and i plopped down i held the pack straight aloft and kicked my feet violently managing to get one down onto reasonably firm muck my head broke the brown surface matted with bits of seeweed that must have gotten lost in this pond normally seeweed kept a sharp eye out for the sea and draped itself over seeshells help i gasped involuntarily as there was another tug on my foot the undertoad was only playing with me soon it would get serious and drag me down for longer man a mere dunk a lot longer a man appeared at the bank he was purple he caught an overhanging branch with one hand and extended the other to me he caught me by a wrist and drew me toward him just in time for my feet were going out again the toad hauled harder not understanding why i wasnt going down the purple man continued to pull me to the shore in a moment he was joined by a green man and the two of them got me up and out of the water forcing the toad to let go lest it be brought to the surface i had escaped with my pack undunked my collection of spells complete thank you i gasped i needed that anything to help another colored person the purple man said there i realized who my benefactors were there were some folk whose colors were different from others and those of the rarer hues tended to seek their own company because the majority sometimes made fun of them they had evidently mistaken me for one of them because i was now mud and seeweed colored how would they react when they learned that i wasnt that i was not one of the guardians of this region but someone trying to sneak in i thought about it for a third of a moment and concluded as usual that honesty was best though they would probably throw me back in the pond im not question quest look theres a beach head green exclaimed purple and i looked to the side there indeed was a head forming in the sand this might be little more than a mud puddle but it seemed to have a number of oceanic attributes quick fetch a beach comber purple cried they charged into the jungle foraging for combers i had to admit that the beach heads hair was rather messy so it was appropriate to comb it out it was just my luck that the head had manifested right at this time i decided that three would be a crowd as far as beach head combing was concerned i marched on in the direction i hoped the castle was interesting that there were human beings here for colored people were human despite the claims of some they differed only in their hues apparently these ones had had trouble getting along elsewhere so had accepted work here hi the region that other folk avoided it was too bad that they were not given the equal chance they deserved i squeezed through some foliageand was abruptly facing a young blue woman i remembered that i remained naked my clothes remained in my pack fauns might run unclothed but i was no faun and this was no nymph she was fully clothed i opened my stupid mouth i uh where is the beach head she inquired i have combs that way i said pointing to my rear let me rephrase that i pointed back the way i had come thank you brown she said and dashed on i started to breathe a sigh of relief but i had gotten no further than si before blue paused glancing back her gaze flicked to my midsection she opened her pretty mouth by the pond i clarified purple and green are already there she nodded and ran on i breathed my gh completing my sigh question quest then i looked down at myself i was not as exposed as i had thought several thick strands of seeweed were hanging from the region the woman had been looking at like a codpiece perhaps i should get dressed now but my body remained caked with mud and that would ruin my clothes there seemed to be no suitable trees nearby so i could not get a new suit i decided to compromise by fashioning the seeweed into a minimum loinpiece that would have to do until i found water in which to wash but now night was closing in around me and soon it would catch me i would have to find a place to sleep i was too tired to struggle on through darkness my repulsive spells would protect me through the night but i still needed somewhere comfortable to lie down i was in luck again i spied bedrock a nice big section of it projecting from the ground i went and touched it with one hand it was genuine no illusion and wondrously soft it was perfect there was even a blanket tree nearby with a fine heavy blanket just waiting to be harvested that would ward away the chill of evening nicely i fished in my pack for a meal ticket as i had not eaten all day i tore the ticket in half and the pieces formed into a fine loaf of bread and a flask of drink i popped the cork and lifted the flask to my mouth it turned out to be soft drink which was fine i did not care to tackle hard drink right now because that had the side effect of making it hard for a person to keep his balance i completed my meal and lay on the bedrock i bounced a little enjoying the feel of the inner springs probably they contained more soft drink but i preferred to let them be if i bounced too hard they might squirt out and the bedrock would lose some of its softness i relaxed then the image of that face in the mirror returned to me i knew that the mirror had no certain obligation to question quest show the truth especially since i had not actually asked it a question it might have been the image of the most beautiful woman the mirror had seen in the past fifty years and she could now be buried in that cute little graveyard where i had found the mirror i suspected that the mirror didnt like me so this might be its cruel joke it was probably just trying to bug me to deprive me of my peace of mind until i had to play its game and ask about the woman i had known that ail along but if that was its game it was working but i refused to give the mirror the satisfaction of knowing how effective its ploy had been i simply let that image be in my mind enjoying it i knew that there was a whole lot more to know about a woman than just her face and i hated being so moved so foolishly but in this respect i was a typical man so i would complete my present mission locate castle roogna then see what to do about that woman assuming she existed then i slept in the morning i got up used another meal ticket they were quite handy when camping outlooked for water again but only blundered into another nature bush thus i did not complete the particular function i had sought i would just have to get clean when the opportunity came before me was a dense forest of large trees now at last i was in familiar territory as it were for i knew that castle roogna was surrounded by just such trees if these moved their branches to intercept an intruder i stepped forward the trees on either side of the avenue i was going toward swung their branches around to bar the way there was no doubt of it now this was what i was looking for excellent i had come prepared for this i had not known that there were other defenses around the castle but the orchard was part of the history that e timber bram had written up in fact it was his history that had question quest reminded me of this missing aspect of xanth and aroused my everready curiosity i retreated removing my pack i brought out a vial of elixir and anointed myself with it this was a familiar potion it made the wearer smell familiar since trees neither saw nor heard very well as a rule they depended on ambience the general odor and attitude of the creature who approached if they smelled cold iron in the possession of an evilsmelling man they became defensive because the thing they hated most was the axe i approached again whistling this time the branches gave way before me i acted and smelled familiar when it came right down to it trees were generally not the smartest creatures in xanth but they did excellent service protecting the grounds i came to the inner orchard where there were all manner of fruit nut pie and other useful trees surely the greatest collection of them in xanth because they had been assembled by king roogna it was a lovely place and looked surprisingly well kept considering that it had been neglected for almost three centuries technically from when magician yang assumed the throne and left the castle until now it looked just as if someone had been tending this orchard yesterday roogna had certainly been a competent magician now i came to the grand old castle itself what a sight it was roughly square with mighty square turrets at each corner and substantial round ones midway along the walls it was surrounded by a formidable moat to my amazement i saw that the water was clear not scummy with neglect and there was a moat monster there could it be that castle roogna was occupied this was astonishing how could it be occupied yet forgotten i walked up to the edge of the moat a monster serpent lifted its head out of the water and hissed at me question quest my serpent repellent had worn mostly off by this time but i had more if i needed it then the drawbridge cranked down and landed with a clank the portcullis lifted the gate opened a woman appeared looking tiny amidst the huge fortifications she was evidently a princess for she wore a small gold crown set with tiny pink pearls and pink diamonds there was a rather large square shaped pink crystal at her bosom her hair was like dewbedazzled rose petals her skin was so creamy it seemed almost possible to drink it and her eyes were shades of leafy green she was attired in a lownecked gown made of translucent full silk gauze in wide stripes of deep rose and stripes of cream silk and cloth of gold her slippers and pantaloons were cloth of gold too and seemed to be fastened together with delicate thorns her long cape and hood were of dated design but excellent quality heavy watered silk of deepest rose color embroidered in seed pods made of pearls musical shards of pink crystals and small pieces of rosecolored jade carved in the shape of rose buds there was a frog closure of shimmering gold in the shape of a living frog prince these were all pretty good signs of royalty it was the woman of the mirror every bit as lovely in life as in image and the rest of her was as aesthetic as her face dont hurt him souffle she said to the moat monster i know you cant let him in but ill go out to meet him the huge serpent nodded and sank slowly back out of sight it was evident that he regarded her as the mistress of the castle that was another excellent recommendation because moat monsters generally made very sure of their employers it just would not do to make an error and swallow the proprietor instead of an intruder it was against the code of guardianship then she walked across the bridge toward me i remembered that i was garbed in mud and a seeweed loin covering i had had no idea that i would thus abruptly encounter the woman of my fancy i tried to back away question quest but came up against a nearby gallantree that prevented me from withdrawing from the princess exquisite presence uh hello i said feeling very little of the intelligence i was supposed to have hello humfrey she said i am the princess rose somehow i had known that would be her name but how had she known mine uh i think i love you she continued blithely and that presents a problem i am here to marry a magician who will become king while you are the reverse a king who will become a magician castle roogna is most upset but i think we can make it work if you are willing how did she know so much about me even that i wasnt a true magician but had been king how could she speak of love when we had only just met uh then she smiled at me and all my doubt wafted away i was in love chapter rose i it was a bleak hour in the history of xanth things had started to decline during the reign of king gromden who had been seduced by a demoness and sired a halfbreed named threnody who was banned from castle roogna lest it fall asunder she married gromdens successor king yang therefore king yang set up residence away from castle roogna to the castles chagrin he governed xanth from the west stockade four years later threnody suicided and became a ghost renee in life she had been banned from castle roogna but in death she was able to enter it and she kept company with her true love jordan the ghost king yang not one to bemoan spilled milk pods remarried and two years later sired a son the son lacked magicianclass magic so could never be king he was established at a separate estate becoming lord bliss he grew up and married the lady ashley rose and their child was princess rose pax of bliss her grandfather was an evil king and her father an indifferent man and xanth was sinking further into its dark age but rose was a really sweet child she had a talent for growing roses and they were everywhere around question quest her a rose by another name did not smell as sweet as the rose that rose grew when rose was just fourteen her grandfather yang died he had been evil but healthy his sudden demise was a shock another magician muerte a fid took the throne there was a suspicion that this fid had poisoned yang for his talent related to alchemy and he could make potions do sinister things he was the most evil man known in xanth but there was no proofand who would dare accuse the king so those who had misgivings kept them mostly to themselves and muddled on they really didnt expect much better from a dark age good kings limited their tenures to bright ages lord bliss being the son of the former king and a halfway decent man with a wholly decent wife did grumble a bit that was perhaps his mistake a grumble or two escaped the house and may have managed to reach the ear of the king it was an evil ear covered over by skin so that it did not project from his head and most of what it heard was bad the kings malicious mind may have started to percolate and the results of such percolations were inevitably foul the longer that brain oozed the worse it festered until at last the awfulness had to find its nefarious expression when rose was sixteen her father received a poisonpen letter the poisoned thorn fell out of the envelope and pricked his hand when he opened it gotcha the text of the letter said it was unsigned but only the king knew how to make such poison so rose had a notion who might have sent it but no proof there just never seemed to be proof for what most of xanth knew was true the poison was slow but sure at first lord bliss merely slowed down a bit while his hand turned deepening shades of purple but then he slowed down a bit more and the pain of it showed around the edges of his face despite his effort to conceal it rose dedicated question quest herself to helping him for her mother was busy trying to maintain the household as autumn waned in a burst of rosescented air and waxy white orange blossoms rose knew that her father did not have much time left each day the ruby and garnet colored sands of time slipped lower in the grandfather clock that clock would stop entirely never to run again on the day he died lord bliss was resigned to his fate if he had any regrets at all it was that he was leaving behind one royal descendent his daughter the princess rose she could never be king because she was female and lacked sufficient magic but she deserved better than what she faced even now as she sat beside his sickly bedside she was a great comfort to him and to the monster under the bed the monster was a childhood friend who had returned to keep him company during his last hours the young and the old were similarly close to the ends of their lives going in different directions and monsters related well to that his dear and loving daughter kept her nimble fingers ever busy with her needle working with the yarns and threads and needlepoint he took her silence as a subtle reproach to the selfishness of his deep and abiding love for her for rose should have been married long ago a beautiful princess could readily find a match by the time she was seventeen but she had remained single to better dedicate herself to his welfare now she was twenty the blush of her youth past yet he had been unable to part with her this child he loved above all people and it was evident that she returned the sentiment but he could not forestall death further my daughter he rasped with what was left of his dying breath you must marry but i fear that marriage the king rose was appalled the king wouldnt marry me she protested yes he wouldto secure his seeming legitimacy question quest you are of the blood of the genuine king your grandfather was an evil man but he had a good side king fid has none he may seek to stifle objections to his terrible reign by requiring the support of the most beautiful nice and innocent princess available father she protested blushing in a beautiful nice and innocent fashion you must hide from the king he continued only my life can protect you and it is almost done the moment i am gone you must go tooto where the king can not find you yes of course dear father she agreed chilled then lord bliss expired rose knew it was so because the big clock stopped ticking she covered his face with the sheet and went to tell her mother about this and her need to hide but as she did so two royal soldiers walked up to the door they had evidently been listening for the clocks final tick and lock no rose cried but lady rose was already opening the door not realizing we have come for the princess rose pax of bliss the men said but she has done nothing bad in her life the lady rose protested precisely the king wishes to see her so it was that rose had to go with the kings three horsemen of hate fraught with trepidation she had had no idea the king would act so swiftly in fact before the past hour she had had no idea he even knew of her as other than nothing all too soon she was brought before king muerte a fid his presence was as ugly as his name he was known as a blackhearted creature who delighted in giving pain he would have oozed evil from his pores had he had any pores he derived his energy from the chaos that war and similar mischief brought his mouth was a cruel slit he normally opened it only to lie belittle or harshly criticize it was said that when he lost control and began to rant bellow and question quest scream his eyes would turn yellow and sparks would fly from them while noxious fumes issued from his nostril slits the prevailing theory was that he was the unnatural bastard son of a priestess who was into a lewd stage act with welltrained reptiles it was quietly bruited about that no stork had brought him all of them being too revolted by his aspect he had been delivered by a large basilisk with a clothespin on its nose rose had not believed any of that of course but now gazing into his cold black doublelidded eyes she began to believe she felt her innocent girlish heart thudding in her throat and feared there would be an echo from the walls the king was naked to the waist on his head below a cap of greasy black curls he wore a thin spiked crown of some unnatural metal perhaps because gold would have eroded from the contact of that flesh his skin gleamed everywhere with shades of purple matching the hues of lord blisss thornpricked hand glowing crystals were fastened to his feet his chest his neck his face and his tail on his curls more crystals glimmered like baleful eyes diamonds and purple dragon seeds he smiled and this was worse we shall be married next week when the preparations have been made he said too bad your father will not be able to attend her worst fear had been realized marriage to this monster would be worse than death that realization gave her a perverted kind of courage it is customary to ask the lady first she said her voice sounding marvelously false ie cool and controlled his eyes narrowed for an instant into snakelike slits oh did i forget that technicality rose pax of bliss will you consent to marry your king she nerved herself for her ultimate act of defiance she opened her mouth and forced out the dread word no question quest his lack of surprise was chilling you will return for the night to your home to reconsider your response in the morning you will have your personal belongings packed and ready for transport here he turned and swept away literally his tail made a sweep of the floor stirring up an irritated cloud of dust oh mother what is to become of me rose wailed when they were alone at home she had hardly been conscious of her trip back doubt indecision misgiving and uncertainty swirled around her pretty person drawing it inexorably down into a gloomy quandary where brooding monsters of despair lurked to have to marry the kingsurely death would be kinder than this your father and i had thought to dress you as a farmers daughter and place you in a distant village the lady ashley rose said but now that is impossible for the king with ruthless cunning will have the paths watched we may trick him for an hour or even a day but not for longer he will know if any farmer acquires a sudden grown daughter no we can not hide you among the people and you would not like the life of a peasant maid anyway the local yokels would treat you exactly as the king proposes to treat you there is only one recourse i will take you to the single place where the king can not go where is that mother it had not occurred to rose that there might be some escape other than death but the idea appealed to her castle roogna but that has been lost since grandfather deserted it no only largely forgotten your father and i have kept the memory but we did not want to send you there because there is a problem a problem mother worse dian the one we face with the king it did not seem that such a thing could be possible but roses confidence in goodness had been question quest severely shaken and she feared that there might indeed be a worse horror whose very mention might further pollute her maidenly innocence no hardly worse than that it is that i can not accompany you there and you can not leave it of your own volition but that would be a prison yet she was heartened for to be imprisoned alone would be better than to be imprisoned with the king at least her tender body would not be savaged by his constantly evil gaze of a sort dear you will be excellently cared for for you derive from the blood of the last legitimate king as i do not but you will be alone until a good magician comes to claim you and make you his queen of xanth that may be some time unfortunately time how long rose was continuing to brighten faintly good care a good magician to marry that should be worth waiting for her mother shrugged perhaps ten years perhaps longer we do not know it depends on the magician but if i grow old he will not want me to be his queen she suffered a distressing mental picture of a tall handsome robust young magician striding up to the castle to discover a wizened old ancient hag of a maid she could hardly blame her fantasy man for his reaction it was well known that a womans quality depended on her youth ten years would make her thirty and at that moment her prospects would brutally decline no woman had a right to pass thirty unless she was already married and even then it was chancy some survived it with a certain grace as had her mother but they never spoke of it you will not grow old my dear now dress like the lowliest peasant for we must sneak you rapidly out of here rose was unable to question her mother further understanding the need for haste she dressed in the most ragged and dirty clothing she could find but she still looked too pretty for her own good her face shone question quest with muted beauty her body pushed the shirt out here and here and the skirt out there and they had to stuff her midriff with material to make her slender waist look ordinary finally her mother brought out the scissors and threatened her glorious swirling rosepetalhued hair rose screamed no mother anything but that for it would hurt her physically to cut her hair she knew because she had severed a lock of it once as a child and the cut end had oozed pained sap and the rest of the hair had darkened to brown for a day in distress her mother sighed it would be a terrible shame i agree i shall do what else i can she braided her daughters long tresses and bound the braids in a circle around her head and poured ashes over them this succeeded mainly in making the ashes pretty finally she applied a battered old mans hat jamming it down over the works she smudged some dirt on roses sweet red cheeks rose looked in the mirror she looked almost merely ordinary now if not inspected too closely it would have to do maybe she could hunch over to enhance the effect they looked out the window there was a soldier watching the house it seemed that the king was alert for attempted escape that was of course the way his sinister mind worked your father bless his bones anticipated this lady ashley said in an hour the men will come to carry him away in his coffin you must be brave brave her mother led her to the room where the coffin had been set lord bliss lay there in state he seemed almost to be sleeping but the ravages of the poison remained on him and the atmosphere of death hung close rose felt her tears coming for a brief time the dawning horror of her own situation had eclipsed that of his but now she knew how terrible it was to lose question quest the one who had loved her most all because her dear father had grumbled legitimately about the terrible king and a grumble had escaped to reach the evil royal ear and delve into the dire royal mind rose glanced at the clock but of course it no longer operated her world now seemed timeless in an awful way lady ashley touched the base of the coffin a panel slid aside there was a shallow chamber beneath the main compartment in there rose asked appalled it is the one place they will not look her mother said grimly rose knew it was true she nerved herself and squeezed into the chamber and the lady ashley slid the panel back shutting her in there was a small pillow for her head and a wan bit of light filtered in from a crevice those were the only comforts she had do not despair my daughter rose would have jumped had there been room it was no voice which had spoken rather it was just a thought squeezing down from the corpse immediately above her it was a grisly business but the thought did reassure her even in his death her father had a care for her welfare he would help her to escape the king in fact instead of feeling worse she was feeling better because of this realization she must have slept for suddenly she woke to the jolting of the coffin it was being picked up and carried away her mother must have had the bearers come in for it one to each corner and two more for the sides strong men who would not notice the extra weight or perhaps trustworthy men who would not say anything if they did notice she heard the hard breathing of the men as they bore the burden and the voice of the lady ashley giving them instructions the coffin lurched out of the house question quest and into the village it passed a soldier who laughed callously what your fair daughter is not attending the burial maybe ill go into that house and keep her some company haw haw do that the lady ashley responded evenly and in the morning when the king learns the soldiers laughter cut off so suddenly it was as if a sword had been run through his gut that was of course a far kinder fate than what the king would arrange if the soldier interfered in any way with the kings pleasure no one would go near that house not even to verify roses presence there for fear of being put under suspicion the kings suspicion was deadly too there is a onetime enchanted path from here to castle roogna her fathers thought came follow it without fear for though there are monsters along it none will harm you when you are challenged state your name and business and you will be allowed to pass do not turn back for then the spell will be broken and you wilt be lost indeed thank you my dear father rose said without voice she had first thought he was helping her even in death now she knew that he had planned this in life and set up his death so as to enable her to be saved the love she bore him was returned and death had become an instrument of help rather than a cruel separation still she wished there had been some other way had she known the nature of the poisonpen letter in time she would have stolen it and buried it unopened thank you beloved daughter they came to the burial place the spades the lady ashley said sounding irritated did no one bring the spades we shall fetch them one of the men replied he seemed somehow unsurprised that such a vital detail had been neglected and of course it did not require all six men to fetch the spades question quest then the panel slid open quickly before they return the lady ashley said rose scrambled out farewell my darling in this manner i repay a bit of the care you so generously lavished on me i know you go to great love a long time hence farewell beloved father rose whispered a tear in her eye again the lady ashley hugged her i must remain here for the burial but you i know mother and what of this wonderful woman left bereft of husband and daughter doomed to live out her declining life alone roses other eye flowed a tear down that trail it leads around the village when you see an unfamiliar path with a slight glow follow it without hesitation go before the men return farewell beloved momer rose disengaged and set off down the trail not daring even to look back already a man was returning with a shovel she recognized him but hoped he would not recognize her masked as she was in dirt she hunched her shoulders and tried to walk in the manner of a boy crudely instead of keeping her natural delicate gait it seemed to work for he did not give her a second glance then she saw a bit of a glimmer on the ground she was about to pass it by before realizing what it was she turned quickly onto the magic path which headed directly away from the village the trees of the forest closed in about her and in an instant the light shaded into gloom it had been dusk but this was more than that the path ahead glowed ever so faintly winding deviously through the jungle rose walked along it as fast as she could fear of imminent pursuit lending her strength but there was no sound from behind and finally she slowed and glanced backand saw nothing but trees and vines and foliage she almost paused but remembered the warning this was a oneway path and if she took even one step question quest backward it would disappear and she would be stranded in the wilderness unable to fend for herself so she settled for peeking back without stopping her walking there was no doubt there was no path behind she looked down at her moving feet and saw that the path faded out as her slippers left it behind how had her parents obtained this onetime path the magic must have cost them dearly they had not said a word to her about it until the time of its use they had suspected that something like this would be required and had prepared how fortunate she was for their loving foresight she settled into a steadier walk not knowing how far she would have to go the west stockade was not very far from the ancient castle roogna but neither was it very close she would probably have to walk all night and she really was not structured for that sort of thing a grotesque shape loomed ahead of her blocking the path he was huge hairy and unbearably ugly he was an ogre me see a she the ogre boomed in stupid verse because ugliness was his first nature and stupidity was his second nature he lifted an arm in surprise his ham hand accidentally brushed against a small tree the tree snapped off and crashed to the ground terrified strength was an ogres third nature or maybe she had the order reversed at any rate she knew mat ogres were justifiably proud of all three rose remembered what she had been told she stood straight and addressed the monster lam rose granddaughter of king yang and i am on my way to castle roogna to await a magician to marry she was afraid that if the monster reached for her she would step back involuntarily and lose the path the ogre considered that it was evident that a thought or two was forging through his brain because steam rose from his head and fleas with hot feet were jumping off at last the thought reached its destination question quest just before the hair caught on fire and the monster stepped off the path so go he growled disappointed it was evident that he would have loved to crunch bones as shapely as hers relieved rose resumed motion she hurried by wrinkling her nose where the air was fraught with the odor of boiled fleas and toasted bugs and the remnants of a scorched thought and in a moment was well beyond she glanced back and saw the hulk in the middle of the thickest possible tangle of trees she wasnt sure that even such a monster could get through that then she heard bashing and her next glance showed splinters of wood flying up the ogre could get through well enough it seemed she pitied the next person that ogre encountered and was sorry it was unlikely to be the king but perhaps the creature would not care to crunch the kings foul bones there were limits even to ogres she continued her walk after a time or perhaps slightly more she smelled smoke she hoped there wasnt a forest fire ahead but it turned out to be worse a dragon a huge fierce smoker lying athwart the path if it even breathed on her she would go into a choking fit she came about two steps closer than she dared and stopped i am rose on my way to castle roogna and the dragons head turned to orient on her the holes of its nose were emitting curlicues of dark smoke which drifted up to frighten the leaves of an overhanging branch rose almost stepped back but caught herself and i will wait there for a magician to come and marry me she concluded the dragon sighed somewhat steamily then it hefted up its bulk and moved on it would have no smoked maiden to gnaw this day it was evidently somewhat disappointed or perhaps it was for some other reason that it turned its head and fired such a blast of smoke at a nearby tangle tree that the tree went into a coughing question quest fit and its tentacles turned black with soot rose suspected that that particular tangler would not treat the next dragon it encountered very kindly but perhaps she was being unfair to the tree she really did not know it very well she chided herself for possibly thinking ill of it or the dragon without proper cause she hurried on she was glad that the magic of the path was in good order it was now full night in the forest but the glow of the path seemed to have brightened in compensation so that she could see her way perhaps a time and a half later her legs becoming deadly tired rose encountered another obstacle thј trees had grown larger and now crowded the path unmercifully and extended their massive lower branches across it she would have to scramble around and under and over those branches this would not be very ladylike but perhaps no one would notice but when she tried to pass the first one it moved surprised she stopped not quite stepped back how could a tree move its branch then she remembered something she had heard there was an orchard around castle roogna and its outermost ring of trees were active guardians she was getting near her destination she stopped again i am rose granddaughter of the branches moved they lifted and twisted like the tentacles of a kraken weed clearing the path it seemed that the trees had been expecting her maybe they knew that only she could follow this particular path it was a relief for she was about ready to collapse she had smeared on dirt to make herself look ugly now she felt just as bad she tramped on in her more innocent time she would never have tramped for it was completely unmaidenly but right now she felt more like tramp than maiden the path wound on through the orchard and the massive gnarled guardian trees gave way to fruiting trees of every type in the darkness it was hard to see question quest but she saw a shoe almost overhanging the path so knew there was a shoe tree here and spied another extremely pretty branch arching over the path which was probably part of an artistree she was definitely approaching the castle now at last it loomed into view its imposing stonework silhouetted against the background stars the castle was so tall she wondered whether any stars got snagged on the turrets it was surrounded by a murky moat but the path led to a drawbridge that was down she kept moving afraid that if she stopped she would collapse in fatigue and dirt where she was that would definitely be out of character for a maiden princess the wooden planks of the drawbridge vibrated with her footsteps then she came to the front gate and found that it was open this castle hadnt even been properly closed by the last person here but as she entered she heard squealing behind her and saw that the drawbridge was lifting itself then the gate closed sealing her in it was the castle opening and closing itself thank you castle roogna she said then safe at last she did collapse in what was probably not a properly maidenly swoon fortunately no one was watching she woke to sunlight she was in a bed it had wonderfully clean sheets and a truly pleasant soft pillow but im a grimy mess she exclaimed realizing how she must be soiling the sheets something flickered nearby nooooo it moaned eeeeek rose screamed in proper maidenly fashion a ghost the ghost frightened by her eeeeek vanished rose realized that she had been impolite im sorry ghost i didnt mean to scream at you rose called apologetically it just wasnt proper for a princessly maiden to be rude to anyone even a ghost the shape reappeared it was mistyish and amorphous floating somewhat above the floor it concen question quest trated and became more like a human figure female noooo messs it breathed now rose understood but im all covered inand the sheets she looked down at herself and her mouth dropped delicately open for both she and the sheets were quite clean how she asked her chagrin changing type the ghost coalesced further becoming shapely to the eye of those who might like that type ffrienndss ccaaame she said yoou weere oon flooor now rose remembered she had collapsed on the stone floor just inside the door her legs still felt sore now she was not only in what was evidently an upstairs bed she was clean and in a clean and fully princessly nightie someone must havemust have what friends she asked perhaps a fraction more sharply than was polite thhe zzombieees the ghost replied zombies rose exclaimed horrified anew but she realized that zombies being dead had very little human emotion and would not have cared a great deal about the exposure of her living body they had not hurt her so perhaps she would be best advised simply to forget that aspect selective memory was another maidenly trait for it helped protect innocence she had been dirty and now was clean and the mechanism of it was no ones business perhaps we should introduce ourselves she said remembering her manners i am rose daughter of lord bliss and lady ashley rose granddaughter of king yang and his second wife whose name escapes me at the moment the ghost made a floating curtsy i aam millliee the ghoosst oonce a ssiimple mmaid betrothed to the zzombie mmaster her speech was getting better as she practiced so was her form she was now about as shapely an apparition as rose had seen outside of the mirror question quest so thrilled to meet you millie rose said extending her hand the ghost extended hers the contact was hardly tangible just the feel of cool vapor but it was enough for the formal introduction rose inquired further and learned that millie hi life had had the talent of sex appeal and had expired by the magic of a jealous rival for the hand of the zombie master after millies demise the zombie master had zombied himself so as to join her as well as he was able it wasnt much of a romance at the moment millie confessed petitely because he was rotten and she was insubstantial but they hoped for improvement in the future meanwhile millie would be happy to serve rose as she had served living folk when she had been a maid she had a fair notion of the expectations of royalty rose was hungry millie offered to have her friend the zombie master get a zombie chef in the kitchen but rose decided graciously that the zombies had done more than enough already and she would not rouse them from their graves for something she could handle herself she got up and followed millie to the kitchen where she found a collection of fruits and cookies with only a little zombie rot on them she washed them without comment realizing that it was not her place to be finicky and had a good meal thus commenced her life at castle roogna she was free to roam the castle and the grounds picking her own fruit and nuts but not to leave the outer ring of trees was woodenly firm about that it was she understood protective custody she was safe as long as she remained here and no hostile party could get in it was a pleasant life with all the best of everything except for the fact that she had no living company fortunately there seemed to be a sanity spell on the premises so that she did not go crazy she simply regretted that she was mostly alone and comforted herself with the realization that company was as one defined it millie was question quest excellent company and so were the other ghosts sultry renee and her male friend jordan the barbarian doreen the child button and one whose name she didnt quite catch even the zombies were tolerable from upwind once she got to know them she learned to play cards with the lady ghosts though she had to deal the cards and hold theirs up facing away from her for them to see but mostly she just napped to wile away the boredom after a year even napping became somewhat dull i need something to do she exclaimed perhaps some crossstitching millie suggested it is dull for us ghosts too and we cant do anything physical but you can so rose took up crossstitching starting with the image of a cross face as it seemed appropriate it seemed inadequate by itself so she pondered a few days and devised a bit of verse to go with it she would give it to the magician who finally came to marry her and be king these little stitches that were mine had to be taken in time and so they grew cross for they counted it loss and decided they wanted to be thine she went on to do a great deal of fine needlepoint and tapestry and this pursuit wiled away another year or two but even this became dull without company normally she made such things for others and there were no others to give these to she had offered to make things for the ghosts but they declined as they were unable to wear them but do you know you might like to see jonathans tapestry millie said who is jonathan the zombie master heoh i cant talk about it but millie did show rose the tapestry where it had question quest been carefully folded and put away in a drawer rose brought it out and hung it on a wall and gazed at it and was amazed for the pictures stitched into it moved in fact it was a historical presentation it responded to her command for she was a princess and showed any pictures she desired it had been made by the wonderful sorceress tapis given to the zombie master hi the form of a jigsaw puzzle and hung on a wall of castle roogna after his death it showed the history of xanth from it she learned exactly what had happened to millie a tragedy indeed and even what had happened to rose herself for it covered everything through the present rose lost track of the time she spent enraptured by the tapestry she learned everything about xanth but eventually even this palled the one thing she refused to watch was her mother she did not want to confirm her mothers loneliness and decline again she was up against the ultimate limit she had no one to share this with doing things alone no matter how interesting they might be was incomplete she talked to the ghosts but they spent most of their time fading out entirely she sang and read poetry to the plants in the castle and garden she made fancy meals for herself and an imaginary companion since she had to eat the companions food too she made sure it was good and because it was unprincessly to get fat she made them small she even forced herself to make and eat her most disliked food sour kraut soup a steady diet of that would make her thin as a ghost but mainly she planted and tended her beloved roses in the courtyard of the castle this was her talent and her roses were very special they would live long after she was gone and their precious magic would be available to anyone who requested it the one thing that was forbidden was to cut any of them from their living stems these roses had to be appreciated alive they were a great comfort to her yet they could not make up for her lack of human company question quest then millie had another suggestion the library rose checked out the musty castle library there were volumes collected by king roogna and his successors they related to everything in xanth its history and magic and people she had never been strong on reading but now she got into it and spent a long time learning aspects of things the tapestry hadnt covered much of the material was beyond her understanding but of course it was not intended for her it was intended for the edification of magiciankings but she would be able to show it to the magician who came to marry her and give him a good head start finding whatever type of information he might desire or need in short she was making herself useful before the fact one day when she was out picking new pillows for the beds as she did every month to keep them fresh for the magicianwhat a horror if he arrived and was turned off by imperfect castlekeepingrose spied a monstrous serpent eeeeeek she screamed affrighted but the creature made no hostile move instead it bowed its head as if penitent she realized that only appropriate folk were allowed through the defensive trees so perhaps she had misjudged this one she hurried inside and fetched a translation book she had found in the library humanserpent she wasnt sure how to use it but hoped that she would figure it out she brought it out and came hesitantly toward the huge snake what do you want she inquired primed to flee at the mere drop of a bit of saliva from a fang the creature hissed nodding toward the book she opened the volume and looked at the printing in it fear not lusscious maiden the print said i undersstand that this casstle hass no moat monsster currently sso i have come to apply for the possi tion rose was amazed and pleased this is true she said the position is open but you have to promise question quest not to eat me or the magician who comes to marry me and be king the serpent hissed again of coursse the print in the book said replacing the prior print thiss iss ssop rose looked at the foot of the page there was another asterisk with a supplementary statement sop standard operating procedure such as in the case of moat monsters not molesting legitimate denizens of the castle they guard right this way rose said thrilled she walked toward the castle and the serpent slithered after her by the way what is your name there was another hiss and the book printed ssouffld sserpent at your sservice ssisster souffl oh what a lovely name she exclaimed with maidenly delight the serpent seemed taken aback later it occurred to her that it might have encountered less positive reactions to its name but rose loved souffle and sometimes splurged on souffl pie when she felt naughty for it was horribly fattening souffl took up residence in the moat and thereafter rose did feel safer also the serpent was good company when she felt particularly lonely because he had come from outside more recently than she had and had oddments of news of course she could get the news from the tapestry but it was nicer when personal in such manner passed the first century rose ceased to wonder when the magician would come she knew what was happening in xanm because the tapestry and a couple of magic mirrors kept her current but it was now another world for her she simply maintained herself from day to day never aging or losing her wits and she longed for the day it would end and she would be able to give all her love to the magician someday the second century passed all the folk rose had known were gone but castle roogna forgotten by question quest xanth remained keeping itself in repair waiting for the magician who would be king and restore the former splendor of king roognas magnificent edifice after years the magician cameand rose had a problem for he was no magician she knew that because the tapestry showed his history he was the former king humfrey twice married and twice deserted by his unfeeling or selfish wives also by his one true love who had declined to marry him this was a man thrice rejected not exactly ideal but she was so desperate for company that she longed for his success in fact she might even have cheated just a tiny bit to enable him to win through after all he was a good man and by the time she had viewed his life history she loved him it wasnt as if it mattered whether one more beach head appeared just in time to distract the colored men it was their job to keep those heads combed regardless as well as to question any intruders so she had tried the spell she had found in one of the tomes and used the magic mirror to picture the place she wanted it to grow surely that was no evil thing was it but now here he was and she wasnt going to send him away and wait perhaps another two hundred and fortysix years for her magician there was only one thing to do she would have to see that humfrey became a magician she had learned of a way from one of the tomes in the library then it would be all right she slipped on any old thing and went out to meet her hero chapter magician s wo you see rose concluded i cant marry you if you arent a true magician but if you go to the university of magic you can get a degree in magic and then you will be a real magician and castle roogna will have to let me go she glanced obliquely at me unless you are willing to be king again then you could live here i dont want to be king again i protested but if that was the price of marrying her then i might have to do it she was certainly my dream woman it had taken time to love mareannperhaps all of a dayand then it hadnt worked out rose had become my second love in all of a minute and there was every sign it would work out if i cooperated anyway the storm king is young yet so xanth wont have an opening for another king for perhaps forty years do you want to wait that long no she exclaimed with maidenly emphasis her precious bosom heaving i want to marry you right now it was one of the oddities of our encounter that there had been no courtship or proposal we had met and were in love and we wanted to marry and remain with question quest each other indefinitely neither of us questioned that she had told me her story and she already knew mine so our only present concern was how to manage our association when castle roogna would let her marry only a proper magician and would not let her leave before she did the castle had not anticipated the approach of a nonmagician who knew enough of magic to get through it had tried to balk me and had failed perhaps in part because it attuned to the kingly experience i had had and could not be quite certain that i wasnt a magician but it would not let rose go she was rose of roogna now and the castle was in effect her parent i really could not question that it had taken good care of her for two and a half centuries had it not done so i would not have met her and that would have been disaster where is this university of magic i asked i have learned of most magical things of xanth but not that thats because it isnt of the human realm in xanth she said i read about it in an arcane text it is a demonic institution most demons live under the ground somewhere only a few bother to explore the surface and then they arent very serious about it i know i murmured thinking of dana she had been caught with a conscience so had had to endure the indignity of human fallibilities of conscience and love she had been a wonderful wife in every respect until she succeeded in getting rid of her conscience our son dafrey was a good person too i hoped he didnt lose the conscience when he married and sired offspring normal demons just didnt care very much about human beings yes you do she agreed touching my hand she had reviewed my relationship with dana and did not hold it against me rose was my second true love and would be my first married true love because of mareanns determined innocence so you must go among the demons and enroll in their university and question quest pass their courses and get your degree and be a magician and then we can marry and be happy together but i dont have a way to contact the demons i protested and if i did i cant think what would persuade them to let me enroll in their school there is a spell for summoning demons in one of the tomes in the castle library she said i realized that that library was something i had to see i could probably spend years there learning the things i had not been able to learn elsewhere if i got to be a true magician and married rose the castle would let me do that even if it didnt let me stay overnight maybe i could make some sort of deal i said i suspected that i would not enjoy whatever the demons demanded but i was quite sure i would not enjoy life apart from rose so this was the lesser of discomforts i shall go in and find that volume and learn that spell rose said meanwhile perhaps souffle will let you bathe in the moat the monster serpent hissed angrily at the notion not wanting its nice moat dirtied by my grime but rose turned her head and looked at it with just a tiny hint of reproach and the creature melted out of sight i knew how that was so she walked gracefully inside and i set my pack down on the bank and waded into the water soon i was dean and the moat was filthy souffle retreated around to the back of the castle but i could hear the monster sneezing then i emerged and walked toward a linen tree to harvest a towel at that moment rose emerged and caught a full view of me oops but she smiled i have seen your healthy body in every state she murmured the tapestry conceals nothing that was true i had known about the tapestry only through history and hoped to get to see and use it when i became a magician of course i had no physical secrets from rose question quest by the time i had gotten dried and dressed rose had set up the spell it was an odd one requiring a pentacle a candle and spoken words the words combine with the flame to summon the demon rose explained the diagram is to prevent the demon from reaching out to squish you being angry about being summoned it cant leave the pentacle until you let it go and you wont let it go until it makes a binding deal with you this is an interesting device i remarked i had thought i knew something about demons but i had not known they could be summoned and dana had not told me even during her souled state she had evidently had some caution what are the words of the spell there seem to be a number of variations she said some use terms which i as a maiden naturally do not understand i suppose demons being creatures of the nether regions have a more explicit mode of expression as nearly as i could tell you can say what you want and it should work as long as it rhymes the more specific words are to isolate particular demons that gave me a notion maybe dana the one to whom i was married would be good to call she would not pretend to misunderstand me perhaps so rose said seeming not entirely pleased that made me wonder just how explicit the tapestry was about matters relating to the adult conspiracy since it evidently knew whether its watcher was of royal blood it might also know whether the watcher was old enough was rose considered to be twenty or two hundred and sixtysix what did it consider to be the fabled age of consent i could not safely assume that she remained innocent despite her reference to maidenly modesty she could be jealous of dana for good reason yet i did not know any other demon by name we lit the candle and set it in the middle of the pentacle then i stepped out and said dana demon passing bycome to me and dont be shy the idea question quest of a demon being shy was laughable but the point was the rhyme the flame flickered then smoke curled out of it looming larger until it almost filled the pentacle blazing eyes formed in the smoke and squirmy tentacles what monster had we caught i had understood your former wife to be beautiful rose murmured with what in a less gentle person might have been taken as irony the smoke dissipated leaving a firmer outline the tentacles became arms and legs the body shaped down into a roughly female figure with a head in the form of a swirling storm cloud what idiot put this firetrap here a voice reminiscent of a harpys screeched somewhat cowed i nevertheless stood my ground is that you dana this is humfrey whom you have known i wasnt completely satisfied with that phrasing it was subject to interpretation but this was the first time i had done this and i was feeling my way the figure shaped up some more becoming somewhat attractive humfrey i have heard that name before but i am not dana i took her watch this month now let me go dance before i blow you away dance i asked dont you mean dunce whatever the figure became quite appealing i think i recognize that voice about a quarter century ago demoness metria i exclaimed remembering danas friend the one with the slight problem of vocabulary who liked to see what human folk did the figure turned luscious and the face formed well now you were good for a bit of entertainment as i recall what do you want this time i want to enroll in the university of magic metrias jaw dropped but almost immediately she recovered her composure and squatted to pick up the fallen jaw she set it back in place where it worked as well as ever are you crazy even for a man i mean question quest no im in love same thing why would you want to get into anything as deadly dull as the university i want to get my degree and be a legitimate magician well you cant only demons can attend or folk sponsored by demons i had a bright idea well youre a demon you can sponsor me she laughed her torso shaking in interesting ways while rose frowned for some reason why should i do a planetary thing like that what kind of thing starry solarian cometary moonish cheesy lunatic whatever answer the question i pondered feverishly because it would be amusing to watch me struggle through that system she considered her gaze focused disturbingly on me then on rose who was standing back a way this is the creature you love leave rose out of it i snapped i intend to ill make you this deal i will enroll with you and be your companion we shall share a room if i cant distract you from your purpose before you get the degree then you will have it listen demoness i said angrily if you think im going to mess with you as i did with dana forget it all i want is an education then you have nothing to fear from me she pointed out safe in your desire for the degree and your love for thorn here rose rose said with an almost unprincessly sharpness whatever so do we deal i knew there was little i could do except deal or quit i looked at rose my marriage to dana demoness showed me that demons can be constant when they have reason i said question quest i know but she had a soul and the moment she divested herself of that soul she took off but she told me that metria here always told the truth except about her age so maybe so im a smidgen over seventeen metria said adopting the aspect of a teenage girl so does it matter it had been twentytwo years since i had met metria at the key stone copse i decided not to comment but rose did actually i am a bit over seventeen too she said i was born two hundred and sixtysix years ago but the last two hundred and fortysix have been at castle roogna and i havent aged hey i like this woman metria muttered she knows about being ageless she glanced at me well humfrey what is it to wasp to what i asked hornet yellow jacket buzz sting to exist or not to exist to bee whatever are you in or out i looked at rose again i fear it is the only way my love i fear it is beloved she agreed accept her sponsorship i will wait for you i know you dont have any future with a demoness ah but what a past he has had with one metria said and what a present coming up a what i asked gift token bonus gratuity alms you had the right word i said i mean what are you going to give me you have a past and a future i will make your present interesting in fact so interesting that you will be distracted from your studies and will flunk out of the u of m then your future will be without rose of roogna here and she will be tragically disappointed in you that wfll be extremely entertaining question quest i looked once more at rose im not sure this is a good idea it is a distinctly mediocre idea rose agreed but the best that offers prove her wrong my love and return to me with your degree emboldened by that expression of confidence i did it sponsor me for the university of magic i told metria i will succeed despite your distractions well then lets get it on she agreed smudge a hole in the pentacle and ill take you there i scuffed a hole in the line with my foot metria became smoke and curled out through that gap reforming as a flying dragon the dragons huge jaws snapped me up fortunately the teeth were more apparent than real and did not crunch me i shall return i cried boldly back to rose as the dragon launched into the air and bore me away ill be watching she called back i thought she meant to say waiting but realized that she had the tapestry so could watch me as she had before that would surely steel my resolve should it ever waver the dragon winged southeast until it reached a large lake that was ogrechobee where the ogres had once lived until they set out for the ogrefenogre fen then the dragon dived it zoomed into the water plunging through it and finally a new world opened out this was the realm of the demons the dive into the water must have been merely to mask its location since demons could dematerialize and reappear far distant in a moment did that mean i had done the same that was an intriguing notion but it could be that there really was an entrance to the demon realm under the water metria had resumed her usual human form i know it was no more natural to her than the dragon form was all forms were unnatural for demons but i preferred this one we were standing before a large desk piled high with meaningless papers a demon with receding hair and question quest heavy spectacles sat there this was odd because demons could assume any form they chose and did not suffer from the maladies of mortals evidently this one just happened to prefer this unprepossessing aspect beside him was a name plaque bureaucrat next he said metria nudged me enroll pull what yank tug wrench lug jerk whatever do it i faced the desk demon i want to jerk i mean enroll the demon yawned showing a gullet that extended literally to his feet he was hollow he materialized a pencil and complicated form name humfrey he made a note on the form species human one bored eye oriented on me while the other remained on the paper sponsor the demoness metria now the other eye left the paper and oriented on metria having fun again female well it does get boring up there in mans land she said defensively to be sure now both eyes focused on me you understand that she has no interest in your welfare humfrey that your candidacy will be a joke among demons that there are simpler ways to arrange to be humiliated yes i said my mouth getting dry the eyes returned to the paper major magic are you sure suddenly i was uncertain i want to be a legitimate magician among my kind i understand that a degree isi magic from this university will qualify me correct specialty question quest information once more an eye aimed at me there are easier specialties which are more dramatic information is power i said motivation i want to become a true magician so that i can marry the woman i love the demon bureaucrats hand came down bearing a stamp it pounded the form proceed to your dormitory chamber next buti said one eye swiveled to cover me you wish to withdraw already no but dont i have to pay for this demons dont do anything for nothing you will pay the eye left me but how will i pay i mean now both eyes returned momentarily in the normal fashion you will be entertaining us by your folly and failure did you expect otherwise i realized that his candor was because he cared not even half a whit for my sensibilities everything i did here would be watched by the demons whose greatest joy was the confounding of mortal folk i suppose i might feel the same if i lived for thousands of years with power to do anything i wanted and no need to eat or sleep no i should not have expected anything else thank you i said with what little dignity i was able to scrape up right this way fool metria said taking me by the hand but dont you need to register too i asked belatedly you said you were enrolling i enrolled five hundred she paused hours ago now ill get around to taking classes she dragged me on we came to a bare stone chamber i gazed at it not pleased the prospect of lying down on stone that was not bedrock did not appeal then metria snapped her question quest fingers and abruptly the chamber had furnishings there were curtains on the window that had not been there beforeneither window nor curtainsand a plush rug on the wooden floor that had been stone and rugs hanging on the walls and sunlight slanting through the glass panel that was now the ceiling in the center was a huge round bed well lets get it on she said making a flying leap for the bed as her clothing misted away she bounced and her bare flesh bounced approximately in unison get what on i asked with greater naivete than i felt get your clothing off and ill show you just as i had suspected forget it demoness ill sleep on the floor no you wont you get demerits for acting uncouth this was new to me but i had no reason to question her accuracy demerits are bad for me too many of them will wash you out then ill sleep on the bed but ill ignore you ha she said confidently but there was a tiny hint of uncertainty hovering in her vicinity i knew what such hints were like they hovered until they had the chance to magnify themselves enormously it was good to see that the demons could be afflicted by them too i made it worse for her by distributing my few possessions appropriately through the room while rigorously ignoring her i could see from the edges of my vision that she was making scissor motions with her bare legs but i never looked directly legs that were bare up to the waist could be a distraction and i wanted her to know that i was having none of it where do i eat i asked demons didnt need to eat but i did so metria took me to the mess hall i wondered why it was called that until i saw that it was the site of what might have been the worst food fight in contemporary xanth so thats what demons did with food mashed potato was caked question quest on the walls jam drooled from the ceiling and puddings lay like mundane cow flops on the floor between pools of milk and beer serve yourself metria said indicating the mess my reaction must have shown too plainly because she dissolved into laughter she melted right down into the biggest brownest cow flop of them all and i heard an echoing hohoho from the walls it seemed that i was not disappointing the demons who wanted entertainment but i had a notion how such things were set up because in my time of marriage to dana demoness she had let slip some hints she had really been a good wife while she had her soul the funny thing was that the reason demons didnt have souls was that they were souls it seemed that when a loose soul served as a body it lost some of its finer properties such as conscience and love evidently these were not properly things of the body so the process of forming a body was hard on them but when a soul occupied a body even a body that was a corrupt soul those qualities returned i walked to the counter across the chamber there were tall stools there i perched on one sure enough a waitress appeared she was another demoness of course playing a role but roles were the perpetual delight of the demon species one slice of apple pie please said and a pitcher of purple tsodapopka i had discovered lake tsoda popka near the north village during my years of surveying and had developed a taste for the fizzy stuff she reached under the counter and produced these things thank you i said and she smiled at me the only problem was that demons did not feel pleasure the same way mortals did so her smile was artificial i ate my meal and it was a good one apparently the demons intended to play it straight as long as i did i was here to try for my degree and metria was the question quest one privileged to distract me from that effort the others only served as supporting players perhaps they would get demerits if they failed to perform their roles aptly i finished in due course and stood dont i get a tip the waitress asked dana had not mentioned that detail very well when you smile at a customer get your eyes into it as well as your mouth i said then it looks like genuine feeling oh thank you she said smiling with genuine feeling i returned to my room metria was there in a stunning seethrough blouse and skirt she was very good with her emulations and i might have been tempted despite knowing better there was something about this kind of partial clothing that was more tempting than outright nakedness perhaps because it gave the illusion that something hidden was being glimpsed but i remembered three things she had no interest in me except my failure other demons were watching hoping that i would do something hilarious such as trying to summon the stork with her and rose was probably watching too via the tapestry suddenly i felt extremely straight and narrow anyway i had something else to do after my meal i looked around but saw no place to wash or other where is i asked oh thats rightmortals have natural functions metria said she gestured and a door appeared in the wall i went to it and put my hand on the knob i turned it and the door opened beyond was a smaller chamber with the devices i required i used mem then i heard the walls chortling ho ho ho well perhaps in time they would get tired of such entertainment i was not about to suspend my natural functions for the sake of avoiding their ridicule i found pajamas hanging on a hook i changed into question quest them they fit me perfectly demons could do things well when they chose i emerged and went to the bed metria was there of course wearing a clinging negligee she rolled into me as i lay down showing the deep cleavage of her bosom show me what you did with dana she said i closed my eyes and breathed evenly it was a significant effort but i knew i had to succeed thats what you did she asked knowing considerably better i associated with her for several years before we married i reminded her then i merely slept with her as i did with mareann storks do not respond to mere sleeping i am not married to you so i am treating you similarly oh fudge she swore and a puffball of smoke flew from her pretty mouth ho ho ho the walls chortled this time i knew that i was not the object of their laughter next morning we went to the first class there were a number of demons there male and female and they looked almost as nervous as i felt it seemed this really was a university the only unusual thing about it was that i a mortal was attending i sat in the front row at the next desk to my left was metria looking bored at the next desk to my right was a demon wearing glasses apparently some demons did need them for reading this ones horns were vestigial and his tail was a soft tuft taken as a whole not one of the more ferocious specimens i decided to be positive hello i said to the demon i am humfrey here to learn to be a magician hello the demon replied i am beauregard here to study the liabilities of the living state he blinked behind his glasses i say are you mortal that i am i confessed why you would be an excellent subject may i observe you question quest you might as well i said other demons are and finding it humorous we have our discourteous members as do the mortal folk i would never i was coming to appreciate that all demons were not alike i was getting to like this one if he wasnt just pretending to be halfway decent maybe you should insult me too so you wont get in trouble with other demons but that would be he paused reconsidering you mean you wont mind i smiled not as long as you dont mean it we can exchange friendly insults excellent fathead he exclaimed delighted think nothing of it incompetent i responded that was the way of it thereafter we always greeted each other with insults and we were friends we were to nave a long association i was feeling better already the professor swept into the room there was a sudden hush he was an imposing figure of a demon with gnarled horns and swishing tail and his fangs made his mouth into a perpetual grimace i am professor grosscloutj he announced we shall now proceed to an exploration of the fundamentals of metamagic what is a feasible definition of this concept he paused glaring about beauregard beauregard jumped i uh am not exactly sure sir he stumbled looking ashamed metria who cares she asked shrugging im just auditing this class anyway the dread professorial eye spiked me next humfrey i uh think that would be something alongside of or beyond magic i said terrified of being shown up as an ignoramus maybe something that inadequate he roared cutting me off he glared around the classroom you numbskulls come here with heads full of mushhe glanced significantly at beau question quest regard who cowered in his chairand bad attitudeshe glanced at metria who was doing her nailsbut maybe if you survive you will eventually learn something about magic he glanced at me and i was electrified i had found faint favor we listened fascinated and terrified what a creature simply put metamagic is that magic which affects or is defined in terms of magic itself the professor continued edifying our mushy brains the onetime king of the human aspect of xanth roogna adapted living magic to suit his purpose the othertime king ebnez adapted inanimate magic similarly those are examples of metamagic someone who could emulate or otherwise affect the magic talents of others would be indulging in metamagic the professor continued and i was rapt he knew more about magic than i had dreamed existed hours later dazed by the days classes i found myself back in my room with metria and beauregard what a monster beauregard exclaimed what boredom metria added what genius i concluded the other two looked at me i can see why grossclout likes you beauregard said i can see i have my work cut out for me metria said dropping into a chair what work is that beauregard inquired naively she spread her legs giving him a good view under her short skirt so that he could see her panties to distract this treeblood from his studies i had thought demons had seen it all but evidently beauregard hadnt his glasses turned pinkthe exact shade of the panties there certainly was a difference between demons what ignoramus numbskull blockhead dunce simpleton nincompoop fool bumpkin sap he asked catching on at last question quest whatever i win if he doesnt get his degree she closed her legs beauregards lenses began to clear i uh had better go he mumbled the toilets there she said and the door to that chamber appeared no i meani dont know what i mean he stumbled out there was a ho ho from a wall apparently i wasnt the only entertaining figure here that wasnt nice metria i said reprovingly oh whats wrong with it she opened her legs toward me now her panties were blue whats wrong is that youre supposed to be tormenting me not himand i care a whole lot more about metamagic than i do about your fakedup underwear for once she was silent but she looked ready to explode into a fireball ho ho ho a wall laughed when tired but exhilarated by learning at the end of the day i came to bed there was rose of roogna under the sheet i froze amazed hhow oh my love i just couldnt wait she said breathlessly i had to come to you i got into the bed with her hardly believing my fortune but how did you find your way here rose she kissed me passionately on the mouth i looked in a tome for a period a what epoch age duration era term time spell whatever clasp me close my love make that stork jump sorry metria i have a hard course of study ahead she kissed me again really goose that stork im ready she broke off realizing that i had seen through her little charade peaches and cream she swore turning into a fair emulation of the stork she had described question quest ho ho and ho a pillow chortled before getting smashed by a wing i did seem to be holding my own i hoped metria never caught on to how near she had come to fooling me the year passed in days i mean a daze i progressed rapidly because i had already studied everything magical i could find and i was absolutely fascinated by the subject metria unable to admit how badly she had misjudged the situation settled into a polkadot funk and finally drifted away bored furious i spent a lot of time with beau regard we did homework together he was bright enough just young for a demon he would surely get his degree in time before i knew it i was embroiled in my dissertation lost human castles with magical implications i had a head start because i had already found castle roogna but now i had to run down the other great lost castle that of the zombie master it wasnt all that far from castle roogna as the dragon flies but it was a devious and messy distance as the magic student walked i finally located it and discovered that it was a rather nice place now that the zombies were gone in fact a light blinked over my head this would be a fine place to live with rose after we were married i couldnt live in castle roogna because i would not be king and was not of royal lineage the castle as i understood it was quite strict about that but once i married her i could take her away with me castle zombie was a fine and private place ideal as a reclusive retreat for those without pretensions at last the grueling course was through i knew more about magic than any living man before me yet my thirst for more remained professor grossclout was almost approving in another century you may be a credit to your species he remarked gruffly i defended my thesis successfully though the demon question quest interrogators made me sweat what you have here is competent but why havent you covered all the lost human castles with magical implications one asked sharply but there are only two i protested suddenly uncertain what of the ivory tower he demanded what of new castle zombie professor grossclout nudged him those have not yet been constructed he murmured oh well what of the nameless castle grossclout nodded he did miss that however two out of three isnt bad nameless castle i had never dreamed of such a thing where and what could it be so i made a c minus but i passed thanks to grossclouts favor it seemed that he appreciated having a student who was genuinely interested in the subject even if some mush remained hi his head i had my degree i was now a true magician of information i could marry rose at last chapter hell i o her great surprise rose found herself awakened by the delicious smell of hot coffee though she had harvested no hot coffee mugs recently what was happening millie the ghost floated in good morning sweet lady she cried excited you looked so peaceful sleeping there that i hated to wake you but its past dawn and the wedding party starts by midmorning at the latest magpie is bringing you a drink to make you alert who rose asked dazedly magpie shes here to help get you through this day but theres no other living person in castle roogna except me rose protested yes shes one of humfreys classmates now rose understood a demoness she had learned a lot about demons in the past year and no longer feared them she understood their nature reasonably well and was careful but knew that demons were merely another of the formidable species of xanth like the dragons and basilisks magpie came in then carrying the coffee which she question quest must have imported from far away she looked just like a bustling matron with her gray hair under a white lace bonnet and a black wool and feather dress she set the mug down on the table beside roses bed then went to poke her finger at the fireplace a fire burst into being there casting its warmth into the chill room for rose had chosen not to use any of the main bedrooms of the castle feeling unworthy she had taken a little attic chamber and up here it did get cold at night rose drank her brew while magpie busily fetched the clothing actually it was more than the mug the demoness had thoughtfully laid out a small breakfast of orange juice fresh toasted breadfruit slices and rosehip preserves this dainty meal would do until the wedding feast thank you magpie i am starving call me mag the woman said and continued her business rose realized that the womans name was probably ironic a magpie was a garrulous bird but this one spoke only briefly rose got up wincing at the cold stone floor her tender warm feet encountered she hugged her nightdress close about her and sat in the chair at the table the day would warm in time it always did meanwhile the blazing fire certainly helped that was an unaccus toined luxury while rose ate the realization washed over her she was getting married she could still hardly believe it but humfrey had completed the university program and now had his degree which meant he was officially a magician and eligible to marry her she had seen it all in the tapestry and gotten the words from a magic mirror castle roogna knew it too and would not try to prevent the wedding it believed that at some time in the future humfrey would return and be king a new prophecy had appeared in the book of prophecies to that effect so it was half a loaf for the castle but not even magic castles had everything their own way the technicalities of the situation had been met question quest rose would have preferred to have the wedding of the century but that would have attracted the attention of the storm king and there was another prophecy warning against that if the storm king discovers activity at castle roogna he will destroy it in a firestorm for his successor will reside here that prophecy said it seemed that the storm king was young and imperious and resentful of anything that might conceivably threaten his authority his correct action would have been to bring his retinue and live at castle roogna but he was a homebody and preferred to remain in the north village thus the very existence of castle roogna was an implied rebuke and activity there would have suggested that a new king was being cultivated to replace him so the wedding had to be quiet and the castle had to remain anonymous but in time there would come a new king and it seemed likely that it would be humfrey after all if the storm king died and there was no other magician in xanth humfrey would have to take it so rose would settle for the quiet wedding and wait on events it wasnt as if she were inexperienced at waiting she finished eating and stood looking about she discovered to her great delight that mag had anticipated her desire for a bath on this day of all days to one side of the brick fireplace aromatically burning crabapple shells and logs the large wooden tub had been brought in and filled steam redolent with rose petals perfumed the room soon rose was settled in her tub her curly rosecolored hair pinned atop her head she settled herself deeply into the hot water she could feel her dry skin soaking up the rose milk and becoming dewy and moist again it was the beginning of the magic transformation that any wedding wrought a pretty young naive girl would become a beautiful and competent woman she had seen this transformation occur any number of times in the tapestry history now it was her turn what a pity rose said and burst out laughing question quest mag jumped and little button ghost who had drifted in to watch the activity spooked away in fright there was a scramble as the monster under the bed retreated farther into the darkness and a rattle as the skeleton in the closet did the same i only meant that it will be too bad to lose another innocent rose said contritely marriage does that you know it sacrifices innocence actually she had long since fathomed the key elements of the adult conspiracy she had after all been twenty years old before coming here and there were things she had seen inthe tapestry thatwell it had been an education she had also noted the little tricks the demoness metria had tried with humfrey those had not been successful but their general import had been plain enough so in her case it would be more symbolic than actual still she was experiencing the mixed thrill and tragedy of it rose washed her long silky hair pouring out warm water from a pewter pitcher little did she know that one day in the far future that pitcher would be stolen from the castle by a demon and used as the basis for a dreadful malignant mechanical thing called cornpewter that would be a constant menace to all things halfway decent in xanth this was just not the sort of thing innocent maidens were capable of knowing mag presented her with a cake of soapstone it smelled of her natural attar of roses fragrance when she finished mag offered her a huge fresh cottonwood towel now that she and her hair were clean rose was ready to be attired in one of several glorious dresses she had harvested from the dress tree in the orchard for the occasion one by one mag handed her gossamer silken panties pink creamy chemiseteddy smooth stockings of gold thread and a long whispering silken underskirt next came the overskirt and bodice of the gown the central panels of the dress were embroidered in tiny seed pearls crystals and smoky topazes in a field of yellow roses upon the rich goldcolored silk when she moved about the dress gave off a faintly rosy reddish question quest gold glow her golden living frog sat in the middle of the rosette on her sleeve the skirt of the gown came to the floor the neckline was so low that mag drew in her breath in a matronly gasp of disapproval roses eyes widened to see her breasts exposed almost to the rosy nipples she had not realized that the decolletage was quite that daring the gown was simply wonderful with that deliciously low neckline rose might even stand up to the competition offered by those barebreasted mermaids and all the other alluring maidens the tapestry had shown her not to mention that horrible demoness metria suddenly it was time for the wedding it was held in the main ballroom of the castle and if it was not the event of the century it was hard for her to know the difference the demons had turned out in force for this was rare entertainment for them normally they were not wanted at weddings for some reason they were all solid and behaved meticulously with all the males being in tails and the females in floating gowns beauregard was best man and millie the ghost was maid of honor and button ghost carried ghost flowers and professor grossclout conducted the ceremony having authority that no man or demon had ever dared question metria was there too of course she couldnt be kept out she played the role of former girlfriend of the groom and was really quite effective in portraying resentment about the proceedings one might almost suspect that there was just a bit of human feeling in that demon callousness but about all rose noticed was that humfrey despite pushing forty was clean and almost handsome in his own formal suit he seemed truly glad to be there which was a relief it wasnt necessarily so with grooms no matter how ardent they might be at other times they must have said their vows because now there was an expectant hush humfrey faced her take off your wedding cap and veil rose he said question quest she blushed meekly made abruptly shy by his request you do it she whispered he stepped forward and gently drew the heartshaped spiderweb lace cap and diaphanous bridal veil from her head then his competent hands moved to undo the diamond and living golden frog hairpins that held her tresses in place to his evident surprise the hair fell in a silken waterfall down down to below her hips it is a lovely lass you are he murmured softly in her ear your hair is indeed like rose petals his hands slid through the perfumed mass of it i think it is time rose of roogna that we seal our marriage with a kiss he tangled his hands in her hair and drew her face forward in his eyes she could have sworn she saw the images of flying storks and she knew she was seeing through them into his mind then he closed his eyes and kissed her at once rose felt as if the blood in her veins had turned to glowing golden lava from a volcano of love she could not move she never wanted to move again she loved her husband humfrey she would love him forever there was a sound as of the rippling of wavelets on a sandy beach it grew to resemble the splash of the surf on firm rocks then it became the roar of the stormdriven sea against a stony cliff no it was not her heart it was the applause of the audience the marriage had been sealed then it was done and the demons were gone and it was the morning after standing on the ramparts of castle roogna gazing down at the ruins of the gardens rose decided that she did not regret any particle of the prior days proceedings not the wedding certainly and not the reception and not the banquet not even the dancing under the new baby moon and not the night of love wherein they had tried so ardently to summon a phalanx of storks that was only partially question quest effective as it turned out only one stork came in due course bearing rosetta bliss humfrey or roy for short whose power was to animate inanimate things for a while but that was in the moderately near future right now it was a beautiful day the sky was spreading itself like a peacocks tail turquoise blue gold and copper luminous and brilliant a spicy warm breeze was blowing in straight off the high c and lost keys everything was ideal she looked at her reflection in h maidens mirror her romantic heart shimmered and softened she did not look like an experienced woman who had been thoroughly indoctrinated into the practice of the adult conspiracy she looked more like a maiden who had just begun to wonder about such things perhaps it took practice to develop the proper expression she went to her rose garden she hated to leave it but knew it would endure as she had here at the castle living without aging rose herself had to leave of course to be with her husband and the spell would be off but that was all right how could a person truly live life if she did not age she wanted to grow old with humfrey she sifted through the rose petals ashes and dust of the garden there were pebbles thorns tiny gems a small leather scroll documenting the marriage and ugha long manylegged pennypede bug it was harmless unlike the larger nickel pedes so she left it alone it preyed on things that might otherwise attack her roses a shadow dimmed the light it was humfrey i have brought a magic carpet to the front he said we can go now my precious wife she glanced at the roses whose power was to test true love that test had never been necessary with humfrey the scrolli had it here with my darting roses but if i am not to remain here bring it along he said smiling the roses need no document question quest so she tucked it into a pocket in her skirt then she went with her husband to the carpet they sat on it she in front he behind the magic of the weave would keep them safe on it to castle zombie humfrey said the rug lifted smoothly and circled up in a moment it was above castle roogna rose felt tears streaming down her face as she gazed down at the castle which had been her home for almost two and a half centuries it had taken perfect care of her but now she had her true life to live farewell dear castle she cried waving to it thank you so much for everything a pennant waved which was odd because there was no wind it was not far as the carpet flew to castle zombie the thing was relatively horrible with a muckfilled moat and decaying vegetation around it but the zombies were gone or safely buried and she knew it was a serviceable estate the zombie master had died more than seven centuries before so this castle had been deserted even longer than castle roogna but it had been soundly constructed despite its seeming decrepitude and she knew it could be cleaned up humfrey brought the carpet down in the rear of the castle they got up and walked to a fence he pushed open the garden gate made of driftwood and led the way into a small secret garden rose followed slowly down the narrow stone path tiny spiders had decorated every weed with their webs and mice rustled under the leaves overall there was a lingering smell of decay i thought you might have your rose garden here humfrey said suddenly she was glad he had shown her this first yes i shall she exclaimed delighted she would make another rose garden roses would brighten this dreary region right up then he led her to the front portcullis humfrey picked her up and carried her gallantly across the threshold and set her down inside rose quailed there question quest was not a stick of furniture inside then he brought her to what she thought of as the captains cabin a large almost oval room so richly appointed that it was obvious that no human agency had done it it had a fireplace with a malachite stone mantel with green ivy carved on it and great goldenwinged lions holding the mantel shelf on their heads above it was a magic silvered mirror on the mantel was a pair of magic pewter candelabra that burned without ever consuming their fine noneofyourbeeswax candles at the head of the bed was a rose window facing west that allowed the cabin to be flooded with light the walls were hung with three wellworked moving crewel tapestries the demons must have set this up during the night and humfrey had surprised her with it what a delight humfrey stood in the middle of their bed chamber which had a priceless antique thick carpet on its wide wooden floor the fireplace was lit with fireweed and the air was fragrant with incense we can be very happy here my wife humfrey said rose was sure of it they settled into married life humfrey nagged by the things he had not yet learned embarked on his most ambitious project yet he was compiling a book of answers in it would be the answer to every possible question anyone might ask he started by listing everything he had learned in his early survey of talents which was considerable and added whatever he could learn from the texts in the castle roogna library which the castle allowed him to check out one at a time he supplemented this with field trips making copious notes he kept himself so busy that some days rose hardly saw him at all but she wasnt concerned she had lived alone for so long that it was not much of a burden and she could contact him at any time by using a magic mirror and he would always come immediately when she asked him in fact there was a certain delight to these brief sep question quest arations because every time she saw him again rose experienced the intense jolt of feelings that seeing him always gave her love made him handsome to her though she knew that this was not an objective judgment she heightened the effect by dressing him well she would send him out one day with shades of blue in his shirt trousers and cloak complemented by sandy tan desert boots another day it would be shades of brown or gray he always carried a battered bulging sack full of books tomes and spells over his shoulder she could not do much about that but she did tie matching ribbons to it sometimes he got caught out in the rain and silvery rain drops sparkled like gems in his hair and on his driftwood staff then she would take him in and dry him off and comfort him with kisses restoring his humor meanwhile she set the castle in order eliminating the last vestiges of zombie occupancy she started the rose garden how could she endure without roses she kept the kitchen filled with homemade soup and love sometimes she accompanied humfrey on his field trips delighting in the carpet rides and the picnic lunches but soon she had to stop this and stay home because she was expecting the stork and it just wouldnt do to be away when it arrived she had a horror of arriving home and discovering the baby deposited in the fireplace or somewhere all dirty storks were notorious about their schedules if the mother was not waiting for the storks arrival it dropped the baby off anyway ready or not fortunately she was present and alert when their daughter arrived and after that she had little time for anything else roy did her best to live up to her masculine nickname from the startrose wondered in those harried moments she could squeeze in for thinking whether they would have been better advised to choose another nameand constantly made the stones of the floor and bricks of the fireplaces come to life and squirm vigorously fortunately they remained animate question quest only while the baby focused on them and roys attention span was brief but it was hectic humfreys tome of answers and roy grew apace then somehow it seemed in a few days roy was grown into pretty childhood and thence to girlhood and thence to maidenhood and suddenly she was marrying the son of a local forester named stone becoming rosetta stone and moving away to start her own family but shes just a child rose wailed through her tears of joy at her daughters fortune stone was good at interpreting things and making sense of them and that was bound to help their marriage shes twentyone humfrey pointed out gruffly older man your physical age when you married me thats old enough but yesterday she was eleven rose cried and only one the day before he agreed wheres my soup rose might have been tempted to make a remark about insensitivity had she been less goodnatured but she was too princessly to deign she fetched him his soup she would not of course admit it but he had grown twenty years older and grumpier in the past two decades and looked more like a gnome than ever it was a good thing she loved him but that was the thing about love in xanth when it was true it was forever in drear mundania she understood love lasted only for a few years and then marriages started breaking up humfrey had almost loved ma re ann and mat feeling had remained until he did love rose he had not loved dana demoness or maiden taiwan though he had treated them courteously it had been his misfortune to lack true love in his early life but once they had found it together they would keep it as long as they both should live that was good because things were very quiet now with roy gone rosetta and stone had discovered that they could animate stones and make them tell what they knew interpreting their confusing remarks and some questlon quest times they knew interesting or useful things but that was there things were dull here rose took a more active interest in her husbands work and in the next six years his great book of answers progressed rapidly humfrey was excellent at discovering things but not at classifying them or putting them in proper order he couldnt even find his socks without help rose did that organizing of facts and crossreferenced them so that it was possible to locate almost anything in the voluminous collection little did she know that this would lead to considerable mischief she had assumed that if she minded her own business and helped her husband loyally and was courteous to others everything would be all right it had never occurred to her that she could be the victim of outright deception and malice that naivete was to cost her dearly it started innocently enough humfrey was cataloging seeshells so she was gathering more of them while he was doing the paperwork she would return later and properly index and crossreference his notes but he had to do the actual definitions peggy the flying horse had returned after a snit when humfrey first got married and used the magic carpet rose had explained about tilings and peggy decided to forgive the transgression then humfrey had used the carpet again and the horse had got her feathers hi an uproar by the time rose smoothed those feathers down peggy decided that she would give rose rides instead of the fickle magician the two had been friends ever since humfrey a typical man had never noticed so today peggy carried rose to the gold coast of southeastern xanth where the sands and many of the plants were golden it had been some time since rose had been here she had visited the region once as a child and played in the sand and had retained a certain tastefor the pretty stuff now she was dismayed to see a new development there was a tower being built from ivory just offshore apparently it was to be a light question quest house and white ivory was lighter than gold rose would have preferred to leave the shore pristine but realized that she could not stand in the way of progress perhaps if she ignored it it would go away she told peggy to go and graze where she wished and the horse walked into the jungle looking for tasty leaves and grass rose walked along the shore picking up new varieties of gold seeshells their eyes were bright orange yellow and some were very pretty humtrey didnt care much about that to him an ugly shell was as good as a pretty one but rose preferred beauty without actually disparaging other conditions it wasnt as if she would be beautiful forever she was now fortyeight years old in awayfromcastleroogna time she had worked to keep her body in reasonable shape and she still brushed out her hair each day to keep it luxurious but on occasion a mirror was unkind enough to show a wrinkle rose had lost her taste for mirrors coincidentally and no longer carried one with her she came to a village of fishmen and fishwives they had the heads of fish and human legs their village was in the water but they came ashore to forage for food rose saw them using their upper fins to hold long poles from which descended lines and on the ends of the lines were hooks which snagged on things of the beach sometimes small animals bit at the bits of candy around the hooks and the hooks caught in their mouths and the fishmen hauled them in by the lines and poles until they were dragged down into the water it seemed like a cruel way to make a living to rose but she was cautious about criticizing the ways of other folk then she saw a decrepit old woman hobbling along the fishmen goggled at her and retreated into the water evidently detesting her company this disturbed rose who never liked to see any person excluded from things she went to the woman who was hunched over carrying a heavy bag may i help you rose inquired the woman gazed up at her her aspect was even question quest more frightful from close up and she smelled of something other than roses her clothing consisted of whatever rags and tatters she had picked up from trash heaps well yes lady she wheezed if you would carry my heavy burden to my home that would help me a lot i shall be glad to rose said she took the bag which she was surprised to discover was filled with ivory horns and tusks the woman evidently collected ivory if i may inquire what is your name my name is rose the beady eyes flicked at her my given name is peril but the fishfaces call me the sea hag rose was properly appalled how unkind of them i shall certainly call you pearl thats peril rosehips the woman corrected her snappishly perhaps rose might have had a hint about her nature then had she not been so trusting rose apologized for her error it was very embarrassing to get a persons name wrong for names were important indications to character everyone knew that the old woman set off at a brisk hobble and rose was constrained to keep abreast of her because the odor behind her was barely to be endured they proceeded downbeach to a spot directly opposite the halfcompleted ivory tower oh they have ruined my house again she exclaimed her voice suggestive of a harpys screech rose saw a pile of driftwood flotsam jetsam and seeweed it was hard to imagine that this could ever have been a house but of course it would be impolite to question the word of her companion do you have any other place to stay there is one the fishfaces cant reach peril said she hobbled to the edge of the forest there was a huge dead tree trunk rising above the height of roses head peril scrambled up it remarkably agile for one in her condition and squeezed into a hole in it she disap question quest peared inside the trunk then her face reappeared well come on stupid she screeched imperiously rose struggled to climb the trunk with the heavy bag of ivory she was not good at this because princesses were not supposed to climb trees but somehow she managed she wedged into the hole and hauled the bag after her she found herself squeezing down inside the tree the bag pressing her down from above her nice dress was getting severely mussed then her feet lost purchase entirely and she fell screaming in an embarrassingly unladylike fashion she splashed into water the bag splashed beside her she flailed and in a moment her feet found a sloping rock she scrambled up it out of the water she was in absolute darkness her first thought was for the old woman peril she cried are you all right she was answered by a resounding cackle im horrible but i will be much better soon the voice of the hag came from above soon rose asked bewildered soon as i kill myself i dont understand there was another awful cackle who cares rest easy fool until i come for you then the voice faded rose looked up far above she saw a disk of light it blinked out for a moment men reappeared she realized that it was the hole in the tree trunk peril had climbed back up and squeezed out of it and was gone rose realized that she was in trouble it seemed to be a most unkind notion and one she hesitated to entertain but it almost seemed that the old woman had intended to trap her in here there was no way she could climb up inside that trunk and escape there was no purchase for her hands and in any event she lacked the strength for such an effort she was trapped in this awful dark pit she knew what to do she had to call humfrey who question quest would immediately come on the carpet and rescue her except that she no longer carried her magic mirror what a problem her foolish vanity had made for her she heard a neigh peggy the winged horse had found her peggy she cried get me out of here but even as she called she knew it was impossible the horse could not get in here and could not do anything to help from outside so she did the next best thing peggy go fetch humfrey bring him here quickly the horse neighed acknowledgment rose heard the beat of her great wings she would fly to wherever humfrey was and alert him to roses problem he could then use a mirror of his own and investigate and he would take care of it immediately then she remembered that she hadnt told peggy where humfrey was he was checking references in the castle roogna library and would not be back until evening peggy would not be able to find him until then for she could not go to castle roogna because of the aversion spell rose was stuck here for the full day she hunched herself with her back to the edge of this cave there seemed to be just the pool and the sloping edge and the wall the water was brine so must connect to the sea but rose could not escape that way either she was not that good a swimmer and for au she knew it was too far for her to hold her breath this place was some distance in from the shore and any tunnel would have to connect under the surface of the sea at least she had not been hurt in the fall how lucky that there had been water there she thought about peril now she realized the significance of the name the woman was a peril to anyone who tried to befriend her no wonder the fishfolk didnt like her but why had she sought to snare rose here what could she gain by doing this to one who meant her no harm rose remembered the sea hags parting question quest words she was horrible but would be much better as soon as she killed herself whatever could that mean was the woman deranged why would anyone want to kill herself and how would that make her feel better why would she want to trap another woman just before then there was a sob rose thought it was her own then realized that it wasnt it had come from across the pool there must be another ledge there who is there she called me a voice replied that was not phenomenally helpful she realized that the other person could be young and therefore thoughtless please tell me your name dread the answer came dred are you a boy dread redhead because i have red hair and i dread the darkness im a tenyearold boy rose was much relieved to discover that she had company yet horrified to learn that another person was similarly trapped did peril lure you in here too she asked sure she did the boy replied yesterday but now shes got you i guess shell just let me die what does she want with me rose asked you mean you dont know i have no idea i was only trying to help her carry her bag of ivory and she led me here and left me she said something peculiar as she left you sure dont know dread said well let me tell you the sea hag is a sorceress who lives forever because every time her body gets old she kills it and her spirit takes over another body usually she takes a young woman but if she cant find one shell take a boy thats why she trapped me but shed rather have a woman even an older one like you that gives her a few more years to find a young one so now shes got you and in an hour or two shell take it question quest rose was appalled but i dont want my body to be taken how can she do that she traps a woman so she cant flee and then her spirit just comes in thats her magic you cant stop her you have to get for away so her spirit cant catch you thats the only way to escape rose realized that she was in twice as much trouble as she had thought but rather than dwell on that awfulness she focused on the boy what is your talent she asked hoping that it was something that could help them i pipe open doors even when there arent doors you mean you can make doors to places that dont have them sure with my hornpipe its fun usually i can get in or out of anything but then why didnt you open a door out of here because my doors open on the level not up or down and theres no light down here no light why should that stop you im afraid of the dark but its already dark here yes and that terrifies me but theres a spot of light from the hole in the tree and i can watch that but if i opened a door it would be to an underground tunnel and it would be dark i cant leave the light rose began to get an idea many children are afraid of the dark but only when they are alone they are never afraid when they are with their mothers my mother isnt here he pointed out with a certain accuracy but vm here and im old enough to be your mother i am a mother of another child if i went with you you wouldnt have to be afraid no matter how dark it is say maybe so he said her heart beat faster he was accepting her logic can you open a door in your wall sure come over here and ill do it question quest rose did not waste time she slid into the water and swam across she found a similar sloping ledge on the other side and climbed out do it she said breathlessly music sounded how lucky that dread had his hornpipe with him there was a creaking as of a door opening rose felt in die darkness sure enough there was a door with a dark passage beyond come on she said maybe this tunnel intersects a cave and we can follow it to the surface where its light the tunnel was heading directly away from the sea but that was fine that was also away from the sea hag you first dread said she didnt argue she knew he would follow rather than be left alone she felt her way into the tunnel proceeding on hands and knees she heard the scuffle of the redheaded boy following the tunnel went straight ahead on the level she was afraid it went nowhere but then it came to a faintly glowing underground stream her eyes had become adjusted to the gloom and now this feint light was quite bright enough to see the path of the river it was breathtakingly beautiful the rock surrounding it was crystalline and each small stone at the bottom was a roughcut gem and above it hung stalactites of glossy sardonyx now there was sound too the stream sang as it wended its way through and around these crystals at the bottom of the stream small plants were growing and these plants produced tiny fruits and there were fish eating the fruits but they could not linger to enjoy the scene we must move on rose said there seems to be no way out from here open another door dread raised his pipe to his mouth and played a new door opened in the wall they entered the new tunnel leaving the lovely river behind this tunnel was tall enough for them to walk upright which was a relief but soon it narrowed so that they had to go single question quest file the darkness became complete again rose could not see anything in front of her she had to stop yielding to the primitive fear of banging her face into something disfiguring now the boy squeezed ahead of her and began cursing his curses lit up the dark and dim pockets of the cave rose about to object to such language realized that it was better to stifle her ladylike sensibility for the nonce they needed this bit of light yet how was it that the boy had not thought to do this before and so escape before she arrived were almost there dread said confidently almost where rose asked but before she could inquire further she heard a screech echoing down the tunnel the sea hag as one they charged down the tunnel now there was a glow from another wall dread whipped out his hornpipe and played another brief melody and another door opened but if the sea hag had killed herself so that her spirit was coming after them how could there be a screech that was the hags living voice hurry the boy cried urgently taking her arm he jumped through the door hauling her after him they were on a water slide it carried them down and around through more darkness then they landed in some kind ofwell it felt like a basket a huge wicker basket with a high arching handle it was swinging from a rope tied to that handle as they landed in it it started moving swinging down into yet further deep depths what is this rose cried alarmed where are we going this is a handbasket the boy replied we are going to hell please dont swear anymore she reproved him it offends my matronly sensibilities where are we really going to hell he repeated i am a demon from there question quest it is a dull place so we decided we needed some pretty flowers but they wont grow your talent is making roses grow and they are nice flowers so we are bringing you there rose was upset and bewildered but the sea hag what about her oh she was going to take your body all right thats why we had to act quickly some talents go with the souls and some with the bodies yours goes with your body so your soul would have been no good to us and anyway it is far too good for us so we had to have your body and get it before the sea hag did we had only a few hours before she killed herself and came for you but it took only minutes to flee her cave yes we couldnt let you stop to think too long or you might have found a way to escape but now you are in the handbasket to hell and we have you she stared at him in the growing light of the flames that were appearing outside the basket youre no more an innocent boy than the sea hag is an innocent woman you were out to trap me too and succeeded he agreed well satisfied she peered down over the side of the big basket there was nothing but licking flames and roiling smoke there she could not escape rose sighed this was just not a good day chapter lethe i returned late from castle roogna our own reconditioned castle was quiet rose was not there where was she then i saw a parchment on the table it was in my wifes hand it was a letter from rose i read it wonderingly dearest husband humfrey where are you my beloved if you do not rescue me soon from this hell i fear for the consequences each day i walk the castle walk in the lonely silver rain from the sand castle inn to the castle in the sky but you do not appear i told the demon in charge of this hell that at long last i am prepared to give anything to see you and love you one more time i have miked to the trees here and they whisper that my banishment from xanth will not be one times nine years or two times nine years but ten times nine years unless you rescue me immediately why have you not come i have only one more day of grace and then i am locked here for the full term oh my love everywhere i walk forgetmenots in thyme spring up to cover my footprints of blood question quest in the white snowsand my soul is being tugged from me it will be encased in rose quartz in the rose garden of castle roogna unless you rescue me today it shames me to confess it but i have bribed a demon with a kiss to deliver this tetter to our home i beg you if you love me as i love you come take me away from all this before it is too late rose of roogna as soon as i finished reading it the letter burst into flame it was a missive from hell all right it was gone i glanced at the calendar an ogre had left i remembered the date on roses letter i had evidently gotten more deeply embroiled in the research at castle roogna man i had realized four days had passed i was one day past roses deadline i had already missed my chance to rescue her i could not redeem her from hell i was the magician of information not of power and i knew i lacked the power to bring her from that infernal region maybe if i had been able to learn morebut she had been helping me to learn and without her i knew i could not research well enough to find out how to free her assuming that there was a way so she was lost i could not live with that i would have to kill myself and join her in hell i knew i would not mind it much in her company i started to put the castle in order for my departure my vials of potions my collected spells my almostcomplete book of answersit would not do for these to be left out for any passerby to take suppose they fell into evil hands but where could i put them where they would be safe castle roogna of course so i carried the flying carpet out to the landing place beside the moat and began loading it souffle lifted his head from the water he had moved here from castle roogna when we did because it was question quest pointless to defend an empty castle that needed no additional defense he claimed actually it was because he liked rose she looked good enough to eat i gazed into the monsters eyes how could i fc mr that rose was gone and that i would be too i rtu that i had commitments here that i could not simpi desert for one thing i had to be ready in case i wa needed as king again much as i loathed the thought the arrogant storm king had put in a law that all human citizens of xanth had to demonstrate a n jlent by age twentyfive or be exiled that was oppiessh and unfair if i didnt want to be king again myself had at least to keep looking for another magician and train him so that when he became king he would abolish that law no i could not desert my post even for rose yet i could not endure without her i couldnt even find my socks alone i would need a woman for thatand how could i marry again loving rose as i did the answer was that i couldnt not as long as i remembered my love for her there was only one thing remaining to do i stepped to the cupboard and fetched my vial of lethe elixir there was enough in here to make a man forget something for eighty years by that time i should be safely dead and with rose in hell for this potion affected only the living mind not the dead mind it was ideal rose i cried naming the thing i had to forget and lifted the vial to my mouth i drank down the whole of it i looked around bewildered what was i doing here i stood in the middle of an arcane study with a vial in my hand the last thing i remembered was discovering castle roogna i had been approaching the ramparts and i had seen a moat monster thennothing was i inside the castle having hit my head during the entry no i had no bruise and anyway this wasnt castle roogna the smell of it was different this was question quest somewhere else more must have happened than simple entry somehow i had been transported elsewhere maybe that was the castles last defense it used magic to move anyone who entered to a different castle maybe thea memory glimmered from the fogthe nameless castle the castle of which i had not heard which ignorance had cost me a good grade somewhere sometime but i could not remember more of that matter i seemed to have forgotten a lot i peered more closely at the vial now i saw a label on it lethe i had just drunk the elixir of forgetfiilness whatever had possessed me to do that slowly i figured it out there was a period of my life missing i must have entered castle roogna then traveled here and set things up to suit myself and then taken a drink of potion to forget it all why i didnt know but was sure that if i had done it voluntarily there had to have been excellent reason so my best course was not to inquire into the matter in due course the elixir would wear offthere was no telling how much had been in the bottleand then i would remember meanwhile i should go about my business awaiting that revelation just how much time had been wiped out by the elixir i looked at the calendar again this time checking the year my mouth fell open it was the year it had been before i had lost twentynine years of my life instead of being thirtyeight years old and fresh from my stint as king of xanth i was now sixtyseven years old and not fresh at all indeed the weight of those extra decades now came down on my shoulders and i felt stooped but there was no sense groaning over squished milk pods i would simply have to make the best of it hoping that it wasnt unbearably bad it had obviously been bad enough to make me take lethe though i explored the castle which turned out to be not the nameless castle but the ancient castle zombie i must question quest have discovered this in my travels after leaving castle roogna and decided to patch it up and live in it but it was too well kept there seemed to be a womans hand in this i must have had a servant maid what had happened to her she was certainly not here now whoever she was she had been highly competent because everything was in far better order than i was capable of managing i located the bed chamber and found therein only one bed large enough for two on one side were my things such as a lost sock on the other were a womans such as the perfume of roses obviously we had been close i spied a magic mirror on the wall what woman was here i demanded of it you told me not to answer mat magician before you took the lethe elixir it replied well now im telling you to answer i said shortly i tended to be shorter now than before being shortened by those extra twentynine years but then you were in command of your faculties it responded with a sneer none of die magic items here will answer you now i realized that it was true i would not have taken lethe if i had wanted to remember what i was trying to forget i also discovered in a closet a fat tome labeled book of answers now this was interesting where had i gotten this but as i turned the pages i recognized the handwriting it was myown with crossreferences by some other party evidently an assistant well maybe this would help me i needed a woman to find my socks where was she i tried to use it to ascertain what woman had been here but it balked me as i had expected i had been routinely thorough before as befitted me but i should be able to use mis and the other magic items in other ways so that i could get on with my life i thumbed through the pages soon i located woman question quest there were pages of types but there was no socks subheading too bad so i checked for the next best thing and there it was wife i discovered that this was a spelled entry it changed as i watched it listing names and descriptions of marriageable females i could fix it on any one who interested me by touching the entry with my finger when i removed my finger the entries started rotating again but i didnt want to choose randomly so i tested its resources i want the best sock finder available i said and stabbed my finger down without looking if this worked the way it should that name would be the one and there it was sofia sock sorter her description was ordinary and she lived in oops this was a problem she lived in mundania well either i wanted tbe best or i didnt of what mettle was i made today i decided to go fetch sofia regardless i packed those spells i recognized from my early days of collecting i found a magic carpet i seemed to have acquired in my missing years i carried it outside looking for a suitable place to launch it there was the moat monster whose name i had learned was souffig serpent no doubt because that was what he would make of any intruder i am going to find a woman i announced i shall return guard the premises well souffle nodded and settled back into the water i unrolled the carpet set my things on it sat on it myself and gave it the standard takeoff command it lifted smoothly it was a good piece of work i flew north and slightly westand soon discovered below a monstrous chasm where had that come from i remembered nothing of the sort in xanth i fetched up my notepadand there was a note gap chasmforget spell on oh that explained it i admired the scenery continuing my flight across the varied landscape of xanth until i reached the isthmus there i question quest landed and hid the carpet away in a tree putting a routine invisibility spell on it from my collection then i used a temporary neutrality spell on the shield that enclosed xanth and walked safely through it it was evident that my hiatus of lost memory had not impaired my routine skills i seemed to be about as good as ever apart from being older there was a peculiar thing i remembered about mundania it had little if any magic however i had found a vial of magic dust i had gotten from somewhere and that would enable me to do such magic as i required if i didnt waste it i set out on foot across drear mundania it would be pointless to recount my experience there no one cares to learn any more about that boring and backward place than the absolute minimum i shall just say that i found sofia the sock sorter at the mundane company she worked for she was about thirty years old and plain but her hands sorted socks of all types with marvelous dexterity i sprinkled some magic dust and then used certain other spells to set up the interview this made me imperceptible to other mundanes and made my words intelligible to sofia take my word such steps are necessary when operating in such a region silly as they may seem to ordinary folk i have come to take you away from all this to a realm of magic i told her she considered a moment okay she agreed in the mundane way so we walked back to xanth chatting as we went and got to know each other as well as was necessary we passed back through the shield and i fetched the carpet we sat on it and it lifted sofia screamed and almost jumped off whats the matter woman i demanded with justified irritation its magic she cried of course it is i told you this was a land of magic but i didnt believe you question quest then why did you come with me because anything is better than being an old maid in mundania she had a point well you will just have to learn to live with magic because i am a magician i had found a scroll attesting to my degree from the demons university of magic so knew that in my missing years i had become a certified magician in feet when i saw mat i remembered an entire yearlong episode with professor grossclout beau regard and metria the demoness had for some reason wanted to seduce me but had railed and i had completed my studies that was good sofia decided that she would live with it but she seemed quite nervous about the height and exposure of the carpet until i uncorked a relaxation spell and she relaxed we came to the castle oh its beautiful she exclaimed just like a fairy tale no fairies here i corrected her they live elsewhere in the forest she glanced at me then laughed though i wasnt sure what she found funny she seemed somewhat in awe of the castle especially its appurtenances like the moat monster until she saw my mound of unsorted socks now that i understand she exclaimed theres enough here to keep me busy for years precisely we settled into what she termed a commonlaw marriage she was good in the kitchen once she learned how to use simple spells and how to harvest ripe pies from the garden she was good with clothing once she learned about shoe trees and such she discovered a rose garden in back and tended to it carefully for the flowers were similar to those she knew at her home actually that rose garden seemed to be magic flourishing with no care but the roses bloomed more readily when someone paid attention to them question quest but she did have one problem it seemed that she felt i should at some point break off my study of the fascinating book of magic and do something with her on the bed it seemed to be some sort of custom in her land perplexed i went to a magic mirror one which gave straight answers it showed a flying stork oh you want to summon the stork i exclaimed she laughed again finding something mysteriously funny so i put a place marker in the book and went to make this sacrifice she was in some kind of nightie and actually looked somewhat fetching i hadnt really looked at her before it must have been some time since i had indulged in this activity because i became quite interested in it once i got started and wound up spendbig the rest of the night with sofia on the bed apparently she had learned to be dextrous with more than mere socks during her prior dull life the next time she was interested in this activity i was quicker to catch on i was in my seventh decade but my dunking in the healing spring kept me healthy and i felt more like thirtynine which was the age i was when i got my degree in magic and my last memory until my jump into the present so in my experience i was that age and perhaps that counted for something the following year our son was delivered sofia named him crombie after an obscure relative of hers who had been a soldier once she got over the shock of seeing the stork land with the bundle apparently she had expected another manner of delivery theres no accounting for the expectations of mundanes then she shrugged when in fairyland do as the fairies do she said i didnt bother to try to understand what she meant by that just so long as she was satisfied with the baby he did seem to have a certain mundanish cast but this sort of thing happened when one married a mundane question quest meanwhile i was getting involved in something new i did not recognize its implications at the time a former approached the castle i hear tell you are a magician he said so i agreed noncommittally do you have a spell i could use to make the most beautiful girl in my village fall madly in love with me i looked at him he was a rare bumpkin smelling of manure only a cow flop could love that kind but as it happened i had found a number of bottles and vials on my shelf and one was labeled love so i presumed it contained elixir from a love spring i did not know how long it had been there or whether the potency of such water faded with time so it would be good to test it i poured a few drops of it into a smaller container put this in her drink or simply sprinkle it on her i said make sure that you are the first man she sees thereafter hokay he said whatcha want for it it hadnt occurred to me that this was a trade but i realized that it did make sense i didnt want the whole village coming to get free love potion we do have a garden plot to dig i said remembering that sofia had expressed the desire to try growing some mundane plants here why she should want to do such a thing was beyond me but i attributed it to the mysteriousness of women i knew from my limited experience with her mat it was best to humor her whims otherwise she might mismatch my socks so the farmer took his spade and did what he did best and in a day had a nice garden plot dug sofia was thrilled and not only were my socks extra sweet for the next week so was she good deeds had thenrewards the fanner went back to his village and later we heard the village wedding gong sounding and i knew that the potion had been effective after that more villagers did come some wanted healing which my supply of healing elixir did and question quest others wanted curse spells for their neighbors and sundry others had sundry other requests i was able to accommodate them all for the needs of rustics were elementary but in an effort to discourage such business i gradually increased my demands for trades this process continued for years and finally it reached to the point of equilibrium there would be three formidable challenges for each person just to gain admittance to the castle and then he would have to give me a years service or something equivalent before i would answer his question then the flow of folk finally diminished and i had no more calls than i wanted which was on the order of one a month sofia agreed with this policy as a mundane she did not feel entirely at home in xanth and preferred seclusion for the raising of her son that turned out to be more complicated than anticipated remember sofia was mundane she was learning about magic but it wasnt natural to her and she had no magic talent of her own she did not understand the pitfalls of it i was busy with my own pursuits and did not think to inquire and in any event sofia would not have been able to tell me what was happening because she had no basis for suspicion the consequence of this was to be unfortunate had i the chance to play that portion of my life over i would pay better attention and spare my son grief and alienation but all i can do now is tell what happened with my regrets when crombie was three years old an eightyearold boy came for an answer i knew instantly that he was a magician and in the guise of making him serve me a year i trained him in certain necessary things i was quite excited and my enthusiasm spread to sofia who had never seen magic like this before in fact it was about at this point that she became a believer thus we were both distracted and did not think of the effect on our son that was my error one of a number whose memory forever plagues me sometimes i am almost tempted to take lethe again to abolish such embar question quest rassments i will discuss the business with the other boy in the next chapter this one is for crombie when crombie saw our attention taken by the other boy who was resident at the castle for that time he was jealous and resentful he had an excellent talent of his own but it was not close to magician level while the other boys was crombie was somewhat annoyed with me for being distracted but he had little contact with me in the best of times so that was not the problem it was when sofia also got involved that crombie s helpless rage overflowed she was his mother how could she be neglecting him in favor of this stranger a few words could have eased his passion but we were not alert and they went unsaid so crombie did what made sense to him he sought another mother a better one one who would pay him full attention to the exclusion of all other children oh the subtle mischief of that quest his talent was to find things all he had to do was fix a thing in his mind close his eyes turn himself around and point and his finger would be pointing in the direction that thing was to be found it had been interesting discovering this at first he had been a baby too small to point but once he started walking sofia kept finding him into the cookie jar no matter where she hid it and finally discovered that he was finding it he could find anything even intangible things but could not be sure how far away they were he was sure only of the direction since he wasnt allowed out of the castle alone he didnt have much opportunity to use it for more than cookies but this time in his rage he broke the rule he spun around pointed and opened his eyes then he walked in the direction he was pointing into a wall his finding sense took no note of intervening obstacles it merely pointed the way so he walked through the doors and out of the castle and tried it again this tune he was pointing across the moat he knew he shouldnt cross it but his rage pushed question quest him on if he got out into the jungle and got lost it would serve his mother right maybe he would never return home it would serve her right but of course he could find home by using bis talent if he changed his mind so he crossed the drawbridge souffle lifted his head from the water and hissed warningly he knew die boy was not supposed to go out alone but crombie ran on across and the monster couldnt stop him for he certainly wasnt going to bite my son crombie did bis find routine again and followed his finger into the jungle souffle alarmed slid out of the moat and into the castle coming to warn us but sofia would have none if it youre getting my carpet wet she screamed get out of here this instant andsouffle cowed slithered hastily back out there are rare times when it is a disadvantage to be unable to speak the human way and this is one of the few examples i can muster the serpent then crossed the moat and slid after crombie but it was slow sniffing out the lads bail and soon he lost it in the welter of odors around the castle defeated he returned to the moat and sank down under the water miserable he could only hope that the boy returned safely of his own accord crombie undaunted by the big outside world fidlowed his finger it led him through forest and dale until he came to a big pot of honey there was candy around its rim well now he walked up and ripped off a gumdrop the gumdrop clung to the pot crombie pulled and it came off connected to the rim by a thinning string of gum he yanked harder and the connection stretched and thinned further then he put it in his mouth and chomped down on it the honeypot exploded into smoke yow the gumdrop became smoke too and curled back into the main cloud question quest somewhat daunted crombie nevertheless stood his ground he was a fighter even at the age of three it wasnt as if he had never seen magic before the smoke coalesced into the figure of a woman who the abyss are you she demanded who the what crombie asked confused shed hades inferno blazes hot underworld she broke off examining him more closely wait an instant youre underage i cant use that word around you what word the word i cant remember whats a little tyke like you doing out here alone wheres your mother shes too busy for me so im finding a better mother and youre it the demoness considered who is your busy mother sofia shes mundane the demoness considered again it had been a long tune since she had considered anything twice in fact it hadnt happened since she tried to seduce me for this was indeed that demoness who was somehow always near when there was mischief about to break loose perhaps demons do have talents and this was hers and who is your rather the magician humfrey now this is abruptly interesting you are humfreys son she evidently wanted to be quite sure yes only hes busy too indeed i remember when he was too busy for me and what is your name im crombie and im metria what makes you think im a better mother for you i pointed to you you bit me too right on thenever mind she rubbed the farthest out spot on her bosom this is your magic yes i find things so i found a better mother question quest the demoness nodded that is an interesting way to put it that certainly is a nice talent you recognized me despite my deceptive configuration your what the way i looked you werent fooled nothing fools my talent he said proudly why are your folks too busy for you theres an older boy there now they like him better metria considered you know i used to know your father but he treated me as shabbily as he is treating you i even showed him my panties crombie was young and innocent but not that innocent you were his wife not exactly that was the demoness dana who sensibly departed after having her way with him i wanted to summon the stork with him too but he didnt cooperate he was just too damuh darned busy for me she frowned aggravated in retrospect yes crombie said understanding perfectly well your talent must be right tell me what is your idea of the perfect mother shell pay all her attention to me and nobody else he replied for he had done some thinking on this subject shell give me candy and never make me take a bath and never make me sleep alone and she wont like any other children not even a little bit metria nodded i can do that sure my talent found you it certainly did well crombie this should be most entertaining what lets find some candy it was obvious they were going to get along metria picked crombie up and carried him swiftly through the air to the bank of the withacookee river where cookies of all types grew in abundance crombie was delighted he picked cookies galore and stuffed them into his mouth then she took him to lake tsoda question quest popka and he sampled the fizz he didnt like the first taste but she showed him how to put some in a bottle she found and shake it until it squirted all over everything and then it was tame enough to drink but after a bit she became more serious crombie this stuff is very good but if you eat too much right away it can give you a tummy ache you have to get used to it i would not be a perfect mother if i did not warn you of this so i will take you home now but tomorrow you can come out again and you will be able to eat more without getting sick eventually you will be able to stuff yourself with impunity and that is the ideal state but i dont want to go home she frowned i understand your position but if you dont return they will know how you sneaked out and then there will be censored to pay what to pay worse than seeing panties that set him back i dont want to be censored just what is so bad about spending the night home im stuck in this dark room all to myself while they do fun things somewhere else there are spooks just waiting to grab me if i even peek out from under the covers and i have to have castor oil because it is good for me metria made a face youre right thats a fete worse than whatever but i have an idea i cant go in that castle because your father has spirit levels out that flatten any spirit but maybe if i make myself very small you can sneak me in then i will keep you company and help you avoid the bad things great the demoness became as small as a gumdrop and he put her in his mouth now dont swallow me she warned a little mouth forming on the drop because then i would have to turn crepuscular to come out and you wouldnt like where i came out question quest turn what hazy indistinct impalpable vague smoky gaseous poopy close enough he was careful not to swallow her or even to bite on her though she tasted very good his tummy was already feeling just enough queasy from the cookies and tsoda popka so that he didnt want any ill wind in there souffli serpent was greatly relieved to see him return safely crombie knew that the creature would not tell on him now moat monsters never told when it would only get them in trouble too no alarms went off it seemed that the magic of the castle couldnt detect an evil spirit when it was inside a good person crombie hadnt even been missed that certainty seemed to justify his attitude soon it was time for supper he wasnt hungry but metria curled out of his mouth an invisible vapor and made the food disappear she did the same for the oil from the castors and that was an even greater relief when he went up to his lonely room she was with him he had company she formed herself into the nicest pillow he could imagine with two extremely soft mounds and he rested his head on her and felt wonderful then in the dark a spook came it leaned over the bed look it exclaimed he forgot to hide under the covers now well get him suddenly the pillow opened a big long mouth with oneandahalf squintillion teeth oh yeah it breathed with supreme menace and snapped at the spooks nose the spook was so surprised it dropped to the floor where missiletoe crombies monster under the bed fired a spike into its foot owoooh the spook cried and shot out of there so fast a piece of it tore on a nail in the wall after that no more question quest spooks came crombie laughed until he almost cried sheerly happy then the pillow formed arms and they hugged crombie and stroked his hair and there was a soft sweet humming until he drifted to sleep metria was the perfect mother all right after a year the other boy went away but metria stayed usually she assumed the form of crombies jacket and he wore her around the house but she could be anything he wanted indeed she was all he wanted he hardly cared about anything else when sofia made him study things he ought to know he paid no attention knowing that metria would provide the answers for him when they were required and often they sneaked out to the withacookee river and gorged his miserable life had become totally happy what none of us knew then was that metria was learning all my secrets for she was an enemy in our midst a number of my spells went wrong causing great inconvenience and annoyance and we didnt know why what a joke the demoness was having at our expense then crombie turned thirteen the moment he was a teenager he became aware of the female of the species he was still too young to join the adult conspiracy but he had notions about it and chafed at being kept in ignorance in short he was a typical teenager here he ran afoul of metria herself she was a creature of mischief but she knew there was more mischief in maintaining the adult conspiracy than in abolishing it so she maintained it so when crombie sought to put his hands on her in an aware way she told him no he had never been balked by her before and was at first incredulous then furious he grabbed herand she dissipated into smoke and floated away while it disturbs me to agree with that confounded demoness i have to say that she acted correctly in that instance any woman who gets grabbed in a manner she doesnt want should depart with similar swiftness question quest after that she was no longer with crombie he had to sleep alone he was now too big for the spooks to harm but he hated losing his womanlysoft pillow now his almost complete ignorance of the things sofia had been teaching him manifested he was a spoiledrotten teenager and that was a condition not even he could live with metria had done him the worst of favors by enabling him to escape any discipline in childhood he was so angry he had to keep blinking to keep the red glare of rage from burning his eyes he cursed all older women for of course he was incapable of blaming himself he stormed out of the castle now having more freedom because we were under the impression he was worthy of it he whirled and pointed uttering the syllable girl he followed his fingerand came across a girl his age sitting in the very glade where he had first found the honeypot she was exquisitely pretty and he fell in love with her right away this too is the manner of teenagers since he hadnt grabbed her she was responsive the two of them had a marvelous tune dancing and kissing and sharing secrets then he became too demanding show me your panties she laughed annoyed he grabbed at herand she dissolved into smoke and floated away only then did he realize that she had been merely another aspect of the demoness metria having her fun with his innocence that was when he swore never to trust another woman any age any type they say there is no fury like that of a woman scorned and metria is a perfect example but surely the fury of a teenager balked conies close by the time i discovered what had happened it was way too late my son was hopelessly embittered there was nothing to do but send him away to be a soldier question quest for hate is an asset to that profession i had in effect lost my son sofia was not particularly pleased either i revised the castle defenses to make sure that never again could a demon sneak in unobserved it was not that i was prejudiced against demons some of my best friends were demons but metria was sheer naughtiness she never acted with outright malice and indeed sometimes seemed to act decently but there was no telling what the final cost of her mischief would be obviously she remained annoyed by her failure to corrupt me so had corrupted my son instead corrupted hun ironically with kindness she had enabled him to avoid the necessary disciplines of growing up that lack of discipline might be typical for demons but was disaster for humans yet it was my fault too i should have been alert i should have taken a hand in the upbringing of my son i too had been spoiled for the maiden taiwan had brought up my first son i resolved that if i ever had another son to raise i would be a true father to him not leaving his upbringing to others to that resolution i was true but let me now return to the matter that so preoccupied me at the time my son was going astray it was not as will be seen a thing of little consequence lets make that a separate chapter chapter trent ne day sofia came to me surprised theres an eightyearold boy approaching the castle she exclaimed she in common with most mothers could tell a childs age and state of health at a glance i pulled my nose from the book of answers i had been studying it for five years now and was beginning to understand its use it was evident that i had made the original entries and someone else had organized and crossreferenced them there were so many entries that without such organization the tome would have been useless but even with them it could be a job to discover exactly what i wanted now i could generally get a desired answer in a few minutes and with further practice might make that even faster much of the time i had simply read through the entries in whatever order they came what a tremendous amount of information i had accumulated in those missing twentyeight years well doubtless he has a question i said there is no age barrier let me see what challenges are best you will make a child do the challenges she asked appalled she was odd in certain ways but of course that was her mundane heritage question quest i dont want to be overrun by children any more than i want to be overrun by bumpkins i said reasonably i looked in the bookand was surprised it said no challenges so i researched for the reason and it said policy growing frustrated as often happened when dealing with this book i investigated that because querent is a magician i stared then i looked up at sofia let him in i said gruffly hes a magician delighted she hurried off meanwhile i did further research in the book but it couldnt tell me what the magicians talent was this was because its answers had all been researched years ago it was not a predictor of the future it was attuned to the signals of magicianclass magic because that had always been a prime matter with me but that was the limit i closed the book a magician in all my years of searching i had found only one magician before and now he was the storm king the more i saw of the storm kings reign the less i liked it the man was a magician true but an incompetent administrator and xanth was sliding back into the dark age instead of climbing out of it we needed a better king one who would bring vigor back to the throne and who would restore castle roogna to prominence maybe this boy was that future king soon the lad was ushered into my presence good magician sofia said formally this is trent i concealed my excitement i needed to know a lot more about this boy before i let him know his importance a greeting trent why are you here im a magician he said i should be king but mom says the storm king will kill me if i go and ask him for the throne shes right i said sofia made a stifled exclamation the very notion of harm to a child upset her go fetch this young man a question quest cookie i said to get her out of the room for a while she disappeared but i dont need a cookie trent protested i can make my own by means of your magic i said trying to ascertain what his magic was sure want to see yes if you wish he looked around there was a speck of dust on the table that had somehow managed to escape sofias destructive attention and in that dust was a flea he pointed to it cookie he said instantly there was a plant a fine fresh chicolate chop cookie plant by the look and smell of it he had transformed the flea into this that was certainly magicianclass magic if he could do it across the board but it might be illusion i had to be sure may i i asked reaching for a cookie sure its your dust i took the cookie and bit into it it was perfect want a different kind trent asked i can make it any kind i know i held the bitteninto cookie what about a glass of milk he pointed suddenly the plant was a milkweed with several full ripe pods i cant make glasses he said only living things that is good enough i said suitably impressed i was satisfied that he was a magician of transformation of living creatures so you have come to find out how to become king without getting killed first right i heard sofia returning spot lesson in diplomacy i said dont mention cookies just accept hers okay sofia had brought a plateful of cookies trent thanked her and took one he was evidently a quick learner that was good question quest i do not have an easy answer for you i said there are only two ways you can safely become king one is to wait until the storm king dies but thatll be forever he protested and the other is to prepare yourself so that you can take power displacing him but you will have to be well trained and adult because such displacement is not a gentle matter oh he looked disappointed you mean i have to pay a years service to you for that in the course of that service you will leam how to prepare yourself i said i would not of course advise you to bother the legitimate king but i will teach you how to be alert and defend yourself oh his disappointment was fading as i said he was a bright boy so it was that trent did a years service for me moving into a spare room in the castle and i taught him how best to use his power the strategy was simple to transform any menace to something that was not a menace when a mosquito came to suck his blood he changed it into a harmless purple fly when a dragon reared up before him he transformed it to a dragonfly when a tangle tree grabbed at him he transformed it to an acorn tree the key was to rehearse things so that he could handle any living thing and not be surprised some creatures could hurt him from a distance while he had to be within arms reach to transform them so he had to figure ways to nullify them from afar usually it was possible to transform some nearby creature into one which was a natural enemy of the attacking creature but some natural enemies were also enemies of man so if a dragon were about to blast out a long tongue of flame he wouldnt transform a nearby worm into a monstrous fireproof serpent because that serpent would find him easier prey than the dragon but he could transform that worm into a huge sphinx which wouldnt care about a man but would object strenuously to having its hide scorched by the dragon question quest i also showed him how to sleep safely by transforming something into a mock tangle tree then he could sleep in the branches of that tree while other creatures did not know it was harmless because he had to be on guard at all times if he wanted to tackle a resentful king even so i urged him not to do itknowing that he would not follow this advice we understood each other between sessions we discussed philosophical matters it has occurred to me that the shield is a mixed blessing i remarked is it but doesnt it protect us from invasion by the mundanes it stopped the waves it stopped the waves i agreed we were referring to the series of wavelike invasions made by the mundanes which had wrought much havoc until halted by the deadly shield king ebnez had adapted but it also stopped colonization from mundania there are actually more human people in mundania than in xanth and the waves served to renew the human stock here without that irregular renewal our species has been dwindling in xanth today the villages are smaller and farther apart and there are fewer magic paths between them making travel more hazardous we need more peopleand we can only get them if that shield comes down but the mundanes are terrible folk he said repeating the standard lore children were frightened into good behavior by threats that the mundanes would get them is sofia terrible i asked sofia had been very nice to him throughout she had come to understand as well as i the importance of a potential future king of xanth and had treated him royally no but she is from mundania he gaped at me this subject had not come up before this was the beginning of a change in his attitude question quest never again did he speak ill of mundanes in feet the time would come when he would marry one as i had but i made one mistake in training him i did not sufficiently stress the importance of integrity i assumed that he already understood it and i was preoccupied by practical matters that error as with the one i made by neglecting my son was to cost us all dearly how late we learn wisdom another visit was from a harried woman the book of answers cut short the challenges again though she was no sorceress why i had to interview the woman to find out its my daughter she said shes six years old and its impossible to discipline her or anything shes out of control im at my wits end i could see that normally folk were right in the middle of their wits but she was off to the end of hers she talks back i asked no she doesnt have to she just uses her illusion she has illusions many girls do not like this iris has illusions thatoh how can i describe them theyre so real i began to get a glimmer the book of answers knew something about this and it warned me only when there was magicianclass magic involved do you mean she makes illusions you cant penetrate well not exactly but its so difficult we just cantits so easy to be fooled gradually i got the story from her and i understood what was happening her daughter iris was sorceress of illusion a sorceress was the same as a magician only female there was this foolish distinction making it allowable only for a magician to be king that was one of the things about xanth that needed changing and that the current king wasnt changing i knew what i had to do send her here to do your question quest years service for you we shall teach her how to use her power beneficially and return her to you with better manners oh thank you good magician she exclaimed tearfully so it was that sixyearold iris came to spend a year with us a year after trent left crombie was a year younger than iris but kept mostly to himself we did not knew then how he had found comfort with the demoness and he and metria were careful never to let us find out so there was not much interaction between the two children iris discovered early that crombie had ways of getting back at her if she teased him with her realistic illusions and she left him alone i believe she crafted an illusion of a dragon coming to eat him up and that night she climbed into bed only to discover a gushy meringue pie there first it was no illusion she had to wash the stuff off her feet and change the sheets she didnt even tell the adults sharing the juvenile conspiracy so only now in distant retrospect can i say that probably it was metria who placed that pie who says the demoness never did anyone a favor it taught iris manners in a hurry iris did have a wondrous talent she could make anything appear and be believably realistic complete with sound and smell only touch was missing if you walked into the illusion you went right through it but who would just walk into a firebreathing dragon on the chance that it wasnt real who would do it if the chances were only one in ten it was real but for those who liked to play the odds she could make a counter trap by placing the illusion of a dragon over a deep pit thus if someone walked into it he would fall in the pit and be in as much trouble as ever in fact she could cover the pit with the illusion of innocent level ground or she could cover a real dragon with that illusion of level ground so a person could not be safe by avoiding the apparent illusions anything could be question quest an illusion and that meant that anything could be dangerous in an unexpected way but we did not have trouble with iris for two powerful reasons first we were delighted with her talent this was the second magicianclass talent i had encountered in two years was a trend commencing even if she could never be king she could be a power in xanth so while her family had been driven to distraction by the illusions we delighted in them and iris was flattered by the attention flattered girls are generally not difficult girls second i knew a good deal about magic myself having studied at the university of magic and collected spells all my life i could not be fooled the way others could i could tell illusion from reality immediately i proved this early iris made illusion duplicates of herself and little girls ran all around the castle screaming but i always spoke only to the true one she did not know that i had had to take a potion to enable me to do this she was impressed children respect adults they cant fool so i taught her new ways to use her talent and how to craft ever more glorious illusions when she came she could make a realistic dollhouse when she left she could craft a realistic castle at the start she could make a miniature storm cloud that seemed to rain on the rug to sofias distress at the end she could make a storm that wailed all around the castle and perhaps most important she learned to make real food that was dull look and taste like the most elegant meal the feel of a glass of water was cool liquid so was the feel of exotic wine so she could get around her limitation deceiving even herself she could drink nothing but green and orange tsoda popka and share it with the rest of usyet it was only water she could eat spicy dragon steak yet it might be mere fruit from a stake plant best of all she could forget to brush her hair yet have it look eloquently coifed i explained to her how she could do even more than that when she grew up she could be as slovenly as question quest she wished in person yet always appear beautiful and well dressed to others then she showed me how well she was learning for she became a beautiful adult woman with a low decolletage then her dress dissolved and she was bare breasted am i sexy now good magician she inquired coyly no i informed her she pouted why not arent my bosoms big enough the term you intend is breast i said you are showing two breasts only one bosom this discussion would have been chancy for a boy but not for a girl as it covered necessary information and so was partially exempt from the adult conspiracy there was a portion of male anatomy that was similarly proscribed for girls whatever she said that gave me pause for just a moment but of course this was not the wily metria it was a coincidental use of the term how big do they have to be there is no actual correct size i said the problem is that yours lack nipples this time the air clouded and there was a distant rumble for that word was really pushing the limit of what the conspiracy allowed but again i was able to plead necessity things can be uttered in the guise of education which can not be even thought of elsewhere iris looked down at her illusion oh two nipples abruptly sprouted then there was the sound of footsteps in the hall and the entire illusion vanished leaving the girl in her ordinary dress tell me more about the illusion of beauty good magician iris said brightly as sofia entered with sandwiches by that token i knew that she understood well enough the limits of the conspiracy sofia despite being mundane would have called a foul instantly had she seen what i had seen the adult conspiracy extends wide and far and few truly compre question quest hend its intricacies but the mothers of children come close so in due course we sent iris home and she was by then a perfectly behaved little girl of seven i had impressed on her that there was more to be gained by pleasing others than by teasing them instead of putting up walls of illusion to avoid taking her castor oil she could thank her mother and make it taste like vanilla syrup i knew that her family would be most pleased with her improved attitude sofia decided to visit her folks in mundania so i gave her a shieldpassing spell and took her to the border i expected her to return with a new appreciation of xanth having been reminded just how dreary mundania is but she surprised me by returning almost immediately excited its gone she exclaimed mundania it cant be yes it is theres just a nothingness there so i had to go look she was right where mundania had been across the isthmus there was a mere void mundania had disappeared now of course this could not be considered much of a loss nobody likes mundania anyway especially the mundanes who have to stew in it all the time depression is rife among them which they seek to ameliorate by taking all manner of mindzonking drugs but sofia was adamant her homeland had been lost and i would have to find it so i sighed and got to work on the problem it turned out that the various parts of the geography of mundania were defined by peculiar numbers called zip codes every year or so a new directory of zip codes was made this year someone in their arcane post orifice whose mascot was a fierce big snail had forgotten thus there was no longer any way to find anywhere and mundania had disappeared into formless glop no one in xanth had noticed the difference question quest in the neighboring realm of course assuming mere was one i had to write a letter and powder it with magic dust and send it to the main office which the letter could reach only because there was nowhere else for it to go in it i explained the problem and urged that the forgotten directory be remembered and issued the snail moved as slowly as ever but in a year my advice was heeded and mundania came back into findability sofia was finally able to make her visit home the odd thing was she reported on her return that nobody in mundania seemed to have been aware of the missing time apparently that world had been suspended and resumed only with the appearance of the new directory what a strange business iris had left at age seven in the year when she was the maidenly age of seventeen she returned this time she was ready to do service for an answer on her own behalf she wanted to know where she could go to have everything her own way that was for a teenage girl a reasonable wish i looked it up in the book of answers there was such a place it was an isle off the east coast of xanth about half way down just beyond the place where themewell i forget what but anyway where it intersected the ocean few folk ever went there yet it was a nice enough place all it needed was some fixing upwhich iris could readily do by means of her illusion so she went there and named it the isle of illusion she crafted the entire island into one big illusion which she changed at her whim everything there was indeed all her own way there she remained for some time gradually discovering that what a person most desires is not necessarily what she really wants in at the age of twentyfour magician trent grew tired of waiting for the aging storm king to blow question quest out and started organizing to take over the throne directly i was in favor of this effort but could not say so i had to maintain overt support of the existing regime trent did not consult me which i appreciated i remained aloof from the politics of the day but i used my spells to watch events closely trent decided that he needed to have a major constituency so as to have a base from which to move against the king and force his abdication he chose the centaur community of central xanth but they refused to join him he made a demonstration of power he went to fish river and changed all its fish into lightning bugs this was an amazing feat because that was a magic river which guarded its waters and sought to nullify any threat against it only an extremely powerful and versatile magician could have overcome that river but centaurs are ornery folksome say stubborn and do not yield readily to demonstrations so trent proceeded to the second part of his program he sent those lightning bugs to harass the centaurs he did this by changing gnats to huge rocs and requiring the birds to anchor themselves to the ground and flap their wings generating a wind to blow the lightning bugs into the centaur village the birds did it because it was the only way they could get changed back to gnats after they blew the lightning bugs trent did change them back the lightning bugs irritable at finding themselves flying in air instead of swimming in the river descended on the centaurs in a raging mass they hurled their little lightning bolts at any flesh they found when the centaurs tried to swat them they made a flanking attack and really zapped those flanks the centaurs smashed at them with their tails but there were so many clouds of bugs that it did little good trent no doubt figured that the centaurs would yield then but he had question quest misjudged them instead they came to me asking for some way to get rid of this scourge their leader alpha centauri made his way through my castle challenges and put their question now i did not want to get involved in this because of the political background so i set a price i thought would make them balk one years service for each centaur my advice rid of the scourge that would be three hundred centaur years an unimagined total but they amazed me by agreeing so i told alpha to go to the hate spring in north xanth dip out a single drop if it dilute it with a thousand parts of regular water and spray the mix on the herd hate elixir is dangerous to the user but highly diluted it merely makes the user detestable for a while the lightning bugs couldnt stand the sprayed flesh and could neither shock it into submission nor feed on it and soon died out now i had three hundred centaurs committed to work for me one year what was i going to have them do well i found things i had one crew build some bridges across thethewell anyway some useful bridges one was oneway and another was invisible so not just anyone could use them they required fine design craftsmanship and workmanship and these were centaur strong points this was a real service to the community though no one remembered it the main crew worked on renovating my castle there had always been a certain rotten odor about it dating from the zombie time and that distressed sofia so we replaced much of it and converted it to a very special design a simple command could cause the rooms and walls to shift position and the moat to change its shape and depth and the trees around it to assume new positions the access paths could change and change again and the entire aspect of the castle could alter in short it was like having a completely different castle outside and in in question quest about two and a half moments that made spring cleaning a delight for sofia she could change everything to be almost unrecognizable it was a womans dream come true the centaurs completed their labors exactly on schedule one year after the deal had been made and departed i made a note not to try to bluff out a centaur next time meanwhile trent now called the evil magician had lost his ploy to enlist the support of the centaurs but he was stubborn too he plowed ahead anyway he marched on the north village employing the simple expedient i had taught him he transformed anyone who tried to interfere into something that couldnt interfere if someone tried to kill him he transformed that man into a fish and let him flop in the ground until he found water or died mere nuisances he changed to harmless animals or plants a man named justin got in trents way and was converted to a tree hi the middle of the village some folk became odd creatures pink dragons twoheaded wolves land octopi or moneypedes one girl tried to give him wrong directions he transformed her into a winged centaur filly she was an attractive specimen of her kindbut the only one of her kind chagrined she fled to the brain coral and begged for sanctuary in its pool it was granted of course and she was soon forgotten others saw the way of it and decided to join the evil magician there was a revolution developing and gaining force the storm king had to use his talent in his own defense he summoned a phenomenal storm but he was now seventythree years old and his powers were failing the storm turned out to be hardly more than wind and rain and a few hailstones it looked as if nothing could stop the evil magician from cornering the storm king and turning him into a rooster roach but the king was cunning he bribed one of trents trusted associates to cast a sleep spel on him question quest this was effective and trent fell asleep in the midst of his final advance his friends hastily bore the body away now the supporters of the king became bold in a way they had not been before and pursued the only way to save the sleeping magician was to get him out of xanth the keeper of the gate at the shield decided to let him through it was after all one way to be quite sure he would never return indeed it seemed that he would not the affairs of mundania are largely opaque to ordinary folk and it was only twenty years later that we were to learn his fate there he settled married had a sonand then lost both to an evil mundane plague this was to have a significant consequence for xanth which is why i mention it otherwise i wouldnt have bothered so the revolution was ended and the storm king was victorious i know i was not the only one who regretted that xanth was destined to continue its mediocrity things continued in their petty pace another dozen years or so then sofia now about sixtyfive years old decided she preferred to return to mundania to die i tried to dissuade her pointing out that i was a hundred and two but that did not change her mind so i had to let her go after thirtyfive years of marriage with regret she had been a very fine sock sorter and it really wasnt her fault that our son went wrong thereafter things were pretty quiet at the castle my son was long gone my wife was gone and i was even more grumpy alone man hi limited company i had thought that all i wanted was to be left alone with my studies in magic but i found that this was too much of a good thing and my socks were piling up horrendously a young woman came her name was starr because she twinkled like a double star that seemed to be her magic at this time i was lonely enough so that i was glad to see anyone even someone with a question so question quest i let her m with only token challenges her question was what could she do with three hummingbirds she had befriended her family objected to the constant music as the birds hummed in chorus so she had to get rid of mem but she couldnt just cast them out into the jungle for one thing they always flew back to her where could she leave them where they would be happy and not follow her home for this she was willing to undertake a years service yes it seemed she was she really cared about those birds i took starr and the birds to the little rose garden in the back the roses were magic dating from my blankedout period and were always red and sweet near them were other flowers more seasonal but still nice the hummingbirds were delighted they hovered near the roses humming a very pretty melody they will like it here i said there is plenty to keep them fed and happy oh thank you the young woman said now what is my service how are you at sorting socks starr wasnt great at that but she learned and the mountain of socks began to be reduced she also fixed me meals which was just as well because i had forgotten to eat for several days and needed reminding good health could go only so far at my age the three hummingbirds turned out to be good company themselves their names were herman helen and hector and they delighted in humming in threepart harmony for any person willing to listen the flowers seemed to like them too i felt almost guilty making stair do a years service because she had really done me a favor by bringing those birds but i had no one else to sort my socks so i said nothing i had been answering questions as a kind of burden because they distracted me from my studies but now i looked forward to visits because they distracted me question quest from my loneliness the greater the problem the more interesting it was for me one case almost stumped me this was a centaur who felt somewhat ambivalent he called himself ambigus he said he felt as if his personality wanted to split i checked everything about him and he seemed normal it would be bad form not to provide an answer i had a reputation to maintain for what little it was worth what was wrong with this creature was it a mere complex of the type that mundanes experienced mundanes i tried one more thing i took gus to the border and spelled us through the shield sure enough when he walked away from the magic ambience of xanth he separated into the basic centaur components a man and a horse that was why he felt like splitting his talent was to split in the absence of magic unfortunately he could not do it in xanth so his choice was either to reside apart in mundania or together in xanth he thought about it while performing his years service for me one case was interesting for another reason who it was it was trojan the horse of another color otherwise known as the night stallion he governed the realm of bad dreams which was accessible only through a hypnogourd he came to me in a dream as he was not comfortable outside the gourd but he had a legitimate question what was a suitable bad dream for writers who wrote about the dream realm such folk were almost immune to ordinary bad dreams because they were constantly devising bad stories themselves and were jaded but they could not be allowed to mess with the dream realm because that could dilute the potency of the dreams i sweated over that one partly because our dialogue was in the form of a bad dream but finally i came up with a satisfactory formula the guilty writer would be taken into a dream which seemed like reality so that he did not know he was dreaming in that dream he question quest would be led into the night stallions very own study and shown a lion this was not a fearsome lion for writers wrote about that kind all the time seeming to enjoy the crunch of bones and splatter of blood no this was an old ill lion its pride gone its teeth were so worn and weak that it could survive only on a diet of soggy puns the writer was required to produce such puns to the satisfaction of a grim person called eddie tor lest he be guilty of letting the lion die if the lion died there would be a real stink but if he failed to make eddie tors unreasonable standards eddie would do beastly things to his prose putting him farther behind there was also a cursed block on his desk which constantly interfered with his vision so that he could not concentrate somehow he had to get around that writers block before he was faced with the dead lion the night stallion was pleased he was sure this would torment any writers enough to prevent them from messing with any more dream stories in fact it might drive some of them out of the trade entirely it was an excellent punishment he repaid me by granting me a bye on future bad dreams for myself no matter how mueh i might deserve them after that i did sleep easier so my life went in its petty pace for about seven years then the muses of parnassus started writing volumes of history of xanth apparently just as a matter of record and my life became infernally complicated chapter bink i rouble came in the form of a seemingly innocent young man of about twentyfive he trudged up to the castle having somehow managed to cross thetheto get through a difficult section of xanth and avoid the inherent dangers of the countryside he evidently had a question so i had ambigus spread the word and retire i really didnt want to be bothered at this time but the man was determined he rode the hippocampus through the moat refusing to be bucked off by the water horse or to lose his nerve and quit the hippocampus had not been trying too hard of course and had he succeeded in throwing the man he would have arranged to notquite trap him in the water allowing him to beat a hasty escape but the man had prevailed that spoke for his stamina then the man explored the huge facade door and found the little door set within it and climbed in through that ambigus had carefully crafted the inner door to be invisible but to yield readily to a push its panel falling out the man located it quickly that spoke for his intelligence finally he encountered the manticora which was a creature the size of a horse with the head of a man question quest body of a lion wings of a dragon and a huge scorpions tail the monster had come to me to ask whether it being only partly human had a soul i told him that only those who had souls were concerned about them satisfied with that obvious answer he was now serving his term of service his instructions being to scare visitors without actually hurting them if he could scare them off good enough if he could not he had to arrange some unobvious way of letting them pass the visitor passed which spoke for his courage well i would have to see what he wanted sometimes i knew well ahead of time but this one was curiously opaque with no reference in the book of answers i would just have to ask him but i wasnt pleased at the prospect i had produced too many love potions for country hicks and beauty potions for girls who hardly needed them and this certainly seemed to be more of the same how i wished a real challenge would appear instead of these nothings the oaf yanked on the bell cord dongdong dongdong as if i wasnt already on my way and i still didnt know his name i didnt want to ask it i didnt want to admit that i the magician of information had not found it listed in my references who shall i say is calling i inquired bink of the north village ha name and origin in one breath both about as unheroic as it was possible to be naturally someone this dull wouldnt be named arthur or roland or charlemagne but i remained annoyed so i pretended to mishear drink of what bink he said getting annoyed himself good bink i looked up at him for this disgustingly healthy young man stood about twice my centurygnarled height i was healthy too but the years had gradually twisted me and i never had been tall or handsome in the way question quest he was what conceivable problem could he have that might ameliorate the dullness of my existence for a moment what shall i say is the business of your master bink i asked still needling the hayseed he clarified that he was bink and was looking for a magical talent he was ready to deliver a years service its robbery but im stuck for it he confided not yet catching on to my identity he assumed i was a servant this was getting better as it went your master gouges the public horrendously this was actually beginning to be fun i played it for another laugh the magician is occupied at the moment can you come back tomorrow tomorrow he exploded in a manner that warmed my heart does the old bugger want my business or doesnt he he had dug himself in deep enough it was time to wrap it up i led him up to my cluttered study and seated myself at my desk what makes you think your service is worth the old gouging buggers while i watched with deep satisfaction as the realization slowly percolated through his thick head at last he knew to whom he was talking he looked suitably crestfallen im strong he finally said i can work i couldnt resist turning the screw just a bit more you are oinkheaded and doubtless have a grotesque appetite youd cost me more in board than id ever get from you probably true but it might be fun having such a naive lunk around he only shrugged at least he had the wit to know how unimportant he was can you read some he said doubtfully so he wasnt much at that good that meant he wouldnt be prying into my precious tomes you seem a fair hand at insult too maybe you could get rid of intruders with their petty problems would he catch question quest the implication that his own problem was as petty as any i could readily ascertain his talent it was probably the ability to make a stalk of hay change color or something similarly banal the storm king required every person to have a talent but most of them were so slight as to be barely worth it that law was barely worth it too maybe he agreed evidently determined not to aggravate me further i had had enough of this well come on we dont have all day i said getting down from my chair actually we did have all day if that was what it took one advantage of boredom is that allday distractions can be welcome especially if they happen to become interesting i decided to try beauregard on this one the demon was still working on his paper fallibilities of other intelligent life after several decades and had finally come to me to ask for some kind of help i had suggested that if he spent a decade or two in the bottle helping me answer the questions of living creatures he should have a rich lode of fallibilities to analyze he had agreed merging service with research and snoozing between times he pretended to be confined to the bottle and to the pentacle though by our agreement neither was tight it was for show so that the visitors wouldnt be terrified by the manifestation of a genuine demon why disabuse them demons were not nearly as horrendous as represented and some like metria or my exwife dana could be surprisingly winsome at times but it could be tricky to deal with them even unknowingly as my son crombie had learned the hard way i lifted the bottle from the shelf and shook it to alert the demon that a show was coming up it wouldnt do to uncork him and have him go right on sleeping i set it in the middle of the fivepointed star painted on the floor i gestured grandiloquently and stepped back out of the figure question quest the demon put on the show the bottles lid popped off and smoke issued impressively from the resulting cloud the figure coalesced about the only thing that detracted from the effect was the pair of spectacles perched on the demons nose but the fact was that demons varied in temperament as men did and this one felt more comfortable using spectacles to read small print just as i did o beauregard i intoned dramatically i conjure thee by the authority vested in me by the compact which was nonsense the only compact was our deal to observe dull visitors without frightening them off tell me what magic talent this lad bink of the north village possesses i could see that the hayseed was suitably impressed by the rigmarole beauregard played it like a pro he oriented impressively on the man step into my demesnes mortal that i may inspect you properly nuhwa bink exclaimed drawing back he was accepting it all at face value beauregard shook his head as if regretting the loss of a tasty morsel of course demons dont eat people they dont eat anything except in rare situations when they have to pass the food along such as when nursing halfhuman babies the demoness dana had not even done that she had lost her soul and bbrrupst she was gone youre a tough nut my turn i didnt ask you for his personality profile whats his magic for beauregard was good at fathoming such things with cursory inspection now the demon concentratedand evinced surprise he has magicstrong magicbut i am unable to fathom it he frowned at me and proffered our usual insult sorry fathead then get ye gone incompetent i snarled just as if meaning it clapping my hands the truth was this was getting considerably more interesting if beauregard couldnt fathom the talent it had to be well beyond the minimum level question quest the demon dissolved into smoke and returned to his bottle to resume his nap no this time he was reading a book i could see him in miniature in there turning a page bink evidently quite impressed stared at the bottle now i got serious i questioned bink but he was ignorant of course so i tried another device the pointer and wall chart i asked questions and the pointer pointed to either a cherub meaning yes or a devil meaning no this only confirmed what beauregard had said strong magic undefined i was really getting interested now this was indeed turning out to be a challenge and was brightening my day i tried a truth spell on him it wasnt that i thought he was being dishonesthe lacked the witbut that this device addressed the magic within him requiring it to clarify itself but when i asked him his talent the manticora abruptly roared it was his feeding time i had been at this chore longer than i had realized time was passing so i went down to feed the manticora who turned out not to be that hungry i dont know what came over me he said suddenly i just had to roar as loud as i could curious i returned to binkwho had like the simpleton he was broken a magic mirror during my brief absence by asking it a question beyond its competence i was disgusted youre a lot more trouble than youre worth i restored the truth spell and started to ask him about his talent again just men the cracked glass fell out of the mirror behind me breaking my concentration what a nuisance i tried a third time and the whole castle shook an invisible giant was passing close by his tread making the earth shudder i realized that more than coincidence was operating here some extremely powerful enchantment was pre question quest venting me from getting the answer that had to be magiciancaliber magic i had thought there were only three persons alive today of that rank but it seems there is a fourth and indeed the joke had turned out to be on me for i had assumed that this was a nothing situation why had my book of answers failed to warn me of the approach of this odd magician three he asked stupidly me iris trent i did not count the storm king he had been a magician but his talent had dwindled with age he was way overdue for replacement but iris was a woman and trent exiled these past twenty years and i certainly didnt want to be stuck with the chore again but if we had here a genuine new magician this was now fascinating in its implications trent he exclaimed the evil magician i explained that trent had not really been evil any more than i was good it was just a popular misconception but i doubted that bink was getting it he still thought in stereotypes and so i had to turn bink away without an answer for it was not safe to probe further it was unsatisfactory in one sense but exciting in another a new magicianwith undefined magic something interesting would surely come of this at this point i suffered a coincidental realization now i understood why a creature like the demoness metria was always alert for new mischief if i as a man hardly over a century in age was so eager for something interesting to pep up my boredom how much worse it must be for a demon who existed for many centuries without any responsibilities or vulnerabilities that didnt mean that i liked metria but i could hardly blame her for her incidental mischief i had been acting a bit like a demon when i tormented the loutish young bink of the north village after that i watched that young man at first he was a severe disappointment all he did was go straight question quest back to the north village crossing on the invisible oneway bridge i had told him about there he was exiled by the storm king who refused to heed the paper i had sent with bink attesting to his undefined magic the storm king didnt like me any better than i liked him my note was probably slightly worse than nothing maybe the notion that there might be significant magic here frightened the king who was now with the fading of his magic technically an impostor bink was deemed to have no magic and was exiled and sent out of xanth beyond the shield that irritated me something awful but all i could do was watch had i realized that the storm king would be that petty i would have looked for some way to bypass him that was a magician the idiot had exiled or had he suspected the truth and that was why he had exiled binkas a possible rival my irritation progressed into something like anger what a fool i had been to give up the throne to that broken wind meanwhile i had another client this was a young woman who called herself chameleon she was plain bordering on ugly her talent was intriguing because it was involuntary in the course of each month she changed gradually from average appearance to beautiful and back through average to ugly the magic mirror showed her physical phases she was truly sublime when on and truly hideous when off her intelligence and personality shifted in the opposite direction counterpointing her appearance thus she was smartest when she was ugliest and stupidest when she was beautiful i verified this with my sources and looked again at pictures of her extremes in the magic mirror at her best she was a creature to make any man even an old grouch like me stop and stare as i was doing now at her worst she was a young crone with a caustic tongue whom no man would tolerate she wanted of course to be rid of her talent as it was doing her no good she was in constant danger of being seduced in her stupidlovely stage or stoned in question quest her smartugly stage only her neutral central stage was suitable she also wanted to win the man she liked who coincidentally was bink it seemed that she had encountered him twice recently once in thethe somewhere dangerous when she was in her lovely phase and they had been separated because of his heroism the other time was in her neutral stage and he had been in the company of a womanhating man named crombie so she had followed bink here and now was begging me for help for a spell for chameleon i did not tell her of my relation to crombie but i felt responsible for bink had liked her all right in her neutral stage but crombies animosity had driven her away crombie had made up some story about how his mother had been able to read minds and had driven his father loco he probably believed that nonsense by now or maybe that was his interpretation of his family life concealing the shame of the mundane mother and a crotchety magician father i had bad news for chameleon her magic was inherent and couid not be eliminated without eliminating her but i did have an answer for which i accepted no payment because it was probably worse than the malady she could go to mundania there she would revert to her neutral state and remain there being neither lovely nor ugly smart nor stupid where is bink going she asked probably to mundania i said heavily then thats where i want to be i stared at her but it did make sense she could have her neutral state and her man together by that grim expedient so i told her of the magic path available and the magic bridge and warned her about not trying to turn back on either and sent her on her way after bink perhaps it was for the best she could gain on him if she hurried and perhaps catch him before he left xanth or better right after because by then she would be into her awfulsmart phase and would need to get out of the magic before showing herself to him question quest it would be nice for them if they could be happy together in mundania it was not a completely dreadful place i knew when properly understood after all i had had thirtyfive years of satisfaction with a mundane wife but i still hated the idea of the loss of that magiciancaliber talent bink had it was such a colossal waste so i watched bink go glumly i think i was glummer than he was but when he passed beyond the shield it suddenly became more interesting for there was a mundane armyand magician trent was leading it my magic mirror could show me scenes as far as the magic went and that was for a certain distance beyond the shield xanth did not end at the shield it was merely circumscribed there trent had returned and in that limited section between mundania and the shield his magic talent was operative things got complicated after that trent captured both bink and chameleon and tried to coerce them into joining his effort to invade xanth from mundania but they refused they tried to escape but trent pursued them and an improbable coincidence got them under the shield where it was damped out by deep water and further coincidences got them through assorted hazards then i was amazed the three now reluctant allies because of the adversity of the xanth jungle made their way to castle roogna itself the castle accepted them even encouraged their progressbecause two of them were magicians it didnt care about the legal structure of xanth it just wanted a magician to be king and renovate the structure and the status of the castle so that it would once more be the center of xanth and that was no bad thing then the three went on from castle roogna remaining together under a truce though bink and chameleon still opposed magician trent the two remained fool question quest ishly loyal to the existing order i shook my head watching them in the mirror it became even stranger the two factions agreed to settle their differences by dueling it was in effect magician against magician and that was dangerous but in the course of the almost unbelievable coincidences that kept trent from transforming bink into something harmless sinks talent became evident he could not be harmed by magic not even magicianclass magic that explained why magical threats had always somehow missed him that was perhaps the most devious and wonderful talent in xanth but trent realizing this was undeterred he simply changed to the use of his sword binks talent did not protect him against purely physical attack but he was saved by the intercession of chameleon who took the strike intended for bink because she loved him at that point trent had had enough he concluded that he did not want the throne at the price of these two young lives he helped bink come to me to fetch healing elixir for chameleon this is a simplification but it will do the full story has been duly recorded by the muse of history then the storm king died and suddenly the entire complexion of things changed the elders naturally asked me to assume the throne and i naturally pointed out that there was now an alternative so it was that magician trent became king after all and castle roogna was indeed restored to its former glory trent married the sorceress iris and made her queen to keep her out of mischief and crombie took up service as a soldier for the king bink married chameleon being satisfied with her as she was changes and all he was made official researcher of xanth so he could explore whatever interested him especially things magical it was in fact a happy ending but things had hardly settled down for me before bink was getting into more complications his wife question quest chameleon was expecting the stork but her phases of beauty and ugliness continued as before she was not pleased having discovered she didnt really want a baby now that it was too late and she compensated by eating a great deal and growing unreasonably fat in the tummy many women did that normally the arrival of the baby thinned such women down in a hurry because they were kept so busy taking care of it but chameleon in her uglysmart stage was surely no joy to be near that was why bink elected to go in search of the source of magic he set off on the adventure with two other dissatisfied males one was chester centaur whose ugly nose was farther out of joint because the arrival of his foal chet had completely distracted his mare cherie the other was crombie the soldier my nowunacknowledged son who was fed up with the imperial female ways of queen iris actually i really couldnt condemn him for that even a normal man would have found her burdensome if constantly exposed his talent for finding things was being put to excellent use pointing the direction they had to go to find that source king trent transformed him into a griffin however so that he could fly and fight and guard the party they were on their way bink riding the centaur they promptly ran afoul of a dragon and a nest of nickelpedes unfortunately those did not turn them aside and all too soon they arrived at my castle they wanted advice for their quest and i knew what they meant this was no innocent jaunt they were seeking the source of magic and that meant they would have to have a fully functional magician along otherwise they would have no chance of success and would probably just get themselves killed even bink himself he could not be harmed by magic but there were plenty of nonmagical dangers in xanth too i hoped to discourage them but bink fought his way into my castle and i had to talk with him when i ex question quest plained that he would have to take a magician along he misinterpreted it completely you old rogue he exclaimed you want to come i hardly made that claim i said with restraint the fact is this quest is entirely too important to allow it to be bungled by an amateur as well trent knew when he sent you here since there is no one else of suitable expertise available i am forced to make the sacrifice there is no necessity however that i be gracious about it so it was that i mothballed the castle and joined the quest i brought along a number of my magicsfolklore claimed i had a hundred spells but that was an understatementand grundy golem who was doing his service for me his talent was translation and the obnoxious little string man was good at it i should know i had animated him four years before for this purpose only to have the ungrateful twerp run away he had returned when he discovered that he wasnt real and asked me how to become real like many ignorant folk he hadnt cared for my answer care it would take him time to fathom it of course unfortunately grundy took pleasure in doing misleading translations of the griffin crombies words stirring up trouble between him and chester who was a pretty ornery centaur to begin with for example he translated centaur as horserear and ass and professed confusion as to which end of the centaur it applied to i stayed out of it as far as i was concerned crombie was a stranger to me until he chose to be otherwise we did not reach our destination by nightfall and sought shelter crombies talent indicated the house of an ogre as a suitable place distrusting this i invoked beauregard we exchanged the usual friendly insults to the probable amazement of the others of course its safe he assured me its your mission thats unsafe he explained that the ogre was a vegetarian so question quest would not crunch our bones this ridiculous assertion turned out to be accurate crunch was a veritable pacifist among ogres so we enjoyed the hospitality of crunch ogre after a bit of repartee and he served us a good meal of purple bouillon with green nutwood then he told us his story rendered into crude rhyming couplets by the golem he had met and loved a curse fiend actress who was playing the part of an ogress and was therefore exquisitely ugly he had snatched her and hidden from the other curse fiends avoiding their massive destructive curse by becoming a vegetarian the curse had oriented on a bone cruncher it was a surprisingly neat ploy for an ogre probably the actress had thought of it for one thing that would prevent him from ever crunching her bones but the mock ogress now lay stunned in a dead forest crunch wanted to know whether to fetch her from there crombie chester and bink recommended that he do so beauregard participating in their dialogue learned the rest of what he needed about the fallibilities of intelligent life on the surface of xanth and returned to his realm to write his dissertation next day we continued on along a magic path to the magic dust village which was inhabited exclusively by women of many humanoid species this was because their men had been lured away by the melody of the siren there were trolls harpies wood nymphs sprites fairies elves centaur fillies griffin cows and even a female golem to keep grundy company that last startled me someone must have made that one recently because there had been no females of his species before now the women were eager for male company indeed they just about buried us in their eager softness the males were of mixed feelings about this some of them being otherwise committed and one being a woman hater question quest then the siren sangand all of us were lured to go to her losing our volition the women tried to hold us back but could not until crombie the womanhater rebelled and pecked in his griffin form at a tangle tree we were passing that got us into a fight with the tree its tentacles wrapped around us crombie fought his way free flew awaybut then returned with the women of the village who attacked the tree with torches fifty of them went after its tentacles under the direction of the woman hater they were grimly determined and courageous i think that was the beginning of the end of crombies problem with women though it would take time for the end of the end to come but before that battle had been concluded the song of the siren came again it mesmerized us we males could not resist its spell though it had no effect on the women but an incident with a battering ram caused a pineapple to explode by chesters head deafening him as a result he could no longer hear the siren and was freed from her spell he fired an arrow through her heart and her music stopped we approached her she was not yet dead she lay on her little isle in a lake she was the loveliest mermaid i had seen in a century with hair like flowing sunshine and tail like flowing water and bare breasts that the adult conspiracy prevents me from describing just in case a juvenile male should happen someday to see these words she was soaked in blood from her wound yet she pleaded only love perplexed by this i consulted my portable magic mirror it confirmed that she intended us no harm so i brought out my via of healing elixir and healed her she was instantly healthy again that type of magic is beautiful to see we learned that though the siren summoned men they inevitably were drawn on to her sister the gorgon at the next isle the gorgons gaze turned men to stone but had no effect on women later as the gorgon ma question quest tured that changed and she stoned men and women and even animals perhaps she should have been recognized as a sorceress for that phenomenal power but for a reason i shall get to in due course i am not objective about that meanwhile the siren was good company she was a mermaid but she was able to make legs so that she could walk on land a certain number of merfolk can do that though they seldom bother she made us a dinner of fish and sea cucumber and a bed of soft dry sponges and we spent the night there next morning we went on to brace the gorgon the others had to be blindfolded and i used the mirror because the stoning spell could not reflect from it while the rest of her did this was special magic called polarization the gorgon turned out to be as lovely as her sister she was fully human in the sense that she had no fish tail but her hair consisted of little serpents it was surprising how prettily they framed her sweet face she was also as innocent as the siren having no notion of the mischief her magic was doing all around her island statues of men stood she thought these were gifts not realizing that they were what remained of the men themselves i tried to explain this to her but was handicapped because her loveliness in the mirror distracted me i wanted to turn and face her directly and did not dare men must not come here anymore i said they must stay home with their families couldnt just one man comeand stay awhile she asked plaintively im afraid not men arent er right for you what a tragedy any man would love this lovely woman if not turned to stone before he had the chance but i have so much love to giveif only a man would stay even a little one i would cherish him for ever and ever and make him so happy the more i talked with her the worse i was feeling question quest you must go into exile i said in mundania your magic will dissipate but she would have none of it i can not depart xanth i love men but i love my home more if this is my only choice i beg of you to slay me now and end my misery i was appalled slay you i would not do that you are the most attractive creature i have ever seen even through a mirror in my youth i would have why you are not old sir she protested and her smile seemed genuine you are a handsome man the three blindfolded males squawked coughed and choked that irritated me for some reason you flatter me i said being flattered but i have other business i knew i had better get on with it quickly because i was in danger of being smitten by this devastating woman in two respects my body turned to stone my heart turned to mush of all the men who had come here you alone have stayed to talk with me the gorgon continued passionately even the little snakes of her hair looked at me beseechingly in the mirror i am so lonely i beg of you stay with me and let me love you always i started to turn my face toward her charmed by this maidenly appeal but my companions warned me in time i demurred though the idea of being loved by such a woman was becoming increasingly attractive i had been alone too long gorgon if i were to look at you directly come close your eyes if you must she said urgently not yet comprehending the danger she represented to men kiss me let me show you how much love i have for you your least word is my command if you will only stay oh my what temptation suddenly i realized how intense my own loneliness had become these eight years since my fourth wife had departed for mundania young women had approached me in this time but i question quest knew it was my power as a magician that appealed to them not my body which was wizened and gnomish or my personality which was grumpy certainly not for my mountain of used socks so how could i trust their motives but the gorgon knew nothing of my background she asked only my presence my dear i think not i said with real regret such a course would have its rewardsi hardly deny itand i might normally be inclined to dally with you a day or three though love be blindfolded but only a magician could safely associate with you and then dally a day or three she exclaimed her bosom heaving in a way that made me feel forty years younger be blindfolded i know no magician would have interest in me but even such a magician could not be more wonderful than you sir she really didnt know she was trying to flatter me one way and succeeding in another how old are you gorgon i asked wickedly tempted i am eighteen i am old enough and i was a hundred and ten what was i thinking of this was the sort of game metria liked to play with men that healing elixir had preserved me remarkably but how could i think of any dalliance with this virtual child i am too old i said with deep regret not all your flattery can change what i know to be true her lovely face clouded over in the mirror the snakes hung limply down as if completely suppressed tears overflowed her eyes and trailed down her cheeks oh sir i beg of you i sighed yielding to an impulse i might later regret perhaps after my present quest is over if you havent changed your mind if you would care to visit at my castle yes yes she cried eagerly where is your castle just ask for humfrey someone will direct you but question quest you will have to wear a veilno even that would not suffice for it is your eyes that do not cover my eyes she protested i must see let me consult i rummaged through my collection of spells i found one that might do the job invisible makeup this is not ideal but it will have to do hold this vial before your face and open it i held it over my shoulder she did so there was a pop as the cork came out and then the hiss of the expanding vapor it shrouded her face and disappearedand her face went with it there simply wasnt anything showing where it had been i lowered my mirror and turned to her but you said she protested not realizing how she had changed i held the mirror up facing her she took it and held it up gazing at her reflection she made a little gasp then she returned the mirror and stepped into me she kissed me how sweet it was her face was there touchable just not seeable how long i have longed to do that with someone she murmured how i thank you marvelous man then she stepped away and i recovered as much of my equilibrium as was feasible companions you may now remove your blindfolds i said the gorgon has been nullified that was a highly misleading statement she had a greater effect on me than ever now the others cleared their blindfolds and gazed at the gorgon for the first time they were obviously impressed i felt a certain suppressed pride i used my magic mirror to contact castle roogna and report on progress queen iris answered using her power of illusion to make her voice heard directly from the mirror her talent had certainly matured but she showed scant appreciation for the training i had given her in her girlhood that was the problem with power it corrupted question quest the gorgon hearing the queen call me good magician finally caught on to my status it dampened her ardor not half a whit she flung her arms around me and planted another invisible kiss on my mouth her hairserpents caught by surprise hissed and snapped at my ear lobes fortunately they were too small to do much harm and they werent poisonous we made our way back to the magic dust village and assured the women that no more men would be taken unfortunately i lacked the power to revert the stone men to life the gorgon might not be a full sorceress but her power was strong enough to withstand any spell i knew that perhaps was part of her appeal certainly i remained somewhat distracted after so unexpectedly encountering so intriguing a creature the ladies provided us with a griffiness as a guide we were going on through the region of madness where thick magic dust made things strange this was the way crombies talent pointed on the way we passed a marvelous region of bugs and i discovered a new species a crayondrawing picturewinged beetle i was thrilled and made careful note of it unfortunately this region of intense magic had mischief for us a midas fly buzzed us getting set to land on me knowing the danger i ducked so low i fell off crombie the fly was about to land on him instead when the female griffin knocked him aside and intercepted the fly they touchedand suddenly she was a solid gold statue she had saved us by sacrificing herself crombie was evidently shaken how was the woman hater to react to a female who had given up her life for him her action was surely a considerable enigma to him of course she might not have done it had she realized that he was not the griffin he appeared but i did not see fit to point mat out now we were without our guide and we all understood the danger of our situation it was late so we had to camp for the night we found the bones of an ancient question quest sphinx and made camp within their protection crombies talent indicated that this was the safest place for us to be but our travails had hardly begun looking for food bink brought me something to check i made an effort to freak out probably only my age prevented me thats blue agony fungus i exclaimed get rid of it for one bite of that would turn a persons whole body blue and he would melt into a puddle that killed the surrounding vegetation yet crombies magic had indicated it was the best possible thing to eat a second check caused him to indicate that it was the worst possible thing to eat which was more accurate what was going on after some confusion we discovered that we were being confused by a chip of what was to become known as reversewood that reversed the magic of the person who touched it what a deadly effect that could be i made a note this variety of magic must have evolved after i did my survey of talents as i had passed through this region without encountering it before then in the night things became more interesting the constellations of the sky came to life chester got into a duel with a centaur constellation soon we were all climbing into the skyuntil grundy brought the reversewood and nullified some of the illusion we were actually climbing a tree this was certainly the region of madness seeing our retreat the constellations came down to the ground to attack us when we fought them off they dumped a sky river on us trying to drown us this was probably a thunderstorm in real life but the effect was the same we were drenched and miserable we were saved in the end perhaps by that same reversewood because it caused grundy golem to reverse his selfish nature and care about us and help us make our way out there was a certain irony in that but we were beyond caring question quest we proceeded on toward lake ogrechobee where the curse fiends dwelt i wanted to save a bit of that reversewood because it could be useful but when i tried to conjure it into a bottle it reversed the spell and put me in the bottle instead the others found that very funny but after several tries i did manage to secure the wood then i investigated the source of the mysterious mounds of dirt that kept popping up near us these turned out to be the work of squiggles one of the branches of the great family of voles the creatures zipped along just under the ground leaving the dirt behind was it spying on us if so why my magic mirror was not providing a clear answer perhaps the underground habitat of the creature obscured the image to safely approach the curse fiends who it seemed were on our route to the source of magic we had to diminish our number i conjured crombie and grundy and me into a bottle which bink and chester would carry they would take waterbreathing pills i had provided so as to be able to walk on the bottom of the lake i was not entirely sanguine about this arrangement but we had to chance it thus we found ourselves in a nicely carpeted chamber the outside world seemed far removed say were traveling in style grundy remarked the griffin squawked well youd think so if you were in manform beakbrain the golem retorted understanding crombie perfectly i liked the magic mirror which i had similarly shrunk it showed what was happening outside the bottle better than the glass wall did because the mirror lacked distortion and was not confined to dinks pocket bink and chester walked under the lake and encountered the curse fiends wouldnt you know it they managed to aggravate the fiends and had to plunge into the central whirlpool which traversed the underwater city the bottle we were inwas flung free and went rushing question quest out of control in the fierce current we were in for it now it was a horrendous ride i was trying to watch the outside realm in the mirror so that i could keep track of where we were assuming we survived but the violence of the water made our chamber whirl around dozens of times it banged into a wall or stone and i went banging into the floor of our chamber the mirror flew from my hand and shattered against the wall then the motion ceased i picked myself up and grundy and crombie picked themselves up we were shaken but not hurt it could have been another story had the bottle we were in smashed as it was the furniture was scattered and overturned and part of the carpet had been wrenched askew next time lets not let idiots carry us grundy said and the griffin squawked agreement i would have been hard put to disagree i picked up the largest fragment of the mirror it remained operative the magic was in the glass not the shape or frame i held it carefully it remained oriented on bink bink was at this moment rousing from his strewn condition at the edge of the lake our bottle floated in he dragged himself up and found chester centaur he picked up a shard of glassand it was from the magic mirror it must have flown right out from the bottle though the bottle remained sealed i wasnt sure exactly how that was possible i would have to investigate the phenomenon when i had leisure bink saw me in the shard he waved i waved back we had established contact but already our bottle was being carried along in the current and the lake was becoming a river we had not been all that close to bink and chester to begin with and now we were moving away from them well we dont need to hide anymore grundy said lets pop the cork and come out into the real world before we get worse lost question quest not applicable i said now tuning the fragment to the water around us why not he demanded in that obnoxious way of his several reasons one is that i cant as you so quaintly put it pop the cork from inside this bottle is designed to contain what is in it whether it be hate elixir or a demon the spell on the cork makes it impervious to pressure from inside another is that if we did get out we would abruptly resume our full size and quite possibly be stuck in a channel that is less than that size i showed him a flash of the outside where the river boundaries had constricted considerably a third is that the water may be poisonous a fourth the griffin squawked i agree grundy said dourly threes enough there was nothing to do but ride along hoping that bink would in due course find us since he had the other shard from the magic mirror this was possible then he could open the battle and we would be reunited whats the idiot doing now grundy asked evidently suffering a similar thought i reoriented the shard bink was now scrambling through a hole in the cavern wall he came to a streamlet and was about to wangle a drink from it the fool i exclaimed aw he must be thirsty grundy said thats the flow from a love spring i said i recognized the glint of the water from long practice helplessly we watched bink drink then encounter a nymph who was typical of her species long of leg pert of bottom slender of waist full of bosom and largeeyed of face she was sorting through a keg of jewels which represented enormous wealth for those who cared for that sort of thing there were diamonds pearls emeralds rubies opals and other precious stones of many colors and sizes question quest hoo grundy exclaimed what i wouldnt give for that nymph and that tub of gems precisely and bink had just taken a love potion his talent protected him from magic harm but didnt define love as harm it didnt care that he was married his talent was happy to let him have a little uninnocent fun with an innocent nymph i checked a reference for i had reduced my collection of tomes and had them with me in miniaturized bottles this was jewel the nymph perhaps the most important rock nymph in xanth for she it was who placed the precious stones for others to find her barrel was never ending no matter how many she removed it remained full she probably had a soul unlike the useless nymphs whose sole purpose was to run around barelegged and tease men jewel even had a talent she smelled the way she felt whether this was of fresh pine needles or burning garbage many women did smell but they had to apply perfume jewel did it naturally of all the folk for bink to encounter she was perhaps the worst because she was a nice person with a necessary job who should be neither hurt nor distracted she was bound to suffer both fates now jewel helped bink and chester travel she summoned a giant of the vole family of creatures a diggle who worked for a song chesters magic talent had manifested by this time he could conjure a silver flute which played beautiful music by itself this flute now charmed the diggle so that it was happy to carry them through the solid stone then they encountered the demons there was beauregard suddenly i knew what i was in for sure enough he just couldnt resist conjuring me out of the bottle fortunately he didnt make me do anything bad we had crombie point out the direction of our bottle from where bink was so he could find it meanwhile the bottle was floating down to the deepest subterranean lake my references could not get a question quest line on where it was going there was powerful evil magic here i did not like this at all you know somethings been spying on us as we travel grundy remarked ive got the feeling were floating into its clutches that was my own impression i had not discussed it because it seemed pointless to alarm the others but maybe i could get out of the bottle and then pull it to safety and wedge the cork off grundy continued no living thing or inanimate thing can pass the cork from inside i reminded him grimly yes but that shard of glass got out maybe because its a nonliving yet animate thing it animates whatever picture you want to see im not exactly living or dead i might be able to get out too i was amazed he could be right see if you can pass i agreed he went to the neck of the bottle and pushed against the cork it didnt budge but he went on through it in a moment he was out he resumed his normal size which wasnt much larger than the bottle but the bottle was floating hi the dark pool and the golem could not get to solid land his body was made of bits of wood and cloth and string he would not be able to swim well enough so we would still have to wait for the bottle to get close enough to land for grundy to do anything bink and chester and jewel the nymph arrived riding the diggle they spied the bottle and headed for it we were about to be rescued then the trap sprang grundys little mind was taken over by a hostile power now he wrapped his string arms around the cork braced his feet against the neck of the battle and hauled out the cork by the power of the brain coral emerge he gasped oh no he was summoning me and crombiein the name of the enemy for suddenly that hostile force overwhelmed my mind and i knew that this was the question quest thing that had opposed us and spied on us it was the brain coral a creature that could not move because it was locked in its subterranean pool but had tremendous magic and intelligence it correctly regarded binks magic as a threat to its interests so had done everything it could to eliminate him as a threat it had to act through other agencies but was quite facile in that respect it had sent a magic sword to kill bink and the dragon and had caused the siren to lure him to the gorgon but binks talent had foiled all these threats seemingly coincidentally the midas fly had been intended for him and the great curse of the curse fiends but only with the spell of the love potion had it been able to compromise him at all that he had actually turned to his advantage because instead of dissipating his energy chasing the nymph he had enlisted her help but now it had found a way to accomplish its purpose it had taken over the golem and caused the golem to invoke crombie and me from the bottle we now had to serve the brain coral that meant that all my magic and knowledge and intelligence were ranged against bink and that was the most formidable challenge he had faced since his duel with magician trent other facts came into my mind as i assimilated the tremendous information of the brain coral the cork had been partly dislodged from our bottle before a seeming coincidence that would have enabled me to rejoin bink but the corals magic had arranged to have it jammed back grundy had escaped then and clung to the bottle but the coral had made it seem that he remained inside i should have realized that if one shard of glass could get out so could other things the real battle had been over control of this bottle and bink had almost recovered it but the coral had just managed to take it as it floated into the center of the corals region of power now my resources were at the disposal of the brain coral i had to try my best to make bink give up his quest for the source of magic and go away for that was question quest the corals objective to prevent bink from accomplishing his mission this i told bink urging him to depart immediately i had to admire his stubbornness he refused to quit though it meant open combat between us i opposed him directly while crombiegriffin would nullify chester centaur it did come to combat unfortunately after a horrendous fight crombie succeeded in knocking chester into the pool where the coral quickly took him under and in meanwhile bink had been able to nullify or avoid my myriad spells that talent of his was truly amazing perhaps it was the strongest talent in xanth for all its subtlety but now it was two against one and the griffin could attack him physically still he did not yield he had once been relatively clumsy with the sword but crombie himself in human form had trained him and now that sword was deadly bink managed to injure the griffin and hurl him into a crevice where he could fight no more this despite the distraction of the spells i was hurling against him that was too impressive for comfort and in the end bink actually won i think the brain coral was as surprised as i was i had to yield to him he had the nymph sprinkle healing elixir on the sadly wounded griffin who jumped up as if to attack bink again the nymph jumped between the two dont you dare she cried with the odor of burning paper that was an extraordinary act for a nymph as the breed is generally pretty emptyheaded it was in retrospect a significant event yet another aspect of binks extremely powerful and subtle talent the brain coral reconsidered it agreed to show bink the source of magic now believing that if he knew the truth he would come to agree with the corals position the source of magic was the demon x lh who resided in the nethermost cave and whose thoughts were question quest in the form of fluxes through the cave he was one of a number of such extremely powerful entities the very rock near him was charged with magic because of the trace leakage of it from his body when this rock welled out to the surface it became the magic dust which spread the magic to the rest of xanth he did not like to be disturbed the demon was playing a game with others of his kind which was the only way to alleviate the boredom that came to otherwise omnipotent creatures its rules were obscure to those of us with merely mortal comprehension one aspect of this game was that a mortal such as bink could by a single word free the demon from his selfimposed captivity now it was clear why the brain coral one of tlie most powerful entities of xanth because it was closest to the source of magic had labored to keep bink away corai was afraid bink would do something unutterably stupid such as releasing the demon xcan who would then depart leaving xanth without magic that would be disaster sure enough bink wrestled with his concept of honor and did the most stupid imaginable thing he freed the demon instantly x th was gone and with him the magic of xanth there followed the most unpleasant few hours in the history of xanth for it was a sorry place without magic yet somehow it all worked out for the demon returned after certain incidental complications he made grundy golem fully real and gave bink a special gift all his descendants would have magicianclass magic in return it was agreed that the ordinary creatures of xanth including man would be barred from access to the demon so as not to bother him further so bink had come out ahead after all just as if his talent had planned it that way which was impossible yet maybe not and my son crombie as a result of his experience question quest with jewel the nymph who had sprinkled the healing elixir on him and stood up to him when he threatened to attack bink again because she loved binkhe had realized that if only such a creature were to love him crombie she would be worth marrying so he set aside his hatred of women and took a love potion to use on her and they were in due course married thus my most significant failure was abated my son had become a family man all because of bink i shook my head reflecting on that how phenomenally i had misjudged that young man the first time i encountered him he had enabled magician trent to return and become king and he had discovered the true source of the magic of xanth and he had restored my son to a proper life and as it turned out he had virtually singlehandedly ended the dearth of magicians and sorceresses in xanth thus helping to usher in what might prove to be the bright age so soon after the dark age yet even then i had underestimated binks impact for he had also affected my own life most significantly it merely took another sixteen years for that to become fully apparent chapter gorgon i returned to my comparatively dull existence at the castle somehow it no longer satisfied me as it had before something was missing from my life but i wasnt sure what meanwhile the chain of supplicants continued at the rate of about one a month most were routine i solved their problems made them serve their year and sent them on their way but one nymph surprised me she had come to ask me for a spell to turn off a faun who was pursuing her she lived outside the main encampment of her kind and did not forget each day as it passed though most nymphs did every day this faun came after her remembering nothing and she was tired of it so i dug in my collection of spells and found a faun repellent she could use this on him early in the day each day and be free for the rest of it that was ideal she said she was quite satisfied with this remedy but as it happenecj there was no useful service she could do for me for a day let alone a year i had someone to fix my meals and someone else to sort my socks and someone else to figure out a suitable set of challenges for the next person who came with a question i didnt want to let the nymph go without service be question quest cause that would set a bad precedent but neither did i want her hanging around the castle doing nothing what was i to do i asked the magic mirror i now had several of these having long since gotten rid of the one that became unreliable with time this one merely showed a cherub felling over with laughter no help there the problem with competent mirrors was that they also tended to be too bright and found ways to express themselves that i did not necessarily appreciate but even so a bright mirror was better than a dull one so i did what i didnt like i told the nymph that i had no use for her and she was free to depart i asked her not to bruit the news about lest others be dissatisfied by unequal treatment but to my surprise she refused she had her answer and she intended to pay for it she wouldnt leave until her year was done that was exactly what i didnt want but there wasnt much i could do about it so i assigned her a room and hoped something would turn up that night when i finished my researches and went to my hard cold lonely pallet to sleep i discovered it occupied the nymph was there i think i have found something i can do for you good magician she said then she clasped me and kissed me and lay down with me and somehow my pallet was no longer hard cold or lonely i had forgotten what nymphs were for but in the course of that year i remembered a man could not summon the stork with an ordinary nymph for they were not subject to that call but he could do a heroic job of imitation jewel the nymph had not been ordinary she had a soul and could do anything a normal woman could but regular nymphs were made for pleasure without responsibility so the storks ignored them how could a person take proper care of a baby if she did not remember her activity from one day to the next this one wasnt interested in marriage just in completing her service i had to agree that i was satisfied question quest in fact when her year was done i was sorry to see her go after that when a similar creature elected to serve in that manner i did not protest i now knew what was missing from my life it was a woman but who would want to marry a centuryplus old gnome of a man then in eleven years after our meeting the gorgon came with a question she was now a marvelously developed woman of twentynine and to my eye the most ravishing creature imaginable but of course i couldnt tell her that this was business we had set challenges of course when i can i tune them to the individual person but sometimes they are allpurpose for whoever conies we had a foghorn guarding the moat and it was lovely to see it operate when the gorgon tried to cross in the boat provided the horn blasted out such columns of fog that she couldnt see or hear anything in that obscurity her boat turned around and came back to the outer shore that was the boats magic it had to be steered or it returned to its dock one of my prior querents had built it for me during his service when the fog cleared the gorgon was a sight her snakehair was hissing with frustration and her dress was plastered to her body i had thought that body to be voluptuous now i knew i had underestimated its case i remembered our dialogue and how she had seemed to dote on me in the brief time of our encounter naturally she would have forgotten that but it was a fond reminiscence if onlybut why be foolish the gorgon was no dummy she pondered a moment then set out again this time she steered the boat directly toward the foghorn the one thing she could hear since it was inside the moat she soon completed the crossing i think i would have been disappointed had she not figured this out she navigated the other two challenges successfully and entered the castle i braced myself and met her she was even more impressive from aclose than she had question quest been from afar her face was heavily veiled including her deadly eyes but the rest of her was nevertheless stunning i was now a hundred and twentyone years old but in her presence i felt more like eightyone i remembered the surprising delight of our first encounter when i had made her iace invisible so that she would no longer stone any man who met her gaze that spell would have been aborted at the tune of no magic of course all the men she had stoned had returned to life then and of course she had let them go i knew i should tackle her question and give her an answer but i was reluctant to terminate our second contact quickly so i dallied somewhat what have you been up to gorgon i inquired in as close an approximation to sociability as i could manage it was an effort but less of one for her than for others because i didnt care about others after the time of no magic my face was restored and since i didnt want to make any more mischief in xanth i went to mundania where there is no magic as you recommended i hated to do it for i love xanth but because i love xanth i had to leave it so as not to do it any harm her face went wry behind the veil i could see the outline of the expression mundania was colossally dreary but what you had told me was true i was normal there and my face did not stun anyone so i bore with it and found employment as an exotic dancer for it seems that mundane men enjoy the appearance of my body i tried to wrench my eyes from that same body embarrassed mundanes are odd i mumbled feeling like the hypocrite i was but in time i got to miss xanth too much to bear she continued blithely taking a breath that threatened to pop a button on her decolletage or a lens on my spectacles the magic the magical creatureseven the ogres and tangle trees had become fond memories i realized that i had been born to magic it was part of my being and i just couldnt endure without it but i question quest also did not want to do harm so i have returned and come to the man i most respect and that is you um i said foolishly flattered but when i returned to xanth after several years i discovered that my talent had matured along with my body she continued sighing it was some sigh my old eyeballs threatened to overheat originally i stoned only men now i stone men and women and animals and even insects its much worse than it was obviously she wanted another invisibility spell for her face i could readily give her that then she would perform some service and be gone and i would be twice as lonely as before but i had to do it evidently your talent is not far short of sorceress class i said ordinarily that would be an asset perhaps when im a mean old woman ill enjoy stoning folk she said but now i am in my prime and i dont she was certainly in her prime what is your question i asked knowing too well what it was would you marry me i do have another vial of invisible makeup i said then something registered what would you marry me that is your question i asked dumbfounded it is this is not a joke this is not a joke she assured me understand im not asking you to marry me i merely want to know whether you would if that were my desire in this manner i seek to spare us both the unpleasantness of rejection oh i had to stall because suddenly my heart was beating at a rate somewhat beyond my age if you really want my answer you will have to give me a years service of course in advance of course question quest i was amazed at the readiness of her agreement it was evident that she had thought this out and preferred a considered answer to an extemporaneous one perhaps she believed that i would be more likely to be affirmative if she associated with me for a while in that she was grossly mistaken i was locked into affirmation the moment i saw her approach the castle the reason for my delay in answering was other than my private preference so the gorgon worked for me a year i made her face invisible again of course because otherwise her veil might have slipped sometime and made a nuisance now she could go around unveiled which was easier the first thing she did was tackle my mountain of socks she was good with them which was an excellent sign next she tackled the castle getting it organized and cleaned up she went through my study and put all my papers and vials in order when my mealfixing maid completed her service and departed the gorgon took over that too she even tended the roses in back she was good at everything she tried and i was better off than i had been in decades i no longer needed other assistance around the castle the gorgon was running it i treated her in a cursory manner in fact i was downright grumpy i called her girl and i was never quite satisfied with what she did now you might wonder about this my reason was simple i had been intrigued by her when she was a maiden of eighteen and fascinated by her as a woman of twentynine her mere proximity caused my pulses to pulse there was it has been said no fool like an old fool and the gorgons competence appearance and power of magic had made a conquest of me in a matter of moments i had loved mareann i had loved rose of roogna now i loved the gorgon she was considering marrying me then she deserved to see what marriage to such a gnome was like question quest i was showing her the worst of me deliberately if that didnt alienate her nothing would surely it would alienate her but it had to be done in fairness the gorgon with her face masked was simply more of a woman than i deserved yet she survived even that challenge of mistreatment and when her year of service concluded i gave her my answer yes i would marry you if you asked i would go to hell for her if she asked she considered that there is one other thing i shall want a family i have too much love for just a man it must overflow for a child im too old to summon the stork i said there is a vial of water from the fountain of youth on your shelf she said you can take some of that and be young enough there is fountain of youth elixir i didnt know that thats why you need a woman around the castle you cant even keep track of your socks she had me there still i would have to be a great deal younger to for the truth was that pleasant as it had been to have the company of certain nymphs in the past i had seldom gotten to that stage with them knowing that it made no difference if i should have to do it for real would i be able i had realistic doubt why dont we find out i will spend the night with you and you can take drops of elixir until you are young enough she was nothing if not practical which was yet another trait i liked the notion intrigued me it might require more elixir than i had but i could go fetch more tomorrow i of course knew where the fountain of youth was so that night she came to me with the vial and she wore a translucent nightdress suddenly i felt forty years younger and wished it were eighty she kissed me her face was invisible but solid i could feel her lips on mine my feeling of age reduced another twenty years i hadnt yet taken a drop of elixir question quest of course feeling is not the same as being and my body did lag somewhat behind i might have the aspirations of a younger man but lacked the capacity rather than go into tedious detail i will say that each drop of youth elixir took ten years off my age and that two drops turned out to suffice at a physical age of a hundred and two with close proximity to that gorgeous creature i discovered i was young enough health youth and love carried the night i knew it would have taken several more drops with any other woman however and so we were betrothed though we did not rush to marriage and thereafter every decade or so i took another drop of youth elixir so as to keep my physical age at about a hundred with one exception i will cover in due course the happiest period of my later life was upon me i hope this was true for the gorgon too meanwhile less interesting events continued sinks son dor was of course a magician thanks to the demons largess he could talk to the inanimate and make it respond but he was dissatisfied because he lacked the physical stature of his father and was bullied by other boys so he went on a quest to the past of eight hundred years before to fetch the elixir of restoration that would enable millie the maid to restore her zombie friend jonathan to life dor was now twelve years old which was young but he was a bright boy and of course his status as magician enormously expanded his capabilities naturally much of this had to be explained to him and he came here to inquire because he was a magician and probable future king of xanth i did not charge him a years service instead i made a deal with him i would enable him to undertake his quest and he would bring me information on a period in the history of xanth whose details were somewhat obscure but i did set up challenges as a matter of form dor came with grundy golem who was now a real live question quest person but still small and with a mouth larger than the rest of him they came to the moat and found it guarded by a triton a merman with a tripletipped spear dor used his talent to make the water of the moat talk in his voice leading the triton astray while he swam under the surface by the time the triton caught on dor was safely inside that had been an elementary challenge and an elementary response the next challenge was a needle cactus ready to shoot its needles into anyone who passed by but dor pretended he was a fireman who would burn anything that touched him and cowed the cactus into letting him pass unneedled that demonstrated the lads cleverness the third challenge was one of courage the gorgon stood where he had to pass dor was terrified but barged ahead blindly literally he kept his eyes closed so that he could not meet her gaze and be stoned and that was his victory he had gone forward instead of back courage as i understand it relates not to fear but to how a person handles the fear he has and dor handled it as well as could be expected for a boy his age so i helped dor make a deal with the brain coral who was no longer our enemy the coral used dors body during dors absence and dor went back to occupy the body of a grown barbarian hero or so it seemed this is an aspect that few understand dor was visiting the image in the tapestry rather than the original setting so the setting was much smaller than it seemed he was not mansized and neither were the other folk he was tiny but this had no affect on his activity which was independent of size with one exception dor had quite an adventure the gorgon and i kept track of it all he encountered what he took to be a giant spider jumper who in our realm is a tiny arachnid and they were great companions that was the exception dors interaction with the spider on an even question quest basis jumper had gotten snagged by the adaptation spell and been brought into the adventure lifesize to jumper it had seemed as if he had entered a realm where human folk were his size dor encountered millie the maid in her seventeenyearold youth and of course was somewhat smitten by her her talent remember is sex appeal and even at the age of twelve he felt its potency he helped king roogna save his castle from encroachment by the goblins and harpies who were at war with each other he met evil magician murphy and neosorceress vadne who in a fit of jealousy rendered millie into a book that was why millie became a ghost when the book was found and restored in contemporary times millie became a maid again in the end dor learned something about manhood and brought back the elixir of restoration and used it to restore jonathan the zombie who turned out to be the zombie master who had first occupied this very castle thus dor had an effect on my life too for jonathan and millie married and moved in with us there was nothing to do but share the castle as the zombie master did have a prior claim on it later he built a new castle zombie and moved there with his family so we were no longer so crowded you may wonder how all this came to pass when dor had entered only the magic tapestry of history rather than the real period of xanths history the answer is that there are intricate connections between the two and the magic worked to make what dor did have real effect he might not have been there physically in the way he thought but what he did was real a fuller understanding is impossible for anyone not well versed hi esoteric magic millies talent was sex appeal remember and she was certainly the sexiest creature i encountered naturally it took almost no time for her and jonathan to summon the stork and the effort was so effective that the stork brought two babies those were hiatus and question quest lacuna with the talents of growing eyes ears and noses on things and of changing print they were cute tykes but capable of enormous mischief in feet they performed remarkably when the gorgon and i got married four years later in prince dor was then sixteen and serving as temporary king while king trent was visiting mundania so it fell on him to perform the ceremony of marriage for us the zombie master and millie handled the details for all that it was accomplished and thereafter the gorgon and i settled down to married life she was my fifth wife though at that time i suspected she was the fourth because of the period blanked from my memory by the lethe elixir in the stork brought our son hugo named after the combination of the first syllables of our names we waited until we determined hugos talent before announcing his arrival and that took a while and then it was an imperfect talent so word was slow to get around hugo could conjure fruitbut because his magic was flawed the fruit was often of poor quality or even rotting that was an embarrassment nevertheless the gorgon lavished her love on nun and he had a gentle character i made it a point to pay some attention to him because of what had happened to my son crombie and tried to involve him in my activities when possible later the princess sorceress ivy was to associate with him and in her presence he became all that any family could wish for unfortunately he relapsed to normal in her absence meanwhile things were proceeding elsewhere crombie and jewel the nymphs daughter tandy grew up to the age of nineteen suffered the attentions of the demon fiant and managed to flee on a night mare she came to this castle in the year asking how she could be free of the demon and served as a house maid for a year awaiting my answer i did not mention the fact that she was my granddaughter to her that was not relevant to the issue presumably crombie would inform her when he deemed it appropriate but i must question quest admit that i rather liked her spunk she was a pretty girl with brown hair and bluegreen eyes and her personality was pleasant i wanted to do right by her so that she would not think ill of me at such time as she learned x must admit it i was proud of her now some answers are more complicated than others those involving demons can be troublesome because demons are more or less immortal and are difficult to bar from any place my castle was specifically spelled to exclude them but when tandy departed it she would be subject to the attentions of her demon lover again i did not have any spell which would adapt to a particular person to discourage demons what could i tell her then the following year just as tandys term of service finished crunch ogres son smash arrived with a question he had forgotten ogres are not the brightest creatures fortunately i knew what was bothering him he was dissatisfied with his life you see smash was not an ordinary ogre his mother was a curse fiend which is a euphemism for human stock so he was half human regular ogres remember were justly proud of three things their outrageous strength their grotesque ugliness and their horrendous stupidity deep down inside where it was so well hidden that even smash was not aware of it he had a certain human weakness human handsomeness and human intelligence he would have been so embarrassed to learn of these qualities that his blush would have fried all the fleas on his hairy body but these subterranean qualities nevertheless were having their muted effect polluting his pristine ogre nature and making him vaguely dissatisfied he wanted to know how to restore his satisfaction as an ogre and i had no good answer because i knew that this half ogre could never be satisfied unless he recognized his true heritage and came to terms with it smash had grown up near castle roogna and was a friend of prince dor and princess irene dor was con question quest sidered a prince because he had magiciancaliber magic which qualified him to be king in due course irene was a princess because she was the daughter of the king and queen definitions are somewhat loose in xanth thus he had picked up certain human sensibilities which further compromised his ogrehood no ordinary ogre would have thought to come to me for an answer so there i was stuck for two answers simultaneously how could i free tandy of the attentions of a demon and how could i make smash satisfied to be what he was and the solution came to me with such a flash that the edges of my assorted tomes tfirned brown and the magic mirror winced i had to blink for several moments before my sight was fully restored these two problems canceled each other out if tandy kept company with an ogre even a demon would think two and a half times before molesting her and if smash got to know a humannymph girl well he would discover the rewards of being partly human she would be protected and he would be satisfied so i gave them both my answer which of course neither understood they were to travel together in smashs case it was both answer and service he was to protect tandy smash was too stupid to formulate his protest well but it was obvious that keeping company with a human girl was somewhere near the top of his limited list of things not to do tandy was more specific if he gobbles me up ill never speak to you again she told the gorgon they had what i found to be an instructive adventure because smash did something so stupid only an ogre could have managed it he looked into the peephole of a hypnogourd he got locked into the realm of the bad dreams but remained too stupid to be afraid and did significant damage to the dream settings he terrorized the walking skeletons who were not accustomed to having their tables turned in this manner one of them question quest by the name of marrow bones got lost at this time finally the night stallion himself had a showdown with him and smash lost half his soul he also encountered a number of females of other species and in his fumbling way managed to help them find husbands notable among these were blythe brassie of the realm of the gourd and chem centaur chester and cheries filly maybe that was later no matter but in the end smash did protect tandy and she did impress on him certain advantages of being a man they married and when tandy was twentyone the stork brought them their son esk my great grandson they called him an ogre but technically he was only a quarter ogre and looked human except when he got really angry he was to grow up to marry blythe brassies daughter bria who like most of her kind was as hard as brass but could be surprisingly soft when she wanted to be i was sorry i never got to meet esk in person because there were aspects of him that might have favored me but i was otherwise occupied at the tune when a meeting would have been convenient however the female who had more direct impact on my life was night mare imbrium she was an ancient creature a sea of the moon had been named after her but she looked just like a small black horse in the confusion surrounding smash ogres dealing with the realm of the gourd she got half of chem centaurs soul and did not turn it in as a result she was corrupted by it and became too softhearted to remain effective in delivering bad dreams finally she was allowed to go out into the regular world of xanth to do two things to bear a message to king trent beware the horseman and to see the rainbow but things seldom go right when minor characters of this drama become major ones the horseman was a creature who could assume the aspects of both man and horse not in the manner of a centaur but as one or the other separately his talent was the making of a line of sight that could not be broken between a persons eye question quest and the peephole of a gourd he used it to connect king trent to the gourd making him unable to function this occurred just as the nextwave came for the shield no longer protected xanth the horseman was working with the nextwavers it was a bad time for xanth when dor assumed the crown of xanth the horseman did the same to him then the zombie master assumed the role and he too was taken then it was my turn i had to do the thing i detested and be king again all because mare imbri had not been able to deliver the warning message in time to avert disaster i was properly disgusted it was grundy golem who rode the night mare to bring me my bad dream i was not exempt from this one because it was real my castle defenses were useless against mare imbri of course she galloped right through the walls and stepped out of my bookshelf i looked up from my tome so it has come at last to this i grumped for a century i have avoided the onerous aspect of politics and now you folk have bungled me into a corner technically it was only ninetysix years since i had quit the throne of xanth but i had not meddled in politics for the last decade of my kingship leaving that to the maiden taiwan yes sir grundy said with seeming humility you have to bite the bullet and be king xanth has no bullets thats a mundane anachronism but that wasnt quite accurate because there before me on the shelf was a row of magic bullets im not the last magician of xanth you know but they would have none of it they did not realize that bink was a magician and arnolde centaur wasnt human and iris and irene were female so i was stuck with it the worst of it was that i knew i would fail because i was destined to do something calamitously stupid thats what really bothered me making that mistake for it was written in the book of answers it is not for the good magician to break the chain the question quest chain of tost kings obviously i had prepared by removing the spell from the gorgons face now she was heavily veiled so that her aspect would not stone any creature who gazed upon it but if she encountered the enemy she would whip that veil aside well she knew the danger oh my lord she said with unaccustomed meekness must you go into this thing cant you rule from here she had packed my lunch and a change of socks knowing my answer i had already told her to fetch her sister the siren for this encounter and i had restored the sirens broken dulcimer so that she could summon mundanes to their doom but i knew that i would not be the king for whom they served it would be one of my successors i told grundy to watch my castle while i was gone the gorgon would use my magic carpet to fetch her sister and reunite her with her dulcimer meanwhile i mounted mare imbri who was solid by daylight now and we headed for castle roogna how i hated all this i was too old for such adventure but it had been thrust upon me mare imbri being female was naturally curious about what was none of her business she formed a dreamlet which showed her as a blackgowned and rather attractive human woman her hair in a long ponytail why didnt you let the gorgon be with you this dream woman asked me she really seems to care for you of course she cares for me the idiot i snapped shes a better wife than i deserve always was always will be but then because i dont want her to see my ignominious doom my wife will perform better if not handicapped by hope that is a cruel mechanism the dream woman said as the mare carried me into the eye of a gourd for rapid transit no more cruel than the dreams of night mares i question quest retorted but of course imbri herself had lost that meanness that was why she was no longer a night mare by profession we arrived at castle roogna i made clear to queen iris that bink was to be the next king after me his talent of not being harmed by magic might be useless against the mundanes but he was a full magician and that was what counted after that i informed her it would be arnolde centaur and after him iris asked tightly if the full chain of future kings were known i pointed out our hidden enemy might nullify them in advance what can i do to help save xanth she asked she evidently thought i was getting senile bide your time woman in due course you will have your reward the single thing you most desire for so that too was written though i had forgotten what it was she most desired then i took a nap and mare imbri trotted out to the zombie graveyard to graze later we went to the place of my ignominy the baobab tree there i met imbris friend the day horse a handsome white stallion and there it was i performed my most colossal act of folly i failed to recognize my enemy when i saw him for the day horse was the equine aspect of the horseman and he connected my vision to the gourd and i was gone i found myself locked in the realm of bad dreams instead of passing through it as i had when riding mare imbri i was in a castle chamber which was pleasantly appointed with tables chairs and beds there were kings trent dor and jonathan the zombie master so good to see you again humfrey trent said whats the news i was taken aback how could he be so casual then he laughed and i knew he was teasing me in his fashion i shook hands with him and jonathan and then question quest with dor who was no longer a child at age twentyfour and had served honorably as king he seemed slightly taken aback which gratified me we were all now recent kings with a certain morbid camaraderie the wives are mourning i reported dor had just been married to irene after a betrothal of eight years duration they had not seen fit to rush things irene had finally taken a hand and tricked him into the ceremony but she had played it too close the sudden duties of the kingship had occupied him in the crisis and they had had no wedding night i told iris that bink and arnolde centaur were to follow me as king meanwhile i failed to recognize the horseman when i met him actually im not quite certain now exactly when i figured out the identity of the horseman it was some time ago but the scene was something like that im sure didnt we all jonathan agreed i caught them up on the recent events of the battle against the lastwave and they nodded all of us were wise too late then we settled down to a game of poker a game trent had picked up in mundania one might think that this consisted of poking a nymph but this was not the case it consisted of dealing out cards and bluffing about the values of our holdings it was a fitting occupation for kings dor being of a younger generation merely watched we used our closest approximations to mundane value as this was a mundane game lettuce clams and bucksaws all provided by the dream realm we were of course all sharing a sustained dream our bodies were lying in their various places comatose being tended by our assorted women we knew that if we were not rescued in a few days our bodies would die and then we would have no escape from this realm except perhaps into the neighboring ream of hell it seemed best not to dwell on that the decision was out of our hands we were comfortable enough aside from the bore question quest dom we did not feel the discomforts of our bodies our bodies seemed solid here because we were all spirits none of us having any more solidity than the others the night stallion checked in on us every so often and provided anything we wanted within reason but he could not provide us with our freedom in due course bink showed up we welcomed him especially his son dor acquainted him with our situation and learned the latest details of the battle of xanth bink had met the enemy leader hasbinbad in single combat and was getting the better of it but they had had to break off because of darkness so they had made a truce for the night and retired then hasbinbad had treacherously attacked in the darkness but bink had been ready for him avoiding the trap then pursued him to the brink of the gap chasm we were all able to remember that cleft now because the forget spell worked on our physical bodies not our souls he had been wounded but had forced hasbinbad into the gap where he had fallen to his death then a white horse had come and the horseman had locked bink into the gourd but you cannot be harmed by magic trent protested i wasnt harmed by magic bink pointed out but if we all die here dor said worried we are unlikely to i said if sinks talent allowed him to join us we must be safe the others nodded agreement we were all comforted then mare imbri showed up the night stallion gave her a taillashing for her tardiness and brought her in to us she projected her communication dreamlet and the pretty young woman in black informed us how king arnolde had performed a truly centaurian series of interpretations of xanth human law concluding that the distinction between magicians and sorceresses was purely cosmetic and that the definition of king did not necessarily indicate male thus he was able to desig question quest nate queen iris and her daughter princess irene as the next two kings in the line of succession queen iris had been somewhat antagonistic to the centaur but for some reason had suffered a swift change of sentiment and now it was clear to me what my reference had written what iris desired most was to rule xanth and now she was very likely to have her chance then mare imbri departedbut returned later with a visitor it was irene you cant skip out on me this time she told dor we started our marriage in a graveyard and well consummate it in a graveyard the skeletons wont like that he demurred perhaps awed by the prospect as has sometimes been the case with men the skeletons dont have to participate she assured him but the night stallion had prepared for them a separate chamber filled with pillows when last seen before the door closed they had a fullscale pillow fight going i had a suspicion that it wouldnt last the night indeed there came a silence for a time and i suspect a stork took notice if the signal was able to get out of the realm of the gourd then later still they emerged both looking satisfied and started throwing pillows at the rest of us soon we were all in it the pillow fight of kings i had forgotten in the course of the last hundred and twenty years or so what fun pillow fights could be too bad the gorgon wasnt here i was sure she could handle a pillow well then arnolde joined us he had sent out a contingent of fifty centaurs from centaur isle to fight the mundanes and they had fought a great battle and greatly reduced the strength of the wave and then the horseman had taken him out too iris was now king of xanth but all too soon king iris herself showed up she had crafted a horrendous army of monsters and tricked the mundanes into walking into the gap chasm decimating their number again and taunted the horseman question quest via her illusion imageand he had made a gesture at that illusion and taken her out what a fool i was she said join the throng her husband trent said irene was now king how long can this continue iris asked through ten kings i said remembering what i had read the chain is to be ten kings long and i was number seven iris said ruefully irene is number eight but who next we are out of magicians and sorceresses then king irene arrived having tried to lull the horseman while her plants encircled castle roogna and sealed him in but he had caught on too soon and banished her to the gourd she had designated chameleon as her successorbut in only two minutes more king chameleon arrived too she was in her smartugly phase and had planned a course of action to destroy the horseman she had designated as the final kingmare imbri and the king mare killed the horseman and destroyed his magic ring of power by throwing it into the void that freed us all but she lost her body in the process for the void took her too fortunately she retained the half soul she had gotten from chem centaur and that maintained her existence she became a day mare bringing pleasant daydreams to folk after that king trent retired turning over the throne to king dor the rest of us faded back into our quiet existences i returned to my castle and to the gorgon who had performed well in battle stoning a number of mundanes it was good to revert to normal chapter ivy i he stork brought ivy to king dor and queen irene in two years after their marriage and their assumption of the throne she was a sorceress thanks to the continuing largess of the demon xcan s gift to bink and therefore in line to become king of xanth someday i made a note in my references for it behooved me to keep track of all magicianclass magic as it happened ivy was to have an impact on my quiet life almost from the start of her career her talent was enhancement she could increase the power of the magic of any creature but that was only part of it the creature itself tended to become what ivy chose to believe it was if she thought an ogre was gentle that ogre would be gentle if she thought a mouse was vicious beware of that mouse thus she had an insidious effect on those around her indeed her mother irene had been classified as neosorceress her talent of growing plants not being of magician caliber but after ivy arrived irene was recognized as a full sorceress by no coincidence her daughter perceived her that way and so she was it occurred to me that ivys magic could be useful in question quest my business suppose she enhanced all my spells suppose she met my son hugo and perceived his talent as strong instead of marginal he might then be able to conjure fresh fruit instead of rotten fruit that would do wonders for the smell of our castle hugo was also a bit slowsome said retardedand if little ivy happened to see him as smart that too would be nice so i looked for a pretext to meet her without being obvious she was a cute bright child by her perception and therefore in reality so that even at the age of three was impressive so it was that i elected to make a personal appearance at a function to which ivy was invited that was the debut of the zombie masters twins hiatus and lacuna then just sixteen actually there was business too because the dread gap dragon the terror of the chasm had somehow found a way out of the gap and was menacing the neighborhood of southern xanth perhaps this was a result of the fragmentation of the forget spell on the chasm that spell had been detonated by dor in his youth when he visited king roogna to make the goblins and harpies forget their war and not overrun castle roogna it had been permanentuntil the time of no magic that had shaken the spell and indeed had abolished most of it but it had been soaking into the chasm for eight hundred years and now that residual forgetting was sifting out and drifting away in whorls and eddies causing any creatures who walked through them to suffer amnesia this represented more mischief and my tomes suggested that a wiggle swarm was about due wiggles were always trouble because they zapped through anything in their path leaving wigglesized holes actually there was evidence that we misunderstood the nature of the wiggles but i had not yet gotten around to researching that in addition i had run out of youth elixir and the gorgon had hinted that it was time to get more so i planned to make a side trip to the fountain of youth which was in easy carpet distance from the new castle question quest zombie and refresh my stock i think all in all there was enough business to justify a few hours away from my tomes though i remain uncertain about that thus it was that my wife stayed home to tend the castle and i took hugo then eight years old on the carpet to new castle zombie little did i know the mischief that would result from that excursion somehow it is impossible to start any trip on time there seems to be a hostile spell which prevents it thus we were an hour late taking off we were flying somewhat slow and uncertain because i was trying to teach hugo how to operate the carpet then we encountered some unfriendly clouds and an adverse wind and were further delayed in the air i picked up a suitable eddy current near the ground and zoomed along it but there was a dragon obstructing the current and i had to slow until it got out of the way always some idiot making a left turn when youre in a hurry so we were well behind schedule by the time we reached new castle zombie well i would just have to condense things so we flew into the window where dor irene the zombie master and arnolde centaur were gathered we have another chore i told them then i spelled out the problems the gap dragon had to be contained but not hurt for it was necessary to the welfare of the gap and the forget whorls had to be sprayed with fixative and moved out to mundania where they would do less damage take it up hugo i said and narrowly missing the wall we lurched up and sailed out of the window in retrospect i fear i was too brief with them the gap dragon bore down on the castle and in the resultant confusion little ivy got lost in the jungle beyond the castle i should have warned them about the proximity of the dragon but forgot its hard to keep every detail in mind when youre in a hurry we flew on to the fountain of youth landing a short distance from it it had once been a full fountain but question quest had worn down into a more ordinary spring over the course of centuries or perhaps the rocks around it had youthened into sand the zombie master had known its location and informed me and i had found it useful but naturally i did not tell others about it what would xanth come to if everyone used this elixir to stave off old age and so no one ever died i had never used it myself until the gorgon suggested it and gave me reason to want to be younger i left hugo and the carpet a safe distance away because it wouldnt do to have him reduced in age or it accidentally youthened into a doily i brought out a disk freed a catch and it sprang out into a tenfoot pole suitable for touching unpleasant things why anyone should want to touch ten feet im not sure but i did need a good long shaft i tramped to the edge of the spring it wasnt actually a fountain in the sense of water sailing up the water merely welled out continuously always young and fresh the vegetation at the verge of the pool was of course very small mere seedlings becoming older only with distance any animal who came to drink here departed considerably younger than it came most were smart enough to sip those who drank deeply had to start their lives over i fixed a bottle to the end of the pole and extended it dipping carefully from the spring when it was full i twitched it so that its fliptop lid snapped into place i shook it dry then brought it in and wrapped it in cloth i retreated from the spring someone watching me might have thought my exaggerated care foolish but youth elixir is dangerous i returned to the carpet and handed the wrapped bottle to hugo with an admonition so that i could condense my pole to packable length it resisted in the manner of the inanimate but finally i got it back into cylinder form and then into its original disk and put it in my pocket there was a sudden roar and the ground shook i looked upand there was the gap dragon steaming question quest toward us it must have continued to run after visiting castle zombie my spells were on the carpet with hugo i would have to get my portable dragon net and fling it over the monster subduing it hugo i cried toss me my bag of spells but hugo fluffed it he grabbed at the fringe of the carpet instead and it mistook the gesture as a command and took off hugo unbraced rolled off the carpet sailed into the air carrying my bag of spells with it i was suddenly without my magic except for the compressed tenfoot pole and the dragon was still bearing down on us that pole was too clumsy to serve as a weapon and the dragon could probably steam us from beyond its length anyway then i saw the wrapped bottle of elixir it had fallen beside hugo hugo i called ill distract the dragon you unwrap that bottle lift the cap and sprinkle some elixir on its tail for the youth elixir did not have to be imbibed it would work on any body it touched in the manner of the healing elixir we could make the dragon young enough to be harmless no younger than necessary of course because it was needed in the gap chasm perhaps even trace youthening would confuse it so it would leave us alone hugo never clever with his hands struggled to get the bottle unwrapped and the lid off while i dodged about as briskly as i could avoiding the steamsnorts of the dragon there were larger dragons than this one and there were flying dragons while this one had only vestigial wings and there were fire breathers and smokers who were frightening to see in action but this was nevertheless one of the most ornery and fearsome creatures of xanth because it normally hunted in the gap chasm and its prey could not escape it that steam could cook prey where it stood worse this dragon could not be spooked or frightened it pursued its prey relentlessly until catching it i had to neutralize it in some fashion or it would steam and eat us both i glanced back at the fountain could i lead the question quest dragon to that no it was between me and the pool it had to be the elixir from the bottle hurry hugo i yelled i was in excellent health for my age but my age was old the boy finally fumbled the bottle out and the lid open but in his haste he did not pour a few drops on the dragons tail he held the bottle and made a throwing motion that sent an arc of elixir flying toward the dragon and me no icried too late the elixir scored all too well it wet down the dragon solidly and some of it also splattered against my skin disaster the dragon youthened rapidly becoming smaller with brighter green scales but so did i we were both overdosed and were losing a century or more of age as it happened we were both over a century old otherwise we might have dwindled all the way into predelivery but it was bad enough the dragon became a baby dragon and i became a baby man i saw us both changing rapidly and i saw hugo gaping at the sight i tried to call out something to him but my youthening prevented me from making much sense even to myself perhaps i was even speaking backwards hugo dismayed and confused began to cry the baby dragon shook itself then scooted away evidently as alarmed as i but i could do nothing for i was now too young to talk then abruptly i was back at the castle the gorgon had evidently been watching us in the magic mirror seen the disaster and used the emergency conjure spell to bring me home unfortunately it like the mirror was tuned to me only and she did not know how to retune them that meant that hugo remained out in the wilderness alone the following years are a bit vague for me i aged at the normal rate except when zora zombie whose talent was accelerated aging came to babysit me my question quest wife managed somehow and worked with queen irene to keep things in order but it was threeyearold ivy who did the most it seems that she lost in that region of the jungle encountered the gap dragon and used her talent to tame it then she met hugo and her talent made him a virtual night in shiny armor as she put it the three had a great adventure and in the end even managed to help glory goblin the youngest prettiest and sweetest of gorbage goblins daughters unite with her lover hardy harpy and also to defuse a wiggle swarming then when ivy was five she came to ask me a question she had she felt been grounded for no reason at all actually she had gotten into such mischief that the entire chapter of that volume of the muse of historys record had been censored out the missing chapter turned up years later in a visual guide to xanth where no one would notice it these things happen in xanth all children got into mischief but ivy could enhance mischief to an excitingly new level now she was compounding it by sneaking out to visit me i had managed to age rapidly and was now about seven years old physically and the same actual size as she was ivy had had considerable effect on me because she enhanced zoras aging talent enabling me to age much faster than otherwise however i was now old enough to remember my principles so i made her go through the challenges ivy used stepping stones to step across the moat she used a dark lantern to get through a region of intolerable brightness she nullified a flying kitty hawk by intensifying its hawk and kitty aspects until the two got into a fight with each other and the fur and feathers really flew then she encountered a headstone who sounded the alarm so that she would get the brushoff and that huge flying brush really terrified her but she buried a dead moth by the headstone so that it become silent like a moth and could not alert the brush so she won through as i had known she would i couldnt question quest turn her in of course that would have been in violation of the juvenile conspiracy to which i technically belonged until i got old enough to rejoin the adult conspiracy okay okay whats your question i inquired graciously i need something to clean up the magic tapestry so jordan the ghost can remember another person might have had difficulty grasping this but i was the magician of information i knew that she referred to a ghost of castle roogna who had died in the year and been dead for years approximately and who was now trying to tell her the story of his life to alleviate her boredom while she was grounded they were using the tapestry to show pictures and refresh his memory but the tapestry was somewhat dirty after years approximately and its crewel stitchery needed cleaning by caustic lye so i gave her the recipe for the crewel lye and she took it back to use the caustic on the yarn the tapestry brightened immediately and jordan the ghost was at last able to tell his sad tale of an unkind untruth it was replete with swords and sorceries and goods and evils and treacheries and thud and blunder and ivy of course loved it even though some of the juicier parts got censored out after she heard it ivy managed to get jordan restored to life and then his girlfriend threnody who was half demon everyone was happy except maybe for stanley steamer her pet little gap dragon who had gotten accidentally banished by a misinvoked spell so naturally that led to more mischief ivy was going to send her shapechanging little brother dolph out to find the dragon but dolph was only three years old when she decided this to stave this off grundy golem did something unusually caring and volunteered to go on this search himself and of course the first thing he did was come to me for an answer i told him to ride the monster under the bed to the question quest ivory tower i had of course already researched it little did he know then that the ivory tower contained the maiden rapunzel ivys pun pal who was the distant descendent of jordan the ghost back in his barbarian years and bluebell elf who had used an accommodation spell to have a rather special tryst with him as a result rapunzel could change sizes being of elf stature or human stature or anything between or around but her magic was in her hair which was marvelously long rapunzel was to become the love of grundys life as there were not many suitable female golems and anyway he was no longer a true golem having been rendered real i did not bother to tel him all this of course he hadnt inquired suffice to say that he did rescue stanley steamer from a fate considerably better than death and brought the dragon back to ivy incidentally grundy said something that changed my life again he suggested that i use reversewood in conjunction with youth elixir to age myself instantly to any level i wished now why hadnt i thought of that as a result i was able to restore myself to the physical age of a hundred or perhaps a bit less to the pleasure of the gorgon we lived happily ever afterfor three years then it was and the lethe elixir i had taken in abruptly wore off and i remembered rose of roogna naturally i departed immediately my wife and son insisted on coming with me so the castle was deserted but this chapter is about ivy and the ways herlife related to mine so i shall complete that discussion before getting into my more private continuation my great grandson eskil ogre encountered that most mischievous of demons the demoness metria it seemed that she was seeking a convenient and comfortable place to relax away from the hummers which infested her home region and so she intended to take question quest over esks private retreat perhaps she had an affinity for his family having been a surrogate mother for his grandfather two generations before esk decided to come and ask me for a solution to this problem meanwhile chex centaur the winged offspring of chem and xap hippogryph was unable to fly so was coming to ask me how to do it she was only seven or eight years old at the tune but had matured rapidly because of her animal parent and was now a young adult it helped that she was a centaur for even the youngest of centaurs is uncommonly intelligent educated and poised so she met esk on the path leading to my castle finally volney vole was coming from the region of the kissmee river to ask how the once curvaceous and friendly river could be restored to its natural state because the angry corps of demoneers had pulled it straight now it was known as the killmee river and was hostile to normal life volney encountered the other two on the path so it was that the three of them traveled together getting to know each other and overcoming the hazards of the route i had seen them coming in my mirror of course and was readying a series of challenges calculated to dissuade them from entry to the castle because the truth was that each of their questions represented a problem for me i did not want to tangle with the demoness metria again knowing that she would find a way to make me regret it such as telling the gorgon too much about my prior wives and that esk was my great grandson esk was also scheduled to meet bria brassie the love of his life in the course of his search for volneys answer and i did not want to deny him that i did not want to tell chex how to flyit was simply a matter of flicking herself with her magic tail which made what it touched get lightbecause centaur pride was such that she would never forgive herself for not figuring it out on her own she was destined to play a part in something truly significant for xanth and to question quest meet cheiron the winged centaur the love of her life in the course of this quest so it was best for me not to interfere at all and the solution to volneys problem was elementary the hummers who were bothering the demons would go away if the demons restored the curves of the kissmee river all he had to do was tell the demons that but my tomes indicated that volney could find lasting happiness if he solved his problem the hard waya happiness he would lack if i made it easy for him this was because in the course of searching for the answer he would encounter wilda wiggle who was both to educate xanth on the true nature of wiggles and to become the love of volneys life so i had excellent reason to avoid giving the answers but how was i to accomplish this if they made it into the castle and insisted on asking their questions and agreed to pay their years services to their mutual loss the sound of tearing hair reverberated through the castle and i hadnt even started doing that yet but something suspiciously like fate solved my problem because about a day before the dread trio arrived the lethe wore off and i remembered rose so i was gone and the castle was vacant in our rush to depart we forgot to shut down various ongoing activities which was a nuisance one of them was an amnesia ambrosia ironically that i was brewing in the cellar that stuff could be extremely awkward to handle the trio arrived and navigated the reduced hazards of the defunct castle they were perplexed but of course unable to ask their questions or get their answers so they went on to castle roogna to inform the king of the mystery of my disappearance there they met princess ivy now just about eleven years old and the growing stanley steamer her pet gap dragon ivy insisted on helping them in their quest for they had decided to work with volney to save the kissmee river thus ivy got involved in this adventure because question quest her talent of enhancement can be devious it is not possible to say to what extent she changed things but by the time their adventure was done they had explored new aspects of the gourd and brought out marrow bones one of the walking skeletons who was to remain as one of the solid citizens of xanth remember he had gottenlost when smash ogre bashed up the dream realm but they did not figure out what had happened to me so three years later prince dolph then nine years old decided to go on his own quest to find the good magician it was ivys fault really because at age fourteen she was an insufferable nuisance to her little brother and he felt he had to prove himself his mother irene insisted that he be accompanied by an adultmothers are funny about things like thatso he took marrow bones first they checked my deserted castle there they found a message i had set up for another purpose and put in storage until needed skeleton key to heaven cent it was for dolph actually but only when he came of age and had to go rescue a sleeping princess unfortunately he found it early and that complicated things in fact by the time he was through his adventure not only had prince dolph failed to find me he had gotten himself betrothed to two nice girls the wrong one and the right one they came to live at castle roogna for several years while he tried to make up his mind which one to marry because his mother was being unreasonable again and said he couldnt marry both they became fast friends of ivy thus her insufferability to her little brother had resulted in her gaining two excellent companions which was surely a miscarriage of justice and dolphs misadventure had resulted in queen irenes dictum one wife at a time this was to complicate things for me in yet another way because it meant that i could not bring rose of roogna back to life while married to the gorgon but that complication must wait for the end of this narration question quest three years later at age seventeen ivy got into it with both feet she decided to look for me she invoked the heaven cent which was a magical device that sent the user where most needed assuming that that was where i would be that was specious logic of course but one does not expect common sense in a princess the cent sent her to mundania where lived the one who really did need her most grey murphy he was the son of evil magician murphy and neosorceress vadne who had escaped the brain corals pool in the time of no magic and fled to mundania it took the brain coral so long to complete its inventory after that shakeup that it never knew they were gone and was still claiming to have both of them in storage decades later grey and ivy made their way back to xanth and looked up my temporary address in the gourd that was a real nuisance you see i was down here in the anteroom of hell waiting to see the demon xcan and i did not want to be disturbed my body was resting peacefully in a coffin at the address on silly goose lane where no sensible person would ever think to look and protected by a spell of illusion but grey murphys talent was the nullification of magic his parents had signaled the stork before leaving xanth so he had magic despite being delivered in mundania in fact he was a magician and as a result was able to penetrate the illusion hiding my coffin thus ivy had finally succeeded in disturbing my peace by the devious route of causing her brother to find the heaven cent and then using it to bring grey murphy to xanth so they braced me at my physical body and i had to risk a moment away from hells antechamber to talk to them grey lifted the lid hey magician humfrey he said boldly what a brash young man i opened an eye go away i said politely but i need an answer he said i am no longer giving answers i had to get rid of him quickly question quest but he persisted how can i void the service i owe to cornpewter he demanded suppose the demon chose this moment to check the anteroom i had to get back ill give your answer when im done here how long will that be if you want an answer i said with enormous patience serve me until i return but i must serve cornpewter he protested after you complete your service to me i pointed out the obvious but how can i serve you if youre asleep would he never give over go to my castle you will find a way finally he lowered the lid and i zipped back to the antechamber what a relief there was no trace of the demons recent presence i had not missed him i had of course given grey murphy his answer it was his destiny to be my apprentice his magic was the nullification of magic which was not at all the same as information but my own status as magician derived from something other than inherent talent too he could do the job if he put his mind to it and blundered through he would have ivy to enhance him and that counted for a lot so he would be the good magician protern until i finished my business here he did not have to worry about the service cornpewter demanded of him because his service to me took precedence thus he could remain in xanth until i returned whereupon i would tell him how to vacate his commitment to compewter it was simple enough he did go to my castle and finally did manage to catch on thanks in large part to the effect of his fathers curse his father bad returned to xanth after renouncing any claim to the xanth throne and his talent was to make anything go wrong that could go wrong he cursed cornpewters effort with the result that it did go wrong in the most devious way and grey murphy escaped the onus of having to serve an entity hostile to question quest the welfare of xanth that also incidentally made ivy happy for she had every intention of marrying grey so it was that ivy brought my replacement and occupied my castle herself that was her greatest impact on my existence and actually it was not a bad one the history of xanth continued apace three years later prince dolph married electra and gave princess nada naga her freedom which was the decent thing to do at the same time a new character came to xanth twelveyearold jenny elf from the world of two moons she helped rescue che centaur the winged foal of cheiron and chex and joined that family as a guest child along with gwendolyn goblin great things were getting ready to happen in the goblin realm and i realized that it would really be better if i returned to take a hand grey murphy meant well but was relatively inexperienced and might bungle it so i hoped the demon xtan would come soon so i could settle with him but that belongs in the next chapter chapter memory o at last i come to my departure from the normal realm of xanth in i confess it was a surprise for i had completely forgotten a section of my life by no coincidence the day started normally which was to say all fouled up there is an endemic curse on households called snafu that accounts for this one simply learns to live with it i was working in my study of course poring over my treasured tomes the gorgon was in the kitchen making gorgonzola cheese by staring at milk through her veil i had not rendered her face invisible again after the action of the nextwave invasion we had decided that a heavy veil spelled to remain in place sufficed hugo now sixteen years old was supervising the placement of a cage of little dragons on the drawbridge over the moat there was an elf doing his service today setting up a holy smoke generator i would use that smoke in a future challenge the querent would have to figure out that he could get through it only by stepping through one of the holes in it the holes could lead anywhere but in this case would lead to the inside of the castle the person who fled the smoke would not question quest get inside and that would save me the burden of yet another answer i had the magic mirror tuned to hugo knowing that he would foul up at some point only when he was with ivy did he become truly competent because ivy had never quite lost her image of him as a night in shiny armor how i wished we could borrow a bit of her talent and permanently enhance our son so that he would be all that he sometimes was with her my tomes said that hugo had a good destiny and that he would find special happiness and do something really nice for another person we just had to wait for that to occur i knew that sometimes the most promising of children went astray and that at other times the least promising turned out well time and hope would show the way but it wasnt hugo who fouled up this time it was the elf i missed it because i wasnt watching him hugo finished with the dragons and retired to his room to practice conjuring his fruits and the mirror remained on him the gorgon finished making her cheese and started on a petrified cheese salad which also used some of hugos fruits because the fruits were of all types but tended to be overripe a bit of petrifaction improved them all was reasonably well there as it was with assorted other creatures working around the premises but not with the elf holy smoke is tricky to handle it is best made in small quantities and bottled then the bottles can be opened separately keeping the amount measured when it is actually being manufactured there has to be a strict containment spell similar to those used to confine summoned demons the elf forgot that he simply set a chunk of knothole wood in the brazier and ignited it with a lightning bug he assumed it would bum slowly allowing him to siphon the smoke into the bottles instead the entire chunk of wood burst into flame suddenly there was a rapidly expanding billow of smoke the elf should have doused it immediately with question quest a bucket of unholy water but he panicked and retreated coughing he was afraid the smoke would surround him and send him through a hole and the holes were not yet defined he could wind up anywhere in xanth the smoke expanded filling the chamber it was enjoying this the inanimate is always perverse but holy smoke is more perverse than most with more power of mischief than most it was out to catch the elf and send him through that hole regardless the smell of the smoke reached the gorgons sensitive nose she perked up sniffing she recognized the smell and screamed warning to me now i reoriented the mirror and saw what was happening i hurried down to deal with it hugo came down bearing a bunch of bluespeckled bananas he had just conjured the smoke did not wait on our convenience it doubled its effort and coursed from chamber to chamber filling them all hot on the trail of the fleeing elk we converged meeting the elf who gesticulated wildly as he explained the woodit all caught fire at once the smoke chased me out cease babbling elf i snapped justifiably annoyed i searched through my memory for a smoke containment spell but naturally couldnt remember the formula at the moment meanwhile the smoke with inanimate cunning circled around to fill the chamber behind us i couldnt remember my freebreathing tunneling spell either a curse on my aging mind there was nothing to do but step into the one remaining clear chamber to give me a breather while i cudgeled my memory for the spell i knew was at the tip of my brain we clustered in the center of the chamber the smoke knowing it had us trapped encircled us hi a smiling wreath then it expanded inward filling the room i focused on the errant spell about to remember it i did a brief exercise to enhance my memory in a question quest moment i would have us free and the smoke under control that was when the lethe wore off it had been wearing thin anyway and my effort of memory banished the last of it rose i cried stricken i have a banana not a rose hugo replied the love of my life the gorgon turned to me what she inquired with somewhat more than ordinary interest as the smoke swirled up to enclose us in a constricting bubble of air my third wife shes in hell dont you mean your first wife the demoness no rose was human a princess i must go to her if you go i go too the gorgon said firmly i cant think why she was interested hey dont leave me behind hugo protested now the smoke was filling in the last of the air around us but that was no problem i uttered a spell to orient the nearest hole then i took hold of my wifes hand and my sons hand and we stepped through what was to be one of the great temporary mysteries of xanth was commencing our abrupt disappearance from the scene we stood on a nearly barren terrain nearby we heard the surge of ocean breakers there were a few trees and a great many weeds ahead was a tumbledown shack the gorgon peered around her vision was not good because she had to look through her thick veil where are we the isle of illusion i said it is fallow since the sorceress iris left to become queen her fabulous residence no more than this no more than this when stripped of its illusion i sent her here long ago and she used her talent to make it a region of wonder question quest but you were going to see your third wife is she here i have come here to have a suitable place for my body i explained it has to be well hidden so that i will not be disturbed while im in hell i dont want to go to hell hugo protested nobody asked you to son i pointed out you are free to return to the castle or to go anywhere else you choose he looked disgruntled let me make sure i have this straight the gorgon said you are going to sequester your body here and send your soul to hell precisely to be reunited with your third wife who died some time ago rose didnt die she went to hell in a handbasket in the year i lacked the means to rescue her from hell so i took my full supply of lethe which happened to be eighty years worth i assumed i would be dead before it wore off it seems you miscalculated she noted do you have the means to rescue rose now that set me back not exactly but i have more experience now and should be able to figure out a way and if you bring her back to life and she is your wife again what of me i began to get her drift why you are my wife too i wouldnt give you up thats nice to learn she remarked to no one in particular the two of you can divide the tasks one can cook while the other sorts the socks a fair division she agreed but she seemed to lack conviction but that can be settled at the time i said first i must recover rose question quest perhaps hugo and i will wait for you elsewhere she said we do not care particularly for hell its too hot hugo agreed fruit must spoil very quickly there he had a point perhaps we can make a deal with the night stallion to fashion a nice dream for you until my return perhaps the gorgon agreed doubtfully i realized that she might not consider the dreams of the gourd to be very pleasant how long do you expect to be i hadnt considered that perhaps a day i opined we can survive a bad dream for a day she said she looked around we shall have to find a sheltered place then we shall have to devise a strategy a strategy dearest husband dealing with the night stallion is one thing he does owe you a favor or two but hell is not strictly part of the dream realm it is i understand administered directly by the demon xcan he owes you no favors she had another point i shall just have to reason with him surely we can make a deal what kind of a deal you know he isnt much interested in the affairs of lesser creatures like us dont pester me woman i snapped with righteous ire i will figure that out on the way down there she knew better than to argue with me very well lets find a place to sleep and then we shall see the night stallion once hugo and i are comfortable you will be free to proceed without worrying about us exactly she had always been a bit quicker to formulate my thoughts than i was so we cast about on the isle and to our surprise found a sheltered place with a collection of coffins evidently the sorceress iris had used them to form the walls of her residence when she lived here before becoming queen her power of illusion would have made the structure seem like a palace or anything else she question quest wished it didnt matter what she used in the real world as long as it was solid enough to last why all the boxes hugo asked i had never thought to do a survey of this island or any other so i didnt know but i could conjecture evidently i am not the only one to regard this as a suitably private spot someone must be storing coffins here indeed they seemed quite solid and were evidently resistant to weathering because they remained in good condition hugo tried to lift the lid of one but it was nailed on there may be someone in it the gorgon said with her veil suggesting a smile her facial expressions were evident when one learned to interpret the configurations of the veil she could even wink she had been able to do that while her face was invisible too though i cant be quite certain how it showed hugo hastily left the coffin alone he was no more eager than others to peer into the face of a dead person there should be some empty ones i said we found several together with their lids we dragged them to a separate spot packed them with pillows from a pillow bush and tried them out for size they were suitable now the two of you dont have to do this i reminded them i expect to take only a day or so you may wait here or return to the castle while you go to hell to fetch your former wife the gorgon said somehow i could tell she was going to be unreasonable about this i shall go along at least as far as the dream realm me too hugo said then i shall put you both to sleep with a spell and take it myself i said it will endure until i invoke the antidote spell but i really doubt it is necessary for such a brief time this is a very powerful spell and i dislike wasting such magic when the gorgon only stared at me through her veil and i felt the tingle of her power sure enough she was question quest being unreasonable i ceased arguing it was better than getting slowly stoned they got into their coffins and made themselves comfortable i invoked the sleep spell and they sank down in it not only would it keep them asleep it would maintain them at the same age as now no matter how long it endured without the need of food or water it suspended their animation leaving only their minds free to dream i used this spell because i knew it would enable me to go as far in the dream realm as required and there was no sense in using a different one on them i set the lids on their coffins so that they would be protected in case it rained they would not need to breathe either so it was fine if the lids were tight then i climbed into my own just before i invoked the spell on myself i had a thought i got out and traced a message in the dust on the outside of my coffin do not disturb i muttered a spell which caused the words to sink into the hard wood becoming permanent then i climbed in again hauled up the lid let it settle down into place and uttered the sleep spell i found myself standing in a pavilion my wife and son were waiting for me if this is the dream realm it is much the same as the waking one the gorgon remarked only superficially i said there should be a path leading to the other aspects as i spoke it appeared a gold brick road i could have wished that the dream realm have something more innovative than that but of course i did not run the dream realm i suppose most folk who spent a lot of time here were not interested in working very hard we set off down it but it wound around interminably extending far beyond where the island had originally been we were no longer on an island i wish i had my magic carpet along i said impatiently the carpet appeared before us we were all startled then hugo caught on you can do anything you want question quest to in a dream he said i wish i could conjure a perfect fruit suddenly there appeared in his hand a perfect apple he bit into it it was evidently good but when his attention went elsewhere the apple faded out dreams had only seeming substance it might not be safe to ride this carpet i wish we were already there the gorgon said suddenly we were there her practicality had simplified things again where we were was at the edge of a rather pleasant village the road went through the center and the houses were pretty colors with nice little gardens around them with flowers and fruits and decorative shrubs there were people too and in a moment they spied us oh newcomers a girl exclaimed happily she hurried up to meet us she was about ten years old with pigtails and freckles hello im electra who are you i am good magician humfrey i said surprised that she did not know of me i might be a recluse but i understood that everyone in xanth knew about the wizened old gnome who gouged the public horrendously and this is my wife the gorgon and my son hugo is he a prince electra asked no merely a boy i said she studied hugo you must be close to my age hugo was startled im older than i look he said gruffly im sixteen oh i thought you were thirteen im older than i look too im twelve in real time i know how it is wiras sixteen would you like to meet her im looking for hell i said tell me where that is then introduce him to wira okay the girl said brightly you have to take the handbasket she pointed and there was a huge basket swinging along on the end of a rope which faded out question quest somewhere above but usually only dead folk go down there its really not part of the dream realm i walked to intercept the basket which dropped low forme i climbed in i shall return i said as it lifted and bore me away hugo and electra and the gorgon waved the basket bore me swiftly down through the various dream sets and into the nethermost regions bringing me finally to hells anteroom i got out walked to the door and knocked the door did not open instead a sign flashed on it no admittance but i have business here i protested then see the demon x th the sign printed where is the demon he will stop by sometime several questions and prints later i understood the situation the demon would meet with anyone here in hells waiting room when he stopped by it was in the rules of the demons game but if a person happened to be out when the demon came he lost his chance forever so it was best to remain right here no matter what because i was in the dream state this was possible i had nowhere i needed to go and did not need food so i settled down to wait the chamber was small and bare absolutely uninteresting as if designed to discourage anyone from waiting but i was not anyone i was the good magician and i had a wife to rescue from hell i focused on the problem pondering ways to get the release of rose from this unpleasant confinement time passed after a while i wished for my magic mirror and it appeared in my hand and i oriented it on the innocent dream realm above where hugo and the gorgon waited as it turned out they were doing something interesting the gorgon had always felt that hugo needed female companionship she had encouraged little ivy to visit question quest but ivy was into everything in xanth enhancing it to her hearts content right now ivy was meeting chex centaur esk ogre and volney vole doing her best to help them she was similar in her girlish way to electra who was now leading hugo to meet wira so the gorgon was hoping that wira would be a nice girl who would interest hugo even if this was only a group dream wira turned out to be in the deer abbey petting the deer they were pretty little things friendly but shy hey wira here are new dreamers electra called wira was a reasonably pretty young woman in a nice pink dress and brown slippers she looked up and her eyes matched her dress which was mildly startling hello she said seeming as friendly and shy as the deer but the deer did not stay for the visitors they trusted wira but not strangers this is hugo electra said eagerly hes sixteen too how nice wira said smiling sadly she extended her hand are you here long hugo not long hugo said taking her hand it was evident that he liked the look and feel of her but of course no girl took him seriously when she realized how gnomish he looked and that his magic talent wasnt very effective that was his tragedy then of course he said something stupid id sure like to meet you by a love spring i winced but wira was not disturbed it wouldnt have any effect on me she said which was an odd statement i am immune oh thats your talent no my talent is sensitivity i can sort of tell how things are when theyre close thats why i can pet the deer theyre sort of lonely because there isnt much for them to do here bad dreams seldom need little deer hugo nodded he had forgotten that this was the question quest realm of dreams but they arent all bad are they i mean this isnt the gourd but most of the interesting things are in the bad dreams she said those are the ones that have the most careful settings so as to make folk feel worst so when the night stallion comes recruiting lots of the people here volunteer for bit parts it relieves the boredom but the little deer dont get the chance so even in their sleep they arent very happy i try to help them but im not very interesting either so theres not much i can do think youre interesting hugo said you do wira blushed turning almost the color of her eyes and they both were silent i remember how the demon beauregard had blushed the color of metrias pink panties long ago it was an interesting effect and this is his mother the gorgon electra said the gorgon stepped forward as wira turned toward her but hugo stepping back at the same time in typically clumsy fashion brushed against her and his jacket snagged against her veil the veil less secure in this dream was pulled down exposing her eyesjust in time to meet wiras gaze the gorgon froze with horror for her face was no longer invisible any person or creature who met her direct gaze was immediately stoned so pleased to meet you mother gorgon wira said extending her hand the gorgon hastily drew up her veil before anyone else could see her face as it was two butterflies directly behind wira plummeted like the little stones they now were striking the ground with separate plinks youyoure alive the gorgon exclaimed asleep but alive wira agreed is something wrong you looked into my faceand didnt turn into stone question quest wira blinked im sorry i didnt mean to oifend you i didnt see you you what the gorgon asked confused oh i guess i forget to tell you electra cut in shes blind she cant see you at ail she goes by your voice blind the gorgon exclaimed now it was coming clear why the girls eyes were pink it was the albino hue the blood vessels showing their color through the colorless lenses that could be a factor in her lack of sight this also explained why a love spring wouldnt affect her it would make her love the first man she saw after touching its water but she would never see a man she would be similarly immune to a hate spring im sorry wira said i did not mean to mislead you i understand why youre upset the gorgon recovered most of her somewhat scattered wits my dear im not upset im astonished your lack of sight just saved your life wira shrugged it wouldnt have made very much difference i think i am of no use to anyone thats why my folks had me put to sleep the gorgon was taken aback again she had the most fearsome power in xanth and the gentlest heart i happen to know she was becoming increasingly interested in this young woman do you mean to say it wasnt an accident or bad fortune your family wanted to get rid of you because you are blind they didnt exactly say that but i knew they were tired of always having to take care of me and they knew i would never be able to take care of them they saw how the boys avoided me so i probably wouldnt get married so they decided to have me put to sleep until they could find a better situation for me im sure they looked for one of course they did the gorgon said righteously surely they will find it any time now and come to wake you up you are one of the folk in the coffins on the isle of illusion question quest question quest yes we are all here because we have a problem in the real world of xanth electras been here longer than any of us the gorgon turned to electra is this true how long have you been sleeping about eight hundred and fifty years i think electra said i tend to lose count there are so many of them im waiting for a prince to come and kiss me awake a prince then the gorgon stifled that line of reaction remembering that xanth was short of princes at the moment the only one was six years old she turned back to wira and how long have you been sleeping dear twelve years hugo gaped chagrined he had thought she was his age and she was actually twelve years older the gorgon understood her sons thoughts almost as well as she understood mine but you dont age while youre sleeping she said quickly to the girl yes i do age wira said my folks could afford only a cheap potion it makes me sleep and stops my body from wasting away but it doesnt stop aging so if i woke now i would be twentyeight im afraid my folks didnt find it doesnt matter the gorgon said firmly but mother hugo began appalled he had evidently liked this girl but a twentyeightyearold woman would be quite another matter remember that potion your father odd on the gorgon asked him his face brightened she was referring to the fountain of youth elixir which could take years off any person in a hurry wira could be sixteen again if she woke if hugo wanted her to be why dont you go and tour the garden with this young woman perhaps you will have something in common hugos thoughts were not the fastest in xanth except when princess ivy wanted them to be but he was be ginning to picture the presence of a pretty young woman in our castle who would have no concern about catching an accidental glimpse of the gorgons face and who just might find him interesting yes lets see the garden he agreed then he realized that he had blundered again uh not seei mean its all right hugo wira said you certainly see and i also see in my own way you do see but by touch she said give me your arm awkwardly he put out his arm she heard the cloth move and put her hand on it she guided him down the path through the abbey they walked on through the ferns and flowers do you think maybe i could pet a deer he asked certainly hugo if you want to i will introduce you but you have to be patient for they are very cautious the gorgon watched them depart my dont they make a nice couple she murmured yes shes a nice girl electra agreed beside her the gorgon jumped having forgotten her presence now the gorgon focused on electra you say you must sleep until a prince comes are you a princess no im more like an accident tell me about it so electra told her story which was a complicated one involving a curse by magician murphy that caused her to take the long sleep instead of the princess who was supposed to electras coffin was the other side of xanth on the isle of view she had come here to join the others in her dream because it was pretty dull being alone now she had to marry the prince who kissed her awake or die that was awkward because she was only twelve years old and looked ten and wasnt a princess but she hoped to do her best meanwhile hugo was getting to know wira she showed him how she could see him with her hands by lightly touching his face and body then he managed question quest to do something stupid again when she was close he kissed her but it turned out not to be as stupid as it might have been because she rather liked having someone like her time passed while i waited for the appearance of the demon x th i realized that this was not a daily matter with him but i didnt dare depart even for a moment lest i miss him in fact i realized that he was probably aware of my presence and waiting for the moment i did step out so he could step in and miss me the demon hated being bothered even more than i did so it was a war of endurance and i intended to endure three years later electra was abruptly called away her prince had come it was really too soon because he was still only nine years old and already had a bethrothee but eventually that did work out in its devious fashion the gorgon answered one of the night stallions casting calls and landed a nice role in a bad dream intended for someone who had been mean to snakes ssso she hissed in sinister fashion while her snakehair writhed enthusiastically you have assssked for it then she started to remove her veil that was where the dream cut off the purpose was to scare the dreamer not to actually turn him to stone after that she was able to obtain a number of nice roles and developed a fair career as an actress in the dream realm she was actually enjoying it that was just as well considering how the years were passing i had thought we would be here only for a day or so but this business was running a trifle overtime hugo and wira became great friends it turned out that she could sense when he was going wrong and correct him with a word or nudge so that he went right instead when he conjured fruit she guided him so that it was good fruit of course it was dream fruit of no lasting substance but it was evident that the principle would apply in waking life as well he told her of the question quest youth elixir so that she could remain sweet sixteen when they woke if she wanted to and she said that if he woke her she would want to be any age he wanted her to be meanwhile it hardly mattered whether they were awake or asleep or sleeping in the dream realm they enjoyed each others company ivy and grey murphy came to disturb me and i managed to get through without losing my appointment as mentioned before the years continued and i continued to watch what was going on both within and without the dream realm i knew that the time would come when the demon came and then he would have to let me take rose out of hell because she really didnt belong there if he could admit to making a mistake which of course he couldnt however i had used my long time in the waiting room to devise a plan then ten years after the start of my vigil you arrived lacuna you brought me news i had overlooked which complicates my situation xanth law no longer allows a man to have two wives i have mentioned that complication here as a result of your information but perhaps that plays into my hands now i shall proceed to tell my future history if the demon does not come so put a dash on the end of this sentence lacuna and we shall start the next chapter which we shall tide chapter bargain cuna looked at the wall where the final words remained printed and we shall start the next chapter which we shall title followed by chapter bargain then she looked inquiringly at the good magician keep writing he told her but make it third person youre in it too now but it would be confusing to have the t switch from me to you but your story is finished she protested i mean its all caught up to the present and going on into the future exactly as i said it would so the demon will have to come or lose by forfeit of course she agreed with such doubt that it sounded like a denial but she kept the print printing on the wall already the last words of the prior chapter were disappearing into the ceiling but they could be recovered at any time all she had to do was reverse the scroll scroll oops in her distraction she had reversed the scroll and the bottom line had moved down to bump the floor where it had bounced and duplicated itself she re question quest reversed the scroll but it was too late to erase the repeat line it was stuck as a flaw in the text meanwhile the hellbent handbasket swung into the anteroom and two children scrambled out they appeared to be twins about six years old a boy and a girl dont let go of the basket lacuna cried but she was too late they landed on the floor and the handbasket swung away now the children too were stranded here they looked at the adults turning shy hi folks the little boy said he wore blue shorts and an offwhite jacket and socks whore you the girl inquired she wore a pink dress and offwhite hair ribbon and socks humfrey shrugged so lacuna had to do the introduction this is the good magician humfrey and i am lacuna who are you im jot the boy said im tittle the girl said were twins jot added were going to hell tittle added then they both ran to the door to hell keeping in step with each other they stopped before it side by side and pounded on the door let me in they cried together wait for the demon x lh the sign on the door printed it looked like lacunas print but was more authoritative oh pooh jot exclaimed disgusted oooo what you said tittle reproved him i didnt say poop i said pooh dummy he snapped well you shouldnt have jot tried the doorknob but it turned in his hand without effect tittle tried it next with no better effect frustrated they turned to the adults hey whens the demon coming jot asked yeah when tittle echoed question quest i dont know lacuna said the good magicians been waiting for him for ten years but we think he will arrive soon well we cant wait jot said were too tittle to wait tittle agreed they walked in step away from the door stay humfrey said suddenly lacuna and the children were startled surely you dont want to keep them here lacuna said they should get on home to their mother i came here to talk to you humfrey said firmly to the children and now i shall demon x th you can not depart until you have settled with me the two children looked resigned you have named me jot said what gave me away tittle asked two things first i knew that you had to appear very soon if you were going to so any arrival was suspect second you used a term only a member of the adult conspiracy can use you said the word hell but this is hell jot protested its waiting room anyway tittle added that doesnt matter only an adult can use the term therefore it was obvious that you were not a child or children not of our culture anyway and since you are speaking the human language you must be pretending to be human i shall be more careful next tune jot said well out with it tittle added what do you want i want to free my wife from hell humfrey said the woman i love she does not belong there and must be released you have a wife who is not in hell jot pointed out and you can only have one wife tittle reminded him i shall have to choose between them humfrey question quest said if prince dolph was able to choose between his two loves i can do the same but first things first release my wife i have to listen to your plea jot stated but i dont have to do your bidding tittle finished but you do have to deal with me humfrey said you have to satisfy me that you have given my plea fair consideration why do i have to do that jot asked yes who says i have to tittle added you said it humfrey said you laid down the rules of your game and this is a footnote to those rules jot sighed i said too much youve done your homework tittle said well i am the magician of information and i have had some intercourse with demons i have a notion of their nature you cant say a word like that to a child jot cried you have violated the adult conspiracy tittle added lacuna kept her mouth shut but found that she was rather enjoying this dialogue she knew that the business at hand was deadly serious but the children were little darlings even if they werent what they seemed there are no children here humfrey reminded them only facsimiles anyway that demoness was my wife the twins considered i will make you a deal jot said yes a fair deal tittle said but if it is not fair i dont have to make it humfrey said sternly i will complete your question quest jot said i will ask you the one question you cant answer tittle added there is no honest question i cant answer if you answer it correctly you will win jot said question quest and if you dont you will lose tittle said but it must be a fair question humfrey said its an easy question jot said anybody could answer it tittle agreed lacuna knew that it would be nothing of the sort humfrey had explained that at the beginning how did he plan to handle it let me be the judge of that humfrey said tell me what the question will be should i choose to answer it lacuna knew that trick wouldnt work the demon would require him to agree to answer it before he gave the actual question but she was surprised jot said it will be this what is the color of mela merwomans panties tittle asked objection humfrey said if you ask me that one i will be unable to answer it because she doesnt wear any panties so that is a question with no answer and therefore unfair but she will wear panties jot argued when she makes legs to walk on xanth tittle continued why would she ever walk on land humfrey demanded she prefers to swim hi water in search of a husband jot said in the next volume of the history of xanth tittle finished humfrey nodded as if persuaded so you will ask me to name the color when she does don them yes jot said when tittle agreed and the correctness of my answer will determine whether my wife is released from hell right true lacuna knew that humfrey knew that the demon would see that mela chose panties of a different color than humfrey predicted so how could he possibly win question quest that seems fair humfrey said after a bit but it would be tedious to have to wait for her before recovering my wife it will be a year before she walks on land what was he doing how could he agree to the fairness of a manifestly unfair question you will just have to wait jot said not that it makes any difference tittle added humfrey arched a wrinkled eyebrow i was not speaking only of me i was speaking of you it will be tedious for you to have to keep this matter in your mind for that year when it would be preferable to dispose of it immediately i have demonic patience jot said i can wait forever tittle agreed unless there is a shift in the fortunes of your game and you are called away from xanth in the interim humfrey said then you would not be able to attend the panting lacuna was perplexed then realized that he meant the donning of the merwomans panties which meant the demon could not dictate their color and humfrey would win of course in that event the magic would be gone from xanth because of the absence of the demon changing everything but the demon still would have lost which would probably gripe him somewhat you have a point jot said but only one point tittle said i should think you would prefer to avoid both the inconvenience of keeping the matter in mind and the chance of missing the event humfrey said considering that there is an easy way to accomplish that avoidance what jot said caught by surprise how tittle asked by pleabargaining humfrey said it is obvious that if i answer the question we shall both have to wait a year before verifying its validity to mutual inconvenience and annoyance despite knowing the outcome question quest but if we compromise now we can each get part of our desire without further nuisance we can skip the question and answer you are beginning to make sense jot said for a human being tittle amended he was lacuna could not quite see how but she was neither a magician nor a demon let me reside in hell for a month humfrey said then let rose out for a month the average attendance will be the same naturally i would rather have rose out without penalty and you would rather keep her in but this may be a feasible alternative no youre too smart to live in hell jot said you would get the denizens all worked up tittle agreed but who else would be willing to fill in in hell humfrey asked it has to be me there is another yes another who the gorgon jot said your other wife tittle clarified but i wouldnt ask her to do such a thing humfrey protested but i would jot said yes i would tittle agreed the two of them gestured with their four little hands suddenly the gorgon stood in the chamber regal in a black dress and veil humfrey she exclaimed are you finished here yet i am pleabargaining with the demon x lh he said to mitigate the sentence on rose i have offered to spend time in hell equivalent to the tune she is released from hell but the gorgons veiled eyes narrowed so you can spend time with her both in and out of hell she asked neither of you much noticing where you are yes thats it jot said hes a cunning one tittle said question quest the gorgons veiled gaze focused on them children they are the present form of the demon lacuna explained the gorgon refocused on humfrey well ill have none of this visit hell instead humfrey looked surprised but lacuna was catching on to his ways he had anticipated this too and was maneuvering both the gorgon and the demon into agreement with his compromise i would not ask you to the gorgon looked at the children if i resided in hell would i be allowed to pursue my career in dream pictures if the night stallion asked for you jot said hell is a bad dream after all tittle agreed but humfrey said then ill do it the gorgon said i agree jot said she can sub for you tittle agreed humfrey looked amazed if that is the way you feel i will make the bargain jot said firmly the gorgon can sub for your wife in hell tittle added nailing it down then i am constrained to agree humfrey said spreading his hands as if outflanked lacuna saw that humfreys plan had worked he had avoided the rigged contest and obtained the release of rose half time without running afoul of the problem of having two live wives in xanth at the same time he had outsmarted the allpowerful demon jot turned toward her i wouldnt say that he said tittle also turned toward her i would say he just makes sense she said lacuna was aghast the demon knew what was in their minds so humfrey had not prevailed by trickery but by offering the demon a good compromise question quest jot extended his hand and a rolled scroll appeared in it here is the agreement he said tittle extended her hand and a huge feathered quill appeared in it sign it she said jot unrolled the scroll and held it against the wall covering part of lacunas ongoing printed narrative tittle gave humfrey the feather lacuna peered over humfreys shoulder to read the scroll it said in script more elaborate than she could render it is hereby agreed that good magician humfrey shall be allowed to exchange one wife for another in hell et cetera and so forth there was a decorative line below separating the text from the space for signature humfrey squinted at it through his spectacles then shrugged and signed then jot took the quill and signed demon tittle took it and signed xarf then she handed the quill to lacuna but im not part of this lacuna protested you have to witness it the gorgon explained i cant im a relative oh lacuna brought the quill to the paper but something nagged her im not sure that sign it humfrey said shortly so doubtfully lacuna signed it too well thats that jot said yes thats that tittle agreed so lets get on with the exchange humfrey said what exchange jot asked yes what tittle added the exchange of wives humfrey said as agreed jot and tittle exchanged one glance i think he didnt read the small print jot said yes i think he didnt tittle agreed question quest small print the gorgon asked her veil twisting in perplexity jot extended his hand and a big magnifying glass appeared in it use this he said yes read the small print tittle said humfrey took the glass and held it over the decorative line the line expandedand turned out to be two lines of very small print now legible but only in the changes of moon on days beginning with letter n but only in the changes of moon on days beginning with letter n lacuna read aloud getting it right for her own text but when does the moon change and what day of the week begins with the letter jv the gorgon asked she looked at humfrey dear this is nonsense tough udder jot said smugly you signed tittle said smugly humfrey shrugged did you suppose i got to be the magician of information without understanding the concept of small print he asked it can merely modify not reverse the contract thats according to the rules demons follow we have only to interpret it well go home and interpret it jot said yes and stop bothering me tittle added humfrey waggled a finger at them not until i have completed my mission if i leave beforehand i will default he turned to the gorgon you interpret the changes of moon then he turned to lacuna you find the days beginning with n lacuna exchanged two glances with the gorgon then both fell to concentrating lacuna thought about the days of the week and found none that began with n there were two beginning with two with t and one each with f m and w there was a month beginning with n noremember but no day yet it seemed that there had to be a day what could it be question quest then she suffered a blinding inspiration there were n daysif the days of the month were numbered alphabetically the ninth and the nineteenth lacuna has gotten her notion humfrey remarked blinking as the flash of light faded then a flashbulb went off just above the gorgons head making lacuna blink the other part of it had been solved the moon changes every month just like a woman the gorgon said so its every month on the ninth or nineteenth lacuna added and what is today humfrey inquired as if bored the ninth of octogre lacuna said then what in hells annex are we waiting for humfrey demanded irritably jot and tittle exchanged half a glance and half a shrug it was evident that the demons little trick had been found out he had tried to out wait humfrey and not succeeded so he had tried to fool him with the appearance of the little twins and not succeeded so he had tried to pose an unanswerable question and not succeeded this contract was the fourth trick which had failed thanks to humfreys determination and insight would there be another trick if so what would it be lacuna looked up the others were looking at her oh noshe had been automatically transcribing her thoughts and they werenow being printed on the wall there were no secrets here there will be one more trick humfrey said but it will be possible to navigate it if we are sensible the demon can not actually cheat there must always be a way through however devious or he defaults only one more trick that was a relief lacuna turned away from the wall preferring not to see her thoughts displayed fortunately she was such a dull person that no one else was really interested in her thoughts anyway right you are humfrey agreed absently dont mind him dear the gorgon murmured question quest he only speaks when hes interested even if only to grump that made lacuna feel better but she tried to cut off her thoughts without much success well lets go jot said walking toward hells door yes lets make the exchange tittle agreed pacing him and the demon she realized he must have wanted this also perhaps because the gorgon was in her way as great a prize as rose in her way rose could grow flowers in hell the gorgon was now a successful actress the demon must want to keep her but could not unless he made the deal what a cynical bargain the two children paused at the door as one they glanced back at lacuna knowing her thoughts so did humfrey she felt a chill not of danger but of understanding these folk were frighteningly intelligent and cynical how could any ordinary person compete we dont try dear the gorgon murmured walking beside her then lacuna realized that the gorgon too was getting something she wanted instead of waking and returning to her life as a housewife she would get to continue her dream career at least half the time hell it seemed was not much of a specter to one who was making a career in bad dreams the twins pushed open the door come on jot said all of you tittle said they walked through the door the twins humfrey and the gorgon and lacuna the print followed along on the wall and when necessary the floor recording the scene hell turned out to be a barren smoky windy place everything was soiled gray the ground the walls the sky lacuna coughed as she breathed the bad air but the gorgons thick veil seemed to protect her the path led upward then abruptly it was too hot and dry with a blazing sun and withered trees question quest they followed the path on around and down into a gulchand here it was clammy wet with greasy dirty water forming on the skin farther along it was cold with grimy snow on the ground and a storm approaching but when the storm arrived it was mostly just violence threatening to blow them off the path lacuna was beginning to understand the nature of hell the weather was always wrong then they came to a garden and there were roses the air became sweet with their fragrance and the climate was almost nice red yellow and blue the rarest roses known this had to be the magic of princess rose making even hell become pleasant in this one limited region an there she was a woman of middle years kept at the age she had been when brought here in the handbasket rose now she was somewhat plump her hair becoming ash gray but even so more attractive than lacuna herself because she was interesting rather than dull she was in work clothes but these were well tailored and well cared for she did not see the approaching party being intent on her work hey rosehips jot called someone to see you petalears tittle added rose looked up from the orangestriped rose bush she was tending her mouth curved into a rosepetal bow of surprise as she peered past the twins to fix on humfrey my husband you have come at last then she saddened or did you die i did not die he said walking up to her but i had to compromise i can free you only part time she brushed herself off and embraced him part time is better than no time but how is it that you have come now after ninety years you dont look ninety years older ive been using youth elixir i could not rescue you before so i took lethe elixir when it wore off i came here however there is a complication question quest there always is rose said wisely i remarried i know sofia is here too but she was mundane yes she was surprised to find herself here when she died but not unduly dismayed she said it wasnt much worse than mundania in bad weather taiwan is here too and even mareann mareann humfrey echoed sofia is your wife too jot said and the maiden taiwan tittle added lacuna began to see the trap being sprung on humfrey he had made a deal to get his wife out for a limited timebut there were three wives here how could he rescue one and not the others and who are your friends rose inquired becoming aware of the remaining two women this is lacuna who is recording my history humfrey said and this is the gorgon my fifth wife rose frowned it was almost as if she were becoming aware of a problem but she kept it to herself so nice to meet you gorgon are you alive or dead i am alive the gorgon said i have agreed to take the place of a wife here so that that wife can return to life for a time rose smiled and it was like the blossoming of a new rose then you are generous i knew my husband would marry only a good woman surprised the gorgon smiled too under her veil yes that is true lacuna knew they were complimenting each other not themselves just then another figure approached it was a much younger woman quite shapely in her revealing dress are you collecting wives humfrey she inquired humfrey looked at her and was chagrined oh no he muttered and who is this the gorgon asked the demoness danamy first wife humfrey said question quest if you are now dating your wives i qualify dana said but you left me when you lost your soul true but on reflection i realized that i was happier when i was with you you must admit that i was a good wife while it lasted i can be so again meanwhile three more women were approaching ah here are mareann maiden taiwan and sofia rose said spying them we have all become great friends having one interest in common humfrey looked somewhat befuddled perhaps he had reason all the women were beyond youth but none was unattractive there was a circle of greetings then the gorgon asked the obvious question how is it that you are here with the wives mareann because i always did love humfrey mareann said simply i would have married him had i not feared it would cost me my innocence now in hell i have had much of my innocence taken from me so there is no further barrier between us except that of death i would be happy to marry him now so which wife are you going to take jot inquired smugly or will you marry mareann and take her tittle asked so it was to be a choice among six no wonder the demon had decided to compromise he had of course known that this was coming demons of any kind had little care for the affairs of man but great interest in complications this was a rare complication lacuna did not see how humfrey was going to find his way out of this one lets consult the gorgon said in a businesslike manner since im the one who is making it possible i think i should have some say in the decision yes maybe you will change your mind jot said maybe you wont let any of them out tittle added question quest so that humfrey having made his compromise would be denied the benefit of it lacuna realized the demon x lh must have seen to it that all of them appeared here including dana demoness what a great joke for the demons jot gestured and a round table appeared with ten chairs tittle gestured and ten place settings appeared then rose fetched a decanter of rose wine and a key lime pie with rose petals decorating each piece evidently the petals made the pie good despite its origin in hell the wine turned out to have rose petals floating in it too when they were all served the discussion began jot and tittle gobbled their pie slices and gulped their wine as if it were milk in exactly the manner of children the others sampled theirs more cautiously lacuna found both the wine and pie to be very good rose evidently had a talent for preparing such things probably this was a trait shared by all his wives and girlfriend ah five of you wish to share moments of humfreys life the gorgon inquired she was eating especially carefully lifting her veil aside without uncovering her eyes the other nodded perhaps we wish also to experience life again rose said she glanced at dana demoness or to simulate it she glanced at mareann or to indulge in a manner not possible before but i can take only one humfrey protested and the only one i want is is it mareann inquired that evidently set him back lacuna knew from his life history that he had loved only three times mareann rose and the gorgon the other three had been essentially business relationships however well they had fulfilled them i have discovered things of interest in the dream realm the gorgon said i have no objection to spending more time in it suppose we give each wife question quest or love a month in turn before i take my turn in six months the cycle would be complete and we could start again the women exchanged fifteen glances lacuna thought that there should be twentyfive glances as each woman met the eyes of the five others but some magic made fifteen enough hey dont i have any say in the matter humfrey inquired grumpily of course not the gorgon said and the others nodded agreement it took you ten years to get this far do you think we want to wait another ten for you to figure it out what no big fight jot asked disappointed no screeching and hair pulling tittle added this may be hell the gorgon said but we arent hellions so it seems we are agreed what should be the order of visitation to xanth alphabetic dana said that would put her first age at death sofia said that would put her first because three had not died and so couldnt compete and the other two had evidently died younger thats when our assets were frozen as it were chronologic mareann said that put her first the others considered they nodded chronologic did seem to make sense so it seems we are agreed the gorgon said mareann will go first now if you will excuse me i have a curtain call by prior appointment she glanced at the twins you are honoring the deal i presume jot grimaced i have to tittle scowled mores the pity lets do it then the gorgon said as she faded out this was for her only a dream so she had dreamy powers and evidently enjoyed them but i think we owe a vote of thanks to rose who made this possible by bringing humfrey here mareann said question quest the other applauded rose blushed rose red have some candied rose petals she said humfrey looked at mareann i suppose youre going to want a ceremony he grumped a little one will do mareann said shyly try as he would humfrey did not manage to look entirely displeased she had after all been his first love funs over jot said until the panties tittle agreed lacuna glanced at the twins as she followed humfrey and mareann down the path toward the exit i realize that you are merely figments of the demons imagination but you are cute and im almost sorry i wont be seeing you again at that they both burst into wild laughter and dissolved into smoke that bothered her what was so funny the handbasket was waiting in the waiting room the three of them climbed in wont you be sorry to lose your unicorns humfrey inquired there are no unicorns in hell she replied i havent seen them in ages anyway i will still be able to summon other equines they continued to talk as the basket swung up and away oblivious of lacuna she was glad for them but what of her own life would she really be able to change it the basket slowed lacuna saw that it was not proceeding straight back the way she had come now another type of dream realm was opening out with a yellow brick path below humfrey had described that they reached a pleasant community there was a handsome young couple standing on the path evidently waiting for them it was hugo with wira his blind love this is where we get off humfrey said lacuna you ride back to the castle tell them were coming yes of course lacuna said surprised but now question quest she realized that her body was at the castle while the other bodies were at the isle of illusion they would have to take turns riding the magic carpet back after waking up the others got out introductions were proceeding as the basket bore lacuna away mareann had never met either hugo or wira of course now she would be a temporary stepmother for hugo it should be all right then the castle came into sight lacuna had a lot to tell grey and ivy chapter change l lacuna saw her body lying within the temporary coffin she climbed out of the handbasket and let go she dropped to the coffin through its lid and on down into her body she was back suddenly she felt stifled she lifted a hand to pound on the closed lid in a moment it lifted and there was magician grey murphy peering down youre back he said we didnt see you lacuna sat up feeling a bit disoriented ive been to hell and back in the handbasket she said i have a whole lot to tell you but first i have to warn you that good magician humfrey is coming back hes on his way now with his girlfriend mareann and what ivy asked lacuna saw that this was not going to be a simple explanation so she plunged in she just had time to cover the main gist and part of the minor gist before humfreys magic carpet arrived he had evidently used a lightening spell because all four were on it together then lacuna had to perform the introductions because she was the only one present who had had per question quest sonal contact with everyone though some of it only through her printing of humfreys history wira was now a woman not a lot younger than lacuna herself but humfrey located his youth elixir and gave her a dose then she became her real age of sixteen lacuna wished she could do that but of course youthening wouldnt do her any good it was her whole life that was blah not just her physical age she felt awkward now for she was not really part of this group i should go do my service for magician grey now she murmured and grey took note but it will take time to research your answer humfrey snorted oh ill do it i dont like reunions much anyway he stalked off toward the study and lacuna followed humfrey squinted at the old pages ah here it is you must take the key to success and go to the mountain of change before the statue of limitations runs out he went to a shelf and picked up a large wooden key bring this back when you are finished with it he handed it to her but lacuna said blankly nonsense the magic carpet will take you there after you deal with cornpewter be sure to return it too he walked out of the study but lacuna said following helplessly oh by the way he said pausing thank you youre welcome but heres the carpet get on it she did so bemused then it took off but she protested one more time despairingly to no better avail than before she was on her way the carpet seemed to know where it was going it flew out a window and looped around the castle before heading north it soon went out over the awesome gap chasm but instead of crossing it it turned to fly west along it then it flew south a short distance to a small mountain and looped down to a cave in the base it question quest entered this cave flying unerringly in the sudden darkness until reaching a large bright chamber it landed before lacuna was a rather junky metallic box with knobs on the front and a pane of glass sticking up at the top part of it was fashioned from a pewter pitcher which lacuna now realized the demoness metria had sneaked from humfreys castle to bring here it was amazing how things integrated now that she knew humfreys life story this was cornpewter the dread nemesis of xanth a greeting the pane printed i think you dont know who i am lacuna said nerving herself for her effort she had spoken blithely of changing its print but she knew that the evil machine had a lot of power and a doubt was starting to nag at the edge of her mind with a qualm a twinge and even a compunction waiting in line behind compewters power was to change reality in its vicinity by printing the reality it preferred on its screen she could change its printbut would it remain changed why hadnt she thought of this problem before i dont even care who you are you are obviously supremely dull i will use you as a servant i dont think so she said and concentrated on the magic formula she had rehearsed to dominate the device the print on the screen changed now it said com pewter is reprogrammed to be a nice machine it has no use for the services of grey murphy and renounces them save and compile the last word was the key that constituted a special spell that would change cornpewters nature the pane of glass blinked huh it printed with something less than machinelike precision lacuna had had the sense not to get off the magic carpet well ill be going now she said print rolled across the screen woman decides to remain longer and lacuna found that she couldnt question quest tell the carpet to go she had indeed changed her mind the evil machine was fighting back in a moment it would decree that she decided to reverse the reprogramming she had just accomplished and she feared she would not be able to deny it but she could fight back too even as the print appeared she changed it woman is sent on her way by compewter who prefers time alone to meditate on its new niceness it worked the carpet lifted and sailed down the cave tunnel out of the mountain not only did compewters print change the local reality it changed the evil machines mind once it was printed it was so even if the machine didnt like it and it seemed that compewter could not reprogram itself it was stuck with her new prime directive to be nice and to renounce the services of grey murphy lacuna had accomplished her mission now she had only to get her reward she stared at the wooden key she still held in her hand what had magician humfrey said she had to take this key to success to the mountain of change beforebefore what something was going to happen but she didnt remember what she looked around the carpet was moving over unfamiliar territory lacuna had not been paying attention and was now lost it didnt matter because the carpet knew where it was going but she would have preferred to know also was this north or south of the gap chasm the carpet circled down by a curious walled park somehow lacuna couldnt quite see what was inside the park it was obscured by trees and bits of mist this must be where the mountain of change was but what was she supposed to do there it was all so unclear she wished it had been grey murphy who had researched her answer because he was young and inexperienced so tended to explain things carefully humfrey just assumed that everyone knew things and had no patience but of course he had lived a long time question quest and experienced many things as she well knew after printing his life history he had a right to be short with ignorant folk she got up and stepped off the carpet it rolled up behind her but did not fly away that was a relief she did not want to be stranded in this strange place it wasnt that the loss of such a dull person as she was would harm xanth in any way but she preferred to be dull in her own home rather than to bore folk she didnt know she approached the large wooden door to the park she lifted her wooden key and fitted it into the keyhole she turned it the lock resisted she turned harder but it was no use the key would not work lacuna stepped back and looked at the park what little she could see was not attractive the wall was worn and the nearby trees were wilting she saw a word printed along the wall failure oh no she had come to the wrong place but the carpet wouldnt have done that this must be the right placeor maybe it could become the right place she focused on the word and changed it success the wall brightened the foliage of the trees hanging over it became greener she approached the door again she tried the key this time the lock clicked now this was the right place thanks to her talent she tried to close the door after her but the hinges tightened up and it no longer budged it remained firmly open curious she stepped back outside the park to see if anything else was approaching waiting for this opportunity but no one was then the door slammed shut behind her making a bang she jumped was she locked out she tried her key once more it turned and the door opened but again it refused to closeuntil she stepped outside now she understood it would not close until the one who had opened it and entered the park went question quest back out that was a fairly neat magical devicebut to what purpose why should the door care whether she was inside or outside she shrugged it was a harmless mystery if it should close while she was inside she could use the key to unlock it again she gazed around the park inside she saw a statue of a naked running man he was a finelooking specimen in every respectmuscular handsome and well endowed in a fashion a maiden was not supposed to understand but of course it was only a statue they were always idealized she really didnt care about that particular detail her desire was for a man who was good in his head and heart and for good children one of the problems with men was that they put more store by a womans anatomy than by her head and heart fortunately women had more sense so used their minds to choose the more sensible men but it did help if the men were handsome then she became aware of something else the statue was changing ever so slowly it was moving the forefoot was coming down and the body was shifting forward and the hair was blowing back as if he were racing through the wind maybe on her scale he was barely making progress but on his scale he was sprinting where could he be going she looked the way he was looking and saw that it was the open door oh evidently he hoped to get out before it closed again how lucky for him that she had happened to come long just before he reached it lucky lacuna had learned to distrust coincidence maybe in mundania chance governed but this was xanth there might be more to this than appeared she pondered then tried an experiment she scuffed a mark by the mans leading foot so she had a record of exactly where he was then she stepped out of the park again the door slammed shut behind her she took a walk around exploring the region after a few minutes she returned and used her key to open question quest the door again she entered and as usual it froze in the open position she walked to the statue sure enough he had not passed her scuff mark though he had had time to do so in fact he was even a bit behind it he had retreated during her absence or perhaps been reset to his original position he raced for the door only when it was open and he had to start a certain distance from it but what was the point coincidence was not the only thing lacuna distrusted pointlessness was suspicious too especially in a magical place she peered more closely at the statue now she saw what she had overlooked before it was on a low pedestal evidently the man started there and ran off it to the door on the pedestal was the legend statue of limitations that was the other thing humfrey had mentioned she had to go to the mountain of change before the statue of limitations ran out before he ran out the door obviously if he got there first the door might close behind himand then perhaps her key would no longer work and she would be confined in the park perhaps she would have to strip naked and get on the pedestal ready to run out when the next person entered and she might have to move as slowly as the man did being rendered statuesque what an awful fate but now she knew she would have to complete her business at the mountain of change quickly because the man was not all that far from the door if she took too long she would surely be lost so where was the mountain of change it had to be here somewhere she spied a path behind the statue and quickly followed it the park was not all that large so this had a fair chance of leading where she wanted she was right soon the mountain hove into view it was not large as ordinary mountains went but it glistened oddly as she came closer she saw that its slopes question quest were rough with shiny little stones then she came closer yet and discovered that those werent stones they were disks in fact they were mundane coins gold and silver and copper and brass what was called small change the mountain of change she had assumed that it would be a mountain where things changed and perhaps her life would change too so that she could somehow be fulfilled instead of deadly dull blah she should have known better still this was supposed to represent the solution to her problem so maybe it was both kinds of change what was she supposed to do here well what did anyone do with a mountain anyone climbed it simply because it was there everyone knew that so she would climb it she started climbing it but the moment her feet got on the coins they lost purchase her legs did not exactly sink into the surface it was just that she could not climb instead the coins gave way below so that she remained pretty much where she was but she had to climb or the statue of limitations would run out before she got where she was going she surely couldnt afford that she stepped back and pondered the situation what would freeze these loose coins in place so she could climb them she remembered something humfreys mundane wife sofia had said in passing frozen assets it seemed irrelevant yet she almost had a notion her notion clarified it turned out to be a naughty one but she was pressed for time that statue might reach the door at any moment she had to try whatever might work and quickly she stepped back onto the change held her skirt tight about her legs and sat down the surface of the mountain was surprisingly cold she was chilled right through the hips then she touched the coins around her sure question quest enough they did not budge they were frozen in place they could not handle this particular type of contact she knew she could not afford to stand up again it was not her feet which froze the change so she pushed with hands and feet and scooted as well as she could up the slope it was uncomfortable and tiring but she made decent progress and the mountain was small she was glad it hadnt been composed of large change finally somewhat soiled of skirtshe hadnt realized that mundane change was such dirty moneyand numb of rear she reached the top of the mountain of change she got to her feet and stood in the loosening coins what now humfrey had not told her what to do once she got here well maybe she simply had to make her wish that might be so obvious to magician humfrey that he thought it was unnecessary to mention so she would try it i wish i had married vernon twelve years ago she said she waited nothing happened her excursion had it seemed been for nothing she must have gotten here after the statue of limitations ran out her effort had not been enough because she was no heroine just a drab woman lacuna sighed it had at least been worth a try she had for a little while had a glimmer of hope she slogged down the mountain her feet half sliding on the massed coins she walked forlornly back the way she had come there was nothing to do but fly back to the good magicians castle and return the magic carpet and the key to success but when she reached the door she discovered it closedand the statue still inside what had happened that door had been wedged open had someone else come and managed to close it she saw that the statue had almost reached the exit question quest he must have had the door slam in his face she knew how that felt but there was no other person lacuna shrugged and used the wooden key to unlock the door from inside it opened and she stepped through the door closed immediately behind her hi mom she jumped surprised there was a bluehaired boy with a water ball in his hand it was ryver the guardian of the moat who had almost prevented her from entering humfreys castle at the outset of this story what was he doing here did you get your wish mom ryver asked politely im afraid it just wasnt she broke off what did you call me whats the matter mom you look spooked did something bad happen in there she stared at him he had wanted to be adopted into a human family but she wasnt a family she was just a middleaged maid something odd may have occurred yes she agreed cautiously she preferred not to speak further on the subject until she had a better notion what had happened outside the park well wed better get back before dad misses us ryver said i got the carpet lets go he indicated the magic carpet which was now spread out on the ground they got on ryver sat in front to direct it he handed her his water ball which she accepted as if used to this it did not break in her hand to her faint surprise she sat behind the boy on the carpet it took off soon they were sailing over the landscape your fatherhes worried she inquired hoping to elicit further information no its not that he said cheerfully he just isnt much of a hand at taking care of the kids also hes curious what you were wishing for he says it isnt as if you had a bad life or anything question quest lacuna stared into the ball of water as if it were a magic crystal wondering just how good or bad her life was supposed to be in due course the carpet descended it came to rest just outside the moat of the good magicians castle two blurs of motion came charging across the lowered drawbridge in two moments they flung themselves into lacunas embrace causing her to drop the water ball which splattered on the ground they were jot and tittle whom she had encountered in hells annex great to see you again mom jot exclaimed planting a somewhat slobbery kiss on her left cheek yes great to have you back mom tittle agreed planting a slightly more dainty kiss on her right cheek these were now her children then a man crossed the drawbridge at a more sedate pace he was oddly familiar in fact he was the statue that perfect specimen for running nonow she saw that he was older but still in excellent physique it was vernon who had grown considerably more handsome in the past decade or so as if a good woman had seen to his health and happiness did you have a good trip dear lacuna tried not to stare at him could it be that he really was her husband now i may have she answered he reached down to help her get off the carpet and out of the entanglement of children he brought her to her feet and drew her in for a kiss then she began to believe the mountain of change had changed her life yet why was she the only one who realized it vernon rolled up the carpet and carried it back across the drawbridge lacuna and the children followed she noticed that there was now a regular moat monster in the water who let them pass without challenge she paused looking more carefully at the creature it seemed somehow familiar though she was sure she had never seen it before had she heard of it then she made the connection she had heard of it arent you question quest souffle serpent she asked it who guarded the moat for princess rose of roogna the monster nodded his head in agreement evidently more had changed around here than her life when ryver stopped being the moat guardian soufflђ must have resumed the post if her change of life had made ryvers life change then this had been necessary how many other ripples had this thing set in motion mareann met them at the castle entrance she stepped forward to embrace lacuna i see that you did get your wish she murmured she at least recognized the change which had occurred perhaps because she had been in hell with lacuna and therefore apart from normal xanth what wish vernon asked mareann answered for her hers was the same as mine merely to return to her loving family but you were away from yours vernon said mareann merely smiled we women have our little ways they come with our loss of innocence vemon shook his head perplexed lacuna decided that it would be best to let him remain that way they returned the carpet and key to magician humfrey he was already deep in his beloved book of answers that confounded foreign elf he was muttering now she wants to find her way back to the world of two moons and shes going to arrive here right at the worst time worst time lacuna asked curious though she was sure it was none of her businessor perhaps because it was none of her business portrait day he grumbled all my wives will be given passes from hell to attend because such a melee will amuse the demon x ih and ill have to have my portrait done too and if theres one thing i hate worse than a gaggle of women its posing for a portrait maybe jenny elfs appearance will give you a pre question quest text to get away from it all for a moment by addressing her question lacuna suggested humfrey brightened maybe it will then he realized that someone was actually in the room with him there was the key beside his tome oh youre back yes thank you your answer worked but of course it worked he snapped how could it be otherwise but there is one thing lacuna began is that another question humfrey inquired for another service she would have to let it go no thank you for the use of the carpet and key he glowered at her i hate it when dull folk are too nice very well i will make an incidental remark certain people are not directly affected by certain events when they are the focus of those actions they are as it were the movers rather than the moved but in time you will pick up your intervening history by listening to the comments of others and you will gradually come to accept this as your own memory your present life is as it seems thank you magician she said gratefully now she knew why she almost alone remembered her other life she was the one who had changed it some few others who had interacted with her before that change and who had had their own lives changed by her actions also remembered but the rest of xanth would not realize what had happened to them the present situation was the one which had always been true humfrey nodded then he did an extremely rare thing he smiled lacuna returned the smile while vernon looked confused its nothing to worry about dear lacuna told him taking his arm lets go home and find something interesting to do she nudged him in a way that suggested all manner of wild creatures such as lovebirds and storks she had dreamed for years of doing that but had never before had the opportunity or courage what a joy it was question quest his eye glinted you have always been the most interesting person in my life he said lacuna intended to remain so history of xanth by e timber brant presumed arrival of the demon x plus or minus ten thousand years or multiple thereof causing magic to slowly infuse the region from the trace leakage of his essence

of her frequent change of bodies she survives until when she is banished to brain coral storage the hag apparently forgot her history remembering only that she is thousands of years old about this

with ches family prince dolph marries electra as she turns eighteen in normalliving time humfrey rescues five and a half wives from hell in a fashion lacunas change of life authors note i try to discourage my readers from sending in puns and notions because i have an adequate imagination of my own and the letters piling in take time to answer i answered in the first three months of and that slowed the start of this novel but because the story of good magician humfrey covered over a century of xanths historyto be precise years from his delivery in to his return in and because he is the magician of information there was occasion to see more aspects of xanth than usual so this time i used more reader notions and i have a bundle of credits to give just bear in mind that i am unlikely to be this free with reader notions again and that i am turned off by fans who pester me with ideas or puns in the hope of getting their names in print indeed i tend to favor notions by folk who are not seeking that kind of recognition here are the names of the contributors roughly in the order of the appearance of their notions jessica timinstalent of making others experience vertigo tyler

chris and nataliemountain of change meanwhile e timber bram figuring out obscure dates and events compiled the history of xanth a digested portion of which is included in this volume the complete edition contains a list of the dates for all the novels spot biographies of the known kings of xanth a chart of the eras and ages of xanth a table of the mundane waves of colonization and genealogies of significant characters as well as the main history with authoritative footnotes he sent it to me via his mundane alias who is too undistinguished to mention here there were a few other suggestions which i meant to use but which got squeezed out im sorry to disappoint the folk who sent them in but they will surely appear in a later novel michael stasco was one of a number of readers who sent complicated lists of questions i hate it when readers prove they are smarter than i am so im getting even by running the main part of my response to him if any of you have similar questions stifle them i might not manage to figure out the answers next time dear michael sigh you have excellent questions okay i will answer them here and maybe run these answers in the authors note to question quest which i am now writing why didn t electra awaken during the time of no magic she did but realized that there was no prince handy to kiss her so she went back to sleep and in a few hours the spell resumed when electra went to mundania she aged phys question quest ically but she should have remained childlike because maturity comes with experience no not necessarily some grown folk are immature and some children are mature in outlook but it is the nature of humorous magic that age does bring maturity this may be unscientific but were not talking science here but magic if sex is just a natural function for centaurs why do they take part in the adult conspiracy because they honor the foibles of those with whom they associate centaur tutors for example must set good examples for the human children they tutor since grey murphy was raised in mundanias sexual realities is it possible that he may begin a slow corruption of the adult conspiracy possible but unlikely because ivy is bound to enhance his xanth morality why cant centaurs assume the three forms of their crossbreed probably because they never thought to try it and believe it to be uncentauriy to assume any other form why didnt millie the ghost change from book to human form during the time of no magic because she had been restored to living form before then why didnt zombies cease to exist during the tune of no magic they did who saw a zombie then but they resumed when the magic returned just as did tangle trees and such why didnt murphy and vadne age rapidly when they went to mundania because the brain corals pool had kept them in suspended animation in contrast to electras magic sleep if wiggle swarms arent as bad as they are thought to be then why did the simurgh panic i dont recall the simurgh ever panicking are you sure this isnt someones slanderous story could xavier use reversewood to fill the holes question quest made by wiggles why should he want to few folk would care to be patched together with reversewood slivers if ivy touches reversewood would her reversed talent then lessen the effect of the wood yesso she has little to fear would a combination of ivy arnolde centaur and reversewood in mundania make a mundane magical no the reversewood would make arnoldes magic aisle into a mundane aisle and nothing would change would trace amounts of xanthian magic in mundania account for people like vri getter whose power is to bend spoons and the amazing randi whose power is to prove that vri getter cannot bend spoons with magic no fakery and the exposure of it require no magic if hitler had released a couple on the condition that their son come and run auschwitz would it be dishonorable and unethical for the son to tell hitler to go to hell and not run auschwitz technically the answer may be yes but the reality of the situation says that dishonor is okay if honor causes more evil to occur so why couldnt grey just tell compewter to go to hell because grey murphy has a better sense of honor than you do just as an honorable son will pay off his fathers debts left when the father dies he will honor his fathers other lingering commitments the idea that an existing commitment can be renounced just because you decide you dont want to do it is sheer mischief try telling the irs that you wont pay your income tax because the income tax law was passed before you were born try telling the government that you refuse to obey its laws because you dont like the way it spends money on missiles designed to kill people the fact is it is not your province to decide what prior deals you will honor unless you are prepared to pay the consequence of breaking the law that is a decision question quest that some folk do make and they do pay the price the ends do not justify the means the end of making your own life better does not justify the violation of solemn prior commitments if you run for president and win then maybe you can see about changing things as i was completing the novel came a fan letteractually i answered several hundred letters in the course of the novel but this was one of the lastfrom the west indies what i noticed was the stationery handpasted pictures of roses on each sheet rose of roogna had sent me a fan letter well almost it was a nice xanth fen letter from an exotic place but the ladys name was sharmila ramsingh still she may be related because of those roses and of course we have a jenny update jenny elf appeared in isle of view and has only a bit part in the present novel but she will play a larger role in the color of her panties no they arent her panties in question what kind of a series do you think this is but its jenny of mundania im concerned with at the moment and her life is not as pleasant as that of jenny elf for those who did not see the note in the last novel jenny was struck by a reckless driver when she was twelve and almost killed she was three months in a coma until my first letter to her brought her out of it i have written to her regularly since and met her and her family in noremember at scicon a convention in virginia when she was thirteen richard pini of elfquest who attended and his graphic edition of isle of view was made and published jenny looks like jenny elf only with more fingers and less pointed ears jenny is slowly making progress she is now home after about a year in the hospital and going to a special school that caters to those with disabilities such as hers there was a newspaper article about her and that resulted in many calls and offers of help a clown came to entertain jenny and her friends and she was given question quest tickets and an ambulance ride to see a program by the new kids on the block she is working to move both arms instead of just one and to move her legs when she is held upright she is learning to speak words one by one she understands words you see but the connections between her brain and her mouth are scrambled so she cant just say them in short jenny has not given up on the recovery of the use of her body and intends somehow someday to walk again she will be a young lady of fifteen when this novel is published also during the course of this novel i attended my one convention of the year dont like to travel which was phoenixcon in atlanta georgia mundania i went only because of friendship with bill ritch who was one of the convention organizers he had helped me get computerized in i was on several panels read a selection from my mainstream historical novel fathom mound and met with business associates deciding how to handle the xanth calendars by the time this novel is published you may have seen me on tv hawking calendars thus the convention was both business and fun then disaster i had to attend two more conventions that year back in florida my elder daughter penny graduated from college achieving her ba in human resources no honors no awards she takes after me being scholastically indifferent the educational establishment has yet to recognize whatever special talents folk like penny and me possess but penny did seem to have the longest hair in her class which made her easy to spot across the crowded auditorium meanwhile a problem that developed as i wrote the prior novel may have carried through to its conclusion question quest in this one my tongue hurt i thought it was getting scratched on a tooth so i saw the dentist and sure enough two of my onlaysthose are like inlays but more sowere wearing thin and developing edges that my tongue touched the dentist tried smoothing them down but the problem continued so reluctantly he replaced the two onlays with two gold crowns andmy tongue was still sore i had to use bubblegum to protect my tongue could it be that roughness on the lower teeth was responsible he made me an appliance to cover thelower teeth and still my tongue hurt but we were catching on to the pattern of it my tongue gets most abraded when im talkingand when im editing novels such as this one because i read them aloud to myself getting the sonic feel of them maybe my tongue was hitting a rough spot when i talked then settling back to an innocent spot when i relaxedand so i felt it in the innocent position that could account for a lot so the dentist made an appliance to cover my upper jaw trying to nail down the problem once and for all and as this novel finished my tongue was on the way to recovery we hope and yes i hear those muttered remarks from readers about how i should tone down the temper of my remarks so that i wont melt any more onlays and burn my tongue i would answer youif my answer werent apt to prove your point that was about it for excitement mundania as you know isnt much piers anthony mayhem ps yes my trollfree number remains in operation we have the xanth calendar ogre video interview xanth tshirts an ongoing newsletter and a stock of every anthony novel in print including this one call hi piers to be possessed by our
