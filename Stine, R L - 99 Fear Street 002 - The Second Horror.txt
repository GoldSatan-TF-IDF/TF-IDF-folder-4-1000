prologue the ghost of cally frasier peered out of an attic window a shadow floating in shadows she stared down at the front yard and watched as the new family started to move into the house my house cally thought fear street the house where i lived and where i died you will be sorry cattys ghost murmured bitterly i promise you will be sorry no one heard callys bitter promise that didnt matter she would make it come true watching the new family a teenage boy and his parents cally thought of her own family gone vanished they abandoned me here cally thought without sadness her anger didnt allow for sadness the evil drove them away as she had every day since theyd left cally thought about the house the house that had become her tomb the house was built over thirty years ago she knew built on cursed land the first owners never moved in the man who built the house brought his family to see it and left them alone for five minutes five minutes when he returned his wife and children were dead their heads ripped from their bodies he hanged himself one month later here in this house for thirty years no one would live here then my family moved in and became victims of the evil my little brother james and his puppy lost forever lost somewhere in the walls of this house my father blinded by a thick cloud of evil my mother and kody kody my twin sister all driven away by the evil but im still here the ghost of cally thought the evil would not let me go the evil is inside me i fed it running through me night and day cally tossed back her head and let out an angry wail of frustration then she returned to the window the strangers were invading a big van was parked in the driveway movers carried carton after carton into the empty house the husband and wife stood watching with their arms around each other then they opened the trunk of their car and began to unload cartons oddly shaped boxes marked fragile their teenage son stood nearby holding a black and white cat the boy was tall and goodlooking when she was alive catty might have liked him she might have thought he was cute but now she was dead and he was alive they couldnt even be friends could they the shadow of cally slipped and slid among the houses dark shadows she glared down at the new family come in she urged them silently come in im waiting for you here im ready to welcome you to fear street i have a welcome i dont think you will forget chapter hey be careful with those boxes mr mccloy shouted brandt mccloy watched his father chase after one of the movers who had four large cardboard boxes piled in his arms the top box teetered and mr mccloy caught it as it fell those are priceless tribal masks mr mccloy scolded the mover theyre very old sorry about that the mover replied hurrying inside brandt thought he didnt sound sorry at all brandt stroked ezra his black and white cat and sighed dad and his masks he murmured to ezra he probably thinks if one breaks it means seven years bad luck ezra purred in reply brandt stared wistfully at the familys new house a new beginning he thought a whole new life the house stood two and a half stories tall its gray shingles were chipped and stained the old trees surrounding the house cast it in deep shadow it might have been nice once brandt thought noticing two window shutters hanging from their hinges but it sure needs help now five steps led to a small sagging front porch the front door was surrounded by cracked stainedglass windows that badly needed to be replaced the house is so rundown brandt thought but his parents thought theyd be comfortable there brandt hoped so he was darkly handsome with wavy black hair hanging loose framing his face and flashing brown eyes he wore faded jeans and a shirt made from colorful handwoven doth a small leather pouch hung on a leather string around his neck this he never took off brandt turned as mr mccloy stormed out of the house scowling mrs mccloy trailed after him there are rats in there he cried angrily in the basement rats brandt thought unhappily petting ezra thats all we need no problem dad he said theres got to be an exterminator in town i checked this house completely before i bought it mr mccloy fumed there was no sign of rats in the basement two months ago you must have missed them somehow john mrs mccloy said its not the end of the world im calling that real estate agent and demanding that he get over here and do something about this what was his name again lurie lurie a mans voice interrupted it seemed to come from nowhere did i hear the name lurie brandt and his parents turned toward the voice a young man stood on the sidewalk smiling at them his hair was straight and black and he had a black mustache he wore gray denim overalls and carried a tool kit dont mean to interrupt the man said i just happened to overhear do you know him mr mccloy asked do you know mr lurie ive heard of him the man answered the people who used to live here i heard them mention the name he held out a longfingered hand mr mccloy shook it the man introduced himself as glen hankers i do odd jobs handiwork that sort of things great brandts father said im john mccloy this is my wife barbara and my son brandt you know anything about rats mr hankers hankers nodded pest control is my specialty why dont i take a look mr mccloy gratefully led mr hankers inside brandt glanced at the movers who were still hauling boxes into the house will you take ezra for a while he asked his mother he held the cat out to her i think the movers could use some help mrs mccloy frowned i wish you wouldnt brandt youve got to be careful your condition brandt sighed his mother was always worrying about him no problem nothing too heavy he said impatiently pressing the cat into her arms dont worry so much mrs mccloys frown deepened but she took the cat brandt rubbed the small scar on his left cheek then he made his way to the moving van and carried a small carton of books into the house after two or three trips he heard his father calling to him from the living room hey brandt i could use some help in here brandt set a box of books on the floor of the hall and walked into the living room mr hankers says he can get rid of the rats in no time mr mccloy said i guess i overreacted a bit brandts father sat on the living room floor among a dozen cardboard boxes carefully unwrapping his tribal relics one by one he peeled away the newspaper wrappers to reveal ancient spears and delicately carved boldly painted masks most of them twisted into frightened or cruel expressions next he pulled out reed pipes that had been used for blowing darts the darts were made of silver and honed to razorsharp points i want to get these things up on the wall before we do anything else brandts father said it will guarantee well have good lock in our new home you dont really believe that do you dad brandt asked opening one of the boxes you never know brandt his father answered it cant hurt can it i guess not brandt replied he heard his mother walk into the house and pick up the box of books hed left on the floor ezra wandered into the room and rubbed against brandts leg mr mccloy nailed a hook into the wall brandt held up a spear it was long and straight with a sharp bronze point brandts father stepped aside as brandt began to hang the spear on the hook suddenly brandt felt a sharp tug hey whats happening the spear seemed to jump out of his hand point down it plunged to the floor a yowl of pain shattered the silence brandt gazed down and cried out in horror ezra he screamed chapter the cat uttered a feeble groan the spear had pierced all the way through his furry body bright red blood puddled onto the floor its eyes wild the cat frantically squirmed and jerked but it couldnt free itself ezra brandt dropped onto his knees beside the twitching cat dont touch him brandt his father instructed get the phone try to reach a vet his heart in his throat brandt raced for the telephone at least ezra didnt suffer too long mr mccloy assured them at the dinner table that evening the vet said the pain probably lasted only a few seconds and ezra was getting old brandt his mother added he wouldnt have lived more than a year or two longer anyway brandt nodded he knew ezra was old and would have died soon but to die so violently he could still picture the cat with the spear in its side what a way to start out in our new house brandt thought unhappily some new beginning he shook his head as if to clear the thoughts away his mother set a paper plate in front of him a slice of pizza he picked it up and bit into it pizza what a treat mr mccloy exclaimed through a mouthful i dont think ive had pizza in two years has it been that long brandt i had a slice two weeks ago in the airport brandt replied on the way home from mapolo his mother laughed you couldnt wait to get your hands on pizza the whole time we lived on the island you whined and complained about not having pizza every day anything wouldve been better than that taro mush brandt exclaimed do you think the grocery stores are open on sunday mrs mccloy asked probably her husband answered nothing closes in the states anymore then ill go to the store tomorrow and buy some healthy food mrs mccloy announced biting into her pizza is that a threat brandt joked come on brandt his mother said you know you like healthy foods why you were eating like a native by the time we left you asked me to make stewed mushrooms and coconut for your birthday remember and dont you miss the pineapples brandt remembered how sweet and juicy the pineapples were on mapolo maybe he did miss the island a bit brandt had spent most of his life traveling to exotic places with his parents for the last couple of years theyd lived on a tiny remote island in the pacific called mapolo where mr mccloy an anthropologist studied ritual magic are you looking forward to school on monday brandt mrs mccloy asked as she handed him a glass of pepsi nervous it was the middle of october brandt hadnt been to school yet why should i be nervous he replied after mapolo high school should be a breeze i think youll enjoy it mr mccloy said wiping cheese off his chin with a paper napkin your mother was right you do need a couple of years of normal american life after all the traveling weve done and if you dont like it mrs mccloy suggested think of it as another anthropology project the rituals of american high school students everyone laughed when the time came to leave mapolo mrs mccloy said she wanted brandt to live in america for a few years and mr mccloy agreed he accepted a teaching post at waynesbridge junior college and moved the family to nearby shadyside where the high school was considered more challenging remember that old woman mrs mccloy asked what was her name zina brandt replied right zina remember that day she disappeared the whole island searched for her but her daughter kept insisting zina had turned into a panther and she wanted me to trap the panther brandt remembered i never understood that why me i was just a fourteenyearold kid because of the prophesy brandts father explained the village sorcerer said something about a young stranger coming to the island a young stranger who could break the spell on zina and you were the only young stranger around i always thought that girl made the prophesy story up brandts mother said i think she had a crush on you brandt mom she was twenty years old i was only fourteen theres no way she had a crush on me you never know brandt mrs mccloy teased different cultures and everything anyway mr mccloy cut in its nice to live in a real house again i wont miss our leaky old leaf hut even with rats in the basement brandt asked mr mccloy didnt reply mrs mccloy said brightly of course the house needs work its always that way when you move well just think of it as a project a family project to work on together brandt rolled his eyes sometimes his mother was so chipper it made him sick and well get a new cat brandt if you want one mr mccloy offered im not sure i do brandt said not yet well think about it mr mccloy said brandt closed his eyes and saw ezra pinned through the back with the spear yeah ill think about it thanks dad he said quietly brandt rolled over in bed ezra usually slept beside him instinctively brandt reached out to pet him his hand landed on the cool cotton sheet i cant believe the poor guy is dead brandt thought he lay in the dark listening to the heavy silence his parents had gone to bed hours before the house lay in a deep darkness brandt couldnt see if the moon shone in the sky or if a street lamp lit up the road outside no light penetrated the thick veil of trees surrounding the house no cars passed by no wind stirred the leaves on the trees brandt listened for the sounds of night birds and insects in the yard but all was quiet then a faint scratching sound broke the silence brandt froze listening scratch scratch scratch what is that brandt wondered raising his head from the pillow to hear better scratch scratch scratch rats he decided in my room chapter brandt sat straight up in bed and pulled the covers around him for protection the scratches grew louder brandt listened hard scratch scratchscratch he stared up at the ceiling the sounds seemed to come from up there there is an attic he remembered he hadnt seen it yet but he remembered passing the narrow stairs that led up to it the sounds grew heavier footsteps brandt thought he turned and lowered his feet to the floor is someone walking around in the attic has someone broken into the house brandt stood up and tiptoed to the door he peered down the dark hallway no light came from his parents bedroom he knew they must be asleep he groped along the hall until he found the door leading to the attic steps silently be pulled it open he listened silence should he go up anyone up there he called leaning into the stairwell his voice came out a hushed whisper whos up there silence then the soft creaking of the attic floorboards footsteps who is it silence again brandt took a deep breath and started up the narrow stairs they felt warm under his bare feet he reached the top and peered into the darkness anyone up here his parents were always scolding him for taking matters into his own hands for being too impulsive reckless they called it brandt didnt care he didnt want to think of himself as a wimp if someone was in the attic he wouldnt hide in his bed hed go upstairs to check it out but the attic was too dark to see anything brandt fumbled along the wall for a light switch then he heard the floorboards creak scratch scratchscratch in the darkness something growled brandt froze he heard the click of claws on the floor its coming for me he realized too late to move out of its way with a snarl the creature sprang through the darkness its outstretched claws reaching for brandts throat chapter nooooo brandt let out a terrified wail he shielded his head with both arms the creature thudded against him then fell heavily to the floor brandt crouched and waited where was the creature preparing to attack again he couldnt see it in the heavy blackness but he heard scuttling is the far comer i need to see it brandt thought frantically i cant fight it if i cant see it he fumbled for the light switch he found it quickly a dim ceiling light clicked on brandt blinked his eyes moved warily around the room the long narrow attic had a low ceiling over plain plasterboard walls the dusty floor was littered with boxes to the right of the door under the eaves of the house brandt spotted a small window slightly open but the creature no sign of the creature scratchscratch slowly carefully brandt reached for a straw broom he spotted on top of a box the creature stepped out from behind a box brandt narrowed his eyes at it a fat raccoon he uttered a relieved sigh only a raccoon but it attacked me he realized a raccoon wouldnt do that unless something was wrong with it unless it had rabies he stared at the raccoon it was breathing hard its tail switched back and forth through the black mask on its face it stared back at brandt and snarled oh no brandt thought it is rabid the raccoon reared back on its haunches preparing to spring again brandt gripped the broom with both hands if only i had one of dads spears now he thought the raccoon sprang with a gasp brandt batted at the animal with the broom the creature let out an angry hiss as the broom knocked it back to the floor brandt swung at it again with a furious hiss the raccoon swiped at the broom with its claws brandt swung the broom and again furiously backing the creature to the wall snarling angrily the raccoon scrambled up onto the windowsill it pulled back its lips and bared its pointy teeth at brandt brandt jabbed at the creature with the broom the raccoon snatched at the broom with its teeth and caught it startled brandt let the broom slip from his hands it clattered to the floor brandt started to reach for the broom but stopped when he noticed the raccoon crouched low preparing to jump onto him if he bent to get the broom brandt realized the raccoon could leap and sink its teeth into his neck the raccoon continued to utter its shrill angry hiss spittle dripped from its mouth brandt slowly backed away his eyes locked on the animal his left leg hit something a chair with a startled cry he stumbled and fell backward the raccoon sprang again brandt jerked himself up he grabbed the chair by the legs lifted it and jabbed it at the spitting animal the raccoon retreated to the windowsill again with a loud angry shout brandt heaved the chair at it the chair slammed against the wall the creature dived out the window brandt lunged for the window grabbed it by the top of the frame slid it shut and locked it struggling to catch his breath brandt gazed blankly around the attic his entire body trembled the narrow room appeared to tilt and sway a close one he thought that creature put up a real fight had any other animals climbed in through the open attic window were there other animals hiding up here brandt wouldnt be able to sleep unless he knew the answer still breathing hard he made a careful search of the boxes no no more raccoons no more animals ill be safe now brandt thought he turned out the light and his legs weak and rubbery started downstairs his father stood in the hallway in his bathrobe brandt stepped into the pale glow from the hall light brandt whats going on his father asked brandt rubbed the little scar on his cheek his mother came running out of the bedroom her features tight with concern brandt you look terrible she cried what happened i heard noises in the attic brandt replied breathlessly i went up to investigate i i found a raccoon is it still up there his father demanded gazing past brandt to the attic door its gone brandt told them i forced it back outside thank goodness mrs mccloy cried raising both hands to her cheeks who left the attic window open i i should tell you something else brandt started hesitantly i think the raccoon might have had rabies it was acting very strangely it attacked me mr mccloy took brandt by the arm and began to check him over did it bite you or scratch you anywhere i dont think so brandt said i think im okay lets make sure mr mccloy said he led brandt into his room and made him stand under the light brandts parents carefully checked his arms his throat and face his chest i dont see any marks mr mccloy announced with a sigh of relief but youve got to be more careful brandt his mother said what did you think you were doing you shouldnt have been up there by yourself trying to fight a rabid raccoon your condition brandt his father reminded him how could i forget brandt thought bitterly but he kept the thought to himself callys ghost watched brandt make his way back to his bedroom invisible she floated in the doorway as he slid into bed pulling the covers up to his chin nice going brandt cally thought a scornful smile playing over her lips i wish i could tell you how much i enjoyed your big scene in the attic just now but im not quite ready to reveal myself to you i will though soon i will you are turning out to be very entertaining brandt i enjoyed watching you fight that raccoon i havent had so much fun in ages youre so cute looking when youre scared brandt i like the way your big brown eyes flash and the way your jaw sticks out when you clench your teeth cute real cute cally watched brandt roll onto his side cant get to sleep huh she thought still thinking about your narrow escape well you dont have to worry about getting rabies brandt that raccoon didnt have rabies theres another reason that it acted so strangely theres something else that made it act viciously the evil brandt the evil in this house but there will be time to discover that plenty of time better get your sleep brandt better rest up cally told him silently because i have lots of excitement in store for you you and i are going to be really good friends chapter brandt slept late the next morning his room was dark but glancing at his clock he saw that it was already after ten through the thick cover of trees outside the window he thought he spotted a patch of blue october sky a sunny sunday he thought with satisfaction a good day for a long drive ive got to get away from mom and dad for a couple of hours theyre working my nerves downstairs he found his parents in the driveway unloading groceries from the battered blue minivan go help your mother his father ordered theres a twelvepound turkey in the backseat and i dont want her to strain her back lifting it brandt carried the turkey into the house for his mother we practically bought out the store she told him ive got roast beef chicken vegetables cake mix what would you like for dinner tonight brandt roast beef sounds good brandt replied shoving the turkey into the refrigerator ill make a devils food cake too mrs mccloy said have you finished unpacking your room brandt his father asked i havent even started brandt admitted ill get to it but i thought id go for a drive first check out the area can i take the honda his father frowned weve got a lot of settling in to do i was hoping youd finish in your room and start unpacking the books ill get to it brandt promised picking up the car keys from the kitchen table and jiggling them in one hand i wont be gone long brandt his father protested brandt dashed out the back door before they could stop him he jumped into the dark green honda and quickly backed around the van and down the driveway his parents ran to the front yard waving their arms at him motioning for him to come back he pretended not to see them lowering his foot hard on the gas pedal he roared off down fear street he sped up even more when his house vanished from sight the old houses whirred by slender beams of morning sunshine poked through the old trees that lined the street he rolled down the window and let the cool autumn air wash over his face this is just what i needed he told himself to get out of the house to get moving to feel the air with a squeal of tires he turned off fear street and headed out of town he jammed a cassette into the tape deck and cranked up the volume he sang along with the music dont care if i live dont care if i die nothing but farm fields on both sides now a long twisting highway nearly empty okay lets see how fast i can go he thought he jammed his foot down and watched the speedometer climb seventy miles an hour eighty he flew around the tight curves spinning the wheel enjoying the excitement of not knowing what lay around the next curve the road climbed into low brown hills brandt blasted the music and kept his foot jammed down on the accelerator the road veered to the right and then sharply left he gazed out over a deep gorge that plunged straight down to his right a narrow river wound through the valley far below sparkling in the sun beautiful he thought following the course of the river with his eyes when he turned back to the road the red oil truck already filled the windshield im in the left lane brandt realized in panic he cried out and frantically cut the wheel back to the right but the car bounced out of control too far too far to the right the oil trucks airhorn rose like a siren he slammed his foot down on the brake the car skidded across the wide shoulder heading straight toward the deep gorge chapter gripping the wheel with both hands his foot all the way down on the brake brandt shut his eyes and waited for the fall waited for the long slide down when the car didnt move he opened his eyes and saw that the car wasnt moving oh man he cried jumping out of the car the right front tire hung over the edge of the gorge the other three were safely on solid ground oh man he repeated shaking his head he hurried back into the small honda brandt shifted into reverse and pressed the gas pedal the tires skidded in the dirt the car slipped but in the wrong direction farther out over the gorge come on brandt shouted to the car when he hit the gas this time the rear tires caught the road and pulled the car back the right front wheel eased up over the edge of the gorge and back onto the shoulder brandt stopped for a second and caught his breath then he made a uturn and sped back toward home at eighty miles an hour that was fun he said out loud man that was fun that night brandt lay restlessly in the darkness waiting for sleep im so tired from putting up bookshelves and unpacking boxes all afternoon he thought so why cant i get to sleep he stared at the ceiling he listened for raccoon scratches silence so why did he have this strange feeling the feeling that something was hovering nearby something dangerous it must be moving into an unfamiliar house he told himself or maybe its the thought that tomorrow is my first day in a new high school shadyside high and ill be the new kid the kid who doesnt know anyone he glanced at the clock ive got to get some sleep he thought or else tomorrow ill have dark circles around my eyes like that raccoon he felt himself drifting off he closed his eyes a soft whisper of cold air rippled across his skin he opened his eyes where did it come from another puff of cold air like an icy breath is someone here he thought his skin tingled he felt the brush of lips on the back of his neck cold cold lips and then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder and he screamed chapter the overhead light clicked on mr mccloy rushed to brandts side whats wrong what happened he grabbed brandts trembling shoulders and tried to calm him brandt swallowed hard my my neck he managed to choke out he rubbed the spot with his hand it still felt cold you hurt your neck you have a stiff neck brandts father demanded his voice clogged with sleep let me see it brandt leaned forward something bit my neck he said can you see where i dont see anything mr mccloy replied lowering his head and squinting at the back of brandts neck another rraccoon brandt stammered i hope not his father muttered he searched the room with his eyes then he bent down and checked under the bed he pulled open the closet door and riffled through brandts clothes he checked under the desk inside boxes all over the room mr mccloy let out a weary relieved sigh must have been a dream brandt a nightmare brandt rubbed the back of his neck it felt okay now his hand moved to the scar on his cheek it was so real dad i really thought youre nervous about school tomorrow thats all mr mccloy assured him try to get some sleep okay okay mr mccloy switched off the light as he left the room brandt settled down in the darkness he pulled the covers up to his chin a dream he muttered softly just a stupid dream he had almost drifted off to sleep when he felt a cold rush of air on his face again brandt heard the roar of a vacuum cleaner as he started downstairs the next morning peeking into the living room he was startled to see a short squat grayhaired woman vacuuming brandt had never seen her before hi he called but the woman didnt glance up brandt figured she couldnt hear him over the roar he went into the kitchen good morning brandt his father greeted him from the table did you manage to get some sleep last night a little brandt replied whos that woman in the living room her name is mrs nordstrom mrs mccloy told him shes going to help me unpack and get the house into shape did you meet her shes very nice i tried to say hello but she had the vacuum cleaner going brandt explained where did she come from mr hankers recommended her the other day mrs mccloy said i was going to phone her this morning to see if she wanted a job but she showed up before i even got a chance to call i guess mr hankers called her for me she used to work for the previous owners of the house mr mccloy added do you want juice this morning brandt his mother asked she opened a carton on the counter and pulled out a couple of juice glasses just a little since its your first day at your new school no thanks brandt said he never ate breakfast and his mother knew it but she couldnt stop pestering him about it anyway he sat down at the table while his father read the newspaper and drank his coffee his mother began to store the juice glasses in a cabinet i keep thinking about last night brandt said that that bite on my neck raising his head from the newspaper mr mccloy glanced across the room to his wife she turned from the cabinet and met her husbands gaze with a worried expression i dont think it was a nightmare brandt continued thoughtfully it seemed too real brandt his mother sat down at the table absentmindedly gripping two glasses in her hands do you really think there was someone in your room last night mr mccloy demanded his eyes locked on brandt i checked everywhere even under the bed no not a person brandt replied running a hand back through his dark wavy hair but something a spirit of some kind he smiled maybe the house is haunted brandts father chuckled he set down his newspaper maybe my research is rubbing off on you playing on your imagination after all youve grown up in all kinds of strange places hearing me talk about magic and spirits maybe brandt admitted but i dont think so mr mccloy rubbed his hands together and smiled hmmm its kind of tempting exciting what if there is some kind of spirit right here in our own house brandts mother flashed him a disgusted look cant we be serious there arent gbqcts and spirits floating around everywhere in the world you know im sure the house is perfectly safe she insisted maybe its haunted and maybe its not mr mccloy said firmly there could be other explanations but youll check it out brandt asked of course how could i resist thanks dad brandts mother glanced at the kitchen clock youd better get going brandt she said brandt stood up i wanted to get there a little early i was thinking i might try to meet a few kids before my first class just dont overdo it brandt his father warned remember i know i know ill be careful brandt groaned he grabbed his backpack from the hall table and started out the door the day was bright and warm for october but the mccloys front yard lay in dark shadow the trees and bushes were so thick they nearly blocked out the sunlight some of the leaves on the trees had turned yellow and red but they clung to their branches as if for dear life brandt pulled the collar of his jeans jacket close around his neck he started across the front yard through the thicket of bushes and trees this grass is so tall he thought kicking a path through the high blades mowing it is going to be a nightmare maybe that guy hankers will do it as he moved toward the sidewalk he gazed at the sunlight that fell onto the street as soon as my front yard ends the sunlight begins he thought weird he was stepping onto the sidewalk when something pushed him hard from behind an icy hand tightened itself on his shoulder chapter with a startled gasp brandt spun around and stared into the face of a girl about his age im sorry i tripped she explained blushing i didnt mean to grab you she was small and pretty blond with bright blue eyes she wore a short gray plaid wool skirt over black tights and an oversize pale blue sweater brandt relaxed you scared me he confessed do you live around here she nodded im abbie ayler she told him straightening her sweater im not usually such a total klutz hows the new house i saw you moving in the other day its okay brandt replied a little rundown though he told her his name are you heading for school yeah but im not going your way abbie replied youre going to shadyside high right brandt nodded you dont go there no darwin academy she made a face its a girls school oh brandt said too bad abbie laughed tell me about it she tossed back her blond hair so its hard to move huh makes you a little nervous or do you always jump three feet in the air when someone grabs your shoulder im a little stressed brandt admitted with a shrug its dark in your yard isnt it abbie said her blue eyes catching the sunlight all those big old trees yeah pretty dark i suppose youve heard the stories about the house she said quietly stories what kind of stories brandt demanded abbie shrugged i dont know stories about the people who used to live here i think something bad happened to them huh what happened im not really sure abbie replied staring up at the house people tell different stories you know how it is did you know the family who lived here before brandt asked switching his backpack to his other shoulder not really abbie told him i saw the two girls once i think they were twins but they didnt look exactly alike anyway they didnt stay long why not brandt asked abbie hesitated i heard one of the girls died thats awful brandt exclaimed you mean she died right in my house abbie nodded yeah i guess pretty horrible huh she didnt give him time to reply my uncle he says theres some kind of curse on the house like its evil or something evil brandt felt a cold chill he thought of the raccoon that attacked him and he thought of the cold lips on the back of his neck the teeth that dug into his skin but im sure thats just a lot of silly gossip abbie added seeing the troubled expression on brandts face i mean people tell all kinds of weird stories about fear street she let out an awkward laugh youll have to tell me some of the stories sometime brandt told her shes really great looking he thought i think im going to like having her for a neighbor but her words continued to trouble him he glanced up at the house resting in the shadows of the huge dark trees then something caught his eye something moved in an upstairs window something dark it swung heavily behind the glass brandt stared harder the dark shape swayed in the window of his parents room brandt blinked and stared again afraid to believe his own eyes it couldnt be true but it was his fathers body was hanging in the window chapter brandt heard abbie scream he turned to see her pointing up at the window she saw it too without saying a word brandt ran blindly through the tall grass up onto the porch into the house abbie followed close behind dad brandt screamed frantically as he flew up the stairs dad he stumbled and fell against the wall then burst into his parents room dad brandt what on earth is the matter mrs mccloy stood calmly by the bed plumping up a pillow whats wrong brandt huh brandt uttered a choked cry the bathroom door opened brandt gaped in shock as his father stepped out whats going on mr mccloy demanded sharply i saw you leave for school brandt turned to the window one of his fathers suits was hanging there oh wow brandt muttered he heard giggling behind him abbie stepped up beside him her eyes on the suit brandt burst out laughing too a suit he cried its only a suit brandt have you totally lost it his mother demanded his parents stared at him as if he had gone completely mad im sorry brandt said finally pulling himself together we thought you were that suit dad mr mccloy frowned and shook his head i dont get it this is abbie brandt told his parents shes a neighbor its nice to meet you abbie mrs mccloy said but brandt i wish you wouldnt bring guests into our bedroom like this i havent even made the bed yet im sorry mom brandt said it was a mistake a major mistake he and abbie exchanged amused glances wed better get going abbie said starting out of the room it was nice to meet you brandt and abbie ran downstairs and outside the house laughing all the way i really thought it was a man hanging in the window abbie exclaimed your parents must think im crazy or else very rude i couldve sworn it was my dad brandt admitted i i was so scared he smiled at her he wondered if she liked him or did she just think he was weird would you like to get together on saturday afternoon he asked her maybe we could study together or something yeah great abbie replied smiling back at him ill come over around two okay okay brandt glanced at his watch oh man im off to a great start late for my first day of school he waved to her and hurried down fear street to catch the bus to shadyside high brandt stood in line at the cafeteria tray in hand the odor of brussels sprouts floated out of the kitchen the girl ahead of him in line wrinkled her nose and said sarcastically smells great huh ill bet you never had food like this at your old school at my old school we had steak every day brandt joked we begged for salad and green beans and brussels sprouts but they gave us french fries instead the girl smiled she was tall and pretty with straight black hair to her shoulders and dramatic blue eyes under heavy black eyebrows she wore faded jeans torn at both knees and a cropped white sweater i heard there was a new kid she said examining brandt with her dramatic eyes youre him huh brandt grinned yeah im all new the new improved me i moved here on saturday he introduced himself welcome to shadyside brandt the girl said im jinny thompson the line began to move and jinny added youd better let me take you on a guided tour of the steam trays id hate for you to get sick on your first day at school brandt picked out a knife and a fork and set them on his tray a girl with short auburn hair squeezed between him and jinny let me cut in jinny she insisted the lines really long and im starving i had half a snickers bar for breakfast thats all really the redhaired girl stood a couple of inches shorter than jinny she had a bulky black sweater pulled down almost to her knees over bright green leggings shes really cute too brandt thought he reached behind him pulled a tray from the stack and handed it to jinnys friend thanks she flashed him a toothy smile you must be the new kid his name is brandt somethingorother and hes very nice jinny told her but im sure it will wear off after a while it always does she grinned at brandt to let him know she was teasing this is my friend meg meg morris whats up with the trays why are they always wet meg demanded staring in disgust at the plastic lunch tray lunch hasnt even started and the trays are all wet why is that its a special kind of plastic brandt joked it stays wet no matter what you do to it both girls laughed meg had a funny highpitched laugh that sounded more like whistling than laughing the line began to move jinny opened a refrigerator case and took out a salad wrapped in cellophane check out this lettuce she said showing the salad to brandt it must have turned brown so they bleached it white so why are you eating it he asked wait till you see what the other choices are meg said rolling her eyes jinny and meg told brandt more than he wanted to know about the food in the cafeteria he managed to get through the line with a ham and cheese sandwich and a carton of milk he followed meg and jinny to a table in the back of the room a tall blond athleticlooking boy ambled over a basketball tucked under one arm he sat next to jinny and draped his other arm casually around the shoulders of her white sweater hey jin he said hey meg he narrowed his eyes at brandt and nodded to him jon burks this is brandt mccloy jinny announced hes new be nice to him why wouldnt i be nice to him jon replied pretending to be insulted im a nice guy ask anybody he spun the basketball on his finger you play ball he asked brandt not really brandt replied you ought to try out for the team jen suggested we need tall guys mom would go totally ballistic if i told her i wanted to play basketball brandt thought shes always nagging me to be careful but he found himself thinking i wonder if i could make the team im good at sports i never played in a league or anything just fooled around on the playground with my friends it might be fun to play on a team and id get to meet a lot of guys ill go to a few practices he decided it cant hurt then maybe ill try out mom and dad never have to know hey brandt jon snapped his fingers interrupting brandts thoughts you still with us what time is practice brandt asked youre going to try out thats excellent meg exclaimed jinny rolled her eyes dont let jon push you around brandt we have practice every afternoon at threethirty jon told brandt ignoring jinny and tryouts are next week he turned to jinny and asked youre meeting me after practice right jinny shook her head no way with all that french homework and the term paper to get started youre worried about homework jon shook his head in disbelief thats a new one he glanced suspiciously at brandt then he stood up abruptly i hope you get all your homework done before friday he said dont forget were going out friday night i had to really fight to get the car i wont forget jinny promised no problem jon left without saying good bye dribbling his basketball across the cafeteria floor whats with him meg asked jinny shrugged who knows thats how jon is he gets jealous if i sit alone and read a book she flashed brandt a teasing smile and added but i never let that stop me from doing what i want hey you made it mccloy jon shoved a basketball into brandts arms as brandt entered the gym that afternoon hey guys he called to five or six other boys who were warming up across the floor this is him the new guy he says hes the next superstar he says his nickname is in your face no way no i didnt brandt cried feeling his face go red you told me you were allstate last year jon claimed loudly enough so that everyone in the gym could hear it give me a break brandt protested why was jon doing this to him was he just goofing or did he really want to embarrass brandt jon took a ball dribbled to the far end of the gym and started practicing foul shots brandt slowly and easily dribbled the ball down the court he spun around and dribbled back the other way warming up this is going to be a breeze he thought nothing to worry about a tall fortyishlooking bald man wearing gray sweats stopped brandt on the sideline im coach hurley he announced fiddling with the whistle that hung from his neck youre the new kid right what year are you eleventh grade brandt replied good did you play at your old school brandt nearly smiled at the thought of playing basketball on the island of mapolo no he replied but i think i can be good at it mr hurley checked him out well youre certainly tall enough if youre tall and youre breathing youve got a pretty good chance of making this team he said dryly well start scrimmaging in a few minutes well see what you can do later jon threw a blue jersey over his head and tossed brandt a red one they stood on opposite sides of the court on different teams coach hurley blew his whistle the centers jumped for the ball it bounced to jon jon dribbled down the court and took a shot brandt tried to block him brandt timed his jump carefully and slapped jons ball away from the basket good mccloy coach hurley shouted jon grunted brandt ran down the court with his teammates a short wiry boy with curly black hair passed the ball to him brandt took a shot missed the blue team had the ball again brandt ran back down the court guarding jon brandt panted trying to catch his breath a line of sweat trickled down his forehead he glanced at the other guys to see how much they were sweating most of them werent no problem brandt told himself im just a little out of shape thats all jon slipped past brandt and went up for a layup the ball swooshed in back down the court brandt lagged behind his teammates his arms and legs felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds breathing hard he stopped running and bent over resting his hands on his knees you cant be tired already mccloy he heard coach hurley calling make sure you do an extra five laps after practice brandt nodded breathless i can do it he told himself i can i can i will i need a good alibi an excuse brandt thought as he ambled down fear street toward home that evening mom will never get off my case if she finds out ive been playing basketball the sun had already lowered itself behind the old trees a cool gusting wind carried a hint of winter as he stared up at his new house fear street brandt suddenly remembered abbies words that morning a girl died in my house he thought shuddering the house is evil abbie had said the whole street is evil he gazed around at the neighbors houses they all seemed as old and dark as his which one does abbie live in he wondered he took a deep breath trying to think of an excuse for being late and hurried inside he found his mother talking to mr hankers i hope youre right she was saying i cant stand to think of living with rats in the basement i dont think theyll bother you anymore mr hankers replied scratching his black hair if they do just let me know he smiled at brandt on his way out where have you been brandt mrs mccloy asked its dark out already well brandt hesitated the student senate i decided to join i thought id meet some kids there his mother smiled that sounds perfect for you she said it meets every day after school brandt told her ive already got tons of homework id better go upstairs and get started she wanted to hear more about his first day but he hurried up to his room and shut the door he didnt want her to see how tired he was without bothering to turn on the light he dropped onto his bed he sniffed hey something smells weird in here he thought he sat up that smell again so sour getting stronger wow it its awful brandt thought as the stench rose around him it smells like he didnt want to think about what it smelled like but he knew it smelled like decay like rotten meat im going to be sick he thought he jumped up and started to the window to let in some fresh air but he stopped when he saw a light under his closet door there is no light in my closet brandt remembered he took a step closer his eyes on the floor the light was green a sickening green glow that seemed to grow brighter as brandt stared at it he took another step toward the closet then another what could be inside he put his hand on the doorknob and immediately jerked it back the doorknob felt wet and slimy brandt stared at his hand it was covered in a disgusting green goo he rubbed it on his jeans the slime stuck to his hand the green glow brightened casting the entire room in its sickening green the foul odor rose up around him ive got to get out of here he thought but no he had to find out what was inside the closet what was behind that door he swallowed his nausea and forced himself back to the closet door he gripped the slimy doorknob and turned it the closet door pulled open a flash of white light what was it what was in there he didnt see it until it was too late and then it sprang out at him choking off his terrified scream chapter a flash of white heavy like smoke choking and sour it burst from the closet as if shot out and covered brandts face in a white cloud it its strangling me brandt realized he tore at the cloud wildly frantically but he couldnt grab hold of it coughing sputtering and gasping for air he staggered blindly toward the door to his room and fell to his knees the door swung open the light came on mrs mccloy uttered a frightened cry brandt what are you doing down there huh he gazed up at her struggling to focus his eyes mom she dropped down beside him brandt mom i uh brandt stared at the open closet door what had happened it was all gone now no choking white cloud no green glow no putrid stench of death all vanished the instant his mother opened the door but brandt knew it would be back its after me brandt thought unable to stop the trembling that convulsed his entire body something is in this house and its after me well well youre beginning to get it now brandt callys ghost thought she laughed watching him pace nervously back and forth in his room he examined the closet for the tenth time then he sat down on the bed and stared at the ceiling thinking hard youre a smart boy brandt cally thought scornfully youre beginning to understand something is after you im after you coach hurley blew his whistle one on one he shouted line up it was the next afternoon brandt stood at halfcourt the basketball in his hand turning to one side he saw jinny and meg watching from the bleachers jinny waved to him and shouted something he couldnt hear hope i dont mess up brandt thought hed been thinking a lot about both girls he didnt want to embarrass himself in front of them burks mccloy go ahead coach hurley ordered why does the coach always pair me up with jon brandt wondered miserably he must think were friends or something come on mccloy lets go jon taunted brandt bounced the basketball he crouched low trying to dribble past jon and shoot a basket jon guarded him closely watch for fouls burks the coach yelled at jon you led the team in fouls last year im keeping my eye on you brandt charged hard trying to slip past jon finally with a loud groan of effort he dodged to the left and took his shot the ball hit the rim and dropped in scowling jon snatched the ball and ran to halfcourt brandt set his legs prepared to guard him jon dribbled toward the basket brandt backed up trying to stay with him then with a burst of speed jon charged right into him hey brandt cried out as he toppled over backward he landed hard on one elbow pain shot up his arm as the elbow scraped over the hardwood floor the coach blew his whistle jon i warned you i didnt touch him jon protested he tripped shaken brandt sat up quickly to examine his elbow he gasped as he saw the black bruise spread across his arm like a dark stain no he thought frozen in horror watching the black stain widen my condition the stain darkened and spread up his arm how can i keep everyone from seeing it brandt wondered too late he realized gazing up coach hurley and all the players were staring down at him in horror chapter brandt covered part of the blackening bruise with his other hand coach hurley leaned over him his eyes narrowed with concern you okay he demanded staring at brandts arm thats a nastylooking bruise i didnt think you fell that hard no big deal brandt replied trying to sound calm he turned moving the arm out of view it doesnt hurt sit out the rest of the practice anyway just in case coach hurley advised really im all right brandt insisted the coach shrugged whatever you say brandt trotted unsteadily back to the others he saw jon dribbling the ball casually at the foul line as brandt moved past he caught the triumphant grin on jons face brandt lay awake that night as the faces of the kids hed met floated through his mind he pictured abbie her lively blue eyes her straight blond hair her musical laugh jinny and meg entered his thoughts they both flirted with him whenever they saw him it was obvious they were competing for him even though jinny was already going with jon jon have i already made an enemy brandt wondered jon bad practice today brandt thought rubbing his elbow the bruise had already started to fade but coach hurley had stared at it stared at brandt suspiciously tomorrow will be better brandt vowed ill show hurley how tough i am creak the faces disappeared from brandts mind as he heard the sound above his head a footstep then another brandt sat up in bed listening creak creak footsteps someone was walking around in the attic dont go up there brandt told himself just stay here stay here and be safe but he knew he couldnt do that creak creak creak he climbed out of bed and tiptoed into the dark hallway his parents were asleep their door was closed the door to the attic opened with a soft squeak brandt leaned in and listened for the footsteps he heard them steady even steps as if someone were pacing over the creaking floorboards brandt silently crept up the stairs he fumbled against the wall clicked on the light the long low room was a shimmering blur he squinted hard waiting for his eyes to adjust no one there weird brandt thought i heard the footsteps just a second ago he searched the attic behind all the boxes and crates no one he spotted something in the middle of the floor a small notebook how could i have missed that he asked himself staring hard at it it was as if someone had put it there on purpose brandt sat on the floor and opened the notebook it was a diary he quickly discovered a girls diary shed written her name on the first page cally frasier brandt flipped through the pages this must be the diary of one of those twins who used to live here he thought one of the girls abbie told me about he skipped the parts in the beginning that seemed to be about some boy cally liked but then he came to a passage that interested him anthony is so cute he told us the most unbelievable story today of course kody swallowed every word of it my poor sister is so gullible i have to admit it was scary but it cant be true how could it anthony said theres a reason why our house seems so creepy he told us about a man named simon fear anthony said simon fear and his wife angelica were early settlers here they used to live in a mansion down the street our street is named after them the fears were really rich and really strange they tortured people and killed them angelica was really into weird stuff anthony said and she used real live people to try out her strange powers brandt turned the page and continued reading the fears buried their victims in a secret graveyard this all took place about a hundred years ago then about thirty years ago when workers were building this house they found the graves but they went ahead and built the house on top of the graveyard when the house was finished the family who built it came to look at it a man his wife and his two kids the man left his family in the living room for a few minutes and when he came back he found them dead anthony swears that their heads were missing something or someone had ripped their heads right off their necks its so gross brandt set the diary down to take this in something or someone had ripped their heads right off their necks a wave of nausea rose from his stomach but he picked up the diary and read on that family never moved in of course no one did until us of course dad would be the first person in thirty years to buy the place now kody is positive the house is haunted i dont believe in any of that stuff but i have to admit theres something weird about this place and anthonys story was really scary brandt shut the diary i was right he thought grimly this house was built on a cursed spot it is haunted i wonder what happened to cally frasier he thought i wonder where she lives now what shes doing i wonder why she left her diary behind an unpleasant thought gripped him abbie said that one of the sisters had died was it cally he set the diary on the floor where he found it it fell open to the last page brandt glanced at it and a chill ran through his body as his question was answered on the top of the page in blue ink cally had written i died tonight mr ross brandts chemistry teacher rapped on his desk for attention people he shouted the room grew quieter brandt sat in the back row of the classroom on his left sat meg on his right jinny then jon jinny was wearing a black miniskirt black tights and a black sweater to match her black hair she looks awesome brandt thought now that weve covered a lot of the basics of chemistry mr ross began were ready to start our lab work youll each need a partner ill give you ten minutes to sort it out the room erupted into loud discussions jon said were lab partners right jinny but jinny gave brandt a sly glance and replied well jon i dont know brandt and i already talked about being lab partners i sort of promised him didnt i brandt she turned to brandt brandt hesitated he saw jon scowling at him this was the first hed heard any talk about lab partners but it would be fun to work with jinny he thought and it would be fun to make jon even more jealous yeah right he told her a promise is a promise jinny grinned jinny youre sitting next to jon meg complained ill be brandts lab partner no way i promised brandt jinny insisted meg let out an exasperated sigh jinny whats your problem were only talking about lab partners here youll be jons partner and ill be brandts its easier that way why dont you be jons lab partner jinny suggested with a sly grin thats just as easy that settles it brandt announced meg and jon are lab partners jinnys my partner ill go tell mr ross the bell rang just as brandt stood up to go to mr rosss desk brandt could feel jons eyes burning a hole in the back of his head the teacher wrote down the partner assignments and the students filed noisily out of the classroom brandt found jinny waiting for him in the hall i hope you dont mind my little lie she said i mean what i said about promising to be your lab partner i just didnt want to work with jon hes so bad at chemistry and hed make me do all the work hey no problem brandt told her listen why dont you come over to my house this saturday we can get a head start on our project jinnys dark eyes lit up she flashed her dazzling smile at brandt that sounds great where do you live on fear street ninetynine fear street jinnys smile faded ninetynine fear street are you serious brandt nodded yeah im serious weird she murmured its just a house brandt replied with a shrug well it cant be all bad if you live there she said softly her eyes locked on his excellent brandt exclaimed come over around two he watched her as she walked down the hall to her next class yes he thought excellent now how to get mom and dad out of the house okay layups coach hurleys deep voice echoed through the gym brandt lined up with the other guys to run down the court leap into the air and shoot the ball into the basket with one hand when his turn came brandt dribbled the ball quickly and smoothly and went for a graceful layup the ball rolled inside the rim and dropped out ill make the next one he thought he knew hed looked good making the shot at least jon took his turn after brandt his layup swished perfectly through the hoop he glanced at brandt after the shot went through yeah i saw it jon brandt thought rolling his eyes great shot jon lets see you do it again brandt shouted lets see you do it once jon taunted brandts next layup was as graceful as the first his lanky arms and legs moved in perfect symmetry and this time the ball dropped through the basket with a swish he didnt glance at jon to check his reaction instead he coolly trotted back to the line as if nothing special had happened jons next shot barely missed jon stood behind brandt in line and whispered its a tie one to one best out of three brandt nodded he shook his arms and legs they began to feel heavy and tired come on he urged himself dont give out on me just one more shot the guy ahead of brandt passed him the ball brandt caught it and dribbled toward the basket he leapt for the shot the ball in his right hand he stretched his right arm high into the air owwww he cried out as he heard a loud snap chapter a sharp jolt shot through his shoulder screeching in pain brandt clutched his shoulder his arm felt dead it hung lifelessly at his side pain shooting out from the joint arching over his entire body coach hurley was at brandts side immediately i think you dislocated it he said to brandts amazement the coach firmly gripped brandts arm with both hands and shoved it back into place whoooooa brandt cried in agony but the arm instantly felt better the intense pain dulled to an ache ive never seen anybody dislocate a shoulder that easily mr hurley said scratching his bald head you ever pull the arm out before no brandt answered well youd better go to the nurses office and get a sling the coach told him youve got to get it xrayed as soon as possible i think your season may be over son out of the corner of his eye brandt saw jon smirk brandt turned away forcing down his angry feelings and trudged slowly out of the gym to find the nurse half an hour later brandt started walking home moving awkwardly with his arm in a sling how am i going to explain this to mom and dad he asked himself a fistfight in the student senate he crossed park drive and was halfway down the next block when someone stepped out of the shadows and darted toward him instinctively brandt backed away stay away he shouted hey brandt its only me a girl stepped into a pool of sunlight meg i know you didnt want to be my lab partner she joked but i didnt think you were terrified of me she laughed her highpitched whistling laugh brandt relaxed im sorry meg he said its been a long day meg studied him curiously hey what happened to your arm basketball practice brandt muttered i dislocated my shoulder meg tossed back her auburn hair jon didnt have anything to do with it did he she asked suspiciously no why i wanted to warn you about him meg said her expression solemn they started walking what do you mean brandt asked jons a really intense guy meg warned she plucked a twig from a tree as she walked youll be sorry if you get on his bad side hes got a terrible temper i can handle that brandt said quietly im serious brandt hes real jealous when it comes to jinny jinny and i are only lab partners brandt insisted i know meg said but you dont know jon i mean sometimes he goes ballistic he got suspended from school last year for beating up a kid in waynesbridge the kid spent two weeks in the hospital she stopped at the corner heres where i turn she announced a strand of auburn hair fell into her eyes she made no move to brush it away thanks for the warning brandt told her but i think i can handle jon meg didnt reply instead she completely startled brandt by rising up on her toes and kissing him quickly getting over his surprise brandt found himself kissing her back shes really awesome he told himself she stepped back and smiled at him i know youve got a study date with jinny on saturday she said but why dont you come over to my house on sunday not to study well just hang out sounds great brandt said see you then see you she flashed him another smile shifted her backpack and hurried away a few minutes later still thinking about meg brandt walked into his front yard abbie sat perched on a sagging front step waiting for him she was wearing her school uniform a gray plaid skirt white blouse and blue sweater she smiled and waved when she saw him oh wow brandt thought as soon as he saw abbie he remembered he had made a study date with her for saturday but now he had invited jinny for saturday afternoon too hows it going brandt abbie asked climbing to her feet hey what happened to your arm her blue eyes narrowed in concern just sprained it or something brandt replied thinking about saturday uh you know saturday he started would you like me to bring something some popcorn maybe abbie suggested she gave him an eager smile no its not that brandt said i uh got hung up saturday some stuff ive got to do can we make it another day abbies happy expression crumpled into disappointment but she replied brightly sure another day no problem really she stood up quickly and started across the front lawn catch you later she called behind her right brandt watched her disappear around the hedges shell get over it he told himself he had to smile girls were throwing themselves at him right and left maybe im going to like it here after all he thought he turned and made his way into the house mom guess what he called you wont believe what a klutz i am i fell down the stairs at school today the doorbell rang at exactly two oclock on saturday afternoon brandt was sitting in the den watching college football on tv he waited a minute until the first half of the game ended then he switched off the tv and went to answer the door his shoulder had nearly healed and he no longer needed the sling but the coach refused to let him play basketball anymore i can live without basketball brandt thought ive got plenty of other activities to keep me busy mainly girls the doorbell rang again brandt fixed his smile then pulled open the door jinny gazed at him fretfully chewing her bottom lip she wore a maroon and white shadyside high sweatshirt over black jeans this is your house she asked raising her eyes to the peeling paint oa the porch yeah brandt replied pretty shabby huh were fixing it up he stepped aside and let her in then he closed the door behind her let me give you the grand tour this is the dining room he showed her the dark dining room with its low stained ceiling in one corner the faded wallpaper was peeling off he pointed through a doorway and said theres the kitchen jinny peered into the kitchen which was more cheerful where are your parents she asked they went to a faculty tea in waynesbridge brandt told her my dad teaches at the community college cool jinny said he led jinny across the hall this is the living room the couch a coffee table and two chain were surrounded by several halfunpacked cartons jinny walked over to the wall with mr mccloys collection of weapons and armor what is all this stuff she asked lightly touching one of the darts my father is an expert on ancient rituals brandt explained these are all things used in tribal warfare he pointed to a spear this is a really old spear that people used on the island in the pacific where we lived he said and these darts he touched the end of a brightly painted feathered dart are really deadly they were used with a blowgun the people on the island would blow them into the necks of their enemies their aim was so good they always hit the jugular he paused then urged feel how sharp it is jinny gingerly touched the point of the dart ouch she said drawing back that suit of armor brandt continued was also worn by the island warriors probably to protect themselves from the darts jinny joked brandt watched as jinny examined the armor it was very heavy made of iron but securely fastened to the wall the craftsman who made it had painted suns moons pyramids and other symbols on the chestplate i guess wed better get started on our project jinny said still eyeing the wall of weapons lets go up to my room brandt suggested ive got all my books and things up there they climbed the stairs to brandts room jinny sat at brandts desk brandt leaned across the desk to get a notebook jinny tugged on the leather pouch he wore around his neck whats this she asked some kind of weird change purse brandt tugged the pouch from her fingers its a goodluck charm he told her it saved my life once how brandt hesitated why had he told her that he really didnt feel like explaining it to her he didnt like to talk about it never mind he said flashing her a smile youll think im superstitious if i tell you whatever jinny shrugged brandt picked up the chemistry textbook have you read through the list of experiments he asked jinny nodded which one do you want to do i havent read the list yet brandt admitted scanning the page im kind of thirsty jinny said do you mind if i go downstairs and get something to drink while you read the list no go ahead brandt replied theres coke and some other soda in the fridge do you want anything jinny asked no thanks he heard jinnys footsteps as she descended the stairs shes really awesome he thought his eyes blurring over the words in his chemistry book try to keep your mind on your book for five minutes he scolded himself shell be annoyed if she comes back and you havent even read the stupid list of experiments he was reading down the list when he heard her scream the book fell out of his hands jinny another shrill scream he raced out of the room plunged down the stairs into the kitchen so much blood so much bright red blood chapter brandts sneakers crunched over shards of broken glass as he crossed the room to jinny make it stop she shrieked her eyes wide with fear make it stop please she raised both arms her hands were drenched with blood the blood poured from her wrists over her sweatshirt and jeans brandt grabbed a dish towel off the counter and struggled to wrap it around one of jinnys wrists make it stop make it stop she cried we have to wrap both arms he said his eyes searching frantically for another towel make it stop make it stop her eyes rolled wildly in her head somehow she had smeared blood over her face shes in shock brandt realized what on earth happened he jerked some paper towels off the roll and began wrapping them around the other wrist make it stop please make it stop her cries grew even shriller more terrified as brandt wrapped the towels tightly around jinnys arms his parents burst into the kitchen through the back door with all the excitement brandt hadnt heard their car pull into the driveway oh my mrs mccloy cried in alarm raising her hands to her face what she dropped her purse on the kitchen table and hurried to help jinny brandt whats happened how did she cut herself brandts dad demanded make it stop make it stop jinny shrieked mrs mccloy grabbed more paper towels and wrapped them tightly around jinnys left arm ill get bandages mr mccloy turned to hurry to the medicine chest i i dont know how it happened brandt stammered gazing down he saw that his shirt and jeans were smeared with blood the glass it flew out of my hand jinny screamed her eyes finally starting to focus again it shattered in midair i i i mrs mccloy placed a comforting hand on jinnys shoulder i think were stopping the bleeding she pulled back the paper towel and examined the wrist the cut isnt really that deep you may not even need stitches but the glass just flew jinny cried not seeming to hear brandts mother like somebody pulled it away and then it shattered for no reason brandt gasped he suddenly remembered ezra the spear had felt as if it were being pulled from brandts hand and then it pierced the cats body and now the glass lets get you to the emergency room mrs mccloy was saying her arm still around jinnys shoulders the bleeding has almost stopped but we should have a doctor take a look at those cuts it just shattered jinny repeated still dazed it just shattered in midair the doctor at shadyside hospital bandaged jinnys wrists she didnt need stitches she was feeling a little better by the time brandt and his parents dropped her off at her house brandt walked her up to the front door great study date she muttered staring down at her bandages sorry brandt replied quietly next time well study at my house she said she hurried inside brandts parents were waiting in the car he told them he felt like walking home i really need to get some air but youre covered in blood mrs mccloy protested its a tenminute walk brandt insisted ill change as soon as i get home he watched them back down jinnys drive and pull away then shoving his hands into his jeans pockets he began walking slowly toward home the late afternoon sky was low and gray the air carried a damp chill he had turned the corner onto fear street when out of the corner of his eye he thought he saw something move along a low hedge he spun around no one there brandt picked up his pace a little the streetlights flickered on casting shadows on the road brandt suddenly felt sure that someone was following him he stopped and listened silence he turned back again a shadowy figure moved silently toward him brandt shuddered no he cried leave me alone he began to run the shadowy figure floated closer moving silently effortlessly as if pushed forward on the wind fear tightened brandts throat go away he managed to choke out but the dark figure all gray on shades of gray slipped closer closer brandt forced his legs to run faster he could see his house he felt a cold wind on his back the icy touch of the shadowy stranger no brandt screamed shrilly using all his strength he pulled away but the icy wind swept up his back his sneakers pounded on the sidewalk he turned sharply into the tall grass of his front yard ill be safe if i get to the house he thought safe from this cold shadowy stranger safe he tripped over a tree root stumbled to the ground sprawled facedown in the tall damp grass and waited in terror for the cold shadow to sweep over him chapter hey brandt brandt raised his head when he heard the voice brandt are you okay abbie he spun around his eyes searching the grass the shadow had vanished who was it what was it he didnt have time to think about it abbie was making her way toward him over the tall grass her expression showing her concern embarrassed brandt climbed to his feet and brushed the dirt from his jeans im okay he assured her i was running and his voice trailed off and you fell on your face she burst out laughing not funny he muttered she covered her mouth and forced herself to stop sorry i saw you and want to come in and talk for a while brandt suggested abbie glanced warily at the dark house to be honest your house scares me a little lets just sit on the porch he suggested she nodded and started to follow him but she suddenly stopped and her expression changed whats that she pointed to the dark bloodstains on his sweater and jeans is that mud yeah i guess brandt replied he didnt feel like telling her the truth im such a klutz today i have days like that abbie replied eyeing him intently they settled on the porch steps abbie brandt began thoughtfully what else do you know about this house i mean what else went on here before i moved in hey im not a snoopy neighbor abbie insisted i really dont know that much come on brandt coaxed you must have heard something other weird stories or maybe you saw something strange going on abbie shook her head i cant think of anything what about the girl who died do you have any idea how it happened abbie wrinkled her nose why are you asking me all these questions brandt realized that his questions were frightening abbie and that she couldnt help him he suddenly wanted to be somewhere safe and warm and he didnt want to be alone abbie he began trying to be casual about it are you busy tonight maybe we could go see a movie i wish i could abbie said but i cant go tonight what about tomorrow afternoon brandt began to say yes but he stopped himself he remembered that he made a date with meg tomorrows no good you sure you cant go out tonight he persisted we could see a comedy a nice cheerful movie where nobody dies or gets mutilated or anything abbie laughed sorry she told him another night we just cant seem to get it together can we brandt complained hey no problem abbie assured him we will after all were neighbors she stood up its getting chilly and dark id better get home see you later see you as soon as brandt opened the front door his father called from the kitchen is that you brandt yes brandt replied get in here your mother and i want to talk to you brandt ambled into the kitchen taking his time he wasnt looking forward to whatever his father had to say he could tell by the tone of his voice that his father was unhappy about something mrs mccloy stood at the stove stirring soup in a large pot mr mccloy was seated at the counter chopping carrots for a salad the blood had all been washed up brandt saw happily when brandt entered mr mccloy set down his knife and raised his eyes to him jinny seems like a nice girl he said but your mother and i were a little surprised to find her here we were working on our chemistry project were lab partners brandt answered curtly why didnt you tell us youd invited her over brandt his mother asked turning to face him did you wait till we left and then invite her over no way brandt insisted impatiently i didnt know i had to tell you every little thing brandt answered im allowed to invite friends over arent i his mother frowned hurt she turned back to the stove we never mind if you have friends over mr mccloy said he changed his tone trying to sound lighter less upset its just well we met your friend abbie the other day and then today its jinny we dont think you should overdo it thats all overdo what brandt snapped even though he knew perfectly well what they were talking about hed heard it before you know mrs mccloy said too many girls it could be too much for you look what happened today jinny could have been seriously hurt but that wasnt my fault brandt protested it was an accident we know that brandt his father agreed but what if we hadnt come home when we did it might have taken a lot out of you give me a break i cant take any more of this brandt muttered call me when dinners ready he stomped out of the kitchen creak creak creak brandt lay on his bed staring up at the dark ceiling creak creak creak the footsteps again in the attic what did it mean who was up there what was making those mysterious sounds brandt decided to ignore them this time he took a deep breath and closed his eyes creak creak creak his eyes flew open it was no use hed never be able to fall asleep it sounded as if someone were pacing back and forth up there back and forth right over his bed one more time he thought im going to sneak up to that attic as quietly as i can this time maybe ill catch whoever it is up there he slipped out of bed and crept up the attic stairs silence he switched on the light no one in view but there in the middle of the floor lay the diary it had been moved brandt stepped toward it the little book lay open puzzled brandt bent down and picked up the diary huh he uttered a low cry when he saw the fresh writing a new page someone had started a new page his hand trembled and his eyes grew wide as he read the words neatly written in blue ink i made jinny bleed abbie is next chapter brandt dropped the diary as if it were burning hot i dont believe this he thought his entire body trembled who wrote the new entry who wrote these words he grabbed the diary and shuffled through the old pages they were written in the same blue ink he saw in the same handwriting cally frasiers handwriting but how could cally frasier still be writing in the diary she was dead still trembling brandt stared at the newly written words again i made jinny bleed abbie is next such cold cruel words was it some kind of a joke brandt suddenly wondered was someone trying to scare him no no one else had been up in the attic no one so what did it mean was the house really haunted haunted by the ghost of cally frasier had a ghost written these frightening new words had a ghost killed ezra and cut jinny and was the ghost really planning to hurt abbie next brandt shut the diary and tossed it against the wall he suddenly remembered the shadowlike figure that had chased him onto the front yard that was the ghost he decided the ghost was outside it chased me home the ghost is outside and inside the house this is crazy he thought totally crazy he climbed to his feet but if it is for real i can stop it he told himself whatever it is whoever it is i wont let abbie get hurt i know theres evil in this house he whispered wondering if the ghost could hear him but if anyone can beat it i can brandt woke up early and hurried to the phone to warn abbie he held the receiver in his hand and realized he didnt know her number or her last name didnt she tell me her last name he struggled to remember he put down the phone and hurried to the front door stepping out into a blustery gray morning that threatened rain he made his way down the driveway which house is hers he wondered turning first to the left then to the right or did abbie say she lived across the street the houses all looked dark it was a little after eight oclock but no lights were on in any of them i have to warn abbie brandt told himself shell probably think im crazy but i have to warn her as he turned and trudged back into the house he vowed to tell her the next time he saw her if i have to ill search door to door he decided i wont let abbie get hurt i wont thats the weirdest thing i ever heard meg said brandt had just told her about the diary he had to tell someone and meg had proven to be a good listener she was sitting with her legs tucked under her on a low chair in her den brandt sat crosslegged on the floor leaning back against the couch brandt yawned for the hundredth time he was exhausted from being awake the entire night but he hadnt wanted to cancel his date with meg meg had rented a movie shed pressed the pause button and stood up to get more popcorn when she noticed how tired brandt looked are you okay she had asked him thats when he had told her about the footsteps in the attic and about cally frasiers diary someone is playing a really mean joke on you meg said what else could it be but who would do it and how are they doing it brandt wondered aloud and why it doesnt make sense meg stared at him thinking hard ill bet its jon she said finally brandt laughed you always want to blame jon for everything meg looked hurt im being serious she shoved a strand of auburn hair off her forehead you dont know jon hes jealous of you brandt he jon may be very slick on the basketball court but he isnt slick enough to sneak up into my attic and write in cally frasiers handwriting brandt told her firmly meg settled back on the chair frowning the closet door suddenly moved with a squeak brandt gasped staring at the door in terror its only lulu meg told him a fluffy white cat slinked out of the closet and settled onto megs lap whoa youre awfully jumpy today brandt let out a long slow breath i keep expecting shadowy ghosts to jump out at me wherever i go he thought i cant ever let my guard down for a second he decided not to tell meg about the choking cloud of white smoke that burst from his closet or the shadowy ghost that chased him home shell think im a total psycho he told himself and then a troubling thought maybe i am meg set the cat down crossed the room and sat down on the floor next to brandt relax she said softly lets think about something else for a while she leaned forward and kissed him brandt wrapped his arms around her and kissed her too her lips were soft and warm he wanted to be kissed he needed to be kissed he pressed his mouth against hers hungrily hey something jabbed his leg something sharp brandt cried out and pulled away from meg what was that meg reached behind him and pulled lulu into her arms the stupid cat she told him did she claw you sorry brandt smiled tensely oh he started to pull her close to kiss her again but the front doorbell rang meg sighed ill be right back she climbed to her feet and made her way across the living room to the front door brandt could see the door from where he sat on the den floor hey megster brandt recognized jinnys voice uhoh brandt thought straightening his hair with his fingers he moved from the floor to the couch hoping that position would seem more innocent jinny in dark green jeans and a pale yellow sweater strode into the house meg at her heels i just stopped by for a second to when she spotted brandt on the couch her mouth dropped open in surprise her face turned red but she recovered quickly oh hi brandt what are you doing here were just studying meg replied for him with no books jinnys voice grew shrill her eyes fell on the tv and she added while watching a movie want to join us brandt asked lightly he patted the couch cushion next to him uh meg could i see you for a minute in the next room jinny demanded it wasnt really a question meg followed jinny into the living room brandt could hear them whispering sharply angrily to each other hey dont fight over me girls he called trying to keep it light theres plenty of me to go around they ignored him and kept whispering a few seconds later brandt heard the front door slam meg returned to the den her cheeks bright pink whats jinnys problem anyway she demanded she already has a boyfriend brandt left megs house a short while later jinnys appearance had spoiled the afternoon brandt liked the idea of having two girls fight over him but he was too exhausted and stressed out to be able to deal with it then his parents were out when he got home the house sat quiet and dark mysterious and full of secrets brandt hesitated for a second feeling weary worn out and frightened taking a deep breath he walked up the stairs and straight to the attic he had to see the diary would it be where he left it would there be any new entries he stepped onto the attic floor a dim shaft of light filtered through the attic window casting a halo of dust around the diary brandt knelt beside the book with trembling fingers he opened the cover then he turned to the last page was there a new entry he raised the open diary read the last page and gasped in horror chapter i made jinny bleed abbie is next brandt you cannot save abbie no brandt cried out loud he slammed the diary shut and squeezed the book in his hand squeezed it until his hand ached cally frasier can you hear me he called silence are you writing these threats in your diary cally brandt demanded in a quivering voice silence im taking your diary away he shouted im taking it and hiding it cally so you cant make any more threats he moved quickly to the stairs the diary still clasped tightly in his hand have i gone totally crazy he asked himself am i really up here shouting at a ghost he clamored heavily down the stairs into his room if there is no diary will the evil still happen he wondered can i save abbie by hiding the diary he glanced around the room desperately searching for a hiding place the closet no he remembered that green glow the flash of white that had sprung out at him from the closet the diary wouldnt be safe there he pulled open his bottom dresser drawer and tossed the diary under a stack of tshirts it would have to do as he pushed the drawer closed brandt heard a voice mom dad he called are you home no answer he hurried to the window and checked the driveway no no sign of his parents he heard the voice again tiny far away cally is that you did you come to find your diary he demanded his eyes searching the room a muffled voice out in the hall he stepped out into the hallway and listened crying was someone crying hello he called is someone here the muffled cry grew louder a whimpering dog a child but where where was it coming from gripped with fear brandt forced his legs to carry him down the dimly lit hall the tiny cries seemed to come from an empty bedroom he stopped outside the door to the room and listened is anybody in there can you hear me as he stepped into the empty room he heard the little boys frightened voice mommy its me are you there mommy whwho is it brandt stammered where are you help me mommy help me come get me mommy its so dark here come get me its me james chapter the little boys tiny terrified voice sent a cold shudder down brandts spine mommy mommy where are you the voice cried come get me mommy please brandt switched on the light a single bare bulb shone in a ceiling fixture his eyes darted frantically around the room no one there mommy the voice pleaded help me come get me its so dark here no brandt thought its impossible the voice seemed to be coming from inside the wall brandt froze unable to decide what to do taking a deep breath he forced himself to the wall and pressed his hands against it was there some kind of trapdoor in the wall some kind of secret compartment he ran his hands all along the wall pressing hard but it was solid plaster take me home mommy its james mommy where are you james james why does that name sound familiar brandt asked himself the diary he remembered cally wrote about her brother a little boy named james she told a horrifying story about how james and his dog disappeared and were never found but callys family heard james calling to them calling from inside the walls could that little boy still be alive brandt wondered staring at the white plaster wall no it was impossible the house had been empty for more than a year mommy im scared its so dark in here im so lonely get me out mommy ill help you james brandt shouted dont be afraid ill help you but how somehow he had to open up the wall please dont leave me mommy dont leave me behind dont worry james brandt called ill be right back he hurried downstairs and frantically rummaged through the cartons stacked in the dining room he knew his father had packed his tools somewhere a few minutes later he returned to the room carrying a large wooden mallet james brandt called are you still here mommy get me out the boy screeched all right brandt called in a soothing voice wherever you are james step away from this side of the wall brandt waited a few seconds then he heaved the mallet and swung it at the wall it cracked a hole in the plaster brandt peered inside the hole nothing but darkness no sign of the boy james brandt called silence then mommy i want to come back please mommy hold on james brandt called breathlessly he raised the heavy mallet and swung again again again the plaster crumbled the hole widened brandt struggled to catch his breath a sour odor invaded his nostrils he recognized it at once the same stench hed smelled in his room a few days before the stench of decay of rotting flesh one more swing of the mallet and the wall fell away ohhhhh brandt uttered a sickened cry the mallet dropped from his hands and landed at his feet with a thud he was staring at the most gruesome sight he had ever seen in his life chapter as brandt gaped in horror the skeleton of a child toppled out of the wall the childs bony hands clutched a dogs skeleton in its arms holding his breath against the foul odor brandt forced himself to look the small body was decomposed a ragged little pair of jeans and a shirt clung to the boys bones the bones tumbled in a heap to the floor brandt turned away fighting down his nausea the room lay in silence now the pitiful cries had stopped brandt stared at the hideous little skull with its patch of red hair this boy was calling to me brandt knew that was the tiny voice that i heard but how abbies words echoed in his mind the house is evil the house is evil maybe brandt thought or maybe the house was haunted by the ghost of james brandts parents returned home about an hour after brandt discovered the skeleton mrs mccloy gasped in horror at the sight but brandts father stared at the two skeletons fascinated this could explain a lot of strange things about the house he told brandt the noises youve been hearing your sense that someones in the room with you he paused its not a classic case he mused but i think weve had a poltergeist what are we going to do with these bones mrs mccloy moaned how can you be talking about poltergeists when we have the skeleton of a child on our floor poltergeists are often the ghosts of children mr mccloy continued staring at the pile of bones theyre mischievous but they rarely hurt anyone no one has been hurt in this house have they what about jinny brandt demanded and what about poor ezra hmmmm mr mccloy rubbed his chin thoughtfully mischievous doesnt describe what ive felt in this house brandt said heatedly its more like evil thats just because it scares you mr mccloy insisted because you dont know what causes it it seems mysterious a heavy silence fell over the room as the three of them stared at the skeleton of james and the dog poor kid brandt thought he sounded so frightened so alone how did he get trapped in the wall and how could he be calling out to us more than a year after he died brandts head spun with questions so many questions mr mccloy broke the silence wed better call the police they will deal with the remains and get in touch with the family as they made their way downstairs mr mccloy put an arm around brandts shoulder maybe the house will settle down now he said once this poor boy is buried and can rest in peace brandt sighed i hope so dad i really do poor james the ghost of cally thought as she watched the grimfaced police officers carry away her brothers bones my poor brother james you were such a cute little guy so sweet so beautiful and look at you now oh an officer uttered a cry as his hand slipped and the dogs skull clattered to the floor it rolled to a stop at callys feet she floated back goodbye james she thought goodbye i hope you rest better than me she realized she felt no sadness her anger was much too strong to allow any soft feelings in too late james she thought feeling her bitterness surge too late for you too late for me she floated close to brandt who stood watching the police officers go about their unpleasant job dont get too cozy brandt cally told him silently because your problems arent over yet its too late for james too late for me and its too late for you chapter on saturday morning brandt stepped outside to get the newspaper he opened the front door to find abbie standing on the porch ready to ring the bell hi she said brightly hey abbie brandt cried in surprise youre looking good she was cute in a pair of faded jeans a white shirt and a pale blue vest abbie smiled whats up brandt leaned down and picked up the folded newspaper not much why dont you come in he suddenly pictured the warning in the diary abbie is next should he warn her about it no he decided the threat is all gone the little boys bones had been removed nearly a week before and nothing strange or frightening had happened in the house since then no need to scare abbie brandt decided no need to make her think im some kind of paranoid nutcase she followed him inside brandt stepped into the kitchen to give the newspaper to his mother she was washing the breakfast dishes he found abbie in the living room staring at his fathers wall of old weapons whats all this stuff she asked its so strange and primitive looking this is my dads collection of arms and armor brandt explained hes really into old tribal weapons and stuff how did he get it all abbie asked she stared at the thin feathered darts in fascination did he buy them no we lived on a remote island in the pacific for a couple of years brandt told her the people there were into weird stuff they had all kinds of bizarre customs and ceremonies like what abbie asked brandt paused remembering well they used a lot of weird herbs to mix love potions and things like that they believed in spirits and ghosts wow abbie said it must have been cool to live there it was interesting brandt admitted but it was difficult too they thought differently from us like they believed every animal and person has two spirits not just one you mean like split personalities no brandt explained one spirit is your personality its what makes you different from other people and the other spirit is a sort of life force that keeps you alive thats why they sacrifice animals and drink the blood i dont get it abbie said they think the blood contains the animals life force and if they drink it their own life force will get stronger and what happens to the other spirit the personality spirit abbie asked that becomes your ghost your personality spirit can haunt people if it wants to abbie stared at the wall thoughtfully did you ever see a ghost while you were there she asked no brandt replied no i never did abbie stepped closer to the wall examining a spear brandt heard the telephone ring in the kitchen a moment later his mother called brandt phone ill be right back he told abbie he hurried into the kitchen his mother handed him the phone and stepped away wiping down a counter hello hi brandt its jinny brandt couldnt hide his surprise jinny hi he exclaimed i havent talked to you all week i thought maybe brandt didnt get to finish his sentence a loud clattering crash from the living room interrupted him he dropped the phone receiver when he heard the chilling scream abbies scream chapter abbies screams rose shrilly brandt cried out in surprise and raced out of the kitchen abbie he found her on the floor pinned under the heavy suit of armor help me abbie cried i cant move oh my goodness mrs mccloy cried right behind brandt how did this happen brandt struggled to lift the metal suit off abbie it it wont budge he stammered abbie moaned and tried to move one of her arms hurry she pleaded i cant breathe its so heavy brandt struggled to lift the armor his mother stepped to the other side and bent to help they managed to move it just enough for abbie to wriggle out from under it are you all right brandt asked does anything feel broken abbie remained seated on the floor her expression dazed she rubbed her arm it it just flew off the wall she murmured i was looking at it and it flew off the wall it didnt just fall brandt it flew it was hanging very securely mrs mccloy said puzzled i know we checked the hooks three times nothing like this has happened before brandt helped abbie to her feet he led her to the couch mrs mccloy hurried to the kitchen to get her a glass of water brandt sat down beside abbie i dont know how to tell you this he began but someone knew that you would have an accident someone predicted it huh abbie sat up straight who who predicted it i dont know brandt replied uneasily one of the twins who used to live here her name was cally kept a diary i found it in the attic but sometimes when i look at it he hesitated what abbie asked go on brandt there are new entries brandt told her i know it sounds crazy but someone is still writing in it and the last entry predicted that you would get hurt i told you this house was evil abbie exclaimed close to tears brandt put his arms around her trying to calm her it could have been an accident he said in a soothing voice though he didnt believe it himself or just a coincidence it wasnt abbie declared i know it wasnt anyway youre okay brandt said you werent really hurt right abbie sniffed i guess not but someone will get hurt here brandt the stories about this house must be true brandt held his arms around her but said nothing it could have been an accident he told himself again james is buried the ghost is gone the house is no longer haunted right brandt sat up as the bell rang ending school he rubbed his eyes then slowly followed the other kids out of the classroom well i made it through another day he thought but if i dont get some sleep soon ill start dozing off in class he had spent another sleepless night the footsteps in the attic had returned he lay staring up at the ceiling gripping the blankets tightly listening listening all night with a weary sigh he stood at his locker daydreaming he heard a basketball being bounced on the hard floor mccloy i want to talk to you brandt raised his eyes to discover jon burks beside him listen jon brandt said i dont have much time jon tucked the basketball under one arm and placed his other hand on brandts shoulder whats up man he asked grinning at brandt not much brandt replied edging away ive got to get going jon glancing down the hall brandt noticed that all the other kids had left hows the bad shoulder jon asked ignoring brandts impatience he slapped the shoulder hows that feel not too bad his grin remained frozen on his face see you later brandt uttered he turned and headed away but jon kept up with him hey whats up with you and jinny brandt stopped short why dont you ask her he snapped jons face turned bright red he leaned menacingly toward brandt dont mess with me he muttered he bumped brandts shoulder hard brandt knew he should back away but he never could take the easy way out watch out for those fouls jon he said sharply jons face turned even redder jinny and you it isnt going to happen he said softly he bounced the ball against the wall just missing brandts head then he bounced it again youve got to remember one thing he told brandt his grin returning you bruise real easily brandt didnt reply his eyes were staring over jons shoulder he saw something in the empty hall a dark shape a shadow it hovered behind jon jon seemed unaware of the presence behind him but brandt saw it he gaped at it in terror its back brandt realized whoever it is whatever it is its following me jons threats meant nothing to brandt now he sensed that the shadow figure was far more dangerous than jon could ever be i cant let jon leave me brandt thought ive got to stick with him until this thing goes away maybe you bruise easily too he told jon want to find out want to see who bruises the most easily jons eyes widened in surprise huh no way man i mean no way im not fighting you i dont want a slaughter on my hands hey dont wimp out brandt challenged come on jon lets go right here brandt shoved jons shoulder jon barely moved he just stared back at brandt amazed get serious jon muttered brandt shoved him again you dont know what youre doing jon warned you cant fight me you scared brandt demanded you chicken jon jon brushed brandts arm away he shook his head youre the weirdest guy i ever met he said he turned and started down the hall brandt panicked the shadowy figure loomed up behind jon jon wait brandt called desperately you going to basketball practice jon kept walking he didnt reply brandt glanced at the dark shadow moving closer and hurried to catch up to jon i think ill come along and watch he said hows the team surviving without me jon stared at him as if he were insane youve got problems mccloy he said rolling his eyes major problems i know brandt thought glancing back the shadowy figure gave up then retreating around the corner what is it brandt wondered breathing a sigh of relief why is it following me how long will i be able to avoid it chapter the diary the diary has the answers brandt thought he had stuck close to jon all the way to the gym afraid the shadowy figure would be waiting outside the school but it wasnt it had vanished brandt had run all the way home ive got to do something brandt told himself slamming the door behind him and locking it ive got to do something before it gets me before it tries to hurt abbie again he shut himself up in his room he furiously read through callys diary searching for clues for hints for anything that could help explain the dark ghost to him cally seemed so nice in the beginning he thought sadly as he paged through the diary funny fun to be with i would have liked her i know i would have but what happened to her is she really dead is she the ghost haunting this house is she the one writing the new entries and hurting my friends is cally the dark shadow that has been following me questions nothing but questions no answers brandt shut the diary and carried it across the hall to his fathers study bookshelves lined the study walls but half of them stood empty unopened cartons were piled on the floor brandt scanned the bookshelves looking for a title that might help him he saw dusty ancient volumes written in languages he didnt recognize mr mccloy collected antique books on spells and strange rites no good no good no good brandt murmured reading the spines of the books if only i could read latin he gave up on the books on the shelves and ripped open a carton he pulled out books called reincarnation in ancient egypt the occult in san francisco and poisons potions and the sumerian gods shaking his head he stacked them on the floor at last he found a book that interested him the nature of evil he scanned its pages searching for anything that might answer his questions evil never dies the author wrote those who do its work can be conquered but evil itself never goes away it only seeks a new vessel anyone can become a victim of evil even the kindest heart the gentlest soul is at its mercy thats what happened to cally frasier brandt thought something evil got her and changed her something in this house he thought of the attic the creaking the footsteps the attic had things the frasiers had left behind in their hurry to leave maybe they left behind a clue he thought a clue about what happened to cally about how i can keep the same thing from happening to me clutching the diary he hurried to the attic he switched on the light the bare bulb cast harsh shadows around the room brandt frantically began digging through the frasiers dusty boxes he found childrens books a teddy bear with one eye missing old clothes then he came across a photograph in a wooden frame he picked it up in a trembling hand the glass was cracked the picture slightly faded it showed two blond girls about twelve or thirteen standing together in front of an apartment building the girls were smiling and had their arms wrapped around each other a little redhaired boy stood in front of them grinning one of his front teeth was missing sisters twin sisters and their younger brother a picture of cally kody and james it was taken before they moved here brandt figured they seemed so happy before all the trouble before their family was ripped apart before james and cally died he dropped the photo back into the box it wont happen to me he vowed silently it wont happen to abbie or jinny or meg i wont let it a noise cut through the silence brandt tensed what was that it sounded like a giggle brandt strained to hear laughter soft laughter a girls laughter where was it coming from downstairs he hurried down the attic stairs and stood in the second floor hallway the laughter grew louder he spun around it seemed to surround him hey he cried whos there where are you such cold laughter so joyless scornful laughter louder and shrill screeching harsh and unpleasant laughter evil laughter where are you who is here he cried covering his ears with his hands he ran from room to room frantically searching for the laughing girl stop it stop he shouted covering his ears didnt help the cruel laughter rang out as if inside his head louder louder the laughter of a girl gone mad trying to escape the frightening sound brandt lunged into his room and slammed the door the harsh grating laughter followed him swirled around him louder louder stop it please i cant stand it he couldnt hear his own cries over the roar of laughter he turned on the radio the sound of a heavy metal group blared out he cranked the volume up all the way but the laughter pounded in his ears louder than the loudest music stop stop louder and louder it echoed and rang until brandts entire body throbbed with pain my head is going to split open brandt realized the laughter its going to kill me chapter brandt threw open his bedroom door and ran out into the hall the laughter and thudding music followed him as he scrambled down the stairs got to get away got to get out he pulled open the front door and raced out of the house he didnt stop running until he reached the street his ears rang his body throbbed and vibrated as if he had received a powerful electrical shock but the laughter had stopped he had escaped struggling to catch his breath waiting for the ringing in his ears to fade he stared across the dark yard at the house can i go back inside he wondered what is waiting in there for me next the ghost of cally frasier watched brandt from the upstairs window a cruel smile played over her pale face as she watched him stagger into the street holding his ears whats wrong brandt she asked silently dont you like to hear a girl having fun ill bet you like it when jinny laughs and meg and abbie why not me cally sighed these silly pranks were losing their excitement she decided it was too easy to frighten brandt too boring brandt and i are going to spend a long long time together she knew it will be much more fun when brandt is dead too she watched him staring up at the house it will be better when we can laugh together brandt she told him silently im getting so impatient first ill take care of your friends and then ill take care of you chapter brandt jumped when the doorbell rang on wednesday afternoon after school he wasnt expecting anyone his mother had gone shopping and his father was sawing some branches off a tree in the side yard mr mccloy didnt teach on wednesdays the doorbell rang again brandt stepped quietly to the front window and peered out jinny and meg brandt opened the door the two girls smiled at him meg held a plate covered with aluminum foil in her hands happy birthday jinny cried laughing its not my birthday brandt told them of course it is jinny insisted she handed him the plate its brownies meg explained we had some left over from the bake sale last week we thought youd like them theyre not too stale jinny added only a little but its not my birthday brandt insisted thats why we didnt bring a cake meg exclaimed both girls burst out laughing jinnys expression turned serious we heard about jon getting on your case the other day she said im sorry about that no problem brandt replied actually i got on his case we know jinny said he told us he didnt want to hurt you hes not such a jerk after all i guess jinny likes him again meg explained shut up jinny shot back shoving meg off the porch come on in brandt urged you can have a stale brownie the girls exchanged glances brandt caught the fear in their eyes hey youre not scared are you brandt teased jinny held up her hands the wrists had tiny scars i havent recovered from the last time i was here she exclaimed come on jinny meg prompted just for a couple of minutes really what could happen okay jinny replied tensely i i kind of decided that is my mother convinced me you know that thing with the glass it must have been an accident right i mean what else could have happened brandt stepped aside to let the girls in well all be real careful this time he said he nearly dropped the plate of brownies and they all laughed he led them into the living room the mccloys had unpacked more of the cartons and the room looked a little more livedin brandt set the plate on the coffee table and pulled off the tinfoil outside the window he could hear his father sawing at a branch help yourselves to the brownies he offered we dont want them meg said thats why we brought them over in the first place so we wouldnt eat them all i sort of want one jinny admitted she took a brownie and nibbled on it then she wandered over to the wall and fingered one of the brightly colored darts did you ever see these meg jinny asked no meg replied what are they theyre deadly darts jinny told her right brandt right brandt replied you shoot them with a blowgun brandt scanned the wall for a blowgun to show them then he went to a table in a corner of the room and pulled open a drawer heres a blowgun brandt pulled a short wooden tube from the drawer i guess its okay if i show it to you he glanced out the window at his father mr mccloy was still working away he didnt seem to be making much progress jinny took the tube and examined it it was hollow made of dark brown wood and painted with interesting red and yellow symbols these red marks stand for death brandt explained i think the yellow symbols have something to do with reincarnation and they kill people with this jinny asked amazing its so small want me to show you how it works brandt asked the girls nodded brandt carefully picked a dart from the wall you place the dart in this slot he said sliding the dart into a niche at one end of the tube make sure the point is going in the right direction and make sure you dont inhale the girls laughed you put your lips at this end and blow brandt puffed a small amount of air pretending to blow through the gun you must have to blow hard to get the dart to go far enough meg said the island people know some kind of trick for that brandt explained they can give just a little puff and the dart flies out hundreds of feet its amazing brandt mr mccloy called from outside brandt hurried to the window his father was sweating from his effort but the branch he was working on still clung to the dead tree can you come out and help me a minute he shouted brandt nodded at him and turned back to the girls ill be right back he said i hope we dont eat all the brownies while youre gone jinny said picking up a second one brandt pulled on a sweater and hurried out the door to help his father check this out brandt mr mccloy said fretfully did you ever see wood like this before brandt examined the cut his father had made in the branch the wood wasnt graybrown as dead wood should be but dark red like blood what kind of tree is this brandt asked i have no idea his father admitted if i had to make up a name for it id call it a bloodwood tree its the toughest wood ive ever tried to cut i wonder how it will burn brandt took the saw from his father and pulled it across the branch a few times he managed to cut the branch halfway through were getting there his father said he took back the saw and worked some more groaning with every movement finally the branch cracked and fell to the ground bright red sap oozed from the branchs cut surface weird brandt exclaimed the sap really does look like blood it does doesnt it mr mccloy agreed you know ive had enough of this im going to call mr hankers and see if he can do anything with these trees im getting too old for this and you his father stopped but brandt knew what he was thinking my condition he thought with irritation i shouldnt be chopping trees with my condition you can go back inside now if you want mr mccloy said im going to clean up the mess ive made all right brandt walked around to the kitchen door hey jinny meg brandt called from the hall i hope you saved a brownie for me no reply thats strange he thought those two never shut up when theyre together maybe they got bored waiting for me and left brandt thought a little disappointed meg jinny he called as he walked toward the living room still no reply brandt stepped into the living room hey he saw the blowgun on the floor and lying a few feet away were meg and jinny their eyes were open staring blank their mouths hung open in frozen horror each girl had a dart stuck in her throat chapter theyre lucky to be alive dr morgan said brandt and his father stood listening in the emergency waiting room at the hospital the doctor a tall middleaged woman with short brown hair had removed the darts from megs and jinnys throats she tucked her hands into the pockets of her white lab coat as she spoke to the girls parents theyll both have to stay here at least several days dr morgan went on they seem to have some minor nerve damage and they are in shock neither girl has regained consciousness yet but will they be okay jinnys mother asked i mean when they wake up the doctor sighed we have no way of knowing she replied softly but they should make a full recovery they should be fine a short while later mr mccloy led brandt away from the emergency room and drove home you didnt see anybody leave the house he asked brandt for the twentieth time no dad i swear brandt replied the front door was locked and we would have seen somebody going through the back door brandts father drove on silently his eyes narrowed on the road perhaps i shouldnt keep such dangerous objects in the house he murmured to himself but it never occurred to me that someone would actually use them dad the ghost in the house brandt started his father raised a hand from the wheel a signal to stop not now brandt no ghost talk now but dad i really think not now brandt lets talk about the ghost later after weve both had a chance to calm down brandt leaned back in his seat and shut his eyes he kept picturing the girls sprawled on the floor with the darts in their throats and he kept thinking about the ghost the diary he thought will there be a new entry in the diary has the ghost left another message for me as soon as mr mccloy pulled into the driveway brandt jumped out of the car and ran inside he climbed straight to his room after making his way to the dresser he bent to pull open the bottom drawer then he fumbled around in search of the diary clean tshirts a few misplaced pairs of socks an old letter hey whered it go he asked himself out loud the diary was gone he searched again then got to his feet there it was on the floor by the closet lying open brandt approached it carefully he stood above the notebook gazing down at it the diary had been opened to the last page he could read the bold blue writing from there no more jinny or meg abbie dies next chapter abbie ive got to warn abbie brandt told himself ive got to find her ive got to tell her shes in real danger somehow i have to make her believe me he started out of his room but stopped when he reached the doorway there stood abbie huh he cried out in shock youre here it was as if hed conjured her up himself he stepped forward and grabbed her by the shoulders abbie im so glad youre here did my parents let you in abbie nodded yes whats wrong brandt abbie i i was going to look for you youre in terrible danger he blurted out her features twisted in confusion danger she repeated yes brandt replied breathlessly abbie you were right this house is evil youve got to get out of here and never come back he locked his eyes on hers studying her face waiting for her reaction would she believe him she had to abbie stood perfectly still for a moment then she tossed back her blond hair and laughed abbie brandt cried desperately its not a joke im serious youve got to listen to me jinny and meg two girls from school they were nearly killed here this afternoon and you you could be next abbies smile faded her blue eyes lit up excitedly why brandt she said youve been reading my diary havent you chapter brandt stared at her he opened his mouth to speak but no sound came out yyour diary he finally stammered abbies smile returned yes my diary she replied i hope you found it interesting brandt before he could reply she began to change brandt stared in shock as abbies small body stretched her blond hair lengthened and her sweet face twisted with rage and hatred until it became a hideous mask of evil he froze in terror as a completely different person stood in front of him abbie was gone what i wrote in my diary has come true the girl told him abbie is dead she was only a disguise that i wore brandt still struggled to speak but he could utter only a horrified cry i am cally the girl announced her cold blue eyes freezing him as she glared at him the ghost of cally frasier brandt turned his eyes away he backed against the wall trying to steady his trembling body she had once been pretty that was clear but now her face was monstrous her eyes burned with cruelty her mouth a red sneer he turned back in time to see her float toward him brandt pressed his back against the wall what are you going to do to me he cried she loomed closer her hands clasped behind her back dont worry brandt i wont hurt you i care about you dont you know that her breath blew cold on his face as she spoke cold as death brandt shivered im not going to hurt you brandt not really im going to protect you cally assured him with an icy smile i was so lonely brandt my family left me here but then you came and i wasnt alone anymore cally please he begged she hovered closer ignoring his plea so im going to keep you here with me brandt forever keep you here and never be lonely again no please brandt pleaded well move away from here i promise well all leave tonight he cried desperately no brandt i dont think so cally whispered her cold breath chilling his skin your parents can leave if they want to i dont care but youre not going anywhere you will be mine forever she brought her right hand forward it held a small decorated hatchet brandt recognized it it belonged to his fathers collection cally raised the hatchet over her head no brandt begged raising his hands to shield himself cally please it will hurt for only a second she murmured then well be together she raised the hatchet as high as she could and brought it down hard it sank with a sickening crack into brandts skull chapter brandt leaned back against the wall the hatchet remained buried in his head he stared back at cally watching her surprise he didnt move he didnt fall he didnt bleed cally floated back her cold blue eyes wide with confusion her mouth twisted in shock she raised both hands to her pale face brandt she cried he didnt move brandt whats happening she demanded in a trembling whisper she circled him warily her hands still pressed to her cheeks her expression changed from confusion to anger die she cried i killed you brandt i killed you neither of them moved or spoke then brandt slowly moved his right arm callys eyes widened brandts arm reached up he yanked the hatchet from his skull and tossed it to the floor it was his turn to smile as his smile widened callys face clouded in anger whats going on here she demanded why dont you bleed why arent you dead my condition brandt began condition what condition she demanded impatiently you cant kill me brandt told her im already dead chapter callys mouth opened in an o of surprise she shook her head as if trying to shake away brandts words youre lying catty accused him she reached out and squeezed his arm pinching it tightly between her icy fingers you cant be dead she insisted youre solid youre not a ghost no im not a ghost but i am dead brandt replied how how did you die cally demanded angrily challenging him brandt bent down to pick up the hatchet he hefted it in his hands as he spoke i died two years ago he revealed how she repeated her eyes locked skeptically on his i was poisoned brandt explained on the island of mapolo with my parents my father was working there searching for rare tribal weapons he began to tell cally the story as he knew it and as his parents had told it to him brandt had been over and over this story in his mind during all the nights he lay awake in bed he kept trying to find some clue in it or some meaning to everything that was happening to him at fear street he let the hatchet fall as he began his story we were staying on a tiny island called mapolo he said thats where my father got those darts is that what killed you cally asked suspiciously you were shot with a dart no brandt replied i died by mistake let me tell the story dont interrupt she flashed him an angry scowl but remained silent the people who live on mapolo followed a strange religion brandt continued it involves herbs and potions spells and rituals they use all these things in their daily life my father bought the darts from a young warrior who later thought dad had cheated him the warrior came to our hut one night and spread poison powder on our doorstep then he growled like a panther and waited for dad to come out and see what the noise was he assumed that my father would be the one who came out first the one who would step into the poison powder but the growling woke me up first i went to the door and stepped outside when my feet touched the powder at first i thought it was only sand but then the soles of my feet began to burn the pain was unbearable i started screaming my feet were on fire the fire spread up my leg all the way up through my body until it reached my heart when the poison hit my heart i fell to the ground i was dead after that all i know is what my parents told me brandt said the people in mapolo were sorry for my parents they put me in a coffin and they buried me brandt touched the small scar on his cheek and added this scar was caused by one of the nails they hammered into my coffin cally ran a cold hand over the scar as if to make sure it was real but my mother couldnt believe i was dead brandt continued she wouldnt believe it she kept insisting there was a mistake so my father went to a sorcerer in the village he was like a witch doctor he knew more about magic and spells than anyone else on the island he gave people potions and medicines he might have made the poison that killed me for all i know the sorcerer said to my parents your sons death does not have to last he is missing only one part of his spirit the life force his life force has been taken away from him but i can give him a new one cally asked how the sorcerer and my father dug up my grave they dragged my coffin to the sorcerers hut the sorcerer left the coffin in a corner of the hut he told my mother to stay by it day and night keeping watch dont let anyone near the body he said then the sorcerer went up to the main road on the island night was coming on he sat by the road and watched the people wander past some were fishermen on their way home with the days catch some were women carrying fruit back to their huts then a stranger walked by a drifter he stumbled down the road ragged and dirty the sorcerer beckoned to him you look hungry my friend the sorcerer said and you look tired i am on my way home now come to my hut and i will feed you you may spend the night there if you wish the drifter probably wanted to go home with the sorcerer but he hesitated he knew that people on mapolo could be dangerous the sorcerer said you must not sleep outdoors on mapolo the island is full of panthers one of them will surely eat you before morning so the drifter went with the sorcerer he felt he had no choice brandt paused callys eyes fell on the leather pouch he always wore yes cally brandt assured her tugging on the pouch this pouch is coming into the story soon the sorcerer brought the drifter into his hut and gave him some kind of herbal tea the tea was heavily drugged after a few minutes the drifter lay as still as if he were dead the sorcerer told my father to open my coffin he looked at my corpse i had been dead for only one day my body had not yet begun to decay brandt swallowed hard it felt strange to talk about himself this way my parents watched as the sorcerer went to work he took off the drifters clothes and handed them to my father he told my father to dress me in the drifters clothes then the sorcerer cut off the drifters hair he clipped off his fingernails he put the hair and the fingernail clippings into a leather pouch this pouch brandt touched the leather pouch again he put the pouch around my neck now i wore the drifters clothes on my body and wore his hair and nails around my neck still i was dead the drifter lay on the floor breathing softly the sorcerer and my father lowered my body on the floor beside the drifters then my parents huddled in a corner and watched the sorcerer perform a strange ceremony he lit a torch and danced around my body and the drifters body in a figure eight he chanted something in a strange language my father had never heard before then he waved the torch over my corpse passing it from the drifters body to mine over and over again chanting in that weird language the ceremony lasted until dawn my father said he heard a rooster crow at that very moment he saw the drifter shudder the man never breathed again then my father stared at me and saw my chest move up then down my mother screamed she was so happy she had seen me breathe too i was alive i had been dead but now i was alive again i sat up i opened my eyes i was alive but the drifter was dead the sorcerer had stolen his life force and given it to me brandt sank back his story was finished cally floated closer brandt she whispered this is even better than id hoped youre dead but youre not youre undead she threw her arms around him well have so much fun brandt you and i well haunt this house together forever she brought her face close to kiss him but a cold cloud fell over brandt he raised his eyes to it and saw the dark shadow figure that had been chasing him who who are you brandt cried out chapter the shadow loomed closer darkening the hallway as it moved ive come to take back my life the dark figure cried brandt gaped into the darkness you he uttered as brandt stared at the shifting dark cloud the figure inside it began to take shape the image came clearer clearer like a camera lens focusing the shadows faded and fell away brandt found himself staring at a man it was impossible to tell how old he was his hair had been shorn off until he was nearly bald he was short and wiry the top of his head reached only to brandts chin he wore cotton pants and a cotton shirt the clothes hung long and loose on him clearly too large the sleeves of the shirt flapped over his hands the cuffs of the pants dragged along the floor his tiny round black eyes gleamed dully hard and empty lifeless a cold sickening realization shuddered through brandt the shadowy figure whod been chasing him it wasnt callys ghost after all the shadowy figure was the spirit of the drifter from the island ive come to take my life back the drifter announced in a dry whisper the sound of crackling dead leaves from the hole that was his mouth no stay away from me brandt cried backing away in terror please stay away with lightning quickness the mans bony hand shot out and ripped the leather pouch from brandts neck no please brandt protested weaker now clutching the pouch the shadowy figure grew solid his features grew sharper and clearer in the dim light of the hallway his skin and eyes gave off a warm glow my heart is beating the drifter cried joyfully im alive he vanished silently down the stairs please brandt whispered helplessly the breath seeped out of his body he tried to inhale to pull air in with his lungs but he hadnt the strength brandt cally narrowed her eyes at him are you okay brandt answered with a low moan he could feel his tongue shrivel up as he opened his mouth several teeth fell out glancing down he saw his hands wrinkle the skin turned green curled up then dropped off in chunks he watched callys face contort in horror at the sight of him he watched her lips moving frantically but he couldnt hear her words he reached up to check his ears and realized they had fallen off he saw her start to scream but then his eyes sank back in their sockets and he saw nothing more no cally screamed brandt dont leave me brandts body shriveled and decomposed before her eyes his skeleton collapsed into the floor callys wails of anger and despair echoed through the house all through the night brandt had been taken from her she felt as if the evil of the house had defeated her once more she was alone again epilogue there they go cally muttered to herself im being abandoned once more she hovered in her usual place staring out of the attic window a cobweb draped across the ceiling just above her face rats scampered across the dusty floor searching for something to nibble on in the street in front of the house cally saw a long black hearse four men moved out of the house and slowly down the driveway shouldering a shiny dark wood coffin look cally said pointing out the window she spoke as if to a friend but she had no friends there it goes there goes brandts coffin mr and mrs mccloy followed behind the coffin in a grim procession mr mccloy wore a dark suit mrs mccloy wore a black dress and a black veil behind the veil she sobbed her head bowed a handkerchief pressed to her face brandts parents cally said in contempt i never liked them they were so stupid so uncaring so selfabsorbed im glad theyre going i cant wait for them to leave get out of my house she roared at them of course they couldnt hear her the undertaker pulled open the back of the hearse the pallbearers lowered the heavy coffin struggling with it then slid it inside the undertaker shut the door of the hearse mr and mrs mccloy climbed into their car the undertaker sat in the front seat of the hearse he started the motor a tremor of grief and fury seized cally no she screamed brandt stays here with me dont take him away but the long black hearse pulled silently away from the curb and rolled quickly down fear street and out of sight cally let out a long shrill animal wail of protest it echoed through the empty house the misery on callys face hardened into a mask her icy blue eyes glittered with hate i wont be alone here forever she murmured through clenched teeth someone else will move into this house sooner or later a new victim will come she snickered scornfully thinking of the evil she would do next time someone will pay for my unhappiness she vowed the next people to arrive will be sorry they ever came to fear street
