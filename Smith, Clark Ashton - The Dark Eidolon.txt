the dark eidolon clark ashton smith thasaidon lord of seven hells wherein the single serpent dwells with volumes drawn from pit to pit through fire and darkness infinite thasaidon sun of nether skies thine ancient evil never dies for aye thy somber fulgors flame on sunken worlds that have no name mans heart enthrones thee still supreme though the false sorcerers blaspheme the song of xeethra on zothique the last continent on earth the sun no longer shone with the whiteness of its prime but was dim and tarnished as if with a vapor of blood new stars without number had declared themselves in the heavens and the shadows of the infinite had fallen closer and out of the shadows the older gods had returned to man the gods forgotten since hyperborea since mu and poseidonis bearing other names but the same attributes and the elder demons had also returned battening on the fumes of evil sacrifice and fostering again the primordial sorceries many were the necromancers and magicians of zothique and the infamy and marvel of their doings were legended everywhere in the latter days but among them all there was none greater than namirrha who imposed his black yoke on the cities of xylac and later in a proud delirium deemed himself the veritable peer of thasaidon lord of evil namirrha had built his abode in ummaos the chief town of xylac to which he came from the desert realm of tasuun with the dark renown of his thaumaturgies like a cloud of desert storm behind him and no man knew that in coming to ummaos he returned to the city of his birth for all deemed him a native of tasuun indeed none could have dreamt that the great sorcerer was one with the beggarboy narthos an orphan of questionable parentage who had begged his daily bread in the streets and bazaars of ummaos wretchedly had he lived alone and despised and a hatred of the cruel opulent city grew in his heart like a smothered flame that feeds in secret biding the time when it shall become a conflagration consuming all things bitterer always through his boyhood and early youth was the spleen and rancor of narthos toward men and one day the prince zotulla a boy but little older than he riding a restive palfrey came upon him in the square before the imperial palace and narthos implored an alms but zotulla scorning his plea rode arrogantly forward spurring the palfrey and narthos was ridden down and trampled under its hooves and afterward nigh to death from the trampling he lay senseless for many hours while the people passed him by unheeding and at last regaining his senses he dragged himself to his hovel but he limped a little thereafter all his days and the mark of one hoof remained like a brand on his body fading never later he left ummaos and was forgotten quickly by its people going southward into tasuun he lost his way in the great desert and was near to perishing but finally he came to a small oasis where dwelt the wizard ouphaloc a hermit who preferred the company of honest jackals and hyenas to that of men and ouphaloc seeing the great craft and evil in the starveling boy gave succor to narthos and sheltered him he dwelt for years with ouphaloc becoming the wizards pupil and the heir of his demonwrested lore strange things he learned in that hermitage being fed on fruits and grain that had sprung not from the watered earth and wine that was not the juice of terrene grapes and like ouphaloc he became a master in devildom and drove his own bond with the archfiend thasaidon when ouphaloc died he took the name of namirrha and went forth as a mighty sorcerer among the wandering peoples and the deepburied mummies of tasuun but never could he forget the miseries of his boyhood in ummaos and the wrong he had endured from zotulla and year by year he spun over in his thoughts the black web of revenge and his fame grew ever darker and vaster and men feared him in remote lands beyond tasuun with bated whispers they spoke of his deeds in the cities of yoros and in zulbhashair the abode of the ghoulish deity mordiggian and long before the coming of namirrha himself the people of ummaos knew him as a fabled scourge that was direr than simoom or pestilence now in the years that followed the goingforth of the boy narthos from ummaos pithaim the father of prince zotulla was slain by the sting of a small adder that had crept into his bed for warmth on an autumn night some said that the adder had been purveyed by zotulla but this was a thing that no man could verily affirm after the death of pithaim zotulla being his only son was emperor of xylac and ruled evilly from his throne in ummaos indolent he was and tyrannic and full of strange luxuries and cruelties but the people who were also evil acclaimed him in his turpitude so he prospered and the lords of hell and heaven smote him not and the red suns and ashen moons went westward over xylac falling into that seldomvoyaged sea which if the mariners tales were true poured evermore like a swiftening river past the infamous isle of naat and fell in a worldwide cataract upon nether space from the far sheer edge of earth grosser still he grew and his sins were as overswollen fruits that ripen above a deep abyss but the winds of time blew softly and the fruits fell not and zotulla laughed amid his fools and his eunuchs and his lemans and the tale of his luxuries was borne afar and was told by dim outland peoples as a twin marvel with the bruited necromancies of namirrha it came to pass in the year of the hyena and the month of the star canicule that a great feast was given by zotulla to the inhabitants of ummaos meats that had been cooked in exotic spices from sotar isle of the east were spread everywhere and the ardent wines of yoros and xylac filled as with subterranean fires were poured inexhaustibly from huge urns for all the wines awoke a furious mirth and a royal madness and afterward they brought a slumber no less profound than the lethe of the tomb and one by one as they drank the revellers fell down in the streets the houses and gardens as if a plague had struck them and zotulla slept in his banquethall of gold and ebony with his odalisques and chamberlains about him so in all ummaos there was no man or woman wakeful at the hour when sirius began to fall toward the west thus it was that none saw or heard the coming of namirrha but awakening heavily in the latter forenoon the emperor zotulla heard a confused babble a troublous clamor of voices from such of his eunuchs and women as had awakened before him inquiring the cause he was told that a strange prodigy had occurred during the night but being still bemused with wine and slumber he comprehended little enough of its nature till his favorite concubine obexah led him to the eastern portico of the palace from which he could behold the marvel with his own eyes now the palace stood alone at the center of ummaos and to the north west and south for wide intervals of distance there stretched the imperial gardens full of superbly arching palms and loftily spiring fountains but to eastward was a broad open area used as a sort of common between the palace and the mansions of high optimates and in this space which had lain wholly vacant at eve a building towered colossal and lordly beneath the fullrisen sun with domes like monstrous fungi of stone that had come up in the night and the domes rearing level with those of zotulla were builded of deathwhite marble and the huge fa–∑ade with multicolumned porticoes and deep balconies was wrought in alternate zones of nightblack onyx and porphyry hued as with dragons blood and zotulla swore lewdly calling with hoarse blasphemies on the gods and devils of xylac and great was his dumfoundment deeming the marvel a work of wizardry the women gathered about him crying out with shrill cries of awe and terror and more and more of his courtiers awakening came to swell the hubbub and the fat castradoes diddered in their clothofgold like immense black jellies in golden basins but zotulla mindful of his dominion as emperor of all xylac strove to conceal his own trepidation saying now who is this that has presumed to enter ummaos like a jackal in the dark and has made his impious den in proximity and counterview of my palace go forth and inquire the miscreants name but ere you go instruct the headsman to make sharp his doublehanded sword then fearing the emperors wrath if they tarried certain of the chamberlains went forth unwillingly and approached the portals of the strange edifice it seemed that the portals were deserted till they drew near and then on the threshold there appeared a titanic skeleton taller than any man of earth and it strode forward to meet them with elllong strides the skeleton was swathed in a loincloth of scarlet silk with a buckle of jet and it wore a black turban starred with diamonds whose topmost foldings nearly touched the high lintel eyes like flickering marshfires burned in its deep eyesockets and a blackened tongue like that of a longdead man protruded between its teeth but otherwise it was clean of flesh and the bones glittered whitely in the sun as it came onward the chamberlains were mute before it and there was no sound except the golden creaking of their girdles the shrill rustling of their silks as they shook and trembled and the footbones of the skeleton clicked sharply on the pavement of black onyx as it paused and the putrefying tongue began to quiver between its teeth and it uttered these words in an unctuous nauseous voice return and tell the emperor zotulla that namirrha seer and magician has come to dwell beside him hearing the skeleton speak as if it had been a living man and hearing the dread name of namirrha as men hear the tocsin of doom in some fallen city the chamberlains could stand before it no longer and they fled with ungainly swiftness and bore the message to zotulla now learning who it was that had come to neighbor with him in ummaos the emperors wrath died out like a feeble and blustering flame on which the wind of darkness had blown and the vinous purple of his cheeks was mottled with a strange pallor and he said nothing but his lips mumbled loosely as if in prayer or malediction and the news of namirrhas coming passed like the flight of evil nightbirds through all the palace and throughout the city leaving a noisome terror that abode in ummaos thereafter till the end for namirrha through the black renown of his thaumaturgies and the frightful entities who served him had become a power that no secular sovereign dared dispute and men feared him everywhere even as they feared the gigantic shadowy lords of hell and of outer space and in ummaos people said that he had come on the desert wind from tasuun with his underlings even as the pestilence comes and had reared his house in an hour with the aid of devils beside zotullas palace and they said that the foundations of the house were laid on the adamantine cope of hell and in its floors were pits at whose bottom burned the nether fires or stars could be seen as they passed under in lowermost night and the followers of namirrha were the dead of strange kingdoms the demons of sky and earth and the abyss and mad impious hybrid things that the sorcerer himself created from forbidden unions men shunned the neighborhood of his lordly house and in the palace of zotulla few cared to approach the windows and balconies that gave thereon and the emperor himself spoke not of namirrha pretending to ignore the intruder and the women of the harem babbled evermore with an evil gossip concerning namirrha and his concubines but the sorcerer himself was not beheld by the people of that city though some believed that he walked forth at will clad with invisibility his servitors were likewise not seen but a howling as of the damned was sometimes heard to issue from his portals and sometimes there came a strange cachinnation as if some adamantine image had laughed aloud and sometimes there was a chuckling like the sound of shattered ice in a frozen hell dim shadows moved in the porticoes when there was neither sunlight nor lamp to cast them and red eery lights appeared and vanished in the windows at eve like a blinking of demoniac eyes and slowly the embercolored suns went over xylac and were quenched in far seas and the ashy moons were blackened as they fell nightly toward the hidden gulf then seeing that the wizard had wrought no open evil and that none had endured palpable harm from his presence the people took heart and zotulla drank deeply and feasted in oblivious luxury as before and dark thasaidon prince of all turpitudes was the true but neveracknowledged lord of xylac and in time the men of ummaos bragged a little of namirrha and his dread thaumaturgies even as they had boasted of the purple sins of zotulla but namirrha still unbeheld by living men and living women sat in the inner walls of that house which his devils had reared for him and spun over and over in his thoughts the black web of revenge and the wrong done by zotulla to narthos in old times was the least of those cruelties which the emperor had forgotten now when the fears of zotulla were somewhat lulled and his women gossiped less often of the neighboring wizard there occurred a new wonder and a fresh terror for sitting one eve at his banquettable with his courtiers about him the emperor heard a noise as of myriad ironshod hooves that came trampling through the palace gardens and the courtiers also heard the sound and were startled amid their mounting drunkenness and the emperor was angered and he sent certain of his guards to examine into the cause of the trampling but peering forth upon the moonbright lawns and parterres the guards beheld no visible shape though the loud sounds of trampling still went to and fro it seemed as if a rout of wild stallions passed and repassed before the fa–∑ade of the palace with tumultuous gallopings and capricoles and a fear came upon the guards as they looked and listened and they dared not venture forth but returned to zotulla and the emperor himself grew sober when he heard their tale and he went forth with high blusterings to view the prodigy and all night the unseen hooves rang out sonorously on the pavement of onyx and ran with deep thuddings over the grasses and flowers the palmfronds waved on the windless air as if parted by racing steeds and visibly the tallstemmed lilies and broadpetaled exotic blossoms were trodden under and rage and terror nested together in zotullas heart as he stood in a balcony above the garden hearing the spectral tumult and beholding the harm done to his rarest flowerbeds the women the courtiers and eunuchs cowered behind him and there was no slumber for any occupant of the palace but toward dawn the clamor of hooves departed going toward namirrhas house when the dawn was fullgrown above ummaos the emperor walked forth with his guards about him and saw that the crushed grasses and brokendown stems were blackened as if by fire where the hooves had fallen plainly were the marks imprinted like the tracks of a great company of horses in all the lawns and parterres but they ceased at the verge of the gardens and though everyone believed that the visitation had come from namirrha there was no proof of this in the grounds that fronted the sorcerers abode for here the turf was untrodden a pox upon namirrha if he has done this cried zotulla for what harm have i ever done him verily i shall set my heel on the dogs neck and the torturewheel shall serve him even as these horses from hell have served my bloodred lilies of sotar and my veincolored irises of naat and my orchids from uccastrog which were purple as the bruises of love yea though he stand the viceroy of thasaidon above earth and overlord of ten thousand devils my wheel shall break him and fires shall heat the wheel whitehot in its turning till he withers black as the seared blossoms thus did zotulla make his brag but he issued no orders for the execution of his threat and no man stirred from the palace towards namirrhas house and from the portals of the wizard none came forth or if any came there was no visible sign or sound so the day went over and the night rose bringing later a moon that was slightly darkened at the rim and the night was silent and zotulla sitting long at the banquettable drained his winecup often and wrathfully muttering new threats against namirrha and the night wore on and it seemed that the visitation would not be repeated but at midnight lying in his chamber with obexah and fathomdeep in his slumber from the wine zotulla was awakened by a monstrous clangor of hooves that raced and capered in the palace porticoes and in the long balconies all night the hooves thundered back and forth echoing awfully in the vaulted stone while zotulla and obexah listening huddled close amid their cushions and coverlets and all the occupants of the palace wakeful and fearful heard the noise but stirred not from their chambers a little before dawn the hooves departed suddenly and afterward by day their marks were found found on the marble flags of the porches and balconies and the marks were countless deepgraven and black as if branded there by flame like mottled marble were the emperors cheeks when he saw the hoofprinted floors and terror stayed with him henceforth following him to the depths of his inebriety since he knew not where the haunting would cease his women murmured and some wished to flee from ummaos and it seemed that the revels of the day and evening were shadowed by ill wings that left their umbrage in the yellow wine and bedimmed the aureate lamps and again toward midnight the slumber of zotulla was broken by the hooves which came galloping and pacing on the palaceroof and through all the corridors and the halls thereafter till dawn the hooves filled the palace with their iron clatterings and they rung hollowly on the topmost domes as if the coursers of gods had trodden there passing from heaven to heaven in tumultuous cavalcade zotulla and obexah lying together while the terrible hooves went to and fro in the hall outside their chamber had no heart or thought for sin nor could they find any comfort in their nearness in the gray hour before dawn they heard a great thundering high on the barred brazen door of the room as if some mighty stallion rearing had drummed there with his forefeet and soon after this the hooves went away leaving a silence like an interlude in some gathering storm of doom later the marks of the hooves were found everywhere in the halls marring the bright mosaics black holes were burnt in the goldenthreaded rugs and the rugs of silver and scarlet and the high white domes were pitted poxwise with the marks and far up on the brazen door of zotullas chamber the prints of a horses forefeet were incised deeply now in ummaos and throughout xylac the tale of this haunting became known and the thing was deemed an ominous prodigy though people differed in their interpretations some held that the sending came from namirrha and was meant as a token of his supremacy above all kings and emperors and some thought that it came from a new wizard who had risen in tinarath far to the east and who wished to supplant namirrha and the priests of the gods of xylac held that their various deities had dispatched the haunting as a sign that more sacrifices were required in the temples then in his hall of audience whose floor of sard and jasper had been grievously pocked by the unseen hooves zotulla called together many priests and magicians and soothsayers and asked them to declare the cause of the sending and devise a mode of exorcism but seeing that there was no agreement among them zotulla provided the several priestly sects with the wherewithal of sacrifice to their sundry gods and sent them away and the wizards and prophets under threat of decapitation if they refused were enjoined to visit namirrha in his mansion of sorcery and learn his will if haply the sending were his and not the work of another loth were the wizards and the soothsayers fearing namirrha and caring not to intrude upon the frightful mysteries of his obscure mansion but the swordsmen of the emperor drove them forth lifting great crescent blades against them when they tarried so one by one in a straggling order the delegation went towards namirrhas portals and vanished into the devilbuilded house pale muttering and distraught like men who have looked upon hell and have seen their doom they returned before sunset to the emperor and they said that namirrha had received them courteously and had sent them back with this message be it known to zotulla that the haunting is a sign of that which he has long forgotten and the reason of the haunting will be revealed to him at the hour prepared and set apart by destiny and the hour draws near for namirrha bids the emperor and all his court to a great feast on the afternoon of the morrow having delivered this message to the wonder and consternation of zotulla the delegation begged his leave to depart and though the emperor questioned them minutely they seemed unwilling to relate the circumstances of the visit to namirrha nor would they describe the sorcerers fabled house except in a vague manner each contradicting the other as to what he had seen so after a little zotulla bade them go and when they had gone he sat musing for a long while on the invitation of namirrha which was a thing he cared not to accept but feared to decline that evening he drank even more liberally than was his wont and he slept a lethean slumber nor was there any noise of trampling hooves about the palace to awaken him and silently during the night the prophets and magicians passed like furtive shadows from ummaos and no man saw them depart and at morning they were gone from xylac into other lands never to return now on that same evening in the great hall of his house namirrha sat alone having dismissed the familiars who attended him ordinarily before him on an altar of jet was the dark gigantic statue of thasaidon which a devilbegotten sculptor had wrought in ancient days for an evil king of tasuun called pharnoc the archdemon was depicted in the guise of a fullarmored warrior lifting a spiky mace as if in heroic battle long had the statue lain in the desertsunken palace of pharnoc whose very site was disputed by the nomads and namirrha by his divination had found it and had reared up the infernal image to abide with him always thereafter and often through the mouth of the statue thasaidon would utter oracles to namirrha or would answer interrogations before the blackarmored image there hung seven silver lamps wrought in the form of horses skulls with flames issuing changeably in blue and purple and crimson from their eyesockets wild and lurid was their light and the face of the demon peering from under his crested helmet was filled with malign equivocal shadows that shifted and changed eternally and sitting in his serpentcarven chair namirrha regarded the statue grimly with a deepfurrowed frown between his eyes for he had asked a certain thing of thasaidon and the fiend replying through the statue had refused him and rebellion was in the heart of namirrha grown mad with pride and deeming himself the lord of all sorcerers and a ruler by his own right among the princes of devildom so after long pondering he repeated his request in a bold and haughty voice like one who addresses an equal rather than the allformidable suzerain to whom he had sworn a fatal fealty i have helped you heretofore in all things said the image with stony and sonorous accents that were echoed metallically in the seven silver lamps yea the undying worms of fire and darkness have come forth like an army at your summons and the wings of nether genii have risen to occlude the sun when you called them but verily i will not aid you in this vengeance you have planned for the emperor zotulla has done me no wrong and has served me well though unwittingly and the people of xylac by reason of their turpitudes are not the least of my terrestial worshippers therefore namirrha it were well for you to live in peace with zotulla and well to forget this olden wrong that was done to the beggarboy narthos for the ways of destiny are strange and the workings of its laws sometimes hidden and truly if the hooves of zotullas palfrey had not spurned you and trodden you under your life had been otherwise and the name and renown of namirrha had still slept in oblivion as a dream undreamed yea you would tarry still as a beggar in ummaos content with a beggars guerdon and would never have fared forth to become the pupil of the wise and learned ouphaloc and i thasaidon would have lost the lordliest of all necromancers who have accepted my service and my bond think well namirrha and ponder these matters for both of us it would seem are indebted to zotulla in all gratitude for the trampling he gave you yea there is a debt namirrha growled implacably and truly i will pay the debt tomorrow even as i have planned there are those who will aid me those who will answer my summoning in your despite it is an ill thing to affront me said the image after an interval and also it is not wise to call upon those that you designate however i perceive clearly that such is your intent you are proud and stubborn and revengeful do then as you will but blame me not for the outcome so after this there was silence in the hall where namirrha sat before the eidolon and the flames burned darkly with changeable colors in the skullshapen lamps and the shadows fled and returned unresting on the face of the statue and the face of namirrha then toward midnight the necromancer arose and went upward by many spiral stairs to a high dome of his house in which there was a single small round window that looked forth on the constellations the window was set in the top of the dome but namirrha had contrived by means of his magic that one entering by the last spiral of the stairs would suddenly seem to descend rather than climb and reaching the last step would peer downward through the window while stars passed under him in a giddying gulf there kneeling namirrha touched a secret spring in the marble and the circular pane slid back without sound then lying prone on the interior of the dome with his face over the abyss and his long beard trailing stiffly into space he whispered a prehuman rune and held speech with certain entities who belonged neither to hell nor the mundane elements and were more fearsome to invoke than the infernal genii or the devils of earth air water and flame with them he made his contract defying thasaidons will while the air curdled about him with their voices and rime gathered palely on his sable beard from the cold that was wrought by their breathing as they leaned earthward laggard and loth was the awakening of zotulla from his wine and quickly ere he opened his eyes the daylight was poisoned for him by the thought of that invitation which he feared to accept or decline but he spoke to obexah saying who after all is this wizardly dog that i should obey his summons like a beggar called in from the street by some haughty lord obexah a goldenskinned and obliqueeyed girl from uccastrog isle of the torturers eyed the emperor subtly and said o zotulla it is yours to accept or refuse as you deem fitting and truly it is a small matter for the lord of ummaos and all xylac whether to go or to stay since naught can impugn his sovereignty therefore were it not as well to go for obexah though fearful of the wizard was curious regarding that devilbuilded house of which so little was known and likewise in the manner of women she wished to behold the famed namirrha whose mien and appearance were still but a farbrought legend in ummaos there is something in what you say admitted zotulla but an emperor in his conduct must always consider the public good and there are matters of state involved which a woman can scarcely be expected to understand so later in the forenoon after an ample and wellirrigated breakfast he called his chamberlains and courtiers about him and took counsel with them and some advised him to ignore the invitation of namirrha and others held that the invitation be accepted lest a graver evil than the trampling of ghostly hooves be sent upon the palace and the city then zotulla called the many priesthoods before him in a body and sought to resummon the wizards and soothsayers who had fled privily in the night among all the latter there was none who answered the crying of his name through ummaos and this aroused a certain wonder but the priests came in a greater number than before and thronged the hall of audience so that the paunches of the foremost were straightened against the imperial dais and the buttocks of the hindmost were flattened on the rear walls and pillars and zotulla debated with them the matter of acceptance or refusal and the priests argued as before that namirrha was nowherewise concerned with the sending and his invitation they said portended no harm nor bale to the emperor and it was plain from the terms of the message that an oracle would be imparted to zotulla by the wizard and this oracle if namirrha were a true archimage would confirm their own holy wisdom and re–ªstablish the divine source of the sending and the gods of xylac would again be glorified then having heard the pronouncement of the priests the emperor instructed his treasurers to load them down with new offerings and calling unctuously upon zotulla and all his household the vicarious blessings of the several gods the priests departed and the day wore on and the sun passed its meridian falling slowly beyond ummaos through the spaces of the afternoon that were floored with seaending deserts and still zotulla was irresolute and he called his winebearers bidding them pour for him the strongest and most magistral of their vintages but in the wine he found neither certitude nor decision sitting still on his throne in the hall of audience he heard toward middle afternoon a mighty and clamorous outcry that arose at the palace portals there were deep wailings of men and the shrillings of eunuchs and women as if terror passed from tongue to tongue invading the halls and apartments and the fearful clamor spread throughout all the palace and zotulla rousing from the lethargy of wine was about to send his attendants to inquire the cause then into the hall there filed an array of tall mummies clad in royal cerements of purple and scarlet and wearing gold crowns on their withered craniums and after them like servitors came gigantic skeletons who wore loincloths of nacarat orange and about whose upper skulls from brow to crown live serpents of banded saffron and ebon had wrapped themselves for headdresses and the mummies bowed before zotulla saying with thin sere voices we who were kings of the wide realm of tasuun aforetime have been sent as a guard of honor for the emperor zotulla to attend him as is befitting when he goes forth to the feast prepared by namirrha then with dry clickings of their teeth and whistlings as of air through screens of fretted ivory the skeletons spoke we who were giant warriors of a race forgotten have also been sent by namirrha so that the emperors household following him to the feast should be guarded from all peril and should fare forth in such pageantry as is meet and proper witnessing these prodigies the winebearers and other attendants cowered about the imperial dais or hid behind the pillars while zotulla with pupils swimming starkly in a bloodshot white with face bloated and ghastly pale sat frozen on his throne and could utter no word in reply to the ministers of namirrha then coming forward the mummies said in dusty accents all is made ready and the feast awaits the arrival of zotulla and the cerements of the mummies stirred and fell open at the bosom and small rodent monsters brown as bitumen eyed as with accursed rubies reared forth from the eaten hearts of the mummies like rats from their holes and chittered shrilly in human speech repeating the words the skeletons in turn took up the solemn sentence and the black and saffron serpents hissed it from their skulls and the words were repeated lastly in baleful rumblings by certain furry creatures of dubious form hitherto unseen by zotulla who sat behind the ribs of the skeletons as if in cages of white wicker like a dreamer who obeys the doom of dreams the emperor rose from his throne and went forward and the mummies surrounded him like an escort and each of the skeletons drew from the reddishyellow folds of his loincloth a curiously pierced archaic flute of silver and all began a sweet and evil and deathly fluting as the emperor went out through the halls of the palace a fatal spell was in the music for the chamberlains the women the guards the eunuchs and all members of zotullas household even to the cooks and scullions were drawn like a procession of nightwalkers from the rooms and alcoves in which they had vainly hidden themselves and marshaled by the flutists they followed after zotulla a strange thing it was to behold this mighty company of people going forth in the slanted sunlight toward namirrhas house with a cort–∏ge of dead kings about them and the blown breath of skeletons thrilling eldritchly in the silver flutes and little was zotulla comforted when he found the girl obexah at his side moving as he in a thralldom of involitent horror with the rest of his women close behind coming to the open portals of namirrhas house the emperor saw that they were guarded by great crimsonwattled things half dragon half man who bowed before him sweeping their wattles like bloody besoms on the flags of dark onyx and the emperor passed with obexah between the louting monsters with the mummies the skeletons and his own people behind him in strange pageant and entered a vast and multicolumned hall where the daylight following timidly was drowned by the baleful arrogant blaze of a thousand lamps even amid his horror zotulla marvelled at the vastness of the chamber which he could hardly reconcile with the mansions outer length and height and breadth though these indeed were of most palatial amplitude for it seemed that he gazed down great avenues of topless pillars and vistas of tables laden with piledup viands and thronged urns of wine that stretched away before him into luminous distance and gloom as of starless night in the wide intervals between the tables the familiars of namirrha and his other servants went to and fro incessantly as if a fantasmagoria of ill dreams were embodied before the emperor kingly cadavers in robes of timerotted brocade with worms seething in their eyepits poured a bloodlike wine into cups of the opalescent horn of unicorns lamias tridenttailed and fourbreasted chimeras came in with fuming platters lifted high by their brazen claws dogheaded devils tongued with lolling flames ran forward to offer themselves as ushers for the company and before zotulla and obexah there appeared a curious being with the fullfleshed lower limbs and hips of a great black woman and the cleanpicked bones of some titanic ape from thereupward verily it seemed to zotulla that they had gone a long way into some malignly litten cavern of hell when they came to that perspective of tables and columns down which the monster had led them here at the rooms end apart from the rest was a table at which namirrha sat alone with the flames of the seven horseskull lamps burning restlessly behind him and the mailed black image of thasaidon towering from the altar of jet at his right hand and a little aside from the altar a diamond mirror was upborne by the claws of iron basilisks namirrha rose to greet them observing a solemn and funereal courtesy his eyes were bleak and cold as distant stars in the hollows wrought by strange fearful vigils his lips were like a palered seal on a shut parchment of doom his beard flowed stiffly in blackanointed banded locks across the bosom of his vermilion robe like a mass of straight black serpents zotulla felt the blood pause and thicken about his heart as if congealing into ice and obexah peering beneath lowered lids was abashed and frightened by the visible horror that invested this man and hung upon him even as royalty upon a king but amid her fear she found room to wonder what manner of man he was in his intercourse with women i bid you welcome o zotulla to such hospitality as is mine to offer said namirrha with the iron ringing of some hidden funereal bell deep down in his hollow voice prithee be seated at my table zotulla saw that a chair of ebony had been placed for him opposite namirrha and another chair less stately and imperial had been placed at the left hand for obexah and the twain seated themselves and zotulla saw that his people were sitting likewise at other tables throughout the huge hall with the frightful servants of namirrha waiting upon them busily like devils attending the damned then zotulla perceived that a dark and corpselike hand was pouring wine for him in a crystal cup and upon the hand was the signetring of the emperors of xylac set with a monstrous fireopal in the mouth of a golden bat even such a ring as zotulla wore perpetually on his indexfinger and turning he beheld at his right hand a figure that bore the likeness of his father pithaim after the poison of the adder spreading through his limbs had left behind it the purple bloating of death and zotulla who had caused the adder to be placed in the bed of pithaim cowered in his seat and trembled with a guilty fear and the thing that wore the similtude of pithaim whether corpse or an image wrought by namirrhas enchantment came and went at zotullas elbow waiting upon him with stark black swollen fingers that never fumbled horribly he was aware of its bulging unregarding eyes and its livid purple mouth that was locked in a rigor of mortal silence and the spotted adder that peered at intervals with chill orbs from its heavyfolded sleeve as it leaned beside him to replenish his cup or to serve him with meat and dimly through the icy mist of his terror the emperor beheld the shadowyarmored shape like a moving replica of the still grim statue of thasaidon which namirrha had reared up in his blasphemy to perform the same office for himself and vaguely without comprehension he saw the dreadful ministrant that hovered beside obexah a flayed and eyeless corpse in the image of her first lover a boy from cyntrom who had been cast ashore in shipwreck on the isle of the torturers there obexah had found him lying behind the ebbing wave and reviving the boy she had hidden him awhile in a secret cave for her own pleasure and had brought him food and drink later wearying she had betrayed him to the torturers and had taken a new delight in the various pangs and ordeals inflicted upon him before death by that cruel pernicious people drink said namirrha quaffing a strange wine that was red and dark as if with disastrous sunsets of lost years and zotulla and obexah drank the wine feeling no warmth in their veins thereafter but a chill as of hemlock mounting slowly toward the heart verily tis a good wine said namirrha and a proper one in which to toast the furthering of our acquaintance for it was buried long ago with the royal dead in amphorae of somber jasper shapen like funeral urns and my ghouls found it whenas they came to dig in tasuun now it seemed that the tongue of zotulla froze in his mouth as a mandrake freezes in the rimebound soil of winter and he found no reply to namirrhas courtesy prithee make trial of this meat quoth namirrha for it is very choice being the flesh of that boar which the torturers of uccastrog are wont to pasture on the wellminced leavings of their wheels and racks and moreover my cooks have spiced it with the powerful balsams of the tomb and have farced it with the hearts of adders and the tongues of black cobras naught could the emperor say and even obexah was silent being sorely troubled in her turpitude by the presence of that flayed and piteous thing which had the likeness of her lover from cyntrom and the dread of the necromancer grew prodigiously for his knowledge of this old forgotten crime and the raising of the fantasm appeared to her a more baleful magic than all else now i fear said namirrha that you find the meat devoid of savor and the wine without fire so to enliven our feasting i shall call forth my singers and my musicians he spoke a word unknown to zotulla or obexah which sounded throughout the mighty hall as if a thousand voices in turn had taken it up and prolonged it anon there appeared the singers who were sheghouls with shaven bodies and hairy shanks and long yellow tushes full of shredded carrion curving across their chaps from mouths that fawned hyenawise on the company behind them entered the musicians some of whom were male devils pacing erect on the hindquarters of sable stallions and plucking with the fingers of white apes at lyres of the bone and sinew of cannibals from naat and others were pied satyrs puffing their goatish cheeks at hautboys formed from the bosomskin of negro queens and the horn of rhinoceri they bowed before namirrha with grotesque ceremony then without delay the sheghouls began a most dolorous and execrable howling as of jackals that have sniffed their carrion and the satyrs and devils played a lament that was like the moaning of desertborn winds through forsaken palace harems and zotulla shivered for the singing filled his marrow with ice and the music left in his heart a desolation as of empires fallen and trod under by the ironshod hooves of time ever amid that evil music he seemed to hear the sifting of sand across withered gardens and the windy rustling of rotted silks upon couches of bygone luxury and the hissing of coiled serpents from the low fusts of shattered columns and the glory that had been ummaos seemed to pass away like the blown pillars of the simoom now that was a brave tune said namirrha when the music ceased and the sheghouls no longer howled but verily i fear that you find my entertainment somewhat dull therefore my dancers shall dance for you he turned toward the great hall and described in the air an enigmatic sign with the fingers of his right hand in answer to the sign a hueless mist came down from the high roof and hid the room like a fallen curtain for a brief interim there was a babel of sounds confused and muffled beyond the curtain and a crying of voices faint as if with distance then dreadfully the vapor rolled away and zotulla saw that the leaden tables had gone in the wide interspaces of the columns his palaceinmates the chamberlains the eunuchs the courtiers and odalisques and all the others lay trussed with thongs on the floor like so many fowls of glorious plumage above them in time to a music made by the lyrists and flutists of the necromancer a troupe of skeletons pirouetted with light clickings of their toebones and a rout of mummies bowed stiffly and others of namirrhas creatures moved with mysterious caperings to and fro they leapt on the bodies of the emperors people in the paces of an evil saraband at every step they grew taller and heavier till the saltant mummies were as the mummies of anakim and the skeletons were boned as colossi and louder the music rose drowning the faint cries of zotullas people and huger still became the dancers towering far into vaulted shadow among the vast columns with thudding feet that wrought thunder in the room and those whereon they danced were as grapes trampled for a vintage in autumn and the floor ran deep with a sanguine must as a man drowning in a noisome nightbound fen the emperor heard the voice of namirrha it would seem that my dancers please you not so now i shall present you a most royal spectacle arise and follow me for the spectacle is one that requires an empire for its stage zotulla and obexah rose from their chairs in the fashion of nightwalkers giving no backward glance at their ministering phantoms or the hall where the dancers bounded they followed namirrha to an alcove beyond the altar of thasaidon thence by the upwardcoiling stairways they came at length to a broad high balcony that faced zotullas palace and looked forth above the city roofs toward the bourn of sunset it seemed that several hours had gone by in that hellish feasting and entertainment for the day was near to its close and the sun which had fallen from sight behind the imperial palace was barring the vast heavens with bloody rays behold said namirrha adding a strange vocable to which the stone of the edifice resounded like a beaten gong the balcony pitched a little and zotulla looking over the balustrade beheld the roofs of ummaos lessen and sink beneath him it seemed that the balcony flew skyward to a prodigious height and he peered down across the domes of his own palace upon the houses the tilled fields and the desert beyond and the huge sun brought low on the deserts verge and zotulla grew giddy and the chill airs of the upper heavens blew upon him but namirrha spoke another word and the balcony ceased to ascend look well said the necromancer on the empire that was yours but shall be yours no longer then with arms outstretched toward the sunset he called aloud the twelve names that were perdition to utter and after them the tremendous invocation gna padambis devompra thungis furidor avoragomon instantly it seemed that great ebon clouds of thunder beetled against the sun lining the horizon the clouds took the form of colossal monsters with heads and members somewhat resembling those of stallions rearing terribly they trod down the sun like an extinguished ember and racing as if in some hippodrome of titans they rose higher and vaster coming towards ummaos deep calamitous rumblings preceded them and the earth shook visibly till zotulla saw that these were not immaterial clouds but actual living forms that had come forth to tread the world in macrocosmic vastness throwing their shadows for many leagues before them the coursers charged as if devilridden into xylac and their feet descended like falling mountain crags upon far oases and towns of the outer wastes like a manyturreted storm they came and it seemed that the world shrank gulfward tilting beneath the weight still as a man enchanted into marble zotulla stood and beheld the ruining that was wrought on his empire and closer drew the gigantic stallions racing with inconceivable speed and louder was the thundering of their footfalls that now began to blot the green fields and fruited orchards lying for many miles to the west of ummaos and the shadow of the stallions climbed like an evil gloom of eclipse till it covered ummaos and looking up the emperor saw their eyes halfway between earth and zenith like baleful suns that glare down from soaring cumuli then in the thickening gloom above that insupportable thunder he heard the voice of namirrha crying in mad triumph know zotulla that i have called up the coursers of thamogorgos lord of the abyss and the coursers will tread your empire down even as your palfrey trod and trampled in former time a beggarboy named narthos and learn also that i namirrha was that boy and the eyes of namirrha filled with a vainglory of madness and bale burned like malign disastrous stars at the hour of their culmination to zotulla wholly mazed with the horror and tumult the necromancers words were no more than shrill shrieked overtones of the tempest of doom and he understood them not tremendously with a rending of staunchbuilt roofs and an instant cleavage and crumbling down of mighty masonries the hooves descended upon ummaos fair templedomes were pashed like shells of the haliotis and haughty mansions were broken and stamped into the ground even as gourds and house by house the city was trampled flat with a crashing as of worlds beaten into chaos far below in the darkened streets men and camels fled like scurrying emmets but could not escape and implacably the hooves rose and fell till ruin was upon half the city and night was over all the palace of zotulla was trodden under and now the forelegs of the coursers loomed level with namirrhas balcony and their heads towered awfully above it seemed that they would rear and trample down the necromancers house but at that moment they parted to left and right and a dolorous glimmering came from the low sunset and the coursers went on treading under them that portion of ummaos which lay to the eastward and zotulla and obexah and namirrha looked down on the citys fragments as on a shardstrewn midden and heard the cataclysmic clamor of the hooves departing toward eastern xylac now that was a goodly spectacle quoth namirrha then turning to the emperor he added malignly think not that i have done with thee however or that doom is yet consummate it seemed that the balcony had fallen to its former elevation which was still a lofty vantage above the sharded ruins and namirrha plucked the emperor by the arm and led him from the balcony to an inner chamber while obexah followed mutely the emperors heart was crushed within him by the trampling of such calamities and despair weighed upon him like a foul incubus on the shoulders of a man lost in some land of accursed night and he knew not that he had been parted from obexah on the threshold of the chamber and that certain of namirrhas creatures appearing like shadows had compelled the girl to go downward with them by the stairs and had stifled her outcries with their rotten cerements as they went the chamber was one that namirrha used for his most unhallowed rites and alchemies the rays of the lamps that illumed it were saffronred like the spilt ichor of devils and they flowed on aludels and crucibles and black athanors and alembics whereof the purpose was hardly to be named by mortal man the sorcerer heated in one of the alembics a dark liquid full of starcold lights while zotulla looked on unheeding and when the liquid bubbled and sent forth a spiral vapor namirrha distilled it into goblets of goldrimmed iron and gave one of the goblets to zotulla and retained the other himself and he said to zotulla with a stern imperative voice i bid thee quaff this liquor zotulla fearing that the draft was poison hesitated and the necromancer regarded him with a lethal gaze and cried loudly fearest thou to do as i and therewith he set the goblet to his lips so the emperor drank the draft constrained as if by the bidding of some angel of death and a darkness fell upon his senses but ere the darkness grew complete he saw that namirrha had drained his own goblet then with unspeakable agonies it seemed that the emperor died and his soul float free and again he saw the chamber though with bodiless eyes and discarnate he stood in the saffroncrimson light with his body lying as if dead on the floor beside him and near it the prone body of namirrha and the two fallen goblets standing thus he beheld a strange thing for anon his own body stirred and arose while that of the necromancer remained still as death and zotulla looked at his own lineaments and his figure in its short cloak of azure samite sewn with black pearls and balasrubies and the body lived before him though with eyes that held a darker fire and a deeper evil than was their wont then without corporeal ears zotulla heard the figure speak and the voice was the strong arrogant voice of namirrha saying follow me o houseless phantom and do in all things as i enjoin thee like an unseen shadow zotulla followed the wizard and the twain went downward by the stairs to the great banquet hall they came to the altar of thasaidon and the mailed image with the seven horseskull lamps burning before it as formerly upon the altar zotullas beloved leman obexah who alone of all women had power to stir his sated heart was lying bound with thongs at thasaidons feet but the hall beyond was deserted and nothing remained of that saturnalia of doom except the fruit of the treading which had flowed together in dark pools among the columns namirrha using the emperors body in all ways for his own paused before the dark eidolon and he said to the spirit of zotulla be imprisoned in this image without power to free thyself or to stir in any wise being wholly obedient to the will of the necromancer the soul of zotulla was embodied in the statue and he felt its cold gigantic armor about him like a straight sarcophagus and he peered forth immovably from the bleak eyes that were overhung by its carven helmet gazing thus he beheld the change that had come on his own body through the sorcerous possession of namirrha for below the short azure cloak the legs had turned suddenly to the hind legs of a black stallion with hooves that glowed redly as if heated by infernal fires and even as zotulla watched this prodigy the hooves glowed white and incandescent and fumes mounted from the floor beneath them then on the black altar the hybrid abomination came pacing haughtily toward obexah and smoking footprints appeared behind it as it came pausing beside the girl who lay supine and helpless regarding it with eyes that were pools of frozen horror it raised one glowing hoof and set the hoof on her naked bosom between the small breastcups of golden filigree begemmed with rubies and the girl screamed beneath that atrocious treading as the soul of one newly damned might scream in hell and the hoof glared with intolerable brilliance as if freshly plucked from a furnace wherein the weapons of demons were forged at that moment in the cowed and crushed and sodden shade of the emperor zotulla closelocked within the adamantine image there awoke the manhood that had slumbered unaroused before the ruining of his empire and the trampling of his retinue immediately a great abhorrence and a high wrath were alive in his soul and mightily he longed for his own right arm to serve him and a sword in his right hand then it seemed that a voice spoke within him chill and bleak and awful and as if uttered inwardly by the statue itself and the voice said i am thasaidon lord of the seven hells beneath the earth and the hells of mans heart above the earth which are seven times seven for the moment o zotulla my power is become thine for the sake of a mutual vengeance be one in all ways with the statue that has my likeness even as the soul is one with the flesh behold there is a mace of adamant in thy right hand lift up the mace and smite zotulla was aware of a great power within him and giant thews about him that thrilled with the power and responded agilely to his will he felt in his mailed right hand the haft of the huge spikyheaded mace and though the mace was beyond the lifting of any man in mortal flesh it seemed no more than a goodly weight to zotulla then rearing he mace like a warrior in battle he struck down with one crashing blow the impious thing that wore his own rightful flesh united with the legs and hooves of a demon courser and the thing crumpled swiftly down and lay with the brain spreading pulpily from its shattered skull on the shining jet and the legs twitched a little and then grew still and the hooves glowed from a fiery blinding white to the redness of redhot iron cooling slowly for a space there was no sound other than the shrill screaming of the girl obexah mad with pain and the terror of those prodigies which she had beheld then in the soul of zotulla grown sick with that screaming the chill awful voice of thasaidon spoke again go free for there is nothing more for thee to do so the spirit of zotulla passed from the image of thasaidon and found in the wide air the freedom of nothingness and oblivion but the end was not yet for namirrha whose mad arrogant soul had been loosened from zotullas body by the blow and had returned darkly not in the manner planned by the magician to its own body lying in the room of accursed rites and forbidden transmigrations there namirrha woke anon with a dire confusion in his mind and a partial forgetfulness for the curse of thasaidon was upon him now because of his blasphemies nothing was clear in his thought except a malign exorbitant longing for revenge but the reason thereof and the object were as doubtful shadows and still prompted by that obscure animus he arose and girding to his side an enchanted sword with runic sapphires and opals in the hilt he descended the stairs and came again to the altar of thasaidon where the mailed statue stood as impassive as before with the poised mace in its immovable right hand and below it on the altar the double sacrifice a veil of weird darkness was upon the senses of namirrha and he saw not the stallionlegged horror that lay dead with slowly blackening hooves and he heard not the moaning of the girl obexah who still lived beside it but his eyes were drawn by the diamond mirror that was upheld in the claws of black iron basilisks beyond the altar and going to the mirror he saw therein a face that he knew no longer for his own and because his eyes were shadowed and his brain filled with the shifting webs of delusion he took the face for that of the emperor zotulla insatiable as hells own flame his old hatred rose within him and he drew the enchanted sword and began to hew therewith at the reflection sometimes because of the curse laid upon him and the impious transmigration which he had performed he thought himself zotulla warring with the necromancer and again in the shiftings of his madness he was namirrha smiting at the emperor and then without name he fought a nameless foe and soon the sorcerous blade though tempered with formidable spells was broken close to the hilt and namirrha beheld the image still unharmed then howling aloud the halfforgotten runes of a most tremendous curse made invalid through his own forgettings he hammered still with the heavy swordhilt on the mirror till the runic sapphires and opals cracked in the hilt and fell away at his feet in little fragments obexah dying on the altar saw namirrha battling with his image and the spectacle moved her to mad laughter like the pealing of bells of ruined crystal and above her laughter and above the cursings of namirrha there came anon like the rumbling of a swiftdriven storm the thunder made by the macrocosmic stallions of thamogorgos returning gulfward through xylac over ummaos to trample down the one house that they had spared aforetime
