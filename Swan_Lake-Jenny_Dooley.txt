chapter one prince zigfried once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a prince his name was zigfried and he was very unhappy his father the king had died and since then everyone in the palace had forgotten how to smile without his father zigfried thought he would never feel happy again every day zigfried sat at the window in his room in the palace looking at the birds in the trees how can they sing and fly so free they must not feel like me his servant ozlowe tried to make the prince smile by telling him jokes or doing funny tricks for him but the prince would not smile i know you love me ozlowe but i cannot smile my heart is broken ozlowe would not give up lets go for a walk good prince maybe we can find something outside which will make you happy if you wish ozlowe but i dont think theres anything that can make me happy ozlowe put on his hunting cap and he took his crossbow he enjoyed hunting and he hoped to catch a bird or a rabbit for the prince they walked through the forest until they came to a lake on the lake there was a beautiful white swan it had a gold crown on its head that only princesses wear the swan swam towards the prince and looked into his eyes the swans eyes were so sad that prince zigfried felt sorry for it here is a creature which feels worse than i do but why do you have that crown on your head the swan opened its wings and cried out i think its trying to tell me something ozlowe had his crossbow in his hands he wanted to shoot the swan ill get that swan for you prince just one minute ozlowe no before ozlowe could shoot a magic owl flew from a tree and took ozlowes cap off his head this cast a spell on him and he was turned to stone the prince did not understand ozlowe what has happened to you speak to me he looked back at the lake the swan was gone everything i do goes wrong this must have happened because of me the prince returned to the palace sadder than before thinking to himself if only ozlowe were here there is nothing good in my life any more zigfrieds mother came to see him that night she had something important to say zigfried soon you will be eighteen years old you must take your fathers place as king i am having a ball on your birthday so that you may choose a wife and i will invite all the princesses from the other kingdoms but i do not wish to marry mother i do not love anyone you will learn to love someone first you must stop thinking of yourself if this will make you happy ill do it mother it is not for my happiness that i am doing this it is for yours and all the other people in this land you see love

know who it would be chapter two the beautiful princess on the morning of the royal ball everybody was very busy in the palace the queens maids were preparing the queens dress the servants cleaned the floors and windows and the cooks were cooking enough food for a thousand people the prince looked handsome in his red outfit but he was still not happy he left the palace to be alone and think and went to the stone statue of ozlowe its my birthday today ozlowe im eighteen that means that i must marry someone and become king the problem is i dont want to get married i dont love anyone there was a quiet splashing in the lake zigfried looked and saw the beautiful swan with the gold crown there it is the beautiful swan has come back he went closer to the water to look at it its eyes had the same sadness in them but it was happy to see zigfried and it swam close to him zigfried looked into its eyes and talked to it i think you understand me i think you know how people feel a tear fell from the swans eye dont cry you should be happy that you are a swan you will never have to marry someone you do not love you will never feel sad when someone dies the swan made a loud cry its wings moved back and forth at its sides suddenly an owl appeared as if from nowhere and flew at zigfrieds head but it missed the owl flew off and the swan began to swim away wait dont leave zigfried ran round the edge of the lake following the swan he had to run fast to see where it went soon he was in a part of the forest he did not know tall trees blocked out the sun it was very dark the swan swam to an ugly old castle when it left the water something magical happened the swan turned into a beautiful princess she had long blonde hair and she wore a long white dress the crown was still on her head zigfried ran to where she stood at the castle door wait where are you going the princess stopped but she did not look at him look at me please my name is prince zigfried and i want to know who you are the princess turned to look at the prince she had the same dark sad eyes of the swan my name is princess odile but why were you a swan why do you look so sad an evil wizard called rocford cast

wizards evil daughter was behind a tree when she saw odile talking to the prince she was jealous she wanted to go to the ball and what was more she wanted to marry the prince she didnt like odile because she was so beautiful and kind but the wizard loved her so odet couldnt do anything to hurt her until now odet went to the wizards room but he was not there the room looked like a museum there was an egyptian statue against one wall and large aquariums full of strange fish on a table stood many different coloured bottles odet opened one of the bottles smoke came out of it it smelled of burning wood the magic owl flew into the open window unseen by odet and changed back into the wizard do you like the smell oh father you scared me you wouldnt be afraid if you were not in my room when i wasnt here i know father but i have something very important to tell you its about odile the wizard opened his eyes wide he was a tall man with a long white beard and long white hair he wore a big black hat and a long black robe with stars on it tell me what you know first you must promise to do something for me what is it i cant tell you now first i must tell you about odile then i will ask for something will you do it tell me before i turn you into a frog the wizard was very much in love with odile he would change his daughter into a frog because he wanted to know about odile today i saw odile talking to prince zigfried the prince asked odile to go to the royal ball tonight he wants to marry her and free her from your evil powers the wizard turned in a circle and pointed his hand at the floor fire came from his fingers and hit the floor the whole castle shook i should have destroyed the prince today when i saw him with odile you saw him too yes at the lake i attacked him but i was only an owl odile knew this and she left him he must have followed her here oh yes father and he is so handsome you should see his face silence the wizard turned himself into a large stone ball he threw himself against the walls making the castle shake again alone in her room odile felt the castle shaking she hid her head under a pillow on her bed she hated it when the wizard got angry the wizard changed back into himself in his room now father you promised youd do something for me i never promised you anything oh father i want to go to the ball i want to marry the prince the wizard angrily raised his hand again then he thought of something slowly he lowered his hand you would like to go to the ball wouldnt you oh yes father and you would like to marry the prince yes i would then you will and he will think that you are odile oh father what a wonderful idea she put her arms around him his body was cold as stone and his eyes were filled with fire chapter four a bird in a cage odiles room was at the top of the castle tower rocford had put her there after he had taken her from her parents she was the most beautiful princess in the land and her parents were good and kind rocford had asked her father if he could marry odile we must ask my daughter what she thinks odile was brought to the wizard odile this man lias asked to marry you he says he is very rich and that he will make you the happiest princess in the world what do you think odile looked into the wizards eyes do you promise to love me forever with all your heart will you love me so much that you will not think of what you want even if it hurts you to do this the look in her eyes and her questions made rocford uncomfortable why do you ask me such questions i told your father i could give you everything you could want the princess smiled and turned her head away im sorry father but i will not marry this man he does not know what love is they did not know then that he was a wizard rocford had looked like a prince he wore beautiful clothes and looked very handsome but when he heard what odile said to her father his face began to change it became old and ugly his clothes changed from blue to black you do not know what you are saying you silly girl i do not have to ask for what i want i am a wizard and i can do anything i please he waved his hands through the air and a fire started in the castle where the princess and her parents lived he had turned odile into a small bird in a cage and carried her to his castle where he locked her up in a tower the entire kingdom was destroyed by this fire and her parents were killed there was a real bird in a cage in odiles room at the wizards castle the wizard had put it there so that odile would remember the power he had over her he only let her leave the castle as a swan because he did not want other men to fall in love with her at night she stayed in her room talking to the bird who was her only friend she called the bird patrice because it was her mothers name oh patrice what should i do the ball is tonight and i am a prisoner here i believe the prince loves me with all his heart i saw it in his eyes he loved me even as a swan the bird began moving its wings wildly it always knew when something horrible was about to happen what is it patrice what are you afraid of odile heard keys in her locked door she put the bird and its cage behind a curtain because she did not want the bird to see what was about to happen chapter five odets new voice the wizard entered odiles room with odet odet was the same age and height as odile but she had dark hair however she wasnt as beautiful as odile and this made her very jealous the wizard spoke first sit down odile i would like to ask you something the wizard waved his hand and a large and very comfortable pink chair appeared odile sat on it odet tells me that you would like to go to the ball tonight is that true yes if i let you go to this ball will you promise to marry me i have told you i will only marry a man who loves me and who i love but you know i love you if you loved me you wouldnt keep me locked up in this castle you wouldnt have killed my parents you are a fool would you like to marry the prince is that it he loves me more than you do how do you know he left you here with me that shows you that you are wrong he is afraid of me he cant love you very much if he is afraid he did it for me i asked him to do it and did you tell him that you would go to the ball yes then you lied you knew i would not let you go i said i would try he knows that if i do not go it is not because i do not want to and how does he know this you do not have to cast a spell on someone or make them rich to love you you understand it by looking in their eyes you know it by the way they speak and act you are a dreamer and you have no heart silence the wizard raised both his arms and the castle shook the curtain on the wall fell down and the wizard saw the bird in the cage ah the bird if you hurt that bird you are worse than i thought the bird flew wildly as the wizard walked towards it he picked up the cage now why would i hurt this bird it is like me it has no heart it does not feel anything when i do this the wizard pointed his fingers at odet she changed into odile she had the same blonde hair the same eyes she was even wearing the crown odile stood up tonight odet will go to the ball as you odile zigfried will marry her and we will see what true love is your hearts are nothing compared to my magic you may look like me odet but there is something missing from your eyes the prince will know this he does not love you odile he only loves what you look like i almost forgot the wizard waved his hand odet say something when odet spoke she sounded just like odile hello prince zigfried its me odile i love you odile ran to her bed crying she fell on the bed and covered her face rocford laughed loudly he took odet out of the room and locked the door behind him when odile looked up only the bird was with her it too had a tear in its eye chapter six the ball the ballroom in the palace was very big there were hundreds of men and women dancing in the centre along the walls there were long white tables they had candles and all kinds of food on them at the top of the room on a stage were three large chairs the queen sat in the middle and zigfried sat on her right the chair on the left was empty it was for the princess who would be zigfrieds wife which princess do you like the best the one i will choose is not here yet but you have met them all surely there is another one mother and she is a surprise you will see every time a new guest arrived the ballroom doors were opened and everyone fell silent a servant called out the guests names as they entered each time this happened the prince became very excited but odile never arrived it was almost twelve oclock zigfried had promised his mother that he would choose a bride by midnight the two large doors opened please let it be her it was a giant cake with candles on it everyone in the room began to sing happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday prince zigfried happy birthday to you zigfried and his mother walked towards the enormous cake now make a wish and blow out all the candles no one heard him but zigfried said i wish odile would come and be my wife he blew out the candles and everyone cheered the doors opened princess odile it was odet dressed as odile she wore a long white dress and long white gloves the gold crown was shining on her head she held a bouquet of flowers in her arms she smiled as she walked towards the queen and prince she gave the queen the flowers then bowed mother this is odile the princess i met in the forest i knew your father im sorry i thought everyone had died in the fire you must be the only one who lived odet did not know what the wizard had done to odiles parents she stopped smiling oh mother her story is too sad to tell let us enjoy this evening together we are her family now do you mean you wish to choose princess odile as your wife yes mother i do the queen raised her hand for the men to sound their horns everyone was quiet ladies and gentlemen i would like to announce the engagement of my son prince zigfried after tonight he will be the king of this land and he has chosen princess odile to be his wife zigfried and odet danced together everyone around them clapped their hands odile i knew you would come how did you escape from the evil wizard i i ran away and he did not see you the prince stepped back so he could look at odets eyes his heart sank when he saw those eyes they looked like odiles but there was something missing in them he didnt love her odet began to lie about her escape from rocford i saw a falling star in the sky i closed my eyes and made a wish when i opened them i was in a carriage pulled by horses thats how i got here it must mean we were meant to be together oh zigfried tell me you will love me forever he held her close because he did not want to look in her eyes he knew he had loved odile when he had first seen her now he didnt know he thought there must be something wrong with him odile i promise always to love you and never leave you chapter seven odile escapes odile stood at her window looking at the stars and the moon there were bars at the window but they were not necessary her window was high above a river if she tried to escape she would almost certainly fall into the water and die her bird patrice chirped behind her she turned to look at the bird oh patrice i understand you i am in a cage too but you must want to get out im sorry i never thought of it i have kept you locked up just like rocford has kept me locked up because you are my only friend in this world i wanted you to stay but you must be free to fly odile took the bird cage to the window she opened its small door fly away patrice and be free find another bird to love it is the only thing worth living for the bird flew from its cage through the bars on the window into the night odile closed her eyes she imagined that she was patrice flying over the forest and lake she flew into the garden of the palace she landed on a palace wall and looked into a large window at the ball beautiful women in beautiful dresses were dancing with handsome men she saw the prince with his mother and the cake with the eighteen candles then odet entered the room dressed as her when she opened her eyes she found to her amazement that she was outside the palace window when she had set the bird free she had also set herself free because she believed with all her heart in love and freedom everything that she imagined came true the wizard knew that odile hated him and it made him angry he wanted to make her love him so he decided to have a ball for her using his magic he made a large room full of people dancing he changed himself into a young man again the same young man he was when he had taken odile from her parents he went to her room with flowers he knocked on her door odile i have a surprise for you there was no answer he couldnt even hear the bird odile its me rocford ive decided to take you to a ball when there was no answer and he heard nothing he became angry he made the door disappear his anger turned him back into the old evil man that he was he saw the bird cage on the floor the room was empty roaring with anger he turned himself into an owl and flew from the castle towards the palace chapter eight the prince chases the princess when odile saw odet dancing with zigfried she ran to the palace entrance the guards stopped her who are you my name is princess odile the prince is expecting me no princess odile has already entered you must be lying please you must believe me that is not princess odile she is lying but the guards wouldnt believe her she ran back to the window and knocked hard on it everyone turned to look at her the prince could not believe what he saw two odiles he looked at odet what is going on i dont know the evil wizard must have changed someone to look like me odile kept knocking on the window she was crying zigfried could now see that she had the same eyes as the swan rocford flew down next to odile as the owl he held her in both arms did you think you could escape from me the prince ran from the ballroom he saw odile fighting with the wizard take your hands off her rocford rocford let go of odiles arms i should have killed you that day at the lake but i will be happy to do it now the wizard lifted up his hand odile stopped him wait dont do it ill go with you ill do what you want just dont hurt him odile what are you saying dont leave me again she could not look at him because if she did she would not want to leave im doing this for us if you die i will die with you it is better for us to live and hope to be together one day odet ran out of the palace she still looked like odile who is this then it is odet the wizards evil daughter she only looks like me look into her eyes and you will know i knew it odet also had magical powers she changed herself back to her real body it is too late zigfried you promised to marry me and love me forever if you do not keep this promise you will never be able to keep another odet changed herself into a bird the wizard was an owl and odile was a swan they flew together away from the palace back to rocfords castle the queen and many others came out of the palace to see what had happened zigfried went after odile guards bring me my horse zigfried where are you going where is the princess she has gone away mother and i must find her the guards brought the prince a beautiful white horse and gave him his sword do you want us to call the men your highness no this is something i must do alone zigfried do not leave the palace alone if something happens to you we will be without a king it is your duty to stay with me mother being a king means nothing if you are not with the woman you love i would rather die than leave odile with that evil wizard the prince spurred his horse on and rode quickly towards the dark forest chapter nine the fir rocford odet and odile flew onto the tower of the castle they changed back into people odile was weeping loudly the wizard just laughed his evil laugh and said odile now i know how to get you to marry me if you dont i will kill the prince and you will watch him die father you do not have to kill zigfried he has already promised to marry me he cannot break such a promise neither of you has a heart how can you ever expect to be happy if you know that someone does not love you but you will see love is stronger than spells you will never succeed in getting what you want at this they saw zigfried coming towards the castle on his horse we shall see which is stronger love or hate the wizard made a wall of fire appear in front of zigfried zigfried could only think of odile he rode right through the fire without getting hurt odile said triumphantly you see i am right as she ran from the wizard he tried to block her way by making the doors close in front of her but odile just ran faster and escaped through each one the prince saw odile on the steps going up to the tower he took her in his arms odile i will never let you leave me again say that you will stay with me forever i

not fight him zigfried if he kills you i will lose everyone ive ever loved you are right odile zigfried is only a boy he is no match for me now come back to your room and let this little boy go home to his mother rocford your words will not discourage me i would kill you now but i will give you one last chance to live let us leave in peace and never come near odile again you really are a little boy if you think that you can harm me rocford raised his hand and odile flew through the air to where odet stood zigfried ran at rocford and tried to stab him with his sword rocford put his hand up the sword touched it and turned into water without a sword zigfried attacked the wizard rocford threw zigfried down the steps he picked up a stick and turned it into a sword he pointed it at zigfrieds heart as he lay on the ground rocford dont say you will marry me odile and i will let him live dont do it odile dont make yourself more unhappy just for me the wizard prodded zigfried with the sword and you have promised to marry me zigfried you said you would always love me i said that because i thought you were odile i would never marry you i would rather die zigfried took the wizards sword and pushed it deep into his own heart zigfried no something strange began to happen the castle began to shake large stones fell from the ceiling and rocford and odet were killed odile ran to zigfried she took the sword out of his heart and pulled his body out of the castle before it fell to the ground chapter ten the wedding dawn broke in the forest but no birds sang the castle was nothing but a pile of stones the only sound was odile crying over zigfrieds body oh zigfried my one true love why did you have to die at this the prince opened first one eye then the other youre alive oh zigfried she hugged the prince and cried tears of happiness i love you odile i knew that my love was stronger than that sword nothing is more powerful than a persons heart tell me you will marry me and i will love you forever of course i will zigfried you have made my dreams come true we were right to believe in love they left the old castle together on zigfrieds horse when they came to the lake near the palace they saw ozlowe he was not a statue anymore he stood scratching his head all of the wizards spells had been broken when he died the prince was full of joy ozlowe master zigfried i dont know what happened i was standing here about to shoot a swan that will teach you never to kill anything this is princess odile she was the swan you tried to kill ozlowe was very confused prince zigfried i think

were invited to the wedding it took place at the edge of the lake where zigfried had first seen odile odile wore a beautiful long wedding dress zigfrieds mother walked towards them zigfried i want you to know that what you did was right though i asked you to stay at the palace you left for a better reason you should always follow your heart especially when it is full of love you father would be very proud of you zigfrieds mother was so happy she had tears in her eyes the prince took odiles hands they stood together in front of the lake the queen put the kings crown on zigfrieds head the priest spoke to the new king and queen marriage is a wonderful thing and what makes this marriage special is that the love you have for each other will affect everyone in this land through your happiness we will become happy through your love for each other we will love each other is this what you want is your love strong enough to lead a land of people who need joy in their lives odile
