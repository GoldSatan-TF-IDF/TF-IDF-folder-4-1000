the tombspawn clark ashton smith evening had come from the desert into faraad bringing the last stragglers of caravans in a wineshop near the northern gate many traveling merchants from outer lands parched and weary were refreshing themselves with the famed vintages of yoros to divert them from their fatigue a storyteller spoke amid the clinking of the winecups great was ossaru being both king and wizard he ruled over half the continent of zothique his armies were like the rolling sands blown by the simoom he commanded the genii of storm and of darkness he called down the spirits of the sun men knew his wizardry as the green cedars know the blasting of levin half immortal he lived from age to age waxing in his wisdom and power till the end thasaidon black god of evil prospered his every spell and enterprise and during his latter years he was companioned by the monster nioth korghai who came down to earth from an alien world riding a firemaned comet ossaru by his skill in astrology had foreseen the coming of nioth korghai alone he went forth into the desert to await the monster in many lands people saw the falling of the comet like a sun that came down by night upon the waste but only king ossaru beheld the arrival of nioth korghai he returned in the black moonless hours before dawn when all men slept bringing the strange monster to his palace and housing him in a vault beneath the throneroom which he had prepared for nioth korghais abode dwelling always thereafter in the vault the monster remained unknown and unbeheld it was said that he gave advice to ossaru and instructed him in the lore of the outer planets at certain periods of the stars women and young warriors were sent down as a sacrifice to nioth korghai and these returned never to give account of that which they had seen none could surmise his aspect but all who entered the palace heard ever in the vault beneath a muffled noise as of slow beaten drums and a regurgitation such as would be made by an underground fountain and sometimes men heard an evil cackling as of a mad cockatrice for many years king ossaru was served by nioth korghai and gave service to the monster in return then nioth korghai sickened with a strange malady and men heard no more the cackling in the sunken vault and the noises of drums and fountainmouths grew fainter and ceased the spells of the wizard king were powerless to avert his death but when the monster had died ossaru surrounded his body with a double zone of enchantment circle by circle and closed the vault and later when ossaru died the vault was opened from above and the kings mummy was lowered therein by his slaves to repose forever beside that which remained of nioth korghai cycles have gone by since then and ossaru is but a name on the lips of storytellers lost now is the palace wherein he dwelt and the city thereabout some saying that it stood in yoros and some in the empire of cincor where yethlyreom was later built by the nimboth dynasty and this alone is certain that somewhere still in the sealed tomb the alien monster abides in death together with king ossaru and about them still is the inner circle of ossarus enchantment rendering their bodies incorruptible throughout all the decay of cities and kingdoms and around this is another circle guarding against all intrusion since he who enters there by the tombs door will die instantly and will putrefy in the moment of death falling to dusty corruption ere he strike the ground such is the legend of ossaru and nioth korghai no man has ever found their tomb but the wizard namirrha prophesying darkly foretold many ages ago that certain travelers passing through the desert would some day come upon it unaware and he said that these travelers descending into the tomb by another way than the door would behold a strange prodigy and he spoke not concerning the nature of the prodigy but said only that nioth korghai being a creature from some far world was obedient to alien laws in death as in life and of that which namirrha meant no man has yet guessed the secret the brothers milab and marabac who were jewelmerchants from ustaim had listened raptly to the storyteller now truly this is a strange tale said milab however as all men know there were great wizards in the olden days workers of deep enchantment and wonder and also there were true prophets and the sands of zothique are full of lost tombs and cities it is a good story said marabac but it lacks an ending prithee teller of tales canst tell us no more than this was there no treasure of precious metals and jewels entombed with the monster and the king i have seen sepulchers where the dead were walled with gold ingots arid sarcophagi that poured forth rubies like the gouted blood of vampires i relate the legend as my fathers told it affirmed the storyteller they who are destined to find the tomb must tell the rest if haply they return from the finding milab and marabac had traded their store of uncut jewels of carver talismans and small jasper and carnelian idols making a good profit in faraad now laden with rosy and purpleblack pearls from the southern gulfs and the black sapphires and winy garnets of yoros they were returning northward toward tasuun with a company of other merchants on the long circuitous journey to ustaim by the orient sea the way had led through a dying land now as the caravan approached the borders of yoros the desert began to assume a profounder desolation the hills were dark and lean like recumbent mummies of giants dry waterways ran down to lakebottoms leprous with salt billows of grey sand were driven high on the crumbling cliffs where gentle waters had once rippled columns of dust arose and went by like fugitive phantoms over all the sun was a monstrous ember in a charred heaven into this waste which was seemingly unpeopled and void of life the caravan went warily urging their camels to a swift trot in the narrow deepwalled ravines the merchants made ready their spears and claymores and scanned the barren ridges with anxious eyes for here in hidden caves there lurked a wild and halfbestial people known as the ghorii akin to the ghouls and jackals they were eaters of carrion and also they were anthropophagi subsisting by preference on the bodies of travelers and drinking their blood in lieu of water or wine they were dreaded by all who had occasion to journey between yoros and tasuun the sun climbed to its meridian searching with ruthless beams the nethermost umbrage of the strait deep defiles the fine ashlight sand was no longer stirred by any puff of wind no lizards lifted or scurried on the rocks now the road ran downward following the course of some olden stream between acclivitous banks here in lieu of former pools there were pits of sand dammed up by riffles or boulders in which the camels floundered kneedeep and here without the least warning in a turn of the sinuous bed the gully swarmed and seethed with the hideous earthbrown bodies of the ghorii who appeared instantaneously on all sides leaping wolfishly from the rocky slopes or flinging themselves like panthers from the high ledges these ghoulish apparitions were unspeakably ferocious and agile uttering no sound other than a sort of hoarse coughing and spitting and armed only with their double rows of pointed teeth and their sickle like talons they poured over the caravan in a climbing wave it seemed that there were scores of them to each man and camel several of the dromedaries were thrown to earth at once with the ghorii gnawing their legs and haunches and chines or hanging dogwise at their throats they and their drivers were buried from sight by the ravenous monsters who began to devour them immediately boxes of jewels and bales of rich fabrics were torn open in the melee jasper and onyx idols were strewn ignominiously in the dust pearls and rubies unheeded lay weltering in puddled blood for these things were of no value to the ghorii milab and marabac as it happened were riding at the rear they had lagged behind somewhat against their will since the camel ridden by milab had gone lame from a stonebruise and thus by good fortune they evaded the ghoulish onset pausing aghast they beheld the fate of their companions whose resistance was overcome with horrible quickness the ghorii however did not perceive milab and marabac being wholly intent on devouring the camels and merchants they had dragged down as well as those members of their own band that were wounded by the swords and lances of the travelers the two brothers levelling their spears would have ridden forward to perish bravely and uselessly with their fellows but terrified by the hideous tumult by the odor of blood and the hyenalike scent of the ghorii their dromedaries balked and bolted carrying them back along the route into yoros during this unpremeditated flight they soon saw another band of the ghorii who had appeared far off on the southern slopes and were running to intercept them to avoid this new peril milab and marabac turned their camels into a side ravine traveling slowly because of the lameness of milabs dromedary and thinking to find the swift ghorii on their heels at any moment they went eastward for many miles with the sun lowering behind them and came at midafternoon to the low and rainless watershed of that immemorial region here they looked out over a sunken plain wrinkled and eroded where the white walls and domes of some inappelable city gleamed it appeared to milab and marabac that the city was only a few leagues away deeming they had sighted some hidden town of the outer sands and hopeful now of escaping their pursuers they began the descent of the long slope toward the plain for two days on a powdery terrain that was like the bituminous dust of mummies they traveled toward the everreceding domes that had seemed so near their plight became desperate for between them they possessed only a handful of dried apricots and a waterbag that was threefourths empty their provisions together with their stock of jewels and carvings had been lost with the packdromedaries of the caravan apparently there was no pursuit from the ghorii but about them there gathered the red demons of thirst the black demons of hunger on the second morning milabs camel refused to rise and would not respond either to the cursing of its master or the prodding of his spear thereafter the two shared the remaining camel riding together or by turns often they lost sight of the gleaming city which appeared and disappeared like a mirage but an hour before sunset on the second day they followed the farthrown shadows of broken obelisks and crumbling watchtowers into the olden streets the place had once been a metropolis but now many of its lordly mansions were scattered shards or heaps of downfallen blocks great dunes of sand had poured in through proud triumphal arches had filled the pavements and courtyards lurching with exhaustion and sick at heart with the failure of their hope milab and marabac went on searching everywhere for some well or cistern that the long desert years had haply spared in the citys heart where the walls of temples and lofty buildings of state still served as a barrier to the engulfing sand they found the ruins of an old aqueduct leading to cisterns dry as furnaces there were dustchoked fountains in the market places but nowhere was there anything to betoken the presence of water wandering hopelessly on they came to the ruins of a huge edifice which it appeared had been the palace of some forgotten monarch the mighty walls defying the erosion of ages were still extant the portals guarded on either hand by green brazen images of mythic heroes still frowned with unbroken arches mounting the marble steps the jewelers entered a vast roofless hall where cyclopean columns towered as if to bear up the desert sky the broad pavement flags were mounded with debris of arches and architraves and pilasters at the halls far extreme there was a dais of blackveined marble on which presumably a royal throne had once reared nearing the dais milab and marabac both heard a low and indistinct gurgling as of some hidden stream or fountain that appeared to rise from underground depths below the palace pavement eagerly trying to locate the source of the sound they climbed the dais here a huge block had fallen from the wall above perhaps recently and the marble had cracked beneath its weight and a portion of the dais had broken through into some underlying vault leaving a dark and jagged aperture it was from this opening that the waterlike regurgitation rose incessant and regular as the beating of a pulse the jewelers leaned above the pit and peered down into webby darkness shot with a doubtful glimmering that came from an indiscernible source they could see nothing a dank and musty odor touched their nostrils like the breath of some longsealed reservoir it seemed to them that the steady fountainlike noise was only a few feet below in the shadows a little to one side of the opening neither of them could determine the depth of the vault after a brief consultation they returned to their camel which was waiting stolidly at the palace entrance and removing the camels harness they knotted the long reins and leather bodybands into a single thong that would serve them in lieu of rope going back to the dais they secured one end of this thong to the fallen block and lowered the other into the dark pit milab descended hand over hand into the depths for ten or twelve feet before his toes encountered a solid surface stiff gripping the thong cautiously he found himself on a level floor of stone the day was fast waning beyond the palace walls but a wan glimmer was afforded by the hole in the pavement above and the outlines of a halfopen door sagging at a ruinous angle were revealed at one side by the feeble twilight that entered the vault from unknown crypts or stairs beyond while marabac came nimbly down to join him milab peered about for the source of the waterlike noise before him in the undetermined shadows he discerned the dim and puzzling contours of an object that he could liken only to some enormous clepsydra or fountain surrounded with grotesque carvings the light seemed to fail momentary unable to decide the nature of the object and having neither torch nor candle he tore a strip from the hem of his hempen burnoose and lit the slowburning cloth and held it aloft at arms length before him by the dull smouldering luminance thus obtained the jewelers beheld more clearly the thing that bulked prodigious and monstrous rearing above them from the fragmentlittered floor to the shadowy roof the thing was like some blasphemous dream of a mad devil its main portion or body was urnlike in form and was pedestalled on a queerly tilted block of stone at the vaults center it was palish and pitted with innumerable small apertures from its bosom and flattened base many armlike and leglike projections trailed in swollen nightmare segments to the ground and two other members sloping tautly reached down like roots into an open and seemingly empty sarcophagus of gilded metal graven with weird archaic ciphers that stood beside the block the urnshaped torso was endowed with two heads one of these heads was beaked like a cuttlefish and was lined with long oblique slits where the eyes should have been the other head in cose juxtaposition on the narrow shoulders was that of an aged man dark and regal and terrible whose burning eyes were like balasrubies and whose grizzled beard had grown to the length of jungle moss on the loathsomely porous trunk this trunk on the side below the human head displayed a faint outline as of ribs and some of the members ended in human hands and feet or possessed anthropomorphic jointings through heads limbs and body there ran recurrently the mysterious noise of regurgitation that had drawn milab and marabac to enter the vault at each repetition of the sound a slimy dew exuded from the monstrous pores and rilled sluggishly down in endless drops the jewelers were held speechless and immobile by a clammy terror unable to avert their gaze they met the baleful eyes of the human head glaring upon them from its unearthly eminence then as the hempen strip in milabs fingers burned slowly away and failed to a red smoulder and darkness gathered again in the vault they saw the blind slits in the other head open gradually pouring forth a hot yellow intolerably flaming light as they expanded to immense round orbits at the same time they heard a singular drumlike throbbing as if the heart of the huge monster had become audible they knew only that a strange horror not of earth or but partially of earth was before them the sight deprived them of thought and memory least of all did they remember the storyteller in faraad and the tale he had told concerning the hidden tomb of ossaru and nioth korghai and the prophecy of the tombs finding by those who should come to it unaware swiftly with a dreadful stretching and straightening the monster lifted its foremost members ending in the brown shrivelled hands of an old man and reached out toward the jewelers from the cuttlefish beak there issued a shrill demonian cackling from the mouth of the kingly greybeard head a sonorous voice began to utter words of solemn cadence like some enchanters rune in a tongue unknown to milab and marabac they recoiled before the abhorrently groping hands in a frenzy of fear and panic by the streaming light of its incandescent orbs they saw the anomaly rise and lumber forward from its stone seat walking clumsily and uncertainly on its illassorted members there was a trampling of elephantine padsand a stumbling of human feet inadequate to bear up their share of the blasphemous hulk the two stiffly sloping tentacles were withdrawn from the gold sarcophagus their ends muffled by empty jewelsewn cloths of a precious purple such as would be used for the winding of some royal mummy with a ceaseless and insane cackling a malign thundering as of curses that broke to senile quavers the doubleheaded horror leaned toward milab and marabac turning they ran wildly across the roomy vault before them illumined now by the pouring rays from the monsters orbits they saw the halfopen door of somber metal whose bolts and hinges had rusted away permitting it to sag inward the door was of cyclopean height and breadth as if designed for beings huger than man beyond it were the dim reaches of a twilight corridor five paces from the doorway there was a faint red line that followed the chambers conformation on the dusty floor marabac a little ahead of his brother crossed the line as if checked in midair by some invisible wall he faltered and stopped his limbs and body seemed to melt away beneath the burnoose the burnoose itself became tattered as with incalculable age dust floated on the air in a tenuous cloud and there was a momentary gleaming of white bones where his outflung hands had been then the bones too were gone and an empty heap of rags lay rotting on the floor a faint odor as of corruption rose to the nostrils of milab uncomprehending he had checked his own flight for an instant then on his shoulders he felt the grasp of slimy withered hands the cackling and muttering of the heads was like a demon chorus behind him the drumlike beating the noise of rising fountains were loud in his ears with one swiftly dying scream he followed marabac over the red line the enormity that was both man and starborn monster the nameless amalgam of an unearthly resurrection stiff lumbered on and did not pause with the hands of that ossaru who had forgotten his own enchantment it reached for the two piles of empty rags reaching it entered the zone of death and dissolution which ossaru himself had established to guard the vault forever for an instant on the air there was a melting as of misshapen cloud a falling as of light ashes after that the darkness returned and with the darkness silence night settled above that nameless land that forgotten city and with its coming the ghorii who had followed milab and marabac over the desert plain swiftly they slew and ate the camel that waited patiently at the palace entrance later in the old hall of columns they found that opening in the dais through which the jewelers had descended hungrily they gathered about the hole sniffing at the tomb beneath then baffled they went away their keen nostrils telling them that the scent was lost that the tomb was empty either of life or death
