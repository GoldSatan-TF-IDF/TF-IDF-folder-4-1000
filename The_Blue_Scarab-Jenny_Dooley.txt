chapter one cairo monica noticed the gift shop because of the beautiful colours round its door and window she walked through its entrance which had a sign above it on the sign the word cairo was written in bright yellow orange and green colours with small black figures dancing beside it inside it was just as colourful large animals made of paper painted in very bright colours hung from the ceiling the floor had a yellowbrown sand colour to it and the shelves held vases plates boxes musical instruments and jewellery monica had never seen before no one seemed to be in the shop not a salesperson or a customer light arab music came from a stereo monica could not see but she moved with its sound as she looked at all the wonderful objects in the shop she saw a blue stone on a gold necklace which looked interesting drawn in the centre of the stone there was something which looked like a large round beetle with thin legs and thick antennae coming from its head its an egyptian scarab the womans voice surprised then frightened monica she almost dropped the necklace im sorry i didnt know anyone was here its okay my dear i knew you would be here come come the woman took monicas arm and led her behind the sales counter to a small area where there was a round table and two chairs it was dark because cloth the colour of sand with dark patterns hung from the walls and ceilings it was almost closed off from the rest of the shop by a curtain so most of the light came from a few candles set around the room it was like a small cave from somewhere far away sit ive made us some tea black tea the tea of judgement judgement yes the tea leaves tell us about a persons entire life some of us have done things we wish we hadnt some of us havent done things we wish we had some of us are messengers some of us are waiting for the message the woman wore a piece of red cloth tied around her head it hid the colour of her hair her eyes were large and dark they became larger when she talked as monica sat at the table she realised she still had the necklace in her hand this stone is quite beautiful ive never seen anything like it it is lapis lazuli the ancient blue stone used to make statues for the gods it was found in rock and the rock had to be burned and broken to get the lapis lazuli out that shows you how strong it is well im sure its too expensive for me as monica was about to put the necklace on the table the woman closed her hand around monicas to keep the stone there dont let it go now that you have it it may help you see things you never thought were possible but i the woman put her finger on monicas lips so that she couldnt talk sit and listen and i will tell you the story of the blue scarab monica held the necklace in her hand while the woman spoke whether it was the heat of the room the tea or the womans soft voice monica began to fall asleep the scarab is the sacred beetle of the sun god the most important of all the gods as it makes people see things in a different way it is given to a different person every hundred years the person is chosen by the sun god to act as a messenger for the dead they see and understand things on earth that help the gods decide whether the dead have lived good or bad lives those who wear it are sometimes frightened because they are able to see the dead living again but they must keep the scarab as the judgement of so many depends on them monica heard the womans words as she slept she saw herself living thousands of years ago wearing the scarab people were touching her hand as she passed them she was smiling and she felt very peaceful when she opened her eyes she looked at the woman talking to her it looks good on you monica touched the necklace with her fingers it was now round her neck chapter two herbie monicas car had a broken headlight as she drove to a garage to have it fixed the sun came down through the trees along the road making everything seem more alive than usual there was an old man cleaning the ground in front of the garage when monica parked her car he had his back to her so she called to him excuse me do you work here the man did not turn round excuse me monica put her hand on the mans shoulder he turned quickly and monica saw her fathers face frightened she put her hands over her mouth her father had died five years earlier when she was eighteen dad is that you tears came to her eyes and her hands shook the man moved his fingers to his mouth and ears to show her he could not speak or hear hello there it was the voice of a young man monica knew from the university she had forgotten his name its owen remember we met at a parly last winter oh er yes im monica i suppose you ve met herbie he just started working here this morning monica wouldnt look at the man afraid of what she would see he was talking to owen in sign language owen spoke as he made the signs with his fingers of course you can i told you mr burns lets us take our lunch whenever we want as long as youve finished your work okay youre welcome herbie walked away suddenly owen noticed monicas necklace is that a blue scarab youre wearing yes a woman at a shop gave it to me she wouldnt take any money for it it was found in a chest believed to be the chest of osiris an ancient egyptian god i read about it in my class on ancient egypt i study archaeology i think i saw you leaving that class once i had an economics class right after it in the same room its a small world so whats wrong with your car it needs a new headlight oh thats no problem i can fix that in ten minutes why dont you go sit in the office while you wait mr burns will write out your bill in the office next to the garage mr burns sat behind his desk smoking a cigar he was a short bald man but monica didnt know how short until he stood up to shake her hand nathan burns pleased to meet you monica halloway owens fixing my headlight er he said youd write up the papers certainly i will you just have a seat there ill lake care of it in two minutes monica looked out of the office window at owen working on her car his thin young face began to look old and tired it was as if she was looking at a completely different man and it frightened her mr burns voice stopped her thinking how do you spell halloway with two ls or one what oh two h a double l o w a y monica went outside to see owen as he finished his work on her car he looked like he usually did and monica forgot about what she thought she had seen before she shook his hand thank you very much for your help anytime it was nice to see you again when owen walked away monica saw herbie sitting on a chair by the garage door he was eating a sandwich she saw something on his right arm it was a purple birthmark the same kind her father had it is you i knew it she took a few steps towards herbie but she frightened him he got up and went into the garage when she followed him inside she saw that he had gone chapter three tops look if you dont stop this youll get yourself into trouble it was a mistake you saw something which wasnt there yvonne was able to make monica relax they ordered their pizza and began to talk about other things when monica saw owen across the room now dont tell me i dont see him thats the guy who fixed my car owen saw them looking over at him and he waved hello he walked over and sat with them im glad i found you owen this is yvonne pleased to meet you look ive read more about your blue scarab wait a minute wait a minute ive just finished telling her that there is no such thing as ghosts or sun gods or whatever else you want to tell her yvonne let him finish the ancient egyptians believed that osiris the sun gods helper used that stone so that people on earth could help those who had died they thought dead people had to go through a trial in that trial they had to show that the good things they had done on earth were greater than the bad things their actions could help the living improve themselves by teaching them something if the living learn something valuable from the life of someone else who is now dead they can continue living their lives in a better way this is good for the living but also for the dead the gods will see that the dead had lived good lives since they continue influencing the living in a positive way owen that was thousands of years ago wait a minute yvonne lets just try to understand this do you think i could have seen a dead person alive again i dont know about that but i know someone who does and hed like to meet you his name is professor lloyd he taught that class on ancient egypt i told you about would you like to talk to him why not this is mad monica was silent for a few minutes because she was thinking of her father she finally asked owen about herbie whos that old man who is working at the garage whats his name herbie yeah herbie strange but right after you left we couldnt find him he never came back chapter four professor lloyd when owen and monica knocked on professor lloyds door they heard a cat miaowing inside they heard professor lloyds footsteps coming toward the door then they saw him a tall wellbuilt man with glasses he had straight greywhite hair and a soft kind face he welcomed them with a large smile you must be monica hello professor lloyd its a pleasure to meet you the pleasure is mine from what owen tells me you have something which may be more powerful than we know professor lloyds flat was filled with books and cats each wall was covered with shelves of books and there were cats of every different colour sitting on tables walking across the floor or rubbing themselves against monicas legs monica picked up a black one with white paws i love your cats professor the kauri indians of southern peru believe the cat spirit controls our lives they probably know my cats and my life professor lloyd laughed loudly he picked up two of the cats as they walked to the middle of the room where a bright light hung over a square white table with four chairs they sat at the table and the professor asked to see the blue scarab he put a round oneinch eyepiece with black glass over his left eye and he studied the back of the stone ah yes here are the markings the professor was quiet he took the eyepiece away from his eye and looked at monica owen was worried what is it professor it seems that monica has been chosen as a messenger for the gods gods professor you dont really believe in the gods do you what i mean is that this stone is exactly like the one in ancient mythology the myth says that certain people are chosen to wear it thats what the woman said who gave it to me professor what are the markings the professor held the stone up to the light you cant see it clearly without the eyepiece but this marking here is the teeth of a dog the dog watches over the dead and here is the wing of a hawk the hawk cries for the revenge of the dead but here is the sign connecting all the others the round horn of the ram this represents the power of water it can give life to the dead the scarab on the front which represents the sun acts together with water to bring peace to both the living and the dead how do you know all this it is written in ancient egyptian tombs but there is another way to see if we are right whats that we can test the stone to see what kind of power it has chapter five professor lloyds back room professor lloyd took owen and monica to the back room of his flat where all the walls were covered with black curtains in the centre of the room there was a round wooden table with strange black markings on it in the centre there was a circle with the drawing of an eye in the middle of it four spears like rays of sunlight went from the central circle to the edge of the table dividing the table into four equal parts there was another thin circle of numbers and letters that went round the edge of the table between the central circle and the circle at the edge of the table there were four equal spaces in each there was a picture one of a fish one of a snake one of the moon and one of a lotus flower professor lloyd lit candles in the room as owen and monica sat at the table the professor put on a tall black hat with a flat top and a long black robe he was the first to speak we are going to try to call people back from the dead if the stone has the power the myth says it does we may hear voices we know the professor put the scarab over the eye in the centre of the table with the beetle facing up now we must all hold hands and close our eyes do not break the circle by letting go of the hand of the person who is sitting next to you or the ceremony will end relax breathe slowly and do not speak they were all very quiet they heard a soft whistling sound it became louder like the sound of the wind the room became cold and all the candles were blown out then there were voices wild laughing screams of pain then again the sound of the wind one voice spoke clearly jack its giving way the tunnel is giving way uncle bob is that you do not speak they cannot hear you jack the tunnel is falling jack the sound of an earthquake was heard and then nothing a new voice spoke she means alright but its her first holiday on her own let her enjoy herself mother its me im here dont speak more wind then rain and thunder the boats going over i cant hold it the womans voice screamed then monica screamed mother no im here the lights went on and monica was standing next to the round table where the professor and owen were sitting she ran out of the room the professor found her in the front room where she was sitting on the sofa crying he sat next to her and put his arm round her as owen walked nervously back and forth in front of them it was my mother and father on the boat trip where they there there its over now what was that part about my uncle calling my fathers name if you recognise a voice that you hear it means that there is something wrong between you and that person one thing is certain the scarab is real chapter six monicas father speaks yvonne drove monica back to the cairo gift shop so she could return the blue scarab to the gypsy woman she did not want the necklace after that night at professor lloyds her parents had both died on a boating holiday and hearing their voices again had really frightened her they parked the car near what they thought was the shops window the window was old and dirty there was no sign with cairo written on it the door had wooden boards in front of it i think it was here yvonne looked around the street to see if they had made a mistake monica wiped the dust off one of the store windows with a tissue so she could see inside the inside had pieces of wood hanging from the ceiling there were old boards stones and dirt all over the floor it looked as if it hadnt been used for a long time then monica saw it hanging from the ceiling there was one of the brightly coloured paper animals it was a bright blue scarab monica ran to the car lets get out of here whats wrong whats happened yvonne got in the car but monica couldnt tell her what happened just drive me to the university im not keeping this scarab what are you going to do with it give it to professor lloyd yvonne left monica at the university where professor lloyd had an office on the top floor of the library monica knocked on the door yes monica opened the door professor lloyd monica my dear come in come in monica remembered the woman in the shop saying something similar she took the necklace out of her bag and put it on the professors desk the sun was shining through the window it hit the scarab when professor lloyd spoke he had monicas fathers voice monica dont be afraid monica covered her mouth with her hands its okay dear i need to talk to you i know i was angry at you for not going with us on that boating trip but you mustnt feel bad about it you lived now we need your help keep the necklace live the best life possible that will help us now the professor stopped talking then he walked to the window monica sat looking at the scarab she wasnt frightened in fact she felt very happy and calm what does it mean professor he did not turn to look at her he spoke with his own voice this time if you live a good life you forgive others and try to help those you can this has a great effect because it shows that you have learned something from other peoples lives by doing this you will be able to teach others who will live after you have died she put the scarab around her neck the professor continued the fact that you were chosen to wear the scarab means you can do more than others you can help many really professor but how can this be done we all have people we have loved and who are now dead we want their lives to be judged fairly the professor never turned away from the window before monica left he said two more words to her thank you chapter seven osiris and seth owen was reading a book about egyptian gods it said that osiris the one who judges those who die was once a king his brother seth wanted to be king so he played a trick on osiris he brought him a beautiful large chest and he told the king that he could have the chest if he could fit inside it after the king lay down in the chest seth quickly closed it threw it into the nile river and it sailed out to sea owen put the book down because he began thinking of his own fathers death his father had been killed at an archaeological site he was a famous archaeologist which is why owen wanted to be one owens uncle was with owens father when he died he came to live with owen and his mother afterwards and owen had always thought his uncle didnt care about his fathers death he never talked about him and he behaved as if he were owens father the voice he heard at the professors suddenly meant something to him he felt he had to talk to monica he remembered where she lived because he had driven her home from the professors he hoped she wasnt asleep monica was asleep when she heard the loud knocking at her door it frightened her who is it its me owen could you open the door i have to talk to you owen looked awful he held his books tightly in his arms and his hair stood up on his head as if he had been pulling at it can i come in ive got something really important to talk to you about yes come in but calm down monica made them some hot chocolate while owen told her what he had read i still dont understand what that story has to do with your uncle that was my uncles voice we heard at professor lloyds i know its wrong but i always thought my uncle had something to do with my fathers death he never talked about it but that has nothing to do with the scarab it does dont you remember professor lloyd telling us about the markings on the back yes well one of those marks was the rams horn its the sign of water which connects all the other signs osiris was killed by water he looks after the dead thats why there arc the markings of the dogs teeth and the hawks wing osiris son horus killed his uncle for his lather when horus died he became the hawk god who sits by his father when he judges the dead and cries for them monica touched the scarab around her neck she knew that she and owen had been brought together for some reason maybe she could do something for him owen was holding his cup of hot chocolate thinking very hard finally he spoke i think i should go and talk to my uncle he would probably like that i havent spoken to him in five years would you like me to go with you he looked at monica yes chapter eight the gloves owens uncle was painting the front of his house when monica and owen drove up the dirt road he pushed back his cap to get a better look and seemed very surprised when he saw who it was owen held out his hand hello uncle bob they shook hands then hugged youre the last person in the world i expected to see coming up that road today well i thought it was time i paid a visit to say hello uncle bobs blue eyes were bright with happiness as he looked into his nephews eyes he looked over at monica im sorry this is my friend monica how do you do nice to meet you sir they all went and sat on the back porch which looked onto a huge empty field surrounded by trees uncle bob brought them some lemonade a large friendly dog lay next to monicas chair and she lightly scratched its head do you two mind if i take a walk with my new friend here the men didnt answer so monica ran down the porch steps into the field with the dog following her uncle bob what happened the day my father died his uncle stopped talking and looked at the long empty field in front of him monica had disappeared somewhere with the dog we never really talked about that did we but maybe its time i never understood why you never mentioned his name alter he died his uncle looked over at him owen some things hurt too much to talk about do you think you could talk about it now i could try you see there was this big earthquake two days before we went down in the tunnel i told your father there would be another one but he his uncle was having trouble telling this part but he wouldnt listen it was our last day and he wanted to go when it hit i was up above cleaning some of the pieces wed found owen could see it happening he didnt even notice that his uncle had got up to go inside he heard the back door open and then he saw his uncle standing next to him holding an old pair of gloves your father gave these to me the day he died because i had left mine at home he wore them every time he went out to dig i think hed have wanted you to have them owen held the gloves in his hands he put them on there were tears in his eyes his uncle put his arm around him soon after monica returned from her walk she and owen got ready to leave they promised uncle bob they would come back again soon as they drove away monica beeped the horn twice in the car owen was quiet monica saw the gloves in his hand but she didnt ask him about them that was between owen his uncle and his father chapter nine cemetery after leaving owens uncle monica did something owen didnt expect she drove the car into a cemetery where are we going my parents were buried here i want to see their gravestones they parked the car in the visitors car park then walked the sun was very bright they were walking through a field of white crosses and gravestones they stopped to look at some of the older ones look at this one and this one is from michael mason look his wife died a year later i think i like archaeology because of the connection between two periods of time i mean when i understand the way someone lived hundreds of years ago i understand more about the way we live now monica took owens hand and walked with him to her parents graves they were never buried here we just have the graves to remember them they died at sea their bodies were never found monica took a jar of water from her coat pocket she poured some of it over each of her parents gravestones whats that its water i took from the sea i was at my parents funeral but i never felt like i said goodbye this is something i thought of doing to let them know that everything is okay was there a problem between you and your parents well my father loved our family holidays the summer they died was the first time i hadnt gone with them some friends of mine had a beach house i was eighteen i wanted to be with my friends my dad and i had a big fight we didnt talk to each other before he left on their boat trip i felt guilty about that in fact i never forgave myself until i began to believe in this scarab she touched the stone on her neck you think your father will somehow feel that your argument meant nothing compared to how much you loved each other something like that all the things ive seen and heard since i got the scarab have given me hope i would like to believe that i live a better life now because of the good things done by the people who lived before me it does justify their life if what the ancient egyptians said was true i mean the fact that peoples lives are judged after they die then i believe its our duty to show the gods that those who died did help us by their good actions its a good reason to do the best you can as owen and monica walked back to the car in the bright golden sunlight they looked like two dark figures slowly disappearing into the distance chapter ten the blue scarab monica was sitting in the living room of owens hat waiting for him he had gone to use a neighbours telephone because his was out of order she found a book on the table next to her it was a library book on ancient egypt she opened it to the story of osiris and began to read after seth had thrown the chest with osiris inside into the nile osiris wife his went to look for it she found the chest but before she could open it and bury the body seth stole it from her he cut the body into sixteen separate pieces and hid them all over egypt again isis went to look for them this time she took her sister nephthys with her together they found each piece isis had magical powers she put the body back together with a special oil this oil is from the tree of healing it will keep the body after it is buried this white cloth that i will put around him will let the gods know that he was a great king the gods liked what isis had done and they rewarded osiris osiris will decide on the life of the dead if someone is good and just they will be rewarded those who are evil and do not respect others lives will be punished so osiris was made the judge of the dead when somebody died their soul which left their body was put through fortytwo tests after these tests the soul was brought before osiris osiris sat in front of a pair of scales he held a feather in his hand next to him there was a man with a dogs head and a man with the head of a falcon osiris held the feather out to the dogs head anubis take this feather and place it on one end of the scale it is the feather of truth it will tell us who has lived a just life and who has not osiris then spoke to the falcon head horus you are my son you tried to find revenge for my death by killing your uncle take the soul and put it on the opposite end of the scale there you will cry for its revenge the falcon head walked to the scale opposite the dogs head they held each scale until osiris told them to let them go this soul has passed through the fortytwo tests these tests were given to decide if your good deeds in life are greater than your bad ones you have not passed these tests alone people who are living have acted for you now it is time to see have you lived a good and just life let go of the scales the falcon and dog let go of the scales the falcon made a loud cry the scales balanced osiris held up the blue scarab this is what we will use to speak to the living through this the souls of the dead will be judged we hope that the living will understand what we say now i understand monica closed the book and put it back on the table she walked to the window and looked outside everything was bathed in the sunlight she touched the scarab round her neck and closed her eyes she said to herself softly now i understand the end
