the stanislaski brothers nora roberts a stanislaski saga luring a lady prologue the playground was full of noise drama and politics even at eight mikhail knew about politics he had after all been in america nearly two full years he no longer waited for men to come drag his father away or to wake up one morning back in the ukraine and find the escape into hungary the travel to austria and finally to new york had all been a dream he lived in brooklyn and that was good he was an american and that was better he and his big sister his little brother went to schoolвђand spoke english most of the time his baby sister had been born here and would never know what it was to shiver in the cold while hiding in a wagon waiting waiting for discovery or freedom there were times he didnt think of it at all he liked getting up in the morning and seeing the little houses that looked so much like their house out his bedroom window he liked smelling the breakfast his mother cooked in the kitchen and hearing his mothers voice murmuring his fathers booming as papa got ready for work papa had to work very hard and sometimes he came home tired in the evening but he had a smile in his eyes and the lines around them were fading and at night there was hot food and laughter around the dinner table school was not so bad and he was learningвђexcept his teachers said he daydreamed too much and too often the girls are jumping rope alexi mikhails little brother plopped down beside him both had dark hair and golden brown eyes and the sharp facial bones that would make women swoon in only a few more years now of course girls were something to be ignored unless they were family natasha alex said with smug pride in his older sister is the best she is stanislaski alex acknowledged this with a shrug it went without saying his eyes scanned the playground he liked to watch how people behaved what they didвђand didnt do his jacketвђjust a bit too big as his brothers was a bit too smallвђwas open despite the brisk march wind alex nodded toward two boys on the far end of the blacktop after school we have to beat up will and charlie braunstein mikhail pursed his lips scratched an itch just under his ribs okay why because will said we were russian spies and charlie laughed and made noises like a pig so so mikhail agreed and the brothers looked at each other and grinned they were late getting home from school which would probably mean a punishment mikhails pants were ripped at the knee and alexis lip was splitвђwhich would undoubtedly mean a lecture but it had been worth it the stanislaski brothers had emerged from the battle victorious they strolled down the sidewalk arms slung over each others shoulders book bags dragging as they recapped the combat charlie he has a good punch mikhail said so if you fight again you have to be fast he has longer arms than you have and he has a black eye alex noted with satisfaction yes mikhail swelled with pride over his baby brothers exploits this is good when we go to school tomorrow weвђ uhoh he broke off and the fearless warrior trembled nadia stanislaski stood on the stoop outside their front door his mamas hands were fisted on her hips and even from half a block away he knew her eagle eye had spotted the rip in his trousers now were in for it alexi muttered were not in yet no it meansвђin trouble alexi tried his best smile even though it caused his lip to throb but nadias eyes narrowed she swaggered down the walk like a gunfighter prepared to draw and fire you fight again as the eldest mikhail stepped in front of his brother just a little her sharp eyes scanned them top to bottom and judged the damage minor you fight each other again no mama alex sent her a hopeful look will braunstein saidвђ i dont want to hear what will braunstein said am i will braunsteins mama at the tone both boys dropped their chins to their chests and murmured no mama whose mama am i both boys sighed heavily our mama so this is what i do when my boys make me worry and come late from school and fight like hooligans it was a word shed learned from her neighbor grace macnamaraвђand one she thought sentimentally suited her sons so well her boys yelped when she grabbed each one by the earlobe before she could pull them toward the house she heard the rattle and thump that could only be her husband yuris secondhand pickup truck he swung to the curb wiggled his eyebrows when he saw his wife holding each of his sons by the ear what have they done fighting the braunsteins we go inside now to call mrs braunstein and apologize aw ow mikhails protest turned into a muffled yip as nadia expertly twisted his earlobe this can wait yes i have something yuri clambered out of the truck and held up a little gray pup this is sasha your new brother both boys shouted with delight and released sprang forward sasha responded with licks and nips and wriggles until yuri bundled the pup into mikhails arms he is for you and alexi and tasha and rachel to take care not for your mama he said even as nadia rolled her eyes this is understood well take good care of him papa let me hold him mik alex demanded and tried to elbow mikhail aside im the oldest i hold him first everybody will hold go go show your sisters yuri waved his hands before scrambling away both boys pressed against him thank you papa mikhail turned to kiss his mothers cheek well call mrs braunstein mama yes you will nadia shook her head as they ran into the house calling for their sisters hooligans she said relishing the word boys will be what boys will be yuri lifted her off her feet laughed long and deep we are an american family he set her down but kept his arm around her waist as they started into the house whats for dinner luring a lady to my nephew kenni my second favorite carpenter chapter contents prev next she wasnt a patient woman delays and excuses were barely tolerated and never tolerated well waitingвђand she was waiting nowвђhad her temper dropping degree by degree toward ice with sydney hayward icy anger was a great deal more dangerous than boiling rage one frigid glance one frosty phrase could make the recipient quake and she knew it now she paced her new office ten stories up in midtown manhattan she swept from corner to corner over the deep oatmealcolored carpet everything was perfectly in place papers files coordinated appointment and address books even her brassandebony desk set was perfectly aligned the pens and pencils marching in a straight row across the polished mahogany the notepads carefully placed beside the phone her appearance mirrored the meticulous precision and tasteful elegance of the office her crisp beige suit was all straight lines and starch but didnt disguise the fact that there was a great pair of legs striding across the carpet with it she wore a single strand of pearls earrings to match and a slim gold watch all very discreet and exclusive as a hayward shed been raised to be both her dark auburn hair was swept off her neck and secured with a gold clip the pale freckles that went with the hair were nearly invisible after a light dusting of powder sydney felt they made her look too young and too vulnerable at twentyeight she had a face that reflected her breeding high slashing cheekbones the strong slightly pointed chin the small straight nose an aristocratic face it was pale as porcelain with a softly shaped mouth she knew could sulk too easily and large smokyblue eyes that people often mistook for guileless sydney glanced at her watch again let out a little hiss of breath then marched over to her desk before she could pick up the phone her intercom buzzed yes ms hayward theres a man here who insists on seeing the person in charge of the soho project and your fouroclock appointmentвђ its now fourfifteen sydney cut in her voice low and smooth and final send him in yes maam but hes not mr howington so howington had sent an underling annoyance hiked sydneys chin up another fraction send him in she repeated and flicked off the intercom with one frosted pink nail so they thought shed be pacified with a junior executive sydney took a deep breath and prepared to kill the messenger it was years of training that prevented her mouth from dropping open when the man walked in no not walked she corrected swaggered like a blackpatched pirate over the rolling deck of a boarded ship she wished shed had the foresight to have fired a warning shot over his bow her initial shock had nothing to do with the fact that he was wildly handsome though the adjective suited perfectly a mane of thick curling black hair flowed just beyond the nape of his neck to be caught by a leather thong in a short ponytail that did nothing to detract from rampant masculinity his face was rawboned and lean with skin the color of an old gold coin hooded eyes were nearly as black as his hair his full lips were shadowed by a day or twos growth of beard that gave him a rough and dangerous look though he skimmed under six foot and was leanly built he made her delicately furnished office resemble a dolls house what was worse was the fact that he wore work clothes dusty jeans and a sweaty tshirt with a pair of scarred boots that left a trail of dirt across her pale carpet they hadnt even bothered with the junior executive she thought as her lips firmed but had sent along a common laborer who hadnt had the sense to clean up before the interview youre hayward the insolence in the tone and the slight hint of a slavic accent had her imagining him striding up to a camp fire with a whip tucked in his belt the misty romance of the image made her tone unnecessarily sharp yes and youre late his eyes narrowed fractionally as they studied each other across the desk am i yes you might find it helpful to wear a watch my time is valuable if yours is not mrвђ stanislaski he hooked his thumbs in the belt loops of his jeans shifting his weight easily arrogantly onto one hip sydneys a mans name she arched a brow obviously youre mistaken he skimmed his gaze over her slowly with as much interest as annoyance she was pretty as a frosted cake but he hadnt come straight and sweaty from a job to waste time with a female obviously i thought hayward was an old man with a bald head and a white mustache youre thinking of my grandfather ah then its your grandfather i want to see that wont be possible mr stanislaski as my grandfathers been dead for nearly two months the arrogance in his eyes turned quickly to compassion im sorry it hurts to lose family she couldnt say why of all the condolences she had received these few words from a stranger touched her yes it does now if youll take a seat we can get down to business cold hard and distant as the moon just as well he thought it would keep him from thinking of her in more personal waysвђat least until he got what he wanted i have sent your grandfather letters he began as he settled into one of the trim queen anne chairs in front of the desk perhaps the last were misplaced during the confusion of death an odd way to put it sydney thought but apt her life had certainly been turned upside down in the past few months correspondence should be addressed to me she sat folding her hands on the desk as you know hayward enterprises is considering several firmsвђ for what she struggled to shrug off the irritation of being interrupted i beg your pardon for what are you considering several firms if she had been alone she would have sighed and shut her eyes instead she drummed her fingers on the desk what position do you hold mr stanislaski position yes yes what is it you do the impatience in her voice made him grin his teeth were very white and not quite straight you mean what is it i do i work with wood youre a carpenter sometimes sometimes she repeated and sat back behind her buildings punched into a hard blue sky perhaps you can tell me why howington construction sent a sometimes carpenter to represent them in this interview the room smelled of lemon and rosemary and only reminded him that he was hot thirsty and as impatient as she i couldвђif they had sent me it took her a moment to realize he wasnt being deliberately obtuse youre not from howington no im mikhail stanislaski and i live in one of your buildings he propped a dirty boot on a dusty knee if youre thinking of hiring howington i would think again i once worked for them but they cut too many comers excuse me sydney gave the intercom a sharp jab janine did mr stanislaski tell you he represented howington oh no maam he just asked to see you howington called about ten minutes ago to reschedule if youвђ never mind sitting back again she studied the man who was grinning at her apparently ive been laboring under a misconception if you mean you made a mistake yes im here to talk to you about your apartment building in soho she wanted badly to drag her hands through her hair youre here with a tenant complaint im here with many tenants complaints he corrected you should be aware that theres a certain procedure one follows in this kind of matter he lifted one black brow you own the building yes yes butвђ then its your responsibility she stiffened im perfectly aware of my responsibilities mr stanislaski and nowвђ he rose as she did and didnt budge an inch your grandfather made promises to honor him you must keep them what i must do she said in a frigid voice is run my business and she was trying desperately to learn how you may tell the other tenants that hayward is at the point of hiring a contractor as were quite aware that many of our properties are in need of repair or renovation the apartments in soho will be dealt with in turn his expression didnt change at the dismissal nor did the tone of his voice or the spreadlegged feetplanted stance were tired of waiting for our turn we want what was promised to us now if youll send me a list of your demandsвђ we have she set her teeth then ill look over the files this evening files arent people you take the rent money every month but you dont think of the people he placed his hands on the desk and leaned forward sydney caught a wisp of sawdust and sweat that was uncomfortably appealing have you seen the building or the people who live in it i have reports she began reports he sworeвђit wasnt in a language she understood but she was certain it was an oath you have your accountants and your lawyers and you sit up here in your pretty office and look through papers with one quick slash of the hand he dismissed her office and herself but you know nothing its not you whos cold when the heat doesnt work or who must climb five flights of stairs when the elevator is broken you dont worry that the water wont get hot or that the wiring is too old to be safe no one spoke to her that way no one her own temper was making her heart beat too fast it made her forget that she was facing a very dangerous man youre wrong im very concerned about all of those things and i intend to correct them as soon as possible his eyes flashed and narrowed like a sword raised and turned on its edge this is a promise weve heard before now its my promise and you havent had that before and were supposed to trust you you who are too lazy or too afraid to even go see what she owns her face went dead white the only outward sign of fury ive had enough of your insults for one afternoon mr stanislaski now you can either find your way out or ill call security to help you find it i know my way he said evenly ill tell you this miss sydney hayward you will begin to keep those promises within two days or well go to the building commissioner and the press sydney waited until he had stalked out before she sat again slowly she took a sheet of stationery from the drawer then methodically tore it into shreds she stared at the smudges his big widepalmed hands had left on her glossy desk and chose and shredded another sheet calmer she punched the intercom janine bring me everything youve got on the soho project an hour later sydney pushed the files aside and made two calls the first was to cancel her dinner plans for the evening the second was to lloyd bingham her grandfathersвђnow herвђexecutive assistant you just caught me lloyd told her as he walked into sydneys office i was on my way out what can i do for you sydney shot him a brief glance he was a handsome ambitious man who preferred italian tailors and french food not yet forty he was on his second divorce and liked to escort society women who were attracted to his smooth blond looks and polished manners sydney knew that he had worked hard and long to gain his position with hayward and that he had taken over the reins during her grandfathers illness the past year she also knew that he resented her because she was sitting behind a desk he considered rightfully his for starters you can explain why nothing has been done about the soho apartments the unit in soho lloyd took a cigarette from a slim gold case its on the agenda its been on the agenda for nearly eighteen months the first letter in the file signed by the tenants was dated almost two years ago and lists twentyseven specific complaints and i believe youll also see in the file that a number of them were addressed he blew out a thin stream of smoke as he made himself comfortable on one of the chairs a number of them sydney repeated such as the furnace repairs the tenants seemed to think a new furnace was required lloyd made a vague gesture youre new to the game sydney youll find that tenants always want new better and more that may be however it hardly seems costeffective to me to repair a thirtyyearold furnace and have it break down again two months later she held up a finger before he could speak broken railings in stairwells peeling paint an insufficient water heater a defective elevator cracked porcelainвђ she glanced up i could go on but it doesnt seem necessary theres a memo here from my grandfather to you requesting that you take over the repairs and maintenance of this building which i did lloyd said stiffly you know very well that your grandfathers health turned this company upside down over the last year that apartment complex is only one of several buildings he owned youre absolutely right her voice was quiet but without warmth i also know that we have a responsibility a legal and a moral responsibility to our tenants whether the building is in soho or on central park west she closed the folder linked her hands over it and in that gesture stated ownership i dont want to antagonize you lloyd but i want you to understand that ive decided to handle this particular property myself why she granted him a small smile im not entirely sure lets just say i want to get my feet wet and ive decided to make this property my pet project in the meantime id like you to look over the reports on the construction firms and give me your recommendations she offered him another file ive included a list of the properties in order of priority well have a meeting friday ten oclock to finalize all right he tapped out his cigarette before he rose sydney i hope you wont take offense but a woman whos spent most of her life traveling and buying clothes doesnt know much about business or making a profit she did take offense but shed be damned if shed show it then id better learn hadnt i good night lloyd not until the door closed did she look down at her hands they were shaking he was right absolutely right to point out her inadequacies but he couldnt know how badly she needed to prove herself here to make something out of what her grandfather had left her nor could he know how terrified she was that she would let down the family name again before she could change her mind she tucked the file into her briefcase and left the office she walked down the wide pastel corridor with its tasteful watercolors and thriving ficus trees through the thick glass doors that closed in her suite of offices she took her private elevator down to the lobby where she nodded to the guard before she walked outside the heat punched like a fist though it was only midjune new york was in the clutches of a vicious heat wave with temperatures and humidity spiraling gleefully she had only to cross the sidewalk to be cocooned in the waiting car sheltered from the dripping air and noise after giving her driver the address she settled back for the ride to soho traffic was miserable snarling and edgy but that would only give her more time to think she wasnt certain what she was going to do when she got there nor was she sure what she would do if she ran into mikhail stanislaski again hed made quite an impression on her sydney mused exotic looks hot eyes a complete lack of courtesy the worst part was the file had shown that hed had a perfect right to be rude and impatient hed written letter after letter during the past year only to be put off with halfbaked promises perhaps if her grandfather hadnt been so stubborn about keeping his illness out of the press sydney rubbed a finger over her temple and wished shed taken a couple of aspirin before shed left the office whatever had happened before she was in charge now she intended to respect her inheritance and all the responsibilities that went with it she closed her eyes and fell into a half doze as her driver fought his way downtown inside his apartment mikhail carved a piece of cherrywood he wasnt sure why he continued his heart wasnt in it but he felt it more productive to do something with his hands he kept thinking about the woman sydney all ice and pride he thought one of the aristocrats it was in his blood to rebel against though he and his family had escaped to america when he had still been a child there was no denying his heritage his ancestors had been gypsies in the ukraine hotblooded hot tempered and with little respect for structured authority mikhail considered himself to be americanвђexcept when it suited him to be russian curls of wood fell on the table or the floor most of his cramped living space was taken up with his workвђblocks and slabs of wood even an oak burl knives chisels hammers drills calipers there was a small lathe in the corner and jars that held brushes the room smelled of linseed oil sweat and sawdust mikhail took a pull from the beer at his elbow and sat back to study the cherry it wasnt ready as yet to let him see what was inside he let his fingers roam over it over the grain into the grooves while the sound of traffic and music and shouts rose up and through the open window at his back he had had enough success in the past two years that he could have moved into bigger and more modern dwellings he liked it here in this noisy neighborhood with the bakery on the corner the bazaarlike atmosphere on canal only a short walk away the women who gossiped from their stoops in the morning the men who sat there at night he didnt need walltowall carpet or a sunken tub or a big stylish kitchen all he wanted was a roof that didnt leak a shower that offered hot water and a refrigerator that would keep the beer and cold cuts cold at the moment he didnt have any of those things and miss sydney hayward hadnt seen the last of him he glanced up at the three brisk knocks on his door then grinned as his downthehall neighbor burst in whats the story keely obrian slammed the door leaned dramatically against it then did a quick jig i got the part letting out a whoop she raced to the table to throw her arms around mikhails neck i got it she gave him a loud smacking kiss on one cheek i got it then the other i told you you would he reached back to ruffle her short cap of dusty blond hair get a beer well celebrate oh mik she crossed to the tiny refrigerator on long slim legs left stunningly revealed by a pair of neon green shorts i was so nervous before the audition i got the hiccups then i drank a gallon of water and sloshed my way through the reading she tossed the cap into the trash before toasting herself and i still got it a movie of the week ill probably only get like sixth or seventh billing but i dont get murdered till the third act she took a sip then let out a long bloodcurdling scream thats what i have to do when the serial killer comers me in the alley i really think my scream turned the tide no doubt as always her quick nervous speech amused him she was twentythree with an appealing coltish body lively green eyes and a heart as wide as the grand canyon if mikhail hadnt felt so much like her brother right from the beginning of their relationship he would have long since attempted to talk her into bed keely took a sip of beer hey do you want to order some chinese or pizza or something ive got a frozen pizza but my oven is on the blink again the simple statement made his eyes flash and his lips purse i went today to see hayward the bottle paused on the way to her lips in person you mean like facetoface yes mikhail set aside his carving tools afraid he would gouge the wood impressed keely walked over to sit on the windowsill wow so whats he like hes dead she choked on the beer watching him wideeyed as she pounded on her chest dead you didntвђ kill him this time mikhail smiled another thing he enjoyed about keely was her innate flare for the dramatic no but i considered killing the new haywardвђhis granddaughter the new landlords a woman whats she like very beautiful very cold he was frowning as he skimmed his fingertips over the wood grain she has red hair and white skin blue eyes like frost on a lake when she speaks icicles form keely grimaced and sipped rich people she said can afford to be cold i told her she has two days before i go to the building commissioner this time keely smiled as much as she admired mikhail she felt he was naive in a lot of ways good luck maybe we should take mrs bayfords idea about a rent strike of course then we risk eviction butвђ hey she leaned out the open window you should see this car its like a lincoln or somethingвђwith a driver theres a woman getting out of the back more fascinated than envious she let out a long appreciative breath harpers bazaars version of the executive woman grinning she shot a glance over her shoulder i think your ice princess has come slumming outside sydney studied the building it was really quite lovely she thought like an old woman who had maintained her dignity and a shadow of her youthful beauty the red brick had faded to a soft pink smudged here and there by soot and exhaust the trimming paint was peeling and cracked but that could be easily remedied taking out a legal pad she began to take notes she was aware that the men sitting out on the stoop were watching her but she ignored them it was a noisy place she noted most of the windows were open and there was a variety of soundвђtelevisions radios babies crying someone singing the desert song in a warbling soprano there were useless little balconies crowded with potted flowers bicycles clothes drying in the still hot air shading her eyes she let her gaze travel up most of the railings were badly rusted and many had spokes missing she frowned then spotted mikhail leaning out of a window on the top floor nearly cheek to cheek with a stunning blonde since he was bare chested and the blonde was wearing the tiniest excuse for a tank top sydney imagined shed interrupted them she acknowledged him with a frigid nod then went back to her notes when she started toward the entrance the men shifted to make a path for her the small lobby was dim and oppressively hot on this level the windows were apparently painted shut the old parquet floor was scarred and scraped and there was a smell a very definite smell of mold she studied the elevator dubiously someone had handlettered a sign above the button that read abandon hope ye who enter here curious sydney punched the up button and listened to the grinding rattles and wheezes on an impatient breath she made more notes it was deplorable she thought the unit should have been inspected and hayward should have been slapped with a citation well she was hayward now the doors squeaked open and mikhail stepped out did you come to look over your empire he asked her very deliberately she finished her notes before she met his gaze at least he had pulled on a shirtвђif you could call it that the thin white tshirt was ripped at the sleeves and mangled at the hem i believe i told you id look over the file once i did i thought it best to inspect the building myself she glanced at the elevator then back at him youre either very brave or very stupid mr stanislaski a realist he corrected with a slow shrug what happens happens perhaps but id prefer that no one use this elevator until its repaired or replaced he slipped his hands into his pockets and will it be yes as quickly as possible i believe you mentioned in your letter that some of the stair railings were broken ive replaced the worst of them her brow lifted you there are children and old people in this building the simplicity of his answer made her ashamed i see since youve taken it on yourself to represent the tenants perhaps youd take me through and show me the worst of the problems as they started up the stairs she noted that the railing was obviously new an unstained line of wood that was sturdy under her hand she made a note that it had been replaced by a tenant he knocked on apartment doors people greeted him enthusiastically her warily there were smells of cookingвђmeals just finished meals yet to be eaten she was offered strudel brownies goulash chicken wings some of the complaints were bitter some were nervous but sydney saw for herself that mikhails letters hadnt exaggerated by the time they reached the third floor the heat was making her dizzy on the fourth she refused the offer of spaghetti and meatballsвђwondering how anyone could bear to cook in all this heatвђand accepted a glass of water dutifully she noted down how the pipes rattled and thumped when they reached the fifth floor she was wishing desperately for a cool shower a chilled glass of chardonnay and the blissful comfort of her airconditioned apartment mikhail noted that her face was glowing from the heat on the last flight of stairs shed been puffing a bit which pleased him it wouldnt hurt the queen to see how her subjects lived he wondered why she didnt at least peel off her suit jacket or loosen a couple of those prim buttons on her blouse he wasnt pleased with the thought that he would enjoy doing both of those things for her i would think that some of these tenants would have window units sweat slithered nastily down her back airconditioning the wiring wont handle it he told her when people turn them on it blows the fuses and we lose power the hallways are the worst he went on conversationally airless and up here is worst of all heat rises so ive heard she was white as a sheet he noted and swore take off your jacket i beg your pardon youre stupid he tugged the linen off her shoulders and began to pull her arms free the combination of heat and his rough purposeful fingers had spots dancing in front of her eyes stop it very stupid this is not a boardroom his touch wasnt the least bit loverlike but it was very disturbing she batted at his hands the moment one of her arms was free ignoring her mikhail pushed her into his apartment mr stanislaski she said out of breath but not out of dignity i will not be pawed i have doubts youve ever been pawed in your life your highness what man wants frostbite sit i have no desire toвђ he simply shoved her into a chair then glanced over where keely stood in the kitchen gaping get her some water he ordered sydney caught her breath a fan whirled beside the chair and cooled her skin you are the rudest most illmannered most insufferable man ive ever been forced to deal with he took the glass from keely and was tempted to toss the contents into sydneys beautiful face instead he shoved the glass into her hand drink jeez mik have a heart keely murmured she looks beat you want a cold cloth even as she offered she couldnt help but admire the ivory silk blouse with its tiny pearl buttons no thank you im fine im keely obrian her oven doesnt work mikhail said and she gets no hot water the roof leaks only when it rains keely tried to smile but got no response i guess ill run along nice to meet you when they were alone sydney took slow sips of the tepid water mikhail hadnt complained about his own apartment but she could see from where she sat that the linoleum on the kitchen floor was ripped and the refrigerator was hopelessly small and outofdate she simply didnt have the energy to look at the rest his approach had been anything but tactful still the bottom line was he was right and her company was wrong he sat on the edge of the kitchen counter and watched as color seeped slowly back into her cheeks it relieved him for a moment in the hall hed been afraid she would faint he already felt like a clod do you want food his voice was clipped and unfriendly you can have a sandwich she remembered that she was supposed to be dining at le cirque with the latest eligible bachelor her mother had chosen no thank you you dont think much of me do you he moved his shoulders in the way she now recognized as habit i think of you quite a bit she frowned and set the glass aside the way he said it left a little too much to the imagination you said you were a carpenter i am sometimes a carpenter you have a license his eyes narrowed a contractors license yes for remodeling renovations then youd have a list of other contractors youve worked withвђelectricians plumbers that sort of thing yes fine work up a bid on repairs including the finish work painting tile replacing fixtures appliances have it on my desk in a week she rose picking up her crumpled jacket he stayed where he was as she folded the jacket over her arm lifted her briefcase and then she shot him a cool look and then mr stanislaski im going to put my money where your mouth is youre hired chapter contents prev next mother i really dont have time for this sydney dear one always has time for tea so saying margerite rothchild hayward kinsdale larue poured ginseng into a china cup im afraid youre taking this real estate business too seriously maybe because im in charge sydney muttered without looking up from the papers on her desk i cant imagine what your grandfather was thinking of but then he always was an unusual man she sighed a moment remembering how fond shed been of the old goat come darling have some tea and one of these delightful little sandwiches even madam executive needs a spot of lunch sydney gave in hoping to move her mother along more quickly by being agreeable this is really very sweet of you its just that im pressed for time today all this corporate nonsense margerite began as sydney sat beside her i dont know why you bother it would have been so simple to hire a manager or whatever margerite added a squirt of lemon to her cup before she sat back i realize it might be diverting for a while but the thought of you with a career well it seems so pointless does it sydney murmured struggling to keep the bitterness out of her voice i may surprise everyone and be good at it oh im sure youd be wonderful at whatever you do darling her hand fluttered absently over sydneys the girl had been so little trouble as a child she thought margerite really hadnt a clue how to deal with this sudden andвђshe was sureвђtemporary spot of rebellion she tried placating and i was delighted when grandfather hayward left you all those nice buildings she nibbled on a sandwich a striking woman who looked ten years younger than her fifty years groomed and polished in a chanel suit but to actually become involved in running things baffled she patted her carefully tinted chestnut hair well one might think its just a bit unfeminine a man is easily put off by what he considers a highpowered woman sydney gave her mothers newly bare ring finger a pointed look not every womans sole ambition centers around a man oh dont be silly with a gay little laugh margerite patted her daughters hand a husband isnt something a woman wants to be without for long you mustnt be discouraged because you and peter didnt work things out first marriages are often just a testing ground reining in her feelings sydney set her cup down carefully is that what you consider your marriage to father a testing ground we both learned some valuable lessons from it im sure confident and content she beamed at her daughter now dear tell me about your evening with channing how was it stifling margerites mild blue eyes flickered with annoyance sydney really you asked to fortify herself sydney picked up her tea again why was it she asked herself that she perpetually felt inadequate around the woman who had given birth to her im sorry mother but we simply dont suit nonsense youre perfectly suited channing warfield is an intelligent successful man from a very fine family so was peter china clinked against china as margerite set her cup in its saucer sydney you must not compare every man you meet with peter i dont taking a chance she laid a hand on her mothers there was a bond there there had to be why did she always feel as though her fingers were just sliding away from it honestly i dont compare channing with anyone the simple fact is i find him stilted boring and pretentious it could be that id find any man the same just now im not interested in men at this point of my life mother i want to make something of myself make something of yourself margerite repeated more stunned than angry youre a hayward you dont need to make yourself anything else she plucked up a napkin to dab at her lips for heavens sake sydney youve been divorced from peter for four years its time you found a suitable husband its women who write the invitations she reminded her daughter and they have a policy of excluding beautiful unattached females you have a place in society sydney and a responsibility to your name the familiar clutching in her stomach had sydney setting the tea aside so youve always told me satisfied that sydney would be reasonable she smiled if channing wont do there are others but i really think you shouldnt be so quick to dismiss him if i were twenty years youngerвђ well she glanced at her watch and gave a little squeak dear me im going to be late for the hairdresser ill just run and powder my nose first when margerite slipped into the adjoining bath sydney leaned her head back and closed her eyes where was she to put all these feelings of guilt and inadequacy how could she explain herself to her mother when she couldnt explain herself to herself rising she went back to her desk she couldnt convince margerite that her unwillingness to become involved again had nothing to do with peter when in fact it did they had been friends damn it she and peter had grown up with each other had cared for each other they simply hadnt been in love with each other family pressure had pushed them down the aisle while theyd been too young to realize the mistake then they had spent the best part of two years trying miserably to make the marriage work the pity of it wasnt the divorce but the fact that when they had finally parted they were no longer friends if she couldnt make a go of it with someone shed cared for someone shed had so much in common with someone shed liked so much surely the lack was in her all she wanted to do now was to feel deserving of her grandfathers faith in her shed been offered a different kind of responsibility a different kind of challenge this time she couldnt afford to fail wearily she answered her intercom yes janine mr stanislaskis here miss hayward he doesnt have an appointment but he says he has some papers you wanted to see a full day early she mused and straightened her shoulders send him in at least hed shaved she thought though this time there were holes in his jeans closing the door he took as long and as thorough a look at her as if they were two boxers sizing up the competition from neutral comers she looked just as starched and prim as before in one of her tidy business suits this time in pale gray with all those little silver buttons on her blouse done up to her smooth white throat he glanced down at the tea tray with its delicate cups and tiny sandwiches his lips curled interrupting your lunch hayward not at all she didnt bother to stand or smile but gestured him across the room do you have the bid mr stanislaski yes you work fast he grinned yes he caught a scentвђrather a clash of scents something very subtle and cool and another florid and overly feminine you have company her brow arched why do you ask there is perfume here that isnt yours then with a shrug he handed her the papers he carried the first is what must be done the second is what should be done i see she could feel the heat radiating off him for some reason it felt comforting life affirming as if shed stepped out of a dark cave into the sunlight sydney made certain her fingers didnt brush his as she took the papers you have estimates from the subcontractors they are there while she glanced through his work he lifted one of the neat triangles of bread sniffed at it like a wolf what is this stuff in here she barely looked up watercress with a grunt he dropped it back onto the plate why would you eat it she looked up again and this time she smiled good question she shouldnt have done that he thought as he shifted his hands to his pockets when she smiled she changed her eyes warmed her lips softened and beauty became approachable rather than aloof it made him forget he wasnt the least bit interested in her type of woman then ill ask you another question her lips pursed as she scanned the list she liked what she saw you seem to be full of them today why do you wear colors like that dull ones when you should be wearing vivid sapphire or emerald it was surprise that had her staring at him as far as she could remember no one had ever questioned her taste in some circles she was thought to be quite elegant are you a carpenter or a fashion consultant mr stanislaski his shoulders moved im a man is this tea he lifted the pot and sniffed at the contents while she continued to gape at him its too hot for tea you have something cold shaking her head she pressed her intercom janine bring in something cold for mr stanislaski please because she had a nagging urge to get up and inspect herself in a mirror she cleared her throat theres quite a line of demarcation between your must and your should list mrвђ mikhail he said easily its because there are more things you should do than things you must like life now a philosopher she muttered well start with the must and perhaps incorporate some of the should if we work quickly we could have a contract by the end of the week his nod was slow considering you too work fast when necessary now first id like you to explain to me why i should replace all the windows because theyre single glazed and not efficient yes butвђ sydney dear the lighting in there is just ghastly oh margerite stopped at the doorway i beg your pardon i see youre in a meeting she would have looked down her nose at mikhails worn jeans but she had a difficult time getting past his face how do you do she said pleased that he had risen at her entrance you are sydneys mother mikhail asked before sydney could shoo margerite along why yes margerites smile was reserved she didnt approve of her daughter being on a firstname basis in her relationships with the help particularly when that help wore stubby ponytails and dirty boots how did you know real beauty matures well oh charmed margerite allowed her smile to warm fractionally her lashes fluttered in reflex how kind mother im sorry but mr stanislaski and i have business to discuss of course of course margerite walked over to kiss the air an inch from her daughters cheek ill just be running along now dear you wont forget were to have lunch next week and i wanted to remind you thatвђ stanislaski she repeated turning back to mikhail i thought you looked familiar oh my suddenly breathless she laid a hand on her heart youre mikhail stanislaski yes have we met no oh no we havent but i saw your photo in art world i consider myself a patron face beaming she skirted the desk and under her daughters astonished gaze took his hands in hers to margerite the ponytail was now artistic the tattered jeans eccentric your work mr stanislaskiвђmagnificent truly magnificent i bought two of your pieces from your last showing i cant tell you what a pleasure this is you flatter me not at all margerite insisted youre already being called one of the top artists of the nineties and youve commissioned him she turned to beam at her speechless daughter a brilliant move darling iвђactually iвђ im delighted mikhail interrupted to be working with your daughter its wonderful she gave his hands a final squeeze you must come to a little dinner party im having on friday on long island please dont tell me youre already engaged for the evening she slanted a look from under her lashes ill be devastated he was careful not to grin over her head at sydney i could never be responsible for devastating a beautiful woman fabulous sydney will bring you eight oclock now i must run she patted her hair shot an absent wave at sydney and hurried out just as janine brought in a soft drink mikhail took the glass with thanks then sat again so he began you were asking about windows sydney very carefully relaxed the hands that were balled into fists under her desk you said you were a carpenter sometimes i am he took a long cooling drink sometimes i carve wood instead of hammering it if he had set out to make a fool of herвђwhich she wasnt sure he hadntвђhe could have succeeded no better ive spent the last two years in europe she told him so im a bit out of touch with the american art world you dont have to apologize he said enjoying himself im not apologizing she had to force herself to speak calmly to not stand up and rip his bid into tiny little pieces id like to know what kind of game youre playing stanislaski you offered me work on a job that has some value for me i am accepting it you lied to me how he lifted one hand palm up i have a contractors license ive made my living in construction since i was sixteen what difference does it make to you if people now buy my sculpture none she snatched up the bids again he probably produced primitive ugly pieces in any case she thought the man was too rough and unmannered to be an artist all that mattered was that he could do the job she was hiring him to do but she hated being duped to make him pay for it she forced him to go over every detail of the bid wasting over an hour of his time and hers all right then she pushed aside her own meticulous notes your contract will be ready for signing on friday good he rose you can bring it when you pick me up we should make it seven excuse me for dinner he leaned forward for a shocking moment she thought he was actually going to kiss her she went rigid as a spear but he only rubbed the lapel of her suit between his thumb and forefinger you must wear something with color she pushed the chair back and stood i have no intention of taking you to my mothers home for dinner youre afraid to be with me he said so with no little amount of pride her chin jutted out certainly not what else could it be with his eyes on hers he strolled around the desk until they were facetoface a woman like you could not be so illmannered without a reason the breath was backing up in her lungs sydney forced it out in one huff its reason enough that i dislike you he only smiled and toyed with the pearls at her throat no aristocrats are predictable hayward you would be taught to tolerate people you dont like for them you would be the most polite stop touching me im putting color in your cheeks he laughed and let the pearls slide out of his fingers her skin he was sure would be just as smooth just as cool come now sydney what will you tell your charming mother when you go to her party without me how will you explain that you refused to bring me he could see the war in her eyes the one fought between pride and manners and temper and laughed again trapped by your breeding he murmured this is not something i have to worry about myself no doubt she said between her teeth friday he said and infuriated her by flicking a finger down her cheek seven oclock mr stanislaski she murmured when he reached the door as he turned back she offered her coolest smile try to find something in your closet without holes in it she could hear him laughing at her as he walked down the hallway if only she thought as she dropped back into her chair if only she hadnt been so wellbred she could have released some of this venom by throwing breakables at the door she wore black quite deliberately under no circumstances did she want him to believe that she would fuss through her wardrobe looking for something colorful because hed suggested it and she thought the simple tube of a dress was both businesslike fashionable and appropriate on impulse she had taken her hair down so that it fluffed out to skim her shouldersвђonly because shed tired of wearing it pulled back as always she had debated her look for the evening carefully and was satisfied that she had achieved an aloof elegance she could hear the music blasting through his door before she knocked it surprised her to hear the passionate strains of carmen she rapped harder nearly gave in to the urge to shout over the aria when the door swung open behind it was the blond knockout in a skimpy tshirt and skimpier shorts hi keely crunched a piece of ice between her teeth and swallowed i was just borrowing an ice tray from mikвђmy freezers set on melt these days she managed to smile and forced herself not to tug on her clothes she felt like a peasant caught poaching by the royal princess i was just leaving before sydney could speak she dashed back inside to scoop up a tray of ice mik your dates here sydney winced at the term date as the blond bullet streaked past her theres no need for you to rush offвђ threes a crowd keely told her on the run and with a quick fleeting grin kept going did you call me mikhail came to the bedroom doorway there was one very small white towel anchored at his waist he used another to rub at his wet unruly hair he stopped when he spotted sydney something flickered in his eyes as he let his gaze roam down the long cool lines of the dress then he smiled im late he said simply she was grateful shed managed not to let her mouth fall open his body was all lean muscle long bones and bronzed skinвђskin that was gleaming with tiny drops of water that made her feel unbearably thirsty the towel hung dangerously low on his hips dazed she watched a drop of water slide down his chest over his stomach and disappear beneath the terry cloth the temperature in the room already steamy rose several degrees youreвђ she knew she could speak coherentlyвђin a minute we said seven i was busy he shrugged the towel shifted sydney swallowed i wont be long fix a drink a smile wicked around the edges tugged at his mouth a man would have to be dead not to see her reactionвђnot to be pleased by it you lookвђ hot sydney he took a step forward watching her eyes widen watching her mouth tremble open with his gaze on hers he turned on a small portable fan steamy air stirred that will help he said mildly she nodded it was cooling but it also brought the scent of his shower of his skin into the room because she could see the knowledge and the amusement in his eyes she got a grip on herself your contracts she set the folder down on a table mikhail barely glanced at them ill look and sign later fine it would be best if you got dressed she had to swallow another obstruction in her throat when he smiled at her her voice was edgy and annoyed well be late a little theres cold drink in the refrigerator he added as he turned back to the bedroom be at home alone she managed to take three normal breaths degree by degree she felt her system level any man who looked like that in a towel should be arrested she thought and turned to study the room shed been too annoyed to take stock of it on her other visit and too preoccupied she admitted with a slight frown a man like that had a way of keeping a woman preoccupied now she noted the hunks of wood small and large the tools the jars stuffed with brushes there was a long worktable beneath the living room window she wandered toward it seeing that a few of those hunks of wood were works in progress shrugging she ran a finger over a piece of cherry that was scarred with groves and gouges rude and primitive just as shed thought it soothed her ruffled ego to be assured shed been right about his lack of talent obviously a ruffian whod made a momentary impression on the capricious art world then she turned and saw the shelves they were crowded with his work long smooth columns of wood beautifully shaped a profile of a woman with long flowing hair a young child caught in gleeful laughter lovers trapped endlessly in a first tentative kiss she couldnt stop herself from touching nor from feeling his work ranged from the passionate to the charming from the bold to the delicate fascinated she crouched down to get a closer look at the pieces on the lower shelves was it possible she wondered that a man with such rough manners with such cocky arrogance possessed the wit the sensitivity the compassion to create such lovely things out of blocks of wood with a half laugh sydney reached for a carving of a tiny kangaroo with a baby peeking out of her pouch it felt as smooth and as delicate as glass even as she replaced it with a little sigh she spotted the miniature figurine cinderella she thought charmed as she held it in her fingertips the pretty fairytale heroine was still dressed for the ball but one foot was bare as mikhail had captured her in her dash before the clock struck twelve for a moment sydney thought she could almost see tears in the painted eyes you like she jolted then stood up quickly still nestling the figurine in her hand yesвђim sorry you dont have to be sorry for liking mikhail rested a hip now more conservatively covered in wheatcolored slacks on the worktable his hair had been brushed back and now curled damply nearly to his shoulders still flustered she set the miniature back on the shelf i meant i should apologize for touching your work a smile tugged at his lips it fascinated him that she could go from wideeyed delight to frosty politeness in the blink of an eye better to be touched than to sit apart only to be admired dont you think it was impossible to miss the implication in the tone of his voice in the look in his eyes that would depend as she started by he shifted rose his timing was perfect she all but collided with him on what she didnt flush or stiffen or retreat shed become accustomed to taking a stand on whether one chooses to be touched he grinned i thought we were talking about sculpture so she thought on a careful breath shed walked into that one yes we were now we really will be late if youre ready mr stanislaskiвђ mikhail he lifted a hand casually to flick a finger at the sapphire drop at her ear its easier before she could reply his gaze came back and locked on hers trapped in that one long stare she wasnt certain she could remember her own name you smell like an english garden at teatime he murmured very cool very appealing and just a little too formal it was too hot she told herself much too hot and close that was why she had difficulty breathing it had nothing to do with him rather she wouldnt allow it to have anything to do with him youre in my way i know and for reasons he wasnt entirely sure of he intended to stay there youre used to brushing people aside i dont see what that has to do withвђ an observation he interrupted amusing himself by toying with the ends of her hair the texture was as rich as the color he decided pleased she had left it free for the evening artists observe youll find that some people dont brush aside as quickly as others he heard her breath catch ignored her defensive jerk as he cupped her chin in his hand hed been right about her skinвђsmooth as polished pearls patiently he turned her face from side to side nearly perfect he decided nearly perfect is better than perfect i beg your pardon your eyes are too big and your mouth is just a bit wider than it should be insulted she slapped his hand away it embarrassed and infuriated her that shed actually expected a compliment my eyes and mouth are none of your business very much mine he corrected im doing your face when she frowned a faint line etched between her brows he liked it youre doing what your face in rosewood i think and with your hair down like this again she pushed his hand away if youre asking me to model for you im afraid im not interested it doesnt matter whether you are i am he took her arm to lead her to the door if you think im flatteredвђ why should you be he opened the door then stood just inside studying her with apparent curiosity you were born with your face you didnt earn it if i said you sang well or danced well or kissed well you could be flattered he eased her out then closed the door do you he asked almost in afterthought ruffled and irritated she snapped back do i what kiss well her brows lifted haughty arches over frosty eyes the day you find out you can be flattered rather pleased with the line she started down the hall ahead of him his fingers barely touched herвђshe would have sworn it but in the space of a heartbeat her back was to the wall and she was caged between his arms with his hands planted on either side of her head both shock and a trembling river of fear came before she could even think to be insulted knowing he was being obnoxious enjoying it he kept his lips a few scant inches from hers he recognized the curling in his gut as desire and by god he could deal with that and her their breath met and tangled and he smiled hers had come out in a quick surprised puff i think he said slowly consideringly you have yet to learn how to kiss well you have the mouth for it his gaze lowered lingered there but a man would have to be patient enough to warm that blood up first a pity im not patient he was close enough to see her quick wince before her eyes went icy i think she said borrowing his tone that you probably kiss very well but a woman would have to be tolerant enough to hack through your ego first fortunately im not tolerant for a moment he stood where he was close enough to swoop down and test both their theories then the smile worked over his face curving his lips brightening his eyes yes he could deal with her when he was ready a man can learn patience milaya and seduce a woman to tolerance she pressed against the wall but like a cat backed into a corner she was ready to swipe and spit he only stepped back and cupped a hand over her elbow we should go now yes yes not at all sure if she was relieved or disappointed she walked with him toward the stairs chapter contents prev next margerite had pulled out all the stops she knew it was a coup to have a rising and mysterious artist such as stanislaski at her dinner party like a general girding for battle she had inspected the floral arrangements the kitchens the dining room and the terraces before she was done the caterers were cursing her but margerite was satisfied she wasnt pleased when her daughter along with her most important guest was late laughing and lilting she swirled among her guests in a frothy gown of robinsegg blue there was a sprinkling of politicians theater people and the idle rich but the ukrainian artist was her coup de grace and she was fretting to show him off and remembering that wild sexuality she was fretting to flirt the moment she spotted him margerite swooped mr stanislaski how marvelous after shooting her daughter a veiled censorious look she beamed mikhail please because he knew the game and played it at his will mikhail brought her hand to his lips and lingered over it you must forgive me for being late i kept your daughter waiting oh she fluttered her hand resting lightly possessively on his arm a smart woman will always wait for the right man then im forgiven absolutely her fingers gave his an intimate squeeze this time now you must let me introduce you around mikhail linked with him she glanced absently at her daughter sydney do mingle darling mikhail shot a quick wicked grin over his shoulder as he let margerite haul him away he made small talk easily sliding into the upper crust of new york society as seamlessly as he slid into the working class in soho or his parents closeknit neighborhood in brooklyn they had no idea he might have preferred a beer with friends or coffee at his mothers kitchen table he sipped champagne admired the house with its cool white walls and towering windows and complimented margerite on her art collection and all the while he chatted sipped and smiled he watched sydney odd he thought he would have said that the sprawling elegance of the long island enclave was the perfect setting for her her looks her demeanor reminded him of glistening shaved ice in a rare porcelain bowl yet she didnt quite fit oh she smiled and worked the room as skillfully as her mother her simple black dress was as exclusive as any of the more colorful choices in the room her sapphires winked as brilliantly as any of the diamonds or emeralds butвђ it was her eyes mikhail realized there wasnt laughter in them but impatience it was as though she were thinkingвђlets get this done and over with so i can get on to something important it made him smile remembering that hed have the long drive back to manhattan to tease her made the smile widen it faded abruptly as he watched a tall blond man with football shoulders tucked into a silk dinner jacket kiss sydney on the mouth sydney smiled into a pair of light blue eyes under golden brows hello charming hello yourself he offered a fresh glass of wine where did margerite find the wild horses im sorry to drag you out of that office his smile dispensed charm like penny candy sydney couldnt help but respond it wasnt quite that drastic i have been busy so youve told me he approved of her in the sleek black dress in much the same way he would have approved of a tasteful accessory for his home you missed a wonderful play the other night it looks like sondheims got another hit on his hands never doubting her acquiescence he took her arm to lead her into dinner tell me darling when are you going to stop playing the career woman and take a break im going up to the hamptons for the weekend and id love your company dutifully she forced her clamped teeth apart there was no use resenting the fact he thought she was playing everyone did im afraid i cant get away just now she took her seat beside him at the long glass table in the airy dining room the drapes were thrown wide so that the garden seemed to spill inside with the pastel hues of early roses late tulips and nodding columbine she wished the dinner had been alfresco so she could have sat among the blossoms and scented the sea air i hope you dont mind a little advice sydney nearly dropped her head into her hand the chatter around them was convivial glasses were clinking and the first course of stuffed mushrooms was being served she felt shed just been clamped into a cell of course not channing you can run a business or let the business run you hmm he had a habit of stating his advice in cliches sydney reminded herself she should be used to it take it from someone with more experience in these matters she fixed a smile on her face and let her mind wander i hate to see you crushed under the heel of responsibility he went on and after all we know youre a novice in the dogeatdog world of real estate gold cuff links monogrammed winked as he laid a hand on hers his eyes were sincere his mouth quirked in that imonlylookingoutforyou smile naturally your initial enthusiasm will push you to take on more than is good for you im sure you agree her mind flicked back actually channing i enjoy the work for the moment he said his voice so patronizing she nearly stabbed him with her salad fork but when reality rushes in you may find yourself trampled under it delegate sydney hand the responsibilities over to those who understand them if her spine had been any straighter it would have snapped her neck my grandfather entrusted hayward to me the elderly become sentimental but i cant believe he expected you to take it all so seriously his smooth lightly tanned brow wrinkled briefly in what she understood was genuine if misguided concern why youve hardly attended a party in weeks everyones talking about it are they she forced her lips to curve over her clenched teeth if he offered one more shred of advice she would have to upend the water goblet in his lap channing why dont you tell me about the play at the other end of the table tucked between margerite and mrs anthony lowell of the boston lowells mikhail kept a weather eye on sydney he didnt like the way she had her head together with pretty boy no by god he didnt the man was always touching her her hand her shoulder her soft white bare shoulder and she was just smiling and nodding as though his words were a fascination in themselves apparently the ice queen didnt mind being pawed if the hands doing the pawing were as lilywhite as her own mikhail swore under his breath i beg your pardon mikhail with an effort he turned his attention and a smile toward margerite nothing the pheasant is excellent thank you i wonder if i might ask what sydneys commissioned you to sculpt he flicked a black look down the length of the table ill be working on the project in soho ah margerite hadnt a clue what hayward might own in soho will it be an indoor or outdoor piece both who is the man beside sydney i dont think i met him oh thats channing channing warfield the warfields are old friends friends he repeated slightly mollified conspiratorily margerite leaned closer if i can confide wilhemina warfield and i are hoping theyll make an announcement this summer theyre such a lovely couple so suitable and since sydneys first marriage is well behind herвђ first marriage he swooped down on that tidbit of information like a hawk on a dove sydney was married before yes but im afraid she and peter were too young and impetuous she told him conveniently overlooking the family pressure that had brought the marriage about now sydney and channing are mature responsible people were looking forward to a spring wedding mikhail picked up his wine there was an odd and annoying scratching in his throat what does this channing warfield do do the question baffled her why the warfields are in banking so i suppose channing does whatever one does in banking hes a devil on the polo field polo mikhail repeated with a scowl so dark helena lowell choked on her pheasant helpfully mikhail gave her a sharp slap between the shoulder blades then offered her her water goblet youre ah russian arent you mr stanislaski helena asked images of cossacks danced in her head i was born in the ukraine the ukraine yes i believe i read something about your family escaping over the border when you were just a child we escaped in a wagon over the mountains into hungary then into austria and finally settled in new york a wagon margerite sighed into her wine how romantic mikhail remembered the cold the fear the hunger but he only shrugged he doubted romance was always pretty or comfortable relieved that he looked approachable again helena lowell began to ask him questions about art after an hour he was glad to escape from the pretensions of the society matrons art school jargon guests were treated to violin music breezy terraces and moonkissed gardens his hostess fluttered around him like a butterfly lashes batting laughter trilling margerites flirtations were patently obvious and didnt bother him she was a pretty vivacious woman currently between men though he had privately deduced she shared little with her daughter other than looks he considered her harmless even entertaining so when she offered to show him the rooftop patio he went along the wind off the sound was playful and fragrant and it was blessedly quiet following the ceaseless afterdinner chatter from the rail mikhail could see the water the curve of beach the serene elegance of other homes tucked behind walls and circling gardens and he could see sydney as she strolled to the shadowy corner of the terrace below with her arm tucked through channings my third husband built this house margerite was saying hes an architect when we divorced i had my choice between this house and the little villa in nice naturally with so many of my friends here i chose this with a sigh she turned to face him leaning prettily on the rail i must say i love this spot when i give house parties people are spread out on every level so its both cozy and private perhaps youll join us some weekend this summer perhaps the answer was absent as he stared down at sydney the moonlight made her hair gleam like polished mahogany margerite shifted just enough so that their thighs brushed mikhail wasnt sure if he was more surprised or more amused but to save her pride he smiled easing away slowly you have a lovely home it suits you id love to see your studio margerite let the invitation melt into her eyes where you create im afraid youd find it cramped hot and boring impossible smiling she traced a fingertip over the back of his hand im sure id find nothing about you boring good god the woman was old enough to be his mother and she was coming on to him like a mistyeyed virgin primed for her first tumble mikhail nearly sighed then reminded himself it was only a moment out of his life he took her hand between both of his hands margerite youre charming and imвђ he kissed her fingers lightly вђunsuitable she lifted a finger and brushed it over his cheek you underestimate yourself mikhail no but he realized how hed underestimated her on the terrace below sydney was trying to find a graceful way to discourage channing he was attentive dignified solicitous and he was boring her senseless it was her lack she was sure any woman with half a soul would be melting under the attraction of a man like channing there was moonlight music flowers the breeze in the leafy trees smelled of the sea and murmured of romance channing was talking about paris and his hand was skimming lightly over her bare back she wished she was home alone with her eyes crossing over a fat file of quarterly reports taking a deep breath she turned she would have to tell him firmly simply and straight out that he needed to look elsewhere for companionship it was sydneys bad luck that she happened to glance up to see mikhail on the rooftop with her mother just when he took margerites hand to his lips why theвђ she couldnt think of anything vile enough to call him slime was too simple gigolo too slick he was nuzzling up to her mother her mother when only hours before hed beenвђ nothing sydney reminded herself and dismissed the tense scene in the soho hallway from her mind hed been posturing and preening that was all and she could have killed him for it as she watched mikhail backed away from margerite laughing then he looked down the instant their eyes met sydney declared war she whirled on channing her face so fierce he nearly babbled kiss me she demanded why sydney i said kiss me she grabbed him by the lapels and hauled him against her of course darling pleased with her change of heart he cupped her shoulders in his hands and leaned down to her his lips were soft warm eager they slanted over hers with practiced precision while his hands slid down her hack he tasted of afterdinner mints her body fit well against his and she felt nothing nothing but an empty inner rage then a chill that was both fear and despair youre not trying darling he whispered you know i wont hurt you no he wouldnt there was nothing at all to fear from channing miserable she let him deepen the kiss ordered herself to feel and respond she felt his withdrawal even before his lips left hers the twinges of annoyance and puzzlement sydney dear im not sure what the problem is he smoothed down his crinkled lapels marginally frustrated he lifted his eyes that was like kissing my sister im tired channing she said to the air between them i should go in and get ready to go twenty minutes later the driver turned the car toward manhattan in the back seat sydney sat ramrod straight well over in her comer while mikhail sprawled in his they didnt bother to speak not even the polite nonentities of two people who had attended the same function he was boiling with rage she was frigid with disdain shed done it to annoy him mikhail decided shed let that silksuited jerk all but swallow her whole just to make him suffer why was he suffering he asked himself she was nothing to him no she was something he corrected and brooded into the dark his only problem was figuring out exactly what that something was obviously sydney reflected the man had no ethics no morals no shame here he was just sitting there all innocence and quiet reflection after his disgraceful behavior she frowned at the pale image of her own face in the window glass and tried to listen to the chopin prelude on the stereo flirting so blatantly with a woman twenty years older sneering yes positively sneering down from the rooftop and shed hired him sydney let out a quiet hissing breath from between her teeth oh that was something she regretted shed let her concern her determination to do the right thing blind her into hiring some oversexed amoral russian carpenter well if he thought he was going to start playing pattycake with her mother he was very much mistaken she drew a breath turned and aimed one steady glare mikhail would have sworn the temperature in the car dropped fifty degrees in a snap you stay away from my mother he slanted her a look from under his lashes and gracefully crossed his legs excuse me you heard me boris if you think im going to stand by and watch you put the moves on my mother think again shes lonely and vulnerable her last divorce upset her and she isnt over it he said something short and sharp in his native tongue and closed his eyes temper had sydney sliding across the seat until she could poke his arm what the hell does that mean you want translation the simplest is bullshit now shut up im going to sleep youre not going anywhere until we settle this you keep your big grimy hands off my mother or ill turn that building youre so fond of into a parking lot his eyes slitted open she found the glitter of angry eyes immensely satisfying a big threat from a small woman he said in a deceptively lazy voice she was entirely too close for his comfort and her scent was swimming in his senses tangling his temper with something more basic you should concentrate on the suit and let your mother handle her own suit what suit the banker who spent the evening sniffing your ankles her face flooded with color he certainly was not hes entirely too well mannered to sniff at my ankles or anything else and channing is my business so you have your business and i have mine now lets see what we have together one moment he was stretched out and the next he had her twisted over his lap stunned sydney pressed her hands against his chest and tried to struggle out of his hold he tightened it as you see i have no manners oh i know it she tossed her head back chin jutting what do you think youre doing he wished to hell he knew she was rigid as an ice floe but there was something incredible and lord inevitable about the way she fit into his arms though he was cursing himself he held her close close enough that he felt the uneven rise and fall of her breasts against his chest tasted the sweet winetipped flavor of her breath on his lips there was a lesson here he thought grimly and she was going to learn it ive decided to teach you how to kiss from what i saw from the roof you did a poor job of it with the polo player shock and fury had her going still she would not squirm or scream or give him the satisfaction of frightening her his eyes were close and challenging she thought she understood exactly how lucifer would have looked as he walked through the gates of his own dark paradise you conceited jerk because she wanted to slug him badly she fisted her hands closed and looked haughtily down her small straight nose theres nothing you can teach me no he wondered if hed be better off just strangling her and having done with it lets see then your channing put his hands here yes he slid them over her shoulders the quick involuntary shudder chilled her skin you afraid of me milaya dont be ridiculous but she was suddenly and deeply she swallowed the fear as his thumbs caressed her bare skin tremble is good it makes a man feel strong i dont think you trembled for this channing she said nothing and wondered if he knew his accent had thickened it sounded exotic erotic he wondered he could speak at all with her watching him and waiting his way isnt mine he muttered ill show you his fingers clamped around the back of her neck pulled her face toward his he heard her breath catch then shudder out when he paused only a fraction before their lips touched her eyes filled his vision that wide wary blue ignoring the twist in his gut he smiled turned his head just an inch and skimmed his lips over her jawline she bit back only part of the moan instinctively she tipped her head back giving him access to the long sensitive column of her throat what was he doing to her her mind raced frantically to catch up with her soaring body why didnt he just get it over with so she could escape with her pride intact shed kill him for this crush him destroy him and oh it felt wonderful delicious wicked he could only think she tasted of morningвђcool spring mornings when the dew slicked over green green grass and new flowers she shivered against him her body still held stiffly away even as her head fell back in surrender who was she he nibbled lazily over to her ear and burned for her to show him a thousand a million pinpricks of pleasure danced along her skin shaken by them she started to pull away but his hands slid down her back and melted her spine all the while his lips teased and tormented never never coming against hers to relieve the aching pressure she wanted the slow flickering heat kindling in the pit of her stomach she yearned spreading spreading through her blood and bone she needed wave after wave of liquid fire lapping cruising flowing over her skin she took in a fire flash her system exploded mouth to mouth she strained against him pressing ice to heat and letting it steam until the air was so thick with it it clogged in her throat her fingers speared through his hair and fisted as she fed greedily on the stunning flavor of her own passion this at last this he was rough and restless and smelled of man instead of expensive colognes the words he muttered were incomprehensible against her mouth but they didnt sound like endearments reassurances promises they sounded like threats his mouth wasnt soft and warm and eager but hot and hard and ruthless she wanted that how she wanted the heedless and hasty meeting of lips and tongues his hands werent hesitant or practiced but strong and impatient it ran giddily through her brain that he would take what he wanted when and where it suited him the pleasure and power of it burst through her like sunlight she choked out his name when he tugged her bodice down and filled his calloused hands with her breasts he was drowning in her the ice had melted and he was over his head too dazed to know if he should dive deeper or scrabble for the surface the scent the taste oh lord the texture alabaster and silk and rose petals every fine thing a man could want to touch to steal to claim as his own his hands raced over her as he fought for more on an oath he shifted and she was under him on the long plush seat of the car her hair spread out like melted copper her body moving moving under his her white breasts spilling out above the stark black dress and tormenting him into tasting she arched and her fingers dug into his back as he suckled a deep and delicious ache tugged at the center of her body and she wanted him there there where the heat was most intense there where she felt so soft so needy please she could hear the whimper in her voice but felt no embarrassment only desperation mikhail please the throaty purr of her voice burst in his blood he came back to her mouth assaulting it devouring it crazed he hooked one hand in the top of her dress on the verge of ripping it from her and he looked looked at her face the huge eyes the trembling lips light and shadow washed over it leaving her pale as a ghost she was shaking like a leaf beneath his hands and he heard the drum of traffic from outside he surfaced abruptly shaking his head to clear it and gulping in air like a diver down too long they were driving through the city their privacy as thin as the panel of smoked glass that separated them from her chauffeur and he was mauling her yes mauling her as if he were a reckless teenager with none of the sense god had given him the apology stuck in his throat an i beg your pardon would hardly do the trick eyes grim loins aching he tugged her dress back into place she only stared at him and made him feel like a drooling heathen over a virgin sacrifice and lord help him he wanted to plunder swearing he pushed away and yanked her upright he leaned back in the shadows and stared out of the dark window they were only blocks from his apartment blocks and hed very nearlyвђ it wouldnt do to think about what hed nearly were almost there strain had his voice coming out clipped and hard sydney winced away as though it had been a slap what had she done wrong this time shed felt and shed wanted felt and wanted more than she ever had before yet she had still failed for that one timeless moment shed been willing to toss aside pride and fear there had been passion in her real and ready and shed thought hed felt passion for her but not enough she closed her eyes it never seemed to be enough now she was cold freezing and wrapped her arms tight to try to hold in some remnant of heat damn it why didnt she say something mikhail dragged an unsteady hand through his hair he deserved to be slapped shot was more like it and she just sat there as he brooded out the window he reminded himself that it hadnt been all his doing shed been as rash pressing that wonderful body against his letting that wide mobile mouth make him crazy squirting that damnable perfume all over that soft skin until hed been drunk with it he started to feel better yes there had been two people grappling in the back seat she was every bit as guilty as he look sydney he turned and she jerked back like an overwound spring dont touch me he heard only the venom and none of the tears fine guilt hammered away at him as the car cruised to the curb ill keep my big grimy hands off you hayward call someone else when you want a little romp in the back seat her fisted hands held on to pride and composure i meant what i said about my mother he shoved the door open light spilled in splashing over his face turning it frosty white so did i thanks for the ride when the door slammed she closed her eyes tight she would not cry a single tear slipped past her guard and was dashed away she would not cry and she would not forget chapter contents prev next shed put in a long day actually shed put in a long week that was edging toward sixty hours between office time luncheon meetings and evenings at home with files this particular day had a few hours yet to run but sydney recognized the new feeling of relief and satisfaction that came with friday afternoons when the work force began to anticipate saturday mornings throughout her adult life one day of the week had been the same as the next all of them a scattershot of charity functions shopping and lunch dates there had been no work schedule and weekends had simply been a time when the parties had lasted longer things had changed as she read over a new contract she was glad they had she was beginning to understand why her grandfather had always been so lusty and full of life hed had a purpose a place a goal now they were hers true she still had to ask advice on the more technical wordings of contracts and depended heavily on her board when it came to making deals but she was starting to appreciateвђmore she was starting to relish the grand chess game of buying and selling buildings she circled what she considered a badly worded clause then answered her intercom mr bingham to see you ms hayward send him in janine oh and see if you can reach frank marlowe at marlowe radcliffe and smyth yes maam when lloyd strode in a moment later sydney was still huddled over the contract she held up one finger to give herself a minute to finish lloyd im sorry if i lose my concentration on all these whereases i have to start over she scrawled a note to herself set it and the contract aside then smiled at him what can i do for you this soho project its gotten entirely out of hand her lips tightened thinking of soho made her think of mikhail mikhail reminded her of the turbulent ride from long island and her latest failure as a woman she didnt care for it in what way in every way with fury barely leashed he began to pace her office a quarter of a million you earmarked a quarter of a million to rehab that building sydney stayed where she was and quietly folded her hands on the desk im aware of that lloyd considering the condition of the building mr stanislaskis bid was very reasonable how would you know he shot back did you get competing bids no her fingers flexed then relaxed again it was difficult but she reminded herself that hed earned his way up the ladder while shed been hoisted to the top rung i went with my instincts instincts eyes narrowed he spun back to her the derision in his voice was as thick as the pile of her carpet youve been in the business for a matter of months and you have instincts thats right im also aware that the estimate for rewiring the plumbing and the carpentry were well in line with other similar rehabs damn it sydney we didnt put much more than that into this building last year one slim finger began to tap on the desk what we did here in the hayward building was little more than decorating a good many of the repairs in soho are a matter of safety and bringing the facilities up to code a quarter of a million in repairs he slapped his palms on the desk and leaned forward sydney was reminded of mikhail making a similar gesture but of course lloyds hands would leave no smudge of dirt do you know what our annual income is from those apartments as a matter of fact i do she rattled off a figure surprising him it was accurate to the penny on one hand it will certainly take more than a year of full occupancy to recoup the principal on this investment on the other when people pay rent in good faith they deserve decent housing decent certainly lloyd said stiffly youre mixing morals with business oh i hope so i certainly hope so he drew back infuriated that she would sit so smug and righteous behind a desk that should have been his youre naive sydney that may be but as long as i run this company it will be run by my standards you think you run it because you sign a few contracts and make phone calls youve put a quarter million into what you yourself termed your pet project and you dont have a clue what this stanislaskis up to how do you know he isnt buying inferior grades and pocketing the excess thats absurd as i said youre naive you put some russian artist in charge of a major project then dont even bother to check the work i intend to inspect the project myself ive been tied up and i have mr stanislaskis weekly report he sneered before sydneys temper could fray she realized lloyd was right shed hired mikhail on impulse and instinct then because of personal feelings had neglected to follow through with her involvement on the project that wasnt naive it was gutless youre absolutely right lloyd and ill correct it she leaned back in her chair was there anything else youve made a mistake he said a costly one in this case the board wont tolerate another with her hands laid lightly on the arms of her chair she nodded and youre hoping to convince them that you belong at this desk theyre businessmen sydney and though sentiment might prefer a hayward at the head of the table profit and loss will turn the tide her expression remained placid her voice steady im sure youre right again and if the board continues to back me i want one of two things from you your resignation or your loyalty i wont accept anything in between now if youll excuse me when the door slammed behind him she reached for the phone but her hand was trembling and she drew it back she plucked up a paper clip and mangled it then another then a third between that and the two sheets of stationery she shredded she felt the worst of the rage subside clearheaded she faced the facts lloyd bingham was an enemy and he was an enemy with experience and influence she had acted in haste with soho not that shed been wrong she didnt believe shed been wrong but if there were mistakes lloyd would capitalize on them and drop them right in her lap was it possible that she was risking everything her grandfather had given her with one project could she be forced to step down if she couldnt prove the worth and right of what she had done she wasnt sure and that was the worst of it one step at a time that was the only way to go on and the first step was to get down to soho and do her job the sky was the color of drywall over the past few days the heat had ebbed but it had flowed back into the city that morning like a river flooding manhattan with humidity the pedestrian traffic surged through it streaming across the intersections in hot little packs girls in shorts and men in wilted business suits crowded around the sidewalk vendors in hopes that an icecream bar or a soft drink would help them beat the heat when sydney stepped out of her car the sticky oppression of the air punched like a fist she thought of her driver sitting in the enclosed car and dismissed him for the day shielding her eyes she turned to study her building scaffolding crept up the walls like metal ivy windows glittered their manufacturer stickers slashed across the glass she thought she saw a pair of arthritic hands scraping away at a label at a thirdfloor window there were signs in the doorway warning of construction in progress she could hear the sounds of it booming hammers buzzing saws the clang of metal and the tinny sound of rock and roll through portable speakers at the curb she saw the plumbers van a dented pickup and a scattering of interested onlookers since they were all peering up she followed their direction and saw mikhail for an instant her heart stopped dead he stood outside the top floor five stories up moving nimbly on what seemed to sydney to be a very narrow board man get a load of those buns a woman beside her sighed they are class a sydney swallowed she supposed they were and his naked back wasnt anything to sneeze at either the trouble was it was hard to enjoy it when she had a hideous flash of him plummeting off the scaffolding and breaking that beautiful back on the concrete below panicked she rushed inside the elevator doors were open and a couple of mechanics were either loading or unloading their tools inside it she didnt stop to ask but bolted up the steps sweaty men were replastering the stairwell between two and three they took the time to whistle and wink but she kept climbing someone had the television up too loud probably to drown out the sound of construction a baby was crying fitfully she smelled chicken frying without pausing for breath she dashed from four to five there was music playing here tough and gritty rock poorly accompanied by a laborer in an offkey tenor mikhails door was open and sydney streaked through she nearly tumbled over a graying man with arms like tree trunks he rose gracefully from his crouched position where hed been sorting tools and steadied her im sorry i didnt see you is all right i like women to fall at my feet she registered the slavic accent even as she glanced desperately around the room for mikhail maybe everybody in the building was russian she thought frantically maybe hed imported plumbers from the mother country can i help you no yes she pressed a hand to her heart when she realized she was completely out of breath mikhail he is just outside intrigued he watched her as he jerked a thumb toward the window she could sec him thereвђat least she could see the flat tanned torso outside but butвђ we are finishing for the day you will sit get him in sydney whispered please get him in before he could respond the window was sliding up and mikhail was tossing one long muscled leg inside he said something in his native tongue laughter in his voice as the rest of his body followed when he saw sydney the laughter vanished hayward he tapped his caulking gun against his palm what were you doing out there the question came out in an accusing rush replacing windows he set the caulking gun aside is there a problem no iвђ she couldnt remember ever feeling more of a fool i came by to check the progress so ill take you around in a minute he walked into the kitchen stuck his head into the sink and turned the faucet on full cold hes a hothead the man behind her said chuckling at his own humor when sydney only managed a weak smile he called out to mikhail speaking rapidly in that exotic foreign tongue tak was all he said mikhail came up dripping hair streaming over the bandanna hed tied around it he shook it back splattering water then shrugged and hooked his thumbs in his belt loops he was wet sweaty and halfnaked sydney had to fold her tongue inside her mouth to keep it from hanging out my son is rude yuri stanislaski shook his head i raised him better yourвђoh sydney looked back at the man with the broad face and beautiful hands mikhails hands how do you do mr stanislaski i do well i am yuri i ask my son if you are the hayward who owns this business he only says yes and scowls yes well i am its a good building only a little sick and we are the doctors he grinned at his son then boomed out something else in ukrainian this time an answering smile tugged at mikhails mouth no you havent lost a patient yet papa go home and have your dinner yuri hauled up his tool chest you come and bring the pretty lady your mama makes enough oh well thank you butвђ im busy tonight papa mikhail cut off sydneys polite refusal yuri raised a bushy brow youre stupid tonight he said in ukrainian is this the one who makes you sulk all week annoyed mikhail picked up a kitchen towel and wiped his face women dont make me sulk yuri only smiled this one would then he turned to sydney now i am rude too talking so you dont understand he is bad influence he lifted her hand and kissed it with considerable charm i am glad to meet you im glad to meet you too put on a shirt yuri ordered his son then left whistling hes very nice sydney said yes mikhail picked up the tshirt hed peeled off hours before but only held it so you want to see the work yes i thoughtвђ the windows are done he interrupted the wiring is almost done that and the plumbing will take another week come he moved out skirting her by a good two feet then walked into the apartment next door without knocking keelys he told her she is out the room was a clash of sharp colors and scents the furniture was old and sagging but covered with vivid pillows and various articles of female attire the adjoining kitchen was a messвђnot with dishes or pots and pansвђbut with walls torn down to studs and thick wires snaked through it must be inconvenient for her for everyone during the construction better than plugging in a cake mixer and shorting out the building the old wire was tube and knob forty years old or more and frayed this is romex more efficient safer she bent over his arm studying the wiring well hmm he nearly smiled perhaps he would have if she hadnt smelled so good instead he moved a deliberate foot away after the inspection we will put up new walls come it was a trial for both of them but he took her through every stage of the work moving from floor to floor showing her elbows of plastic pipe and yards of copper tubing most of the flooring can be saved with sanding and refinishing but some must be replaced he kicked at a square of plywood hed nailed to a hole in the secondfloor landing sydney merely nodded asking questions only when they seemed intelligent most of the workers were gone off to cash their weeks paychecks the noise level had lowered so that she could hear muted voices behind closed doors snatches of music or televised car chases she lifted a brow at the sound of a tenor sax swinging into rhapsody in blue thats will metcalf mikhail told her hes good plays in a band yes hes good the rail felt smooth and sturdy under her hand as they went down mikhail had done that she thought hed fixed repaired replaced as needed because he cared about the people who lived in the building he knew who was playing the sax or eating the fried chicken whose baby was laughing are you happy with the progress she asked quietly the tone of her voice made him look at her something hed been trying to avoid a few tendrils of hair had escaped their pins to curl at her temples he could see a pale dusting of freckles across her nose happy enough its you who should answer its your building no its not her eyes were very serious very sad its yours i only write the checks sydneyвђ ive seen enough to know youve made a good start she was hurrying down the steps as she spoke be sure to contact my office when its time for the next draw damn it slow down he caught up with her at the bottom of the steps and grabbed her arm whats wrong with you first you stand in my room pale and out of breath now you run away and your eyes are miserable it had hit her hard that she had no community of people who cared her circle of friends was so narrow so selfinvolved her best friend had been peter and that had been horribly spoiled her life was on the sidelines and she envied the involvement the closeness she felt in this place the building wasnt hers she thought again she only owned it im not running away and nothings wrong with me she had to get out get away but she had to do it with dignity i take this job very seriously its my first major project since taking over hayward i want it done right and i took a chance byвђ she trailed off glancing toward the door just to her right she could have sworn shed heard someone call for help television she thought but before she could continue she heard the thin pitiful call again mikhail do you hear that hear what how could he hear anything when he was trying not to kiss her again in here she turned toward the door straining her ears yes in here i heardвђ that time hed heard it too lifting a fist he pounded on the door mrs wolburg mrs wolburg its mik the shaky voice barely penetrated the wood hurt help me oh god shesвђ before sydney could finish mikhail rammed his shoulder against the door with the second thud it crashed open to lean drunkenly on its hinges in the kitchen mrs wolburg called weakly mik thank god he bolted through the apartment with its starched doilies and paper flowers to find her on the kitchen floor she was a tiny woman mostly bone and thin flesh her usually neat cap of white hair was matted with sweat cant see she said dropped my glasses dont worry he knelt beside her automatically checking her pulse as he studied her painfilled eyes call an ambulance he ordered sydney but she was already on the phone im not going to help you up because i dont know how youre hurt hip she gritted her teeth at the awful radiating pain i think i busted my hip fell caught my foot couldnt move all the noise nobody could hear me calling been here two three hours got so weak its all right now he tried to chafe some heat into her hands sydney get a blanket and pillow she had them in her arms and was already crouching beside mrs wolburg before hed finished the order here now im just going to lift your head a little gently she set the womans limp head on the pillow despite the raging heat mrs wolburg was shivering with cold as she continued to speak in quiet soothing tones sydney tucked the blanket around her just a few more minutes sydney murmured and stroked the clammy forehead a crowd was forming at the door though he didnt like leaving sydney with the injured woman he rose i want to keep the neighbors away send someone to keep an eye for the ambulance fine while fear pumped hard in her heart she continued to smile down at mrs wolburg you have a lovely apartment do you crochet the doilies yourself been doing needlework for sixty years since i was pregnant with my first daughter theyre beautiful do you have other children six three of each and twenty grandchildren five greatвђ she shut her eyes on a flood of pain then opened them again and managed a smile been after me for living alone but i like my own place and my own way of course and my daughter lizzy moved clear out to phoenix arizona now what would i want to live out there for sydney smiled and stroked i couldnt say theyll be on me now she muttered and let her eyes close again wouldnt have happened if i hadnt dropped my glasses terrible nearsighted getting olds hell girl and dont let anyone tell you different couldnt see where i was going and snagged my foot in that torn linoleum mik told me to keep it taped down but i wanted to give it a good scrub she managed a wavery smile least ive been lying here on a clean floor paramedics are coming up mikhail said from behind her sydney only nodded filled with a terrible guilt and anger she was afraid to voice you call my grandson mik he lives up on eightyfirst hell take care of the rest of the family dont worry about it mrs wolburg fifteen efficient minutes later sydney stood on the sidewalk watching as the stretcher was lifted into the back of the ambulance did you reach her grandson she asked mikhail i left a message on his machine nodding she walked to the curb and tried to hail a cab wheres your car i sent him home i didnt know how long id be and it was too hot to leave him sitting there maybe i should go back in and call a cab in a hurry she winced as the siren shrieked i want to get to the hospital nonplussed he jammed his hands into his pockets theres no need for you to go she turned and her eyes in the brief moment they held his were ripe with emotion saying nothing she faced away until a cab finally swung to the curb nor did she speak when mikhail climbed in behind her she hated the smell of hospitals layers of illness antiseptics fear and heavy cleaners the memory of the last days her grandfather had lain dying were still too fresh in her mind the emergency room of the downtown hospital added one more layer fresh blood sydney steeled herself against it and walked through the crowds of the sick and injured to the admitting window you had a mrs wolburg just come in thats right the clerk stabbed keys on her computer you family no iвђ were going to need some family to fill out these forms patient said she wasnt insured mikhail was already leaning over eyes dangerous when sydney snapped out her answer hayward industries will be responsible for mrs wolburgs medical expenses she reached into her bag for identification and slapped it onto the counter im sydney hayward where is mrs wolburg in x ray the frost in sydneys eyes had the clerk shifting in her chair dr cohens attending so they waited drinking bad coffee among the moans and tears of inner city er sometimes sydney would lay her head back against the wall and shut her eyes she appeared to be dozing but all the while she was thinking what it would be like to be old and alone and helpless he wanted to think she was only there to cover her butt oh yes he wanted to think that of her it was so much more comfortable to think of her as the head of some bloodless company than as a woman but he remembered how quickly she had acted in the wolburg apartment how gentle she had been with the old woman and most of all he remembered the look in her eyes out on the street all that misery and compassion and guilt welling up in those big eyes she tripped on the linoleum sydney murmured it was the first time shed spoken in nearly an hour and mikhail turned his head to study her her eyes were still closed her face pale and in repose she was only walking in her own kitchen and fell because the floor was old and unsafe youre making it safe sydney continued as if she hadnt heard then she could only lie there hurt and alone her voice was so weak i nearly walked right by you didnt walk by his hand hesitated over hers then with an oath he pressed his palm to the back of her hand youre only one hayward sydney your grandfatherвђ he was ill her hand clenched under mikhails and her eyes squeezed more tightly closed he was sick nearly two years and i was in europe i didnt know he didnt want to disrupt my life my father was dead and there was only me and he didnt want to worry me when he finally called me it was almost over he was a good man he wouldnt have let things get so bad but he couldntвђ he just couldnt she let out a short shuddering breath mikhail turned her hand over and linked his fingers with hers when i got to new york he was in the hospital he looked so small so tired he told me i was the only hayward left then he died she said wearily and i was youre doing what needs to be done no one can ask for more than that she opened her eyes again met his i dont know they waited again in silence it was nearly two hours before mrs wolburgs frantic grandson rushed in the entire story had to be told again before he hurried off to call the rest of his family four hours after theyd walked into emergency the doctor came out to fill them in a fractured hip a mild concussion she would be moved to a room right after shed finished in recovery her age made the break serious but her health helped balance that sydney left both her office and home numbers with the doctor and the grandson requesting to be kept informed of mrs wolburgs condition unbearably weary in body and mind sydney walked out of the hospital you need food mikhail said what no really im just tired ignoring that he grabbed her arm and pulled her down the street why do you always say the opposite of what i say i dont see you did it again you need meat if she kept trying to drag her heels he was going to pull her arm right out of the socket annoyed she scrambled to keep pace what makes you think you know what i need because i do he pulled up short at a light and she bumped into him before he could stop it his hand had lifted to touch her face god youre so beautiful while she blinked in surprise he swore scowled then dragged her into the street seconds before the light turned maybe im not happy with you he went on muttering to himself maybe i think youre a nuisance and a snob andвђ i am not a snob he said something vaguely familiar in his native language sydneys chin set when she recalled the translation it is not bull youre the snob if you think i am just because i come from a different background he stopped eyeing her with a mixture of distrust and interest fine then you wont mind eating in here he yanked her into a noisy bar and grill she found herself plopped down in a narrow booth with him hip to hip there were scents of meat cooking onions frying spilled beer all overlaid with grease her mouth watered i said i wasnt hungry and i say youre a snob and a liar the color that stung her cheeks pleased him but it didnt last long enough she leaned forward and would you like to know what i think of you again he lifted a hand to touch her cheek it was irresistible yes i would she was saved from finding a description in her suddenly murky brain by the waitress two steaks medium rare and two of what youve got on tap i dont like men to order for me sydney said tightly then you can order for me next time and well be even making himself comfortable he tossed his arm over the back of the booth and stretched out his legs why dont you take off your jacket hayward youre hot stop telling me what i am and stop that too what playing with my hair he grinned i was playing with your neck i like your neck to prove it he skimmed a finger down it again she clamped her teeth on the delicious shudder that followed it down her spine i wish youd move over okay he shifted closer better calm she told herself she would be calm after a cleansing breath she turned her head if you dontвђ and his lips brushed over hers stopping the words and the thought behind them i want you to kiss me back she started to shake her head but couldnt manage it i want to watch you when you do he murmured i want to know whats there theres nothing there but his mouth closed over hers and proved her a liar she fell into the kiss one hand lost in his hair the other clamped on his shoulder she felt everything everything and it all moved too fast her mind seemed to dim until she could barely hear the clatter and bustle of the bar but she felt his mouth angle over hers his teeth nip his tongue seduce whatever she was doing to him he was doing to her he knew it he saw it in the way her eyes glazed before they closed felt it in the hot ready passion of her lips it was supposed to soothe his ego prove a point but it did neither it only left him aching sorry to break this up the waitress slapped two frosted mugs on the table steaks on its way sydney jerked her head back his arms were still around her though his grip had loosened and she she was plastered against him her body molded to his as they sat in a booth in a public place shame and fury battled for supremacy as she yanked herself away that was a despicable thing to do he shrugged and picked up his beer i didnt do it alone over the foam his eyes sharpened not this time or last time last time youвђ what sydney lifted her mug and sipped gingerly i dont want to discuss it he wanted to argue even started to but there was a sheen of hurt in her eyes that baffled him he didnt mind making her angry hell he enjoyed it but he didnt know what hed done to make her hurt he waited until the waitress had set the steaks in front of them youve had a rough day he said so kindly sydney gasped i dont mean to make it worse itsвђ she struggled with a response its been a rough day all around lets just put it behind us done smiling he handed her a knife and fork eat your dinner well have a truce good she discovered she had an appetite after all chapter contents prev next sydney didnt know how mildred wolburgs accident had leaked to the press but by tuesday afternoon her office was flooded with calls from reporters a few of the more enterprising staked out the lobby of the hayward building and cornered her when she left for the day by wednesday rumors were flying around the offices that hayward was facing a multimilliondollar suit and sydney had several unhappy board members on her hands the consensus was that by assuming responsibility for mrs wolburgs medical expenses sydney had admitted haywards neglect and had set the company up for a large public settlement it was bad press and bad business knowing no route but the direct one sydney prepared a statement for the press and agreed to an emergency board meeting by friday she thought as she walked into the hospital she would know if she would remain in charge of hayward or whether her position would be whittled down to figurehead carrying a stack of paperbacks in one hand and a potted plant in the other sydney paused outside of mrs wolburgs room because it was sydneys third visit since the accident she knew the widow wasnt likely to be alone invariably friends and family streamed in and out during visiting hours this time she saw mikhail keely and two of mrs wolburgs children mikhail spotted her as sydney was debating whether to slip out again and leave the books and plant shed brought at the nurses station you have more company mrs wolburg sydney the widows eyes brightened behind her thick lenses more books your grandson told me you liked to read feeling awkward she set the books on the table beside the bed and took mrs wolburgs outstretched hand my harry used to say id rather read than eat the thin bony fingers squeezed sydneys thats a beautiful plant i noticed you have several in your apartment she smiled feeling slightly more relaxed as the conversation in the room picked up again to flow around them and the last time i was here the room looked like a florists shop she glanced around at the banks of cut flowers in vases pots baskets even in a ceramic shoe so i settled on an african violet i do have a weakness for flowers and growing things set it right there on the dresser will you dear between the roses and the carnations shes getting spoiled as sydney moved to comply the visiting daughter winked at her brother flowers presents pampering well be lucky to ever get homebaked cookies again oh i might have a batch or two left in me mrs wolburg preened in her new crocheted bed jacket mik tells me im getting a brandnew oven eye level so i wont have to bend and stoop so i think i should get the first batch mikhail said as he sniffed the roses the chocolate chip please keely pressed a hand to her stomach im dieting im getting murdered next week and i have to look my best she noted sydneys stunned expression and grinned death stalk she explained my first tv movie im the third victim of the maniacal psychopath i get strangled in this really terrific negligee you shouldnt have left your windows unlocked mrs wolburg told her and keely grinned again well thats show biz sydney waited until a break in the conversation then made her excuses mikhail gave her a tensecond lead before he slipped a yellow rose out of a vase see you later beautiful he kissed mrs wolburg on the cheek and left her chuckling in a few long strides he caught up with sydney at the elevators hey you look like you could use this he offered the flower it couldnt hurt after sniffing the bloom she worked up a smile thanks you want to tell me why youre upset im not upset she jabbed the down button again never argue with an artist about your feelings insistently he tipped back her chin with one finger i see fatigue and distress worry and annoyance the ding of the elevator relieved her though she knew he would step inside the crowded car with her she frowned a little when she found herself pressed between mikhail and a large woman carrying a suitcasesized purse someone on the elevator had used an excess of expensive perfume fleetingly sydney wondered if that shouldnt be as illegal as smoking in a closed car any gypsies in your family she asked mikhail on impulse naturally id rather you use a crystal ball to figure out the future than analyze my feelings at the moment well see what we can do the car stopped on each floor people shuffled off or squeezed in by the time they reached the lobby sydney was hard up against mikhails side with his arm casually around her waist he didnt bother to remove it after theyd stepped off she didnt bother to mention it the works going well he told her good she didnt care to think how much longer shed be directly involved with the project the electrical inspection is done plumbing will perhaps take another week he studied her abstracted expression and we have decided to make the new roof out of blue cheese hmm she stepped outside stopped and looked back at him with a quick laugh she shook her head that might look very distinctiveвђbut risky with this heat you were listening almost absently she pressed fingers to her throbbing temple as her driver pulled up to the curb im sorry ive got a lot on my mind tell me it surprised her that she wanted to she hadnt been able to talk to her mother margerite would only be baffled channingвђthat was a joke sydney doubted that any of her friends would understand how she had become so attached to hayward in such a short time there really isnt any point she decided and started toward her waiting car and driver did she think he would let her walk away with that worry line between her brows and the tension knotted tight in her shoulders how about a lift home she glanced back the ride home from her mothers party was still a raw memory but he was smiling at her in an easy friendly fashion nonthreatening no he would never be that with those dark looks and untamed aura but they had agreed on a truce and it was only a few blocks sure well drop mr stanislaski off in soho donald yes maam she took the precaution of sliding casually she hoped all the way over to the far window mrs wolburg looks amazingly well considering she began shes strong it was mozart this tune he noted low and sweet through the car speakers the doctor says shell be able to go home with her son soon and youve arranged for the therapist to visit sydney stopped passing the rose from hand to hand and looked at him she told me he explained also that when she is ready to go home again there will be a nurse to stay with her until she is well enough to be on her own im not playing samaritan sydney mumbled im just trying to do whats right i realize that i realize too that youre concerned for her but theres something more on your mind is it the papers and the television news her eyes went from troubled to frigid i didnt assume responsibility for mrs wolburgs medical expenses for publicity good or bad and i dontвђ i know you didnt he cupped a hand over one of her clenched ones remember i was there i saw you with her sydney drew a deep breath she had to shed very nearly had a tirade and a lost temper was hardly the answer the point is she said more calmly an elderly woman was seriously injured her pain shouldnt become company politics or journalistic fodder what i did i did because i knew it was right i just want to make sure the right thing continues to be done you are president of hayward for the moment she turned to look out the window as they pulled up in front of the apartment building i see were making progress on the roof among other things because he was far from finished he leaned over her and opened the door on her side for a moment they were so close his body pressed lightly to hers she had an urge almost desperate to rub her fingers over his cheek to feel the rough stubble hed neglected to shave away id like you to come up he told her i have something for you sydney caught her fingers creeping up and snatched them back its nearly six i really shouldвђ come up for an hour he finished your driver can come back for you yes yes she shifted away not sure whether she wanted to get out or simply create some distance between them you can messenger your report over i could he moved another inch in defense sydney swung her legs out of the car all right then but i dont think itll take an hour but it will she relented because she preferred spending an hour going over a report than sitting in her empty apartment thinking about the scheduled board meeting after giving her driver instructions she walked with mikhail toward the building youve repaired the stoop tuesday it wasnt easy getting the men to stop sitting on it long enough he exchanged greetings with the three who were ranged across it now as sydney passed through the aroma of beer and tobacco we can take the elevator the inspection certificate is hardly dry she thought of the five long flights up i cant tell you how glad i am to hear that she stepped in with him waited while he pulled the open iron doors closed it has character now he said as they began the assent and you dont worry that youll get in to get downstairs and spend the night inside theres good news he pulled the doors open again as the car slid to a smooth quiet stop in the hallway the ceiling was gone leaving bare joists and new wiring exposed the water damage from leaking was bad mikhail said conversationally once the roof is finished well replace ive expected some complaints from the tenants but we havent received a single one isnt it difficult for everyone living in a construction zone mikhail jingled his keys inconvenient but everyone is excited and watches the progress mr stuben from the third floor comes up every morning before he leaves for work every day he says mikhail you have your work cut out for you he grinned as he opened the door some days id like to throw my hammer at him he stepped back and nudged her inside sit lips pursed sydney studied the room the furniture had been pushed together in the centerвђto make it easier to work she imagined tables were stacked on top of chairs the rug had been rolled up under the sheet hed tossed over his worktable were a variety of interesting shapes that were his sculptures his tools and blocks of wood yet to be carved it smelled like sawdust she thought and turpentine where he stopped on his way to the kitchen and looked back after a quick study he leaned into the jumble and lifted out an old oak rocker onehanded sydney noted and felt foolish and impressed here after setting it on a clear spot he headed back into the kitchen the surface of the rocker was smooth as satin when sydney sat she found the chair slipped around her like comforting arms ten seconds after shed settled she was moving it gently to and fro this is beautiful he could hear the faint creak as the rocker moved and didnt bother to turn i made it for my sister years ago when she had a baby his voice changed subtly as he turned on the kitchen tap she lost the baby lily after only a few months and it was painful for natasha to keep the chair im sorry the creaking stopped i cant think of anything worse for a parent to face because there is nothing he came back in carrying a glass of water and a bottle lily will always leave a little scar on the heart but tash has three children now so pain is balanced with joy here he put the glass in her hand then shook two aspirin out of the bottle you have a headache she frowned down at the pills he dropped into her palm true her head was splitting but she hadnt mentioned it i might have a little one she muttered how do you know i can see it in your eyes he waited until shed sipped and swallowed then walked behind the chair to circle her temples with his fingers its not such a little one either there was no doubt she should tell him to stop and she would any minute unable to resist she leaned back letting her eyes close as his fingers stroked away the worst of the pain is this what you had for me headache remedies her voice was so quiet so tired that his heart twisted a little no i have something else for you but it can wait until youre feeling better talk to me sydney tell me whats wrong maybe i can help its something i have to take care of myself okay will that change if you talk to me no she thought it was her problem her future but what harm would it do to talk it out to say it all out loud and hear someone elses viewpoint office politics she sighed as he began to massage the base of her neck his rough calloused fingers were as gentle as a mothers i imagine they can be tricky enough when you have experience all i have is the family name and my grandfathers last wishes the publicity on mrs wolburg has left my position in the company very shaky i assumed responsibility without going through channels or consulting legal the board isnt pleased with me his eyes had darkened but his hands remained gentle because you have integrity because i jumped the gun so to speak the resulting publicity only made things worse the consensus is that someone with more savvy could have handled the wolburg matterвђthats how its referred to at hayward the wolburg matter in a quiet tidy fashion theres a board meeting at noon on friday and they could very well request that i step down as president and will you i dont know he was working on her shoulders now competently thoroughly id like to fight draw the whole thing out then again the companys been in upheaval for over a year and having the president and the board as adversaries wont help hayward added to that my executive vice president and i are already on poor terms he feels perhaps justifiably that he should be in the number one slot she laughed softly there are times i wish he had it no you dont he resisted the urge to bend down and press his lips to the long slender column of her neck barely you like being in charge and i think youre good at it she stopped rocking to turn her head and stare at him youre the first person whos ever said that to me most of the people who know me think im playing at this or that im experiencing a kind of temporary insanity his hand slid lightly down her arm as he came around to crouch in front of her then they dont know you do they there were so many emotions popping through her as she kept her eyes on his but pleasure the simple pleasure of being understood was paramount maybe they dont she murmured maybe they dont i wont give you advice he picked up one of her hands because he enjoyed examining it the long ringless fingers the slender wrist the smooth cool skin i dont know about office politics or board meetings but i think youll do whats right you have a good brain and a good heart hardly aware that shed turned her hand over under his and linked them she smiled the connection was more complete than joined fingers and she couldnt understand it this was support a belief in her and an encouragement shed never expected to find odd that id have to come to a ukrainian carpenter for a pep talk thanks youre welcome he looked back into her eyes your headaches gone surprised she touched her fingers to her temple yes yes it is in fact she couldnt remember ever feeling more relaxed you could make a fortune with those hands he grinned and slid them up her arms pushing the sleeves of her jacket along so he could feel the bare flesh beneath its only a matter of knowing what to do with them and when and he knew exactly how he wanted to use those hands on her unfortunately the timing was wrong yes wellвђ it was happening again those little licks of fire in the pit of her stomach the trembling heat along her skin i really am grateful for everything i should be going you have time yet his fingers glided back down her arms to link with hers i havent given you your present present he was drawing her slowly to her feet now they were thigh to thigh her eyes level with his mouth it was curved and close sending her system into overdrive he had only to lean down inches bare inches imagining it nearly drove him crazy not an altogether unpleasant feeling he discovered this anticipation this wondering if she offered and only when she offered would he take dont you like presents milaya his voice was like hot cream pouring richly over her iвђ the report she said remembering werent you going to give me your report his thumbs skimmed over her wrist and felt the erratic beat of her pulse it was tempting very tempting i can send the report i had something else in mind somethingвђ her own mind quite simply shut down he laughed so delighted with her he wanted to kiss her breathless instead he released her hands and walked away she didnt move not an inch as he strolled over to the shelves and tossed up the drop cloth in a moment he was back pressing the little cinderella into her hand id like you to have this oh butвђ she tried really tried to form a proper refusal the words wouldnt come you dont like no i mean yes of course i like it its exquisite but why her fingers were already curving possessively around it when she lifted her eyes to his why would you give it to me because she reminds me of you shes lovely fragile unsure of herself the description had sydneys pleasure dimming most people would term her romantic im not most here as she runs away she doesnt believe enough he stroked a finger down the delicate folds of the ball gown she follows the rules without question its midnight and she was in the arms of her prince but she breaks away and runs because that was the rule and she is afraid afraid to let him see beneath the illusion to the woman she had to leave shed promised besides shed have been humiliated to have been caught there in rags and bare feet tilting his head mikhail studied her do you think he cared about her dress well no i dont suppose it would have mattered to him sydney let out an impatient breath as he grinned at her it was ridiculous standing here debating the psychology of a fairytale character in any case it ended happily and though ive nothing in common with cinderella the figurines beautiful ill treasure it good now ill walk you downstairs you dont want to be late for dinner with your mother she wont be there until eightthirty shes always late halfway through the door sydney stopped how did you know i was meeting my mother she told me ah two days ago we had a drink uptown sydney turned completely around so that he was standing on one side of the threshold she on the other you had drinks with my mother she asked spacing each word carefully yes lazily he leaned on the jamb before you try to turn me into an iceberg understand that i have no sexual interest in margerite thats lovely just lovely if she hadnt already put the figurine into her purse she might have thrown it in his face we agreed youd leave my mother alone we agreed nothing he corrected and i dont bother your mother there was little to be gained by telling her that margerite had called him three times before hed given in and met her it was a friendly drink and after it was done i think margerite understood we are unsuitable for anything but friendship particularly he said holding up a finger to block her interruption since i am very sexually interested in her daughter that stopped her words cold she swallowed struggled for composure and failed you are not all youre interested in is scoring a few macho points something flickered in his eyes would you like to come back inside so that i can show you exactly what im interested in no before she could stop herself shed taken a retreating step but i would like you to have the decency not to play games with my mother he wondered if margerite would leap so quickly to her daughters defense or if sydney would understand that her mother was only interested in a brief affair with a younger manвђsomething hed made very clear he wanted no part in since i would hate for your headache to come back after i went to the trouble to rid you of it i will make myself as clear as i can i have no intention of becoming romantically physically or emotionally involved with your mother does that suit you it would if i could believe you he didnt move not a muscle but she sensed he had cocked like the hammer on a gun his voice was low and deadly i dont lie she nodded cool as an ice slick just stick to hammering nails mikhail well get along fine and i can find my own way down she didnt whirl away but turned slowly and walked to the elevator though she didnt look back as she stepped inside she was well aware that he watched her go at noon sharp sydney sat at the head of the long walnut table of the boardroom ten men and two women were ranged down either side with crystal tumblers at their elbows pads and pens at the ready heavy brocade drapes were drawn back to reveal a wall of window tinted to cut the glare of sunlightвђhad there been any instead there was a thick curtain of rain gray as soot she could just make out the silhouette of the times building occasionally a murmur of thunder sneaked in through the stone and glass the gloom suited her sydney felt exactly like the reckless child summoned to the principals office she scanned the rows of faces some of whom had belonged in this office at this very table since before shed been born perhaps they would be the toughest to sway those who thought of her as the little girl who had come to hayward to bounce on grandfathers knee then there was lloyd halfway down the gleaming surface his face so smug so confident she wanted to snarl no she realized as his gaze flicked to hers and held she wanted to win ladies gentlemen the moment the meeting was called to order she rose before we begin discussion of the matter so much on our minds id like to make a statement youve already made your statement to the press sydney lloyd pointed out i believe everyone here is aware of your position there was a rippling murmur some agreement some dissent she let it fade before she spoke again nonetheless as the president and the major stockholder of hay ward i will have my say then the meeting will open for discussion her throat froze as all eyes fixed on her some were patient some indulgent some speculative i understand the boards unease with the amount of money allocated to the soho project of haywards holdings this building represents a relatively small annual income however this small income has been steady over the last ten years this complex has neededвђor i should say receivedвђlittle or no maintenance you know of course from the quarterly reports just how much this property has increased in value in this space of time i believe from a purely practical standpoint that the money i allocated is insurance to protect our investment she wanted to stop to pick up her glass and drain it but knew the gesture would make her seem as nervous as she was in addition i believe hayward has a moral an ethical and a legal obligation to insure that our tenants receive safe and decent housing that property could have been made safe and decent for half of the money budgeted lloyd put in sydney barely glanced at him youre quite right i believe my grandfather wanted more than the minimum required for hayward he wanted it to be the best the finest i know i do i wont stand here and quote you figures theyre in your folders and can be discussed at length in a few moments yes the budget for the soho project is high and so are hayward standards sydney howard keller one of her grandfathers oldest associates spoke gently none of us here doubt your motives or your enthusiasm your judgment however in this and in the wolburg matter is something we must consider the publicity over the past few days has been extremely detrimental hayward stock is down a full three percent thats in addition to the drop we suffered when you took your position as head of the company our stockholders are understandably concerned the wolburg matter sydney said with steel in her voice is an eightyyearold woman with a fractured hip she fell because the floor in her kitchen a floor we neglected to replace was unsafe its precisely that kind of reckless statement that will open hayward up to a major lawsuit lloyd put in he kept his tone the quiet sound of calm reason isnt it the function of insurance investigators and legal to come to a decision on this after a careful thoughtful overview of the situation we cant run our company on emotion and impulse miss haywards heart might have been touched by the wolburg matter but there are procedures channels to be used now that the press has jumped on thisвђ yes she broke in its very interesting how quickly the press learned about the accident its hard to believe that only days after an unknown unimportant old lady falls in her downtown apartment the press is slapping hayward in the headlines i would imagine she called them herself lloyd said her smile was icy would you i dont think the issue is how the press got wind of this mavis trelane commented the point is they did and the resulting publicity has been shaded heavily against us putting hayward in a very vulnerable position the stockholders want a solution quickly does anyone here believe hayward is not culpable for mrs wolburgs injuries its not what we believe mavis corrected and none of us could make a decision on that until a full investigation into the incident what is relevant is how such matters are handled she frowned when a knock interrupted her im sorry sydney said and moved away from the table to walk stiffly to the door janine i explained we werent to be interrupted yes maam the secretary who had thrown her loyalty to sydney five minutes after hearing the story kept her voice low this is important i just got a call from a friend of mine he works on channel mrs wolburgs going to make a statement on the noon news any minute now after a moments hesitation sydney nodded thank you janine good luck ms hayward sydney smiled and shut the door she was going to need it face composed she turned back to the room ive just been told that mrs wolburg is about to make a televised statement im sure were all interested in what she has to say so with your permission ill turn on the set rather than waiting for the debate to settle it sydney picked up the remote and aimed it at the console in the corner while lloyd was stating that the board needed to concern themselves with the facts and not a publicity maneuver channel cut from commercial to mrs wolburgs hospital bed the reporter a pretty woman in her early twenties with eyes as sharp as nails began the interview by asking the patient to explain how she came by her injury several members of the board shook their heads and muttered among themselves as she explained about tripping on the ripped linoleum and how the noise of the construction had masked her calls for help lloyd had to stop his lips from curving as he imagined sydneys ship springing another leak and this floor the reporter continued had the condition of it been reported to hayward oh sure mikвђthats mikhail stanislaski the sweet boy up on the fifth floor wrote letters about the whole building and nothing was done nope not a thing why mr and mrs kowalski the young couple in had a piece of plaster as big as a pie plate fall out of their ceiling mik fixed it so the tenants were forced to take on the repairs themselves due to haywards neglect i guess you could say that up until the last few weeks oh and what happened in the last few weeks that would be when sydneyвђthats miss haywardвђtook over the company shes the granddaughter of old man hayward heard hed been real sick the last couple years guess things got away from him anyway mik went to see her and she came out herself that very day to take a look not two weeks later and the building was crawling with construction workers we got new windows got a new roof going on right this minute all the plumbings being fixed too every single thing mik put on the list is going to be taken care of really and did all this happen before or after your injury before mrs wolburg said a bit impatient with the sarcasm i told you all that hammering and sawing was the reason nobody heard me when i fell and i want you to know that miss hayward was there checking the place out again that day she and mik found me she sat right there on the floor and talked to me brought me a pillow and a blanket and stayed with me until the ambulance came came to the hospital too and took care of all my medical bills been to visit me three times since ive been here wouldnt you say that hayward and therefore sydney hayward is responsible for you being here bad eyes and a hole in the floors responsible she said evenly and ill tell you just what i told those ambulance chasers whove been calling my family ive got no reason to sue hayward theyve been taking care of me since the minute i was hurt now maybe if theyd dallied around and tried to make like it wasnt any of their doing id feel differently but they did what was right and you cant ask for better than that sydneys got ethics and as long as shes in charge i figure hayward has ethics too im pleased to live in a building owned by a company with a conscience sydney stayed where she was after the interview ended saying nothing she switched off the set and waited you cant buy that kind of goodwill mavis decided your method may have been unorthodox sydney and i dont doubt there will still be some backwash to deal with but all in all i think the stockholders will be pleased the discussion labored on another thirty minutes but the crisis had passed the moment sydney was back in her own office she picked up the phone the receiver rang in her ear twelve times frustrating her before it was finally picked up on the other end yeah mikhail nope hes down the hall oh well then iвђ hang on the phone rattled clanged then clattered as the male voice boomed out mikhails name feeling like a fool sydney stayed on the line hello mikhail its sydney he grinned and grabbed the jug of ice water out of the refrigerator hello anyway i just saw the news i suppose you knew caught it on my lunch break so you asked her to do it no i didnt he paused long enough to gulp down about a pint of water i told her how things were and she came up with the idea herself it was a good one yes it was a good one and i owe you yeah he thought about it okay pay up why shed expected him to politely refuse to take credit was beyond her excuse me pay up hayward you can have dinner with me on sunday really i dont see how one has to do with the other you owe me he reminded her and thats what i want nothing fancy okay ill pick you up around four four four in the afternoon for dinner right he pulled a carpenters pencil out of his pocket whats your address he let out a low whistle as she reluctantly rattled it off nice he finished writing it on the wall got a phone number in case something comes up she was scowling but she gave it to him i want to make it clear thatвђ make it clear when i pick you up im on the clock and youre paying on impulse he outlined her address and phone number with a heart see you sunday boss chapter contents prev next sydney studied her reflection in the cheval glass critically and cautiously it wasnt as if it were a date shed reminded herself of that several hundred times over the weekend it was more of a payment and no matter how she felt about mikhail she owed him haywards paid their debts nothing formal shed taken him at his word there the little dress was simple its scooped neck and thin straps a concession to the heat the nipped in waist was flattering the flared skirt comfortable the thin nearly weightless material was teal blue not that shed paid any attention to his suggestion she wear brighter colors maybe the dress was new purchased after a frantic two hours of searchingвђbut that was only because shed wanted something new the short gold chain with its tiny links and the hoops at her ears were plain but elegant shed spent longer than usual on her makeup but that was only because shed been experimenting with some new shades of eyeshadow after much debate shed opted to leave her hair down then of course shed had to fool with it until the style suited her fluffed out skimming just above her shoulders seemed casual enough to her and sexy not that she cared about being sexy tonight but a woman was entitled to a certain amount of vanity she hesitated over the cutglass decanter of perfume remembering how mikhail had described her scent with a shrug she touched it to pulse points it hardly mattered if it appealed to him she was wearing it for herself satisfied she checked the contents of her purse then her watch she was a full hour early blowing out a long breath she sat down on the bed for the first time in her life she actively wished for a drink an hour and fifteen minutes later after she had wandered through the apartment plumping pillows rearranging statuary then putting it back where it had been in the first place he knocked on the door she stopped in the foyer found she had to fuss with her hair another moment then pressed a hand to her nervous stomach outwardly composed she opened the door it didnt appear hed worried overmuch about his attire the jeans were clean but faded the hightops only slightly less scuffed than his usual work boots his shirt was tucked inвђa definite changeвђand was a plain working mans cotton the color of smoke his hair flowed over the collar so black so untamed no woman alive could help but fantasize about letting her fingers dive in he looked earthy a little wild and more than a little dangerous and hed brought her a tulip im late he held out the flower thinking she looked as cool and delicious as a sherbert parfait in a crystal dish i was working on your face you wereвђwhat your face he slid a hand under her chin his eyes narrowing in concentration i found the right piece of rosewood and lost track of time as he studied his fingers moved over her face as they had the wood searching for answers you will ask me in her mind empty as a leaky bucket struggled to fill again of course for a minute she stepped back breaking contact ill just put this in water when she left him mikhail let his gaze sweep the room it pleased him this was not the formal professionally decorated home some might have expected of her she really lived here among the soft colors and quiet comfort style was added by a scattering of art nouveau in the bronzed lamp shaped like a long slim woman and the sinuous etched flowers on the glass doors of a curio cabinet displaying a collection of antique beaded bags he noted his sculpture stood alone in a glossy old shadow box and was flattered she came back carrying the tulip in a slim silver vase i admire your taste she set the vase atop the curio thank you nouveau is sensuous he traced a finger down the flowing lines of the lamp and rebellious she nearly frowned before she caught herself i find it attractive graceful graceful yes also powerful she didnt care for the way he was smiling at her as if he knew a secret she didnt and that the secret was her yes well im sure as an artist youd agree art should have power would you like a drink before we go no not before i drive drive yes do you like sunday drives sydney iвђ she picked up her purse to give her hands something to do there was no reason none at all for her to allow him to make her feel as awkward as a teenager on a first date i dont get much opportunity for them in the city it seemed wise to get started she moved to the door wondering what it would be like to be in a car with him alone i didnt realize you kept a car his grin was quick and a tad selfmocking as they moved out into the hall a couple of years ago after my art had some success i bought one it was a little fantasy of mine i think i pay more to keep it parked than i did for the car but fantasies are rarely free in the elevator he pushed the button for the garage i think about it myself she admitted i miss driving the independence of it i suppose in europe i could hop in and zoom off whenever i chose but it seems more practical to keep a driver here than to go to war every time you need a parking space sometime well go up north along the river and you can drive the image was almost too appealing whipping along the roads toward the mountains upstate she thought it was best not to comment your report came in on friday she began not today he reached down to take her hand as they stepped into the echoing garage talking reports can wait till monday here he opened the door of a glossy redandcream mg the canvas top was lowered you dont mind the top down he asked as she settled inside sydney thought of the time and trouble shed taken with her hair and she thought of the freedom of having even a hot breeze blow through it no i dont mind he climbed into the drivers seat adjusting long legs then gunned the engine after taking a pair of mirrored sunglasses off the dash he pulled out the radio was set on rock sydney found herself smiling as they cruised around central park you didnt mention where we were going i know this little place the food is good he noted her foot was tapping along in time with the music tell me where you lived in europe oh i didnt live in any one place i moved around paris saint tropez venice london monte carlo perhaps you have gypsies in your blood too perhaps not gypsies she thought there had been nothing so romantic as wanderlust in her hopscotching travels through europe only dissatisfaction and a need to hide until wounds had healed have you ever been when i was very young but i would like to go back now that i am old enough to appreciate it the art you see and the atmosphere the architecture what places did you like best a little village in the countryside of france where they milked cows by hand and grew fat purple grapes there was a courtyard at the inn where i stayed and the flowers were so big and bright in the late afternoon you could sit and drink the most wonderful white wine and listen to the doves coo she stopped faintly embarrassed and of course paris she said quickly the food the shopping the ballet i knew several people and enjoyed the parties not so much he thought as she enjoyed sitting alone and listening to cooing doves do you ever think about going back to the soviet union she asked him often to see the place where i was born the house we lived in it may not be there now the hills where i played as a child they would be his glasses only tossed her own reflection back at her but she thought behind them his eyes would be sad his voice was things have changed so much so quickly in the last few years glasnost the berlin wall you could go back sometimes i think i will then i wonder if its better to leave it a memoryвђpart bitter part sweet but colored through the eyes of a child i was very young when we left it was difficult yes more for my parents who knew the risks better than we they had the courage to give up everything they had ever known to give their children the one thing they had never had freedom moved she laid a hand over his on the gearshift margerite had told her the story of escaping into hungary in a wagon making it seem like some sort of romantic adventure it didnt seem romantic to sydney it seemed terrifying you must have been frightened more than i ever hope to be again at night i would lie awake always cold always hungry and listen to my parents talk one would reassure the other and they would plan how far we might travel the next dayвђand the next when we came to america my father wept and i understood it was over i wasnt afraid anymore her own eyes had filled she turned away to let the wind dry them but coming here must have been frightening too a different place different language different culture he heard the emotion in her voice though touched he didnt want to make her sad not today the young adjust quickly i had only to give the boy in the next house a bloody nose to feel at home she turned back saw the grin and responded with a laugh then i suppose you became inseparable friends i was best man at his wedding only two years ago with a shake of her head she settled back it was then she noticed they were crossing the bridge over to brooklyn you couldnt find a place to have dinner in manhattan his grin widened not like this one a few minutes later he was cruising through one of the old neighborhoods with its faded brick row houses and big shady trees children scrambled along the sidewalks riding bikes jumping rope at the curb where mikhail stopped two boys were having a deep and serious transaction with baseball cards hey mik both of them jumped up before hed even climbed out of the car you missed the game we finished an hour ago ill catch the next one he glanced over to see that sydney had already gotten out and was standing in the street studying the neighborhood with baffled and wary eyes he leaned over and winked i got a hot date oh man twelveyearold disgust prevented either of them from further comment laughing mikhail walked over to grab sydneys hand and pull her to the sidewalk i dont understand she began as he led her across the concrete heaved up by the roots of a huge old oak this is a restaurant no he had to tug to make her keep up with him as he climbed the steps its a house but you saidвђ that we were going to dinner he shoved the door open and took a deep sniff smells like mama made chicken kiev youll like your mother she nearly stumbled into the narrow entrance way scattered emotions flew inside her stomach like a bevy of birds you bought me to your parents house yes for sunday dinner oh good lord he lifted a brow you dont like chicken kiev no yes that isnt the point i wasnt expectingвђ youre late yuri boomed are you going to bring the woman in or stand in the doorway mikhail kept his eyes on sydneys she doesnt want to come in he called back thats not it she whispered mortified you might have told me about this so i could haveвђ oh never mind she brushed past him to take the couple of steps necessary to bring her into the living room yuri was just hauling himself out of a chair mr stanislaski its so nice of you to have me she offered a hand and had it swallowed whole by his you are welcome here you will call me yuri thank you we are happy mikhail shows good taste grinning he used a stage whisper his mama she didnt like the dancer with the blond hair thanks papa casually mikhail draped an arm over sydneys shouldersвђfelt her resist the urge to shrug it off where is everyone mama and rachel are in the kitchen alex is later than you alex sees all the girls at the same time yuri told sydney it should confuse him but it does not yuri you have not taken the trash out yet a small woman with an exotic face and graying hair came out of the kitchen carrying silverware in the skirt of her apron yuri gave his son an affectionate thump on the back that nearly had sydney pitching forward i wait for mikhail to come and take it and mikhail will wait for alex she set the flatware down on a heavy table at the other end of the room then came to sydney her dark eyes were shrewd not unfriendly but quietly probing she smelled of spice and melted butter i am nadia mikhails mother she offered a hand we are happy to have you with us thank you you have a lovely home she had said it automatically meaningless politeness but the moment the words were out sydney realized they were true the entire house would probably fit into one wing of her mothers long island estate and the furniture was old rather than antique doilies as charming and intricate as those she had seen at mrs wolburgs covered the arms of chairs the wallpaper was faded but that only made the tiny rosebuds scattered over it seem more lovely the strong sunlight burst through the window and showed every scar every mend just as it showed how lovingly the woodwork and table surfaces had been polished out of the corner of her eye she caught a movement as she glanced over she watched a plump ball of gray fur struggling whimpering from under a chair that is ivan yuri said clucking to the puppy he is only a baby he sighed a little for his old mutt sasha who had died peacefully at the age of fifteen six months before alex brings him home from pound saved you from walking the last mile right ivan mikhail bent down to ruffle fur ivan thumped his tail while giving sydney nervous looks he is named for ivan the terrible but hes a coward hes just shy sydney corrected then gave in to need and crouched down shed always wanted a pet but boarding schools didnt permit them there arent you sweet the dog trembled visibly for a moment when she stroked him then began to lick the toes that peeked out through her sandals mikhail began to think the pup had potential what kind is he she asked he is part russian wolfhound yuri declared with plenty of traveling salesmen thrown in the voice came from the kitchen doorway sydney looked over her shoulder and saw a striking woman with a sleek cap of raven hair and tawny eyes im mikhails sister rachel you must be sydney yes hello sydney straightened and wondered what miracles in the gene pool had made all the stanislaskis so blindingly beautiful dinnerll be ready in ten minutes rachels voice carried only the faintest wisp of an accent and was as dark and smooth as black velvet mikhail you can set the table i have to take out the trash he told her instantly choosing the lesser of two evils ill do it sydneys impulsive offer was greeted with casual acceptance she was nearly finished when alex as dark exotic and gorgeous as the rest of the family strolled in sorry im late papa just finished a double shift i barely had time toвђ he trailed off when he spotted sydney his mouth curved and his eyes flickered with definite interest now im really sorry im late hi hello her lips curved in response that kind of romantic charm could have raised the blood pressure on a corpse providing it was female mine mikhail said mildly as he strolled back out of the kitchen alex merely grinned and continued walking toward sydney he took her hand kissed the knuckles just so you know of the two of us im less moody and have a steadier job she had to laugh ill certainly take that into account he thinks hes a cop mikhail sent his brother an amused look mama says to wash your hands dinners ready sydney was certain shed never seen more food at one table there were mounds of chicken stuffed with rich herbed butter it was served with an enormous bowl of lightly browned potatoes and a platter heaped with slices of grilled vegetables that nadia had picked from her own kitchen garden that morning there was a tower of biscuits along with a mountain of some flaky stuffed pastries that was alexs favorite dish sydney sipped the crisp wine that was offered along with vodka and wondered the amount and variety of food was nothing compared to the conversation rachel and alex argued over someone named goose after a winding explanation sydney learned that while alex was a rookie cop rachel was in her first year with the public defenders office and goose was a petty thief rachel was defending yuri and mikhail argued about baseball sydney didnt need nadias affectionate translation to realize that while yuri was a diehard yankee fan mikhail stood behind the mets there was much gesturing with silverware and russian exclamations mixed with english then laughter a shouted question and more arguing rachel is an idealist alex stated with his elbows on the table and his chin rested on his joined hands he smiled at sydney what are you she smiled back too smart to be put between a lawyer and a cop elbows off nadia said and gave her son a quick rap mikhail says you are a businesswoman and that you are very smart and fair the description surprised her enough that she nearly fumbled i try to be your company was in a sticky situation last week rachel downed the last of her vodka with a panache sydney admired you handled it well it seemed to me that rather than trying to be fair you simply were have you known mikhail long she segued into the question so neatly sydney only blinked no actually we met last month when he barged into my office ready to crush any available hayward under his work boot i was polite he corrected you were not polite because she could see yuri was amused she continued he was dirty angry and ready to fight his temper comes from his mama yuri informed sydney she is fierce only once nadia said with a shake of her head only once did i hit him over the head with a pot he never forgets i still have the scar and here yuri pointed to his shoulder where you threw the hairbrush at me you should not have said my new dress was ugly it was ugly he said with a shrug then tapped a hand on his chest and here where youвђ enough all dignity she rose or our guest will think i am tyrant she is a tyrant yuri told sydney with a grin and this tyrant says we will clear the table and have dessert sydney was still chuckling over it as mikhail crossed the bridge back into manhattan sometime during the long comfortable meal shed forgotten to be annoyed with him perhaps shed had a half a glass too much wine certainly shed eaten entirely too much kisselвђthe heavenly apricot pudding nadia had served with cold rich cream but she was relaxed and couldnt remember ever having spent a more enjoyable sunday evening did your father make that up snuggled back in her seat sydney turned her head to study mikhails profile about your mother throwing things no she throws things he downshifted and cruised into traffic once a whole plate of spaghetti and meatballs at me because my mouth was too quick her laughter came out in a burst of enjoyment oh i would have loved to have seen that did you duck he flicked her a grin not fast enough ive never thrown anything in my life her sigh was part wistful part envious i think it must be very liberating theyre wonderful she said after another moment your family youre very lucky so you dont mind eating in brooklyn frowning she straightened a bit it wasnt that i told you im not a snob i just wasnt prepared you should have told me you were taking me there would you have gone she opened her mouth then closed it again after a moment she let her shoulders rise and fall i dont know why did you take me i wanted to see you there maybe i wanted you to see me there too puzzled she turned to look at him again they were nearly back now in a few more minutes he would go his way and she hers i dont understand why that should matter to you then you understand much too little sydney i might understand if youd be more clear it was suddenly important vital that she know the tips of her fingers were beginning to tingle so that she had to rub them together to stop the sensation im better with my hands than with words impatient with her with himself he pulled into the garage beneath her building when he yanked off his sunglasses his eyes were dark and turbulent didnt she know that her damn perfume had his nerve ends sizzling the way she laughed the way her hair lifted in the wind how her eyes had softened and yearned as shed looked at the silly little mutt of his fathers it was worse much worse now that hed seen her with his family now that hed watched how her initial stiffness melted away under a few kind words hed worried that hed made a mistake that she would be cold to his family disdainful of the old house and simple meal instead shed laughed with his father dried dishes with his mother alexs blatant flirting hadnt offended but rather had amused her and when rachel had praised her handling of the accident with mrs wolburg shed flushed like a schoolgirl how the hell was he supposed to know hed fall in love with her and now that she was alone with him again all that cool reserve was seeping back he could see it in the way her spine straightened when she stepped out of the car hell he could feel itвђit surprised him that frost didnt form on his windshield ill walk you up he slammed the door of the car that isnt necessary she didnt know what had spoiled the evening but was ready to place the blame squarely on his shoulders ill walk you up he repeated and pulled her over to the elevator fine she folded her arms and waited the moment the doors opened they entered without speaking both of them were sure it was the longest elevator ride on record sydney swept out in front of him when they reached her floor she had her keys out and ready two steps before they hit her door i enjoyed your family she said carefully polite be sure to tell your parents again how much i appreciated their hospitality the lock snapped open you can reach me in the office if there are any problems this week he slapped his hand on the door before she could shut it in his face im coming in chapter contents prev next sydney considered the chances of shoving the door closed while he had his weight against it found them slim and opted for shivery reserve its a bit early for a nightcap and a bit late for coffee i dont want a drink mikhail rapped the door closed with enough force to make the foyer mirror rattle though she refused to back up sydney felt her stomach muscles experience the same helpless shaking some people might consider it poor manners for a man to bully his way into a womans apartment i have poor manners he told her and jamming his hands into his pockets paced into the living room it must be a trial for your parents obviously they worked hard to instill a certain code of behavior in their children it didnt stick with you he swung back and she was reminded of some compact and muscled cat on the prowl definitely a maneater you liked them baffled she pushed a hand through her disordered hair of course i like them ive already said so while his hands bunched and unbundled in his pockets he lifted a brow i thought perhaps it was just your very perfect manners that made you say so as an insult it was a wellaimed shot indignation shivered through the ice well you were wrong now if weve settled everything you can go weve settled nothing you tell me why you are so different now from the way you were an hour ago she caught herself tightening her lips before they could move into a pout i dont know what youre talking about with my family you were warm and sweet you smiled so easily now with me youre cold and far away you dont smile at all thats absurd though it was little more than a baring of teeth she forced her lips to curve there ive smiled at you satisfied temper flickered into his eyes as he began to pace again i havent been satisfied since i walk into your office you make me suffer and i dont like it artists are supposed to suffer she shot back and i dont see how ive had anything to do with it ive given in to every single demand you made replaced windows ripped out plumbing gotten rid of that toolandknot wiring tube and knob he corrected nearly amused well its gone isnt it have you any idea just how much lumber ive authorized to last twobyfour i know this is not point she studied him owlishly do you know you drop your articles when youre angry his eyes narrowed i drop nothing your thes and ans and as she pointed out and your sentence structure suffers you mix your tenses that wounded id like to hear you speak my language she set the purse she still carried onto a table with a snap baryshnikov glasnost his lips curled this is russian i am ukrainian this is a mistake you make but i overlook it you overlook it she corrected in any case its close enough he took a step forward she took one back im sure we can have a fascinating discussion on the subtleties of language but it will have to wait he came closer and sheвђcasually she hopedвђedged away as i said before i enjoyed the evening nowвђ he maneuvered her around a chair вђstop stalking me you imagine things youre not a rabbit youre a woman but she felt like a rabbit one of those poor frozen creatures caught in a beam of headlights i dont know whats put you in this moodвђ i have many moods you put me in this one every time i see you or think about you she shifted so that a table was between them because she well knew if she kept retreating her back would be against the wall she took a stand all right damn it what do you want you you know i want you her heart leaped into her throat then plummeted to her stomach you do not the tremble in her voice irritated her enough to make her force ice into it i dont appreciate this game youre playing i play what is a man to think when a woman blows hot then cold when she looks at him with passion one minute and frost the next his hands lifted in frustration then slapped down on the table i tell you straight out when you are so upset that i dont want your mama i want you and you call me a liar i dontвђ she could hardly get her breath deliberately she walked away moving behind a chair and gripping the back hard it had been a mistake to look into his eyes there was a ruthlessness there that brought a terrible pitch of excitement to her blood you didnt want me before before i think i wanted you before i met you what is this before in the car humiliation washed her cheeks of color when iвђwhen we were driving back from long island we wereвђ her fingers dug into the back of the chair it doesnt matter in two strides he was in front of the chair his hands gripped over hers you tell me what you mean pride she told herself she would damn well keep her pride all right then to clarify and to see that we dont have this conversation again you started something in the car that night i didnt ask for it i didnt encourage it but you started it she took a deep breath to be certain her voice remained steady and you just stopped becauseвђ well because i wasnt what you wanted after all for a moment he could only stare too stunned for speech then his face changed so quickly sydney could only blink at the surge of rage when he acted she gave a yip of surprise the chair he yanked from between them landed on its side two feet away he swore at her she didnt need to understand the words to appreciate the sentiment behind them before she could make an undignified retreat his hands were clamped hard on her arms for an instant she was afraid she was about to take the same flight as the chair he was strong enough and certainly angry enough but he only continued to shout it took her nearly a full minute to realize her feet were an inch above the floor and that hed started using english again idiot how can so smart a woman have no brains im not going to stand here and be insulted of course she wasnt standing at all she thought fighting panic she was dangling it is not insult to speak truth for weeks i have tried to be gentleman a gentleman she said furiously youve tried to be a gentleman and youve failed miserably i think you need time you need me to show you how i feel and i am sorry to have treated you as i did in the car that night it makes me think you will haveвђ he trailed off frustrated that the proper word wasnt in him that you will think meвђ a heathen she tossed out with relish barbarian no thats not so bad but a man who abuses a woman for pleasure who forces and hurts her it wasnt a matter of force sydney said coldly now put me down he hiked her up another inch do you think i stopped because i dont want you im well aware that my sexuality is under par he didnt have a clue what she was talking about and plowed on we were in a car in the middle of the city with your driver in the front and i was ready to rip your clothes away and take you there it made me angry with myself and with you because you could make me forget she tried to think of a response but he had set her back on her feet and his hands were no longer gripping but caressing the rage in his eyes had become something else and it took her breath away every day since he murmured every night i remember how you looked how you felt so i want more and i wait for you to offer what i saw in your eyes that night but you dont i cant wait longer his fingers streaked into her hair then fisted there drawing her head back as his mouth crushed down on hers the heat seered through her skin into blood and bone her moan wasnt borne of pain but of tormented pleasure willing desperately willing her mouth parted under his inviting him accepting him this time when her heart rose to her throat there was a wild glory in it on an oath he tore his mouth from hers and buried it against her throat she had not asked she had not encouraged those were her words and he wouldnt ignore the truth of them whatever slippery grip he had on control he clamped tight now fighting to catch his breath and hold to sanity damn me to hell or take me to heaven he muttered but do it now her arms locked around his neck he would leave she knew just as he had left that first time and if he did she might never feel this frenzied stirring again i want you im afraid im afraid yes i want you make love to me and his mouth was on hers again hard hot hungry while his hands flowed like molten steel down her body not a caress now but a branding in one long possessive stroke he staked a claim it was too late for choices fears and pleasures battered her rough waves of emotion that had her trembling even as she absorbed delights her fingers dug into his shoulders took greedy handfuls of his hair through the thin layers of cotton she could feel the urgent drum of his heart and knew it beat for her more he could only think he needed more even as her scent swam in his head and her taste flooded his mouth she moved against him that small slim body restless and eager when he touched her when his artists hands sculpted her finding the curves and planes of her already perfect her low throaty whimpers pounded in his ears like thunder more he tugged the straps from her shoulders snapping one in his hurry to remove even that small obstacle while his mouth raced over the smooth bare curve he dragged at the zipper yanking and pulling until the dress pooled at her feet beneath it oh lord beneath it the strapless little fancy frothed over milkwhite breasts flowed down to long lovely thighs she lifted a trembling hand as if to cover herself but he caught it held it he didnt see the nerves in her eyes as he filled himself on how she looked surrounded in the last flames of sunset that warmed the room mikhail because he wasnt quite ready to speak he only nodded iвђ the bedroom hed been tempted to take her where they stood or to do no more than drag her to the floor checking himself he had her up in his arms in one glorious sweep it better be close on an unsteady laugh she gestured no man had ever carried her to bed before and she found it dazzlingly romantic unsure of what part she should play sydney pressed her lips tentatively to his throat he trembled encouraged she skimmed them up to his ear he groaned on a sigh of pleasure she continued to nibble while her fingers slipped beneath his shirt to stroke over his shoulder his arms tightened around her when she turned her head his mouth was there taking greedily from hers as he tumbled with her onto the bed shouldnt we close the drapes the question ended on a gasp as he began doing things to her wonderful things shattering things there was no room for shyness in this airless spinning world it wasnt supposed to be like this shed always thought lovemaking to be either awkwardly mechanical or quietly comforting it wasnt supposed to be so urgent so turbulent so incredible those rough clever hands rushed over flesh over silk then back to flesh leaving her a quivering mass of sensation his mouth was just as hurried just as skilled as it made the same erotic journey he was lost in her utterly irretrievably lost in her even the air was full of her that quiet restrained gloriously seductive scent her skin seemed to melt like liquid flowers under his fingers his lips each quick tremble he brought to her racked through him until he thought he would go mad desire arced and spiked and hummed even as she grew softer more pliant more his impatient he brought his mouth to her breast to suckle through silk while his hands slid up her thighs to find her wet and burning when he touched her her body arched in shock her arm flew back until her fingers locked over one of the rungs of the brass headboard she shook her head as pleasure shot into her hot as a bullet suddenly fear and desire were so twisted into a single emotion she didnt know whether to beg him to stop or plead with him to go on on and on helpless stripped of control she gasped for breath it seemed her system had contracted until she was curled into one tight hot ball even as she sobbed out his name the ball imploded and she was left shattered a moan shuddered out as her body went limp again unbearably aroused he watched her the stunned glowing pleasure that flushed her cheeks the dark dazed desire that turned her eyes to blue smoke for her for himself he took her up again driving her higher until her breath was ragged and her body on fire please she managed when he tugged the silk aside i will please you he flicked his tongue over her nipple and me there couldnt be more but he showed her there was even when she began to drag frantically at his clothes he continued to assault her system and to give her give her more than she had ever believed she could hold his hands were never still as he rolled over the bed with her helping her to rid him of every possible barrier he wanted her crazed for him as crazed as he for her he could feel the wild need in the way she moved beneath him in the way her hands searched and yes in the way she cried out when he found some secret shed been keeping just for him when he could wait no longer he plunged inside her a sword to the hilt she was beyond pleasure there was no name for the edge she trembled on her body moved arching for his finding their own intimate rhythm as naturally as breath she knew he was speaking to her desperate words in a mixture of languages she understood that wherever she was he was with her as much a captive as she and when the power pushed her off that last thin edge he was all there was all there had to be it was dark and the room was in shadows wondering if her mind would ever clear again sydney stared at the ceiling and listened to mikhail breathe it was foolish she supposed but it was such a soothing intimate sound that air moving quietly in and out of his lungs she could have listened for hours perhaps she had she had no idea how much time had passed since hed slapped his hand on her door and barged in after her it might have been minutes or hours but it hardly mattered her life had been changed smiling to herself she stroked a hand through his hair he turned his head just an inch and pressed his lips to the underside of her jaw i thought you were asleep she murmured no i wouldnt fall asleep on top of you he lifted his head she could see the gleam of his eyes the hint of a smile there are so many more interesting things to do on top of you she felt color rush to her cheeks and was grateful for the dark i wasвђ how could she ask it was all right then no even with his body pressed into hers he could feel her quick retreat sydney i may not have so many good words as you but i think all right is a poor choice a walk through the park is all right i only meantвђ she shifted though he braced on his elbows to ease his weight from her he made sure she couldnt wiggle away i think well have a light now no thats notвђ the bedside lamp clicked on necessary i want to see you because i think i will make love with you again in a minute and i like to look at you casually he brushed his lips over hers dont dont what tense your shoulders id like to think you could relax with me i am relaxed she said then blew out a long breath no she wasnt its just that whenever i ask a direct question you give evasions i only wanted to know if you were well satisfied shed been sure before but now as the heat had faded to warmth she wondered if shed only wished ah wrapping her close he rolled over until she lay atop him this is like a quiz multiple choice they were my favorite in school you want to know a was it all right b was it very good or c was it very wonderful forget it he clamped his arms around her when she tried to pull away im not finished with you hayward i still have to answer the question but i find there are not enough choices he nudged her down until her lips had no choice but to meet his and the kiss was long and sweet do you understand now his eyes were dark still heavy from the pleasure theyd shared the look in them said more than hundreds of silky words yes good come back to me he nestled her head on his shoulder and began to rub his hand gently up and down her back this is nice yes she smiled again this is nice moments passed in easy silence mikhail hmm there werent enough choices for me either she was so beautiful when she slept he could hardly look away her hair a tangled flow of golden fire curtained part of her face one hand small and delicate curled on the pillow where his head had lain the sheet tangled from hours of loving showed the outline of her body to where the linen ended just at the curve of her breast she had been greater than any fantasy generous open stunningly sexy and shy all at once it had been like initiating a virgin and being seduced by a siren and afterward the faint embarrassment the puzzling selfdoubt where had that come from he would have to coax the answer from her and if coaxing didnt work he would bully but now when he watched her in the morning light he felt such an aching tenderness he hated to wake her but he knew women enough to be sure she would be hurt if he left her sleeping gently he brushed the hair from her cheek bent down and kissed her she stirred and so did his desire he kissed her again nibbling a trail to her ear sydney her sleepy purr of response had his blood heating wake up and kiss me goodbye s morning her lashes fluttered up to reveal dark heavy eyes she stared at him a moment while she struggled to surface his face was close and shadowed with stubble to satisfy an old craving she lifted her hand to it you have a dangerous face when he grinned she propped herself up on an elbow youre dressed she realized i thought it the best way to go downtown go amused he sat on the edge of the bed to work its nearly seven i made coffee with your machine and used your shower she nodded she could smell bothвђthe coffee and the scent of her soap on his skin you should have waked me he twined a lock of her hair around his finger enjoying the way its subtle fire seemed to lick at his flesh i didnt let you sleep very long last night you will come downtown after work i will fix you dinner relieved she smiled yes and youll stay the night with me sleep in my bed she sat up so they were facetoface yes good he tugged on the lock of hair now kiss me goodbye all right testing herself she sat up linked her hands around his neck the sheet slid away to her waist pleased she watched his gaze skim down felt the tensing of muscles saw the heat flash slowly waiting until his eyes had come back to hers she leaned forward her lips brushed his and retreated brushed and retreated until she felt his quick groan satisfied she had his full attention she flicked open the buttons of his shirt sydney on a half laugh he caught at her hands youll make me late thats the idea she was smiling as she pushed the shirt off his shoulders dont worry ill put in a good word for you with the boss two hours later sydney strolled into her offices with an armful of flowers shed bought on the street shed left her hair down had chosen a sunny yellow suit to match her mood and she was humming janine looked up from her work station prepared to offer her usual morning greeting the formal words stuck wow ms hayward you look fabulous thank you janine i feel that way these are for you confused janine gathered up the armful of summer blossoms thank you iвђ thank you whens my first appointment ninethirty with ms brinkman mr lowe and mr keller to finalize the buy on the housing project in new jersey that gives me about twenty minutes id like to see you in my office yes maam janine was already reaching for her pad you wont need that sydney told her and strode through the double doors she seated herself then gestured for janine to take a chair how long have you worked for hayward five years last march sydney tipped back in her chair and looked at her secretary really looked janine was attractive neat had direct gray eyes that were a trifle puzzled at the moment her dark blond hair was worn short and sleek she held herself well sydney noted appearance was important not the most important but it certainly counted for what she was thinking you must have been very young when you started here twentyone janine answered with a small smile right out of business college are you doing what you want to do janine excuse me is secretarial work what you want to do with your life or do you have other ambitions janine resisted the urge to squirm in her chair i hope to work my way up to department manager but i enjoy working for you miss hayward you have five years experience with the company nearly five more than i do yet you enjoy working for me why why janine stopped being nervous and went to flatout baffled being secretary to the president of hayward is an important job and i think im good at it i agree with both statements rising sydney walked around the desk to perch on the front corner lets be frank janine no one here at hayward expected me to stay more than a token month or two and im sure it was generally agreed id spend most of that time filing my nails or chatting with friends on the phone she saw by the faint flush that crept up janines cheeks that shed hit very close to the mark they gave me an efficient secretary not an assistant or an office manager or executive aide whatever we choose to call them at hayward because it wasnt thought id require one true thats the office gossip janine straightened in her chair and met sydneys eyes levelly if she was about to be fired shed take it on the chin i took the job because it was a good position a promotion and a raise and i think you were very wise the door opened and you walked in since youve been working for me youve been excellent i cant claim to have a lot of experience in having a secretary but i know that youre at your desk when i arrive in the morning and often stay after i leave at night when i ask you for information you have it or you get it when i ask you explain and when i order you get the job done i dont believe in doing things half way ms hayward sydney smiled that was exactly what she wanted to hear and you want to move up contrarily when my position was tenuous at best last week you stood behind me breaking into that board meeting was a risk and putting yourself in my corner at that point certainly lessened your chances of moving up at hayward had i been asked to step down and it most certainly earned you a powerful enemy i work for you not for mr bingham and even if it wasnt a matter of loyalty you were doing what was right i feel very strongly about loyalty janine just as strongly as i feel about giving someone whos trying to make something of herself the chance to do so the flowers were a thankyou for that loyalty from me to you personally thank you ms hayward janines face relaxed in a smile youre welcome i consider your promotion to my executive assistant with the appropriate salary and benefits to be a good business decision janines mouth dropped open i beg your pardon i hope youll accept the position janine i need someone i trust someone i respect and someone who knows how the hell to run an office agreed sydney offered a hand janine stared at it before she managed to rise and grip it firmly in hers ms haywardвђ sydney were going to be in this together janine gave a quick dazzled laugh sydney i hope im not dreaming youre wideawake and the flaks going to fall before the days over your first job in your new position is to arrange a meeting with lloyd make it a formal request here in my office before the close of business hours today he put her off until fourfifteen but sydney was patient if anything the extra time gave her the opportunity to examine her feelings and make certain her decision wasnt based on emotion when janine buzzed him in sydney was ready and she was sure you picked a busy day for this he began sit down lloyd he did and she waited again while he took out a cigarette i wont take up much of your time she told him i felt it best to discuss this matter as quickly as possible his gaze flicked up and he smiled confidently through the haze of smoke having problems on one of the projects no her lips curved in a wintry smile theres nothing i cant handle its the internal strife at hayward that concerns me and ive decided to remedy it office reorganization is a tricky business he crossed his legs and leaned back do you really think youve been around long enough to attempt it im not going to attempt it im going to do it id like your resignation on my desk by five oclock tomorrow he bolted up what the hell are you talking about your resignation lloyd or if necessary your termination at hayward that distinction will be up to you he crushed the cigarette into pulp in the ashtray you think you can fire me walk in here with barely three months under your belt and fire me when ive been at hayward for twelve years heres the point she said evenly whether its been three months or three days i am hayward i will not tolerate one of my top executives undermining my position its obvious youre not happy with the current status at hayward and i can guarantee you im going to remain in charge of this company for a long time therefore i believe its in your own interest and certainly in mine for you to resign the hell i will thats your choice of course i will however take the matter before the board and use all the power at my disposal to limit yours going with instinct she pushed the next button leaking mrs wolburgs accident to the press didnt just put me in a difficult position it put hayward in a difficult position as an executive vice president your first duty is to the company not to go off on some vindictive tangent because you dislike working for me he stiffened and she knew shed guessed correctly you have no way of proving the leak came from my office youd be surprised what i can prove she bluffed i told you i wanted your loyalty or your resignation if the board stood behind me in the soho project we both know your loyalty is out of the question ill tell you what youll get there was a sneer in his voice but beneath the neat gray suit he was sweating ill be sitting behind that desk when youre back in europe dancing from shop to shop no lloyd youll never sit behind this desk as the major stockholder of hayward ill see to that now she continued quietly it wasnt necessary for me to document to the board the many cases in which youve ignored my requests overlooked complaints from clients tenants and other associates at the meeting on friday i will do so however at the next in the current climate i believe my wishes will be met his fingers curled he imagined the satisfaction of hooking them around her throat you think because you skidded through one mess because your senile grandfather plopped you down at that desk you can shoehorn me out lady ill bury you coolly she inclined her head youre welcome to try if you dont manage it it may be difficult for you to find a similar position with another company her eyes iced over if you dont think i have any influence or the basic guts to cany this off youre making a mistake you have twentyfour hours to consider your options this meeting is over why you coldblooded bitch she stood and this time it was she who leaned over her desk take me on she said in a quiet voice do it this isnt over turning on his heel he marched to the door to swing it open hard enough that it banged against the wall after three deep breaths sydney sank into her chair okay she was shakingвђbut only a little and it was temper she realized as she pressed a testing hand against her stomach not fear good solid temper she found she didnt need to vent any anger by mangling paper clips or shredding stationery in fact she found she felt just wonderful chapter contents prev next mikhail stirred the mixture of meats and spices and tomatoes in the old castiron skillet and watched the street below through his kitchen window after a sniff and a taste he added another splash of red wine to the mixture behind him in the living room the marriage of figaro soared from the stereo he wondered how soon sydney would arrive leaving the meal to simmer he walked into the living room to study the rosewood block that was slowly becoming her faceвђ her mouth there was a softness about it that was just emerging testing he measured it between his index finger and thumb and remembered how it had tasted moving eagerly under his hot candy coated with cool white wine addictive those cheekbones so aristocratic so elegant they could add a regal haughty look one moment or that of an iceblooded warrior the next that firm proud jawlineвђhe traced a fingertip along it and thought of how sensitive and smooth her skin was there her eyes hed wondered if hed have problems with her eyes oh not the shape of themвђthat was basic to craft but the feeling in them the mysteries behind them there was still so much he needed to know he leaned closer until he was eye to eye with the halfformed bust you will let me in he whispered at the knock on the door he stayed where he was peering into sydneys emerging face is open hey mik keely breezed in wearing a polkadotted tshirt and shorts in neon green got anything cold my fridge finally gave up the ghost help yourself he said absently ill put you on top of the list for the new ones my hero she paused in the kitchen to sniff at the skillet god this smells sinful she tipped the spoon in and took a sample it is sinful looks like a lot for one its for two oh she gave the word three ascending syllables as she pulled a soft drink out of the refrigerator the smell was making her mouth water and she glanced wistfully at the skillet again looks like a lot for two too he glanced over his shoulder and grinned put some in a bowl simmer it a little longer youre a prince mik she rattled in his cupboards so whos the lucky lady sydney hayward sydney her eyes widened the spoon she held halted in midair above the pan of bubbling goulash hayward she finished you mean the rich and beautiful hayward who wears silk to work and carries a sixhundreddollar purse which i personally priced at saks shes coming here to have dinner and everything he was counting on the everything yes gee she couldnt think of anything more profound but she wasnt sure she liked it no she wasnt sure at all keely thought as she scooped her impromptu dinner into a bowl the rich were different she firmly believed it and this lady was rich in capital letters keely knew mikhail had earned some pretty big bucks with his art but she couldnt think of him as rich he was just mik the sexy guy next door who was always willing to unclog a sink or kill a spider or share a beer carrying the bowl she walked over to him and noticed his latest work in progress oh she said but this time it was only a sigh she would have killed for cheekbones like that you like sure i always like your stuff but she shifted from foot to foot she didnt like the way he was looking at the face in the wood i ah guess you two have more than a business thing going yes he hooked his thumbs in his pockets as he looked into keelys troubled eyes this is a problem problem no no problem she worried her lower lip well its justвђboy mik shes so uptown he knew she was talking about more than an address but smiled and ran a hand over her hair youre worried forme well were pals arent we i cant stand to see a pal get hurt touched he kissed her nose like you did with the actor with the skinny legs she moved her shoulders yeah i guess but i wasnt in love with him or anything or only a little you cried sure but im a wienie i tear up during greeting card commercials dissatisfied she looked back at the bust definitely uptown a woman who looks like that i figure she could drive a guy to joining the foreign legion or something he laughed and ruffled her hair dont worry ill write before she could think of anything else there was another knock giving keely a pat on the shoulder he went to answer it hi sydneys face brightened the moment she saw him she carried a garment bag in one hand and a bottle of champagne in the other something smells wonderful my mouth started watering on the third floor andвђ she spotted keely standing near the worktable with a bowl cupped in her hands hello after clearing her throat sydney told herself she would not be embarrassed to have mikhails neighbor see her coming into his apartment with a suitcase hi i was just going every bit as uncomfortable as sydney keely darted back into the kitchen to grab her soft drink its nice to see you again sydney stood awkwardly beside the open door how did your murder go he strangled me in three takes with a fleeting smile she dashed through the door enjoy your dinner thanks mik when the door down the hall slammed shut sydney let out a long breath does she always move so fast mostly he circled sydneys waist with his hands she is worried you will seduce me use me then toss me aside oh well really chuckling he nipped at her bottom lip i dont mind the first two as his mouth settled more truly on hers he slipped the garment bag out of her lax fingers and tossed it aside taking the bottle of wine he used it to push the door closed at her back i like your dress you look like a rose in sunshine freed her hands could roam along his back slip under the chambray work shirt he hadnt tucked into his jeans i like the way you look all the time his lips were curved as they pressed to her throat youre hungry mmm past hungry i had to skip lunch ten minutes he promised and reluctantly released her if he didnt dinner would be much much later what have you brought us he twisted the bottle in his hand to study the label one dark brow lifted this will humble my goulash with her eyes shut sydney took a long appreciative sniff no i dont think so then she laughed and took the bottle from him i wanted to celebrate i had a really good day you will tell me yes good lets find some glasses that wont embarrass this champagne she didnt know when shed been more charmed he had set a small table and two chairs on the tiny balcony off the bedroom a single pink peony graced an old green bottle in the center and music drifted from his radio to lull the sounds of traffic thick blue bowls held the spicy stew and rich black bread was heaped in a wicker basket while they ate she told him about her decision to promote janine and her altercation with lloyd you ask for his resignation you should fire him its a little more complicated than that flushed with success sydney lifted her glass to study the wine in the evening sunlight but the results the same if he pushes me ill have to go before the board i have memos other documentation take this building for example she tapped a finger on the old brick my grandfather turned it over to lloyd more than a year ago with a request that he see to tenant demands and maintenance you know the rest then perhaps i am grateful to him he reached up to tuck her hair behind her ear placing his lips just beneath the jet drops she wore if he had been honest and efficient i wouldnt have had to be rude in your office you might not be here with me tonight taking his hand she pressed it to her cheek maybe i should have given him a raise she turned her lips into his palm amazed at how easy it had become for her to show her feelings no instead well think this was destiny i dont like someone that close who would like to hurt you i know he leaked mrs wolburgs story to the press worked up again sydney broke off a hunk of bread his anger toward me caused him to put hayward in a very unstable position i wont tolerate that and neither will the board youll fix it he split the last of the champagne between them yes i will she was looking out over the neighborhood seeing the clothes hung on lines to dry in the sun the open windows where people could be seen walking by or sitting in front of televisions there were children on the sidewalk taking advantage of a long summer day when mikhails hand reached for hers she gripped it tightly today for the first time she said quietly i felt in charge my whole life i went along with what i was told was best or proper or expected catching herself she shook her head that doesnt matter what matters is that sometime over the last few months i started to realize that to be in charge meant you had to take charge i finally did i dont know if you can understand how that feels i know what i see and this is a woman who is beginning to trust herself and take what is right for her smiling he skimmed a finger down her cheek take me she turned to him he was less than an arms length away those dark untamed looks would have set any womans heart leaping but there was more happening to her than an excited pulse she was afraid to consider it there was only now she reminded herself and reached for him he held her rubbing his cheek against her hair murmuring lovely words she couldnt understand ill have to get a phrase book her eyes closed on a sigh as his mouth roamed over her face this one is easy he repeated a phrase between kisses she laughed moving willingly when he drew her to her feet easy for you to say what does it mean his lips touched hers again i love you he watched her eyes fly open saw the race of emotion in them run from shock to hope to panic mikhail iвђ why do the words frighten you he interrupted love doesnt threaten i didnt expect this she put a hand to his chest to insure some distance eyes darkening mikhail looked down at it then stepped back what did you expect i thought you wereвђ was there no delicate way i assumed that youвђ wanted only your body he finished for her and his voice heated he had shown her so much and she saw so little i do want it but not only will you tell me there was nothing last night of course not it was beautiful she had to sit down really had to it felt as though shed jumped off a cliff and landed on her head but he was looking at her in such a way that made her realize shed better stay on her feet the sex was good he picked up his glass though he was tempted to fling it off the balcony he only sipped good sex is necessary for the body and for the state of mind but it isnt enough for the heart the heart needs love and there was love last night for both of us her arms fell uselessly to her sides i dont know ive never had good sex before he considered her over the rim of his glass you were not a virgin you were married before yes i was married before and the taste of that was still bitter on her tongue i dont want to talkabout that mikhail isnt it enough that were good together that i feel for you something ive never felt before i dont want to analyze it i just cant yet you dont want to know what you feel that baffled him how can you live without knowing whats inside you its different for me i havent had what youve had or done what youve done and your emotionsвђtheyre always right there you can see them in the way you move the way you talk in your eyes in your work mine areвђ mine arent as volatile i need time he nearly smiled do you think im a patient man no she said with feeling good then youll understand that your time will be very short he began to gather dishes did this husband of yours hurt you a failed marriage hurts please dont push me on that now for tonight i wont with the sky just beginning to deepen at his back he looked at her because tonight i want you only to think of me he walked through the door leaving her to gather the rest of the meal he loved her the words swam in sydneys mind as she picked up the basket and the flower it wasnt possible to doubt it shed come to understand he was a man who said no more than he meant and rarely less but she couldnt know what love meant to him to her it was something sweet and colorful and lasting that happened to other people her father had cared for her in his erratic way but they had only spent snatches of time together in her early childhood after the divorce when shed been six they had rarely seen each other and her mother she didnt doubt her mothers affection but she always realized it ran no deeper than any of margerites interests there had been peter and that had been strong and true and important until they had tried to love as husband and wife but it wasnt the love of a friend that mikhail was offering her knowing it feeling it she was torn by twin forces of giddy happiness and utter terror with her mind still whirling she walked into the kitchen to find him elbow deep in soapsuds she set basket and bottle aside to pick up a dish towel are you angry with me she ventured after a moment some more im puzzled by you and hurt but he didnt want her guilt or pity to be loved should make you happy warm part of me is the other half is afraid of moving too fast and risking spoiling what weve begun he needed honesty she thought deserved it she tried to give him what she had all day today i looked forward to being here with you being able to talk to you to be able to share with you what had happened to listen to you i knew youd make me laugh that my heart would speed up when you kissed me she set a dry bowl aside why are you looking at me like that he only shook his head you dont even know youre in love with me but its all right he decided and offered her the next bowl you will youre so arrogant she said only halfannoyed im never sure if i admire or detest that you like it very much because it makes you want to fight back i suppose you think i should be flattered because you love me of course he grinned at her are you thinking it over she stacked the second bowl in the first then took the skillet i suppose its human nature and youreвђ im what she looked up at him again the cocky grin the dark amused eyes the tumble of wild hair youre so gorgeous his grin vanished when his mouth dropped open when he managed to close it again he pulled his hands out of the water and began to mutter are you swearing at me instead of answering her he yanked the dishcloth away from her to dry his hands i think i embarrassed you delighted she laughed and cupped his face in her hands yes i did stop thoroughly frazzled he pushed her hands away i cant think of the word for what i am but you are gorgeous before he could shake her off she wound her arms around his neck when i first saw you i thought you looked like a pirate all dark and dashing this time he swore in english and she only smiled maybe its the hair she considered combing her fingers through it i used to imagine what it would be like to get my hands in it or the eyes so moody so dangerous his hands lowered to her hips im beginning to feel dangerous hmm or the mouth it just might be the mouth she touched hers to it then slowly her eyes on his outlined its shape with her tongue i cant imagine theres a woman still breathing who could resist it youre trying to seduce me she let her hands slide down her fingers toying with his buttons somebody has to she only hoped she could do it right then of course theres this wonderful body the first time i saw you without a shirt i nearly swallowed my tongue she parted his shirt to let her hands roam over his chest his knees nearly buckled your skin was wet and glistening and there were all these muscles she forgot the game seducing herself as completely as him so hard and the skin so smooth i wanted to touch like this her breath shuddered out as she pressed her ringers into his shoulders kneading her way down his arms when her eyes focused on his again she saw that they were fiercely intense beneath her fingers his arms were taut as steel the words dried up in her mouth do you know what you do to me he asked he reached for the tiny black buttons on her jacket and his fingers trembled beneath the sunny capsleeved suit she wore lace the color of midnight he could feel the fast dull thud of his heart in his head or how much i need you she could only shake her head just show me its enough to show me she was caught fast and hard her mouth fused to his their bodies molded when her arms locked around his neck he lifted her an inch off the floor circling slowly his lips tangling with hers dizzy and desperate she clung to him as he wound his way into the bedroom she kicked her shoes off heedless of where they flew there was such freedom in the simple gesture she laughed then held tight as they fell to the bed the mattress groaned and sagged cupping them in the center he was muttering her name and she his when their mouths met again it was as hot and reckless as before now she knew where they would go and strained to match his speed the need to have him was as urgent as breath and she struggled with his jeans tugging at denim while he peeled away lace she could feel the nubs of the bedspread beneath her bare back and him hard and restless above her through the open window the heat poured in and there was a rumble low and distant of thunder she felt the answering power echo in her blood he wanted the storm outside in her never before had he understood what it was to truly crave he remembered hunger and a miserable wish for warmth he remembered wanting the curves and softness of a woman but all that was nothing nothing like the violent need he felt for her his hands hurried over her wanting to touch every inch and everywhere he touched she burned if she trembled he drove her further until she shuddered when she moaned he took and tormented until she cried out and still he hungered thunder stalked closer like a threat following it through the window came the passionate wail of the sax the sun plunged down in the sky tossing flame and shadows inside the hot darkening room they were aware of no time or sound reality had been whittled down to one man and one woman and the ruthless quest to mate he filled she surrounded crazed he lifted her up until her legs circled his waist and her back arched like a bow shuddering from the power they made he pressed his face to her shoulder and let it take him the rain held off until the next afternoon then came with a full chorus of thunder and lightning with her phone on speaker sydney handled a tricky conference call though janine sat across from her she took notes of her own thanks to a morning of intense work between herself and her new assistant she had the information needed at her fingertips yes mr bernstein i think the adjustments will be to everyones benefit she waited for the confirmation to run from bernstein to his lawyer to his west coast partner well have the revised draft faxed to all of you by five east coast time tomorrow she smiled to herself yes hayward industries believes in moving quickly thank you gentlemen goodbye after disengaging the speaker she glanced at janine well you never even broke a sweat look at me janine held out a hand my palms are wet those three were hoping to bulldoze you under and you came out dead even congratulations i think that transaction should please the board seven million she thought shed just completed a sevenmilliondollar deal and janine was right she was steady as a rock lets get busy on the fine print janine yes maam even as she rose the phone rang moving on automatic she plucked up sydneys receiver ms haywards office one moment please she clicked to hold mr warfield the faintest wisp of fatigue clouded her eyes as she nodded ill take it thank you janine she waited until her door closed again before bringing him back on the line hello channing sydney ive been trying to reach you for a couple of days where have you been hiding she thought of mikhails lumpy bed and smiled im sorry channing ive beenвђ involved all work and no play darling he said and set her teeth on edge im going to take you away from all that how about lunch tomorrow lutece as a matter of course she checked her calendar i have a meeting meetings were made to be rescheduled no i really cant as it is i have a couple of projects coming to a head and i wont be out of the office much all week now sydney i promised margerite i wouldnt let you bury yourself under the desk im a man of my word why was it she thought she could handle a multimilliondollar deal with a cool head but this personal pressure was making her shoulders tense my mother worries unnecessarily im really sorry channing but i cant chat now ive gotвђim late for an appointment she improvised beautiful women are entitled to be late if i cant get you out to lunch i have to insist that you come with us on friday we have a group going to the theater drinks first of course and a light supper after im booked channing have a lovely time though now i really must ring off ciao cursing herself she settled the receiver on his pipe of protest why hadnt she simply told him she was involved with someone simple question she thought simple answer channing would go to margerite and sydney didnt want her mother to know what she had with mikhail was hers only hers and she wanted to keep it that way for a little while longer he loved her closing her eyes she experienced the same quick trickle of pleasure and alarm maybe in time she would be able to love him back fully totally in the fullblooded way she was so afraid she was incapable of shed thought shed been frigid too shed certainly been wrong there but that was only one step time she thought again she needed time to organize her emotions and thenвђ then theyd see the knock on her office door brought her back to earth yes sorry sydney janine came in carrying a sheet of hayward stationery this just came in from mr binghams office i thought youd want to see it right away yes thank you sydney scanned the letter it was carefully worded to disguise the rage and bitterness but it was a resignation effective immediately carefully she set the letter aside it took only a marginal ability to read between the lines to know it wasnt over janine ill need some personnel files well want to fill mr binghams position and i want to see if we can do it inhouse yes maam she started toward the door then stopped sydney does being your executive assistant mean i can offer advice it certainly does watch your back theres a man who would love to stick a knife in it i know i dont intend to let him get behind me she rubbed at the pressure at the back of her neck janine before we deal with the files how about some coffee for both of us coming right up she turned and nearly collided with mikhail as he strode through the door excuse me the man was soaking wet and wore a plain white tshirt that clung to every ridge of muscle janine entertained a brief fantasy of drying him off herself im sorry ms hayward isвђ its all right sydney was already coming around the desk ill see mr stanislaski noting the look in her bosss eye janine managed to fight back the worst of the envy shall i hold your calls hmm mikhail grinned please youre janine with the promotion why yes sydney tells me you are excellent in your work thank you who would have thought the smell of wet male could be so terrific would you like some coffee no thank you hold mine too janine and take a break yourself yes maam with only a small envious sigh she shut the door dont you have an umbrella sydney asked him and leaned forward for a kiss he kept his hands to himself i cant touch you ill mess up your suit do you have a towel just a minute she walked into the adjoining bath what are you doing uptown at this time of day the rain slows things up i did paperwork and knocked off at four he took the towel she offered and rubbed it over his head is it that late she glanced at the clock and saw it was nearly five youre busy she thought of the resignation on her desk and the files she had to study a little when youre not busy maybe youd like to go with me to the movies id love to she took the towel back i need an hour ill come back he reached out to toy with the pearls at her throat theres something else what my family goes to visit my sister this weekend to have a barbecue will you go with me id love to go to a barbecue when they leave friday after work he wanted to sketch her in those pearls just those pearls though he rarely worked in anything but wood he thought he might carve her in alabaster we can go when youre ready i should be able to get home and changed by six sixthirty she corrected all right all right he took her shoulders holding her a few inches away from his damp clothes as he kissed her natasha will like you i hope so he kissed her again i love you emotion shuddered through her i know and you love me he murmured youre just stubborn he toyed with her lips another moment but soon youll pose for me iвђ what pose for me i have a show in the fall and i think ill use several pieces of you you never told me you had a show coming up the rest of it hit her of me yes well have to work very hard very soon so now i leave you alone so you can work oh shed forgotten all about files and phone calls yes ill see you in an hour and this weekend there will be no work but nextвђ he nodded his mind made up definitely in alabaster she ran the damp towel through her hands as he walked to the door mikhail with the door open he stood with his hand on the knob yes where does your sister live west virginia he grinned and shut the door behind her sydney stared at the blank panel for a full ten seconds west virginia chapter contents prev next shed never be ready in time always decisive about her wardrobe sydney had packed and unpacked twice what did one wear for a weekend in west virginia a few days in martiniqueвђno problem a quick trip to rome would have been easy but a weekend a family weekend in west virginia had her searching frantically through her closet as she fastened her suitcase a third time she promised herself she wouldnt open it again to help herself resist temptation she carried the bag into the living room then hurried back to the bedroom to change out of her business suit shed just pulled on thin cotton slacks and a sleeveless top in mint greenвђand was preparing to tear them off againвђwhen the knock sounded at her door it would have to do it would do she assured herself as she went to answer they would be arriving so late at his sisters home it hardly mattered what she was wearing with a restless hand she brushed her hair back wondered if she should secure it with a scarf for the drive then opened the door sequined and sleek margerite stood on the other side sydney darling as she glided inside she kissed her daughters cheek mother i didnt know you were coming into the city today of course you did she settled into a chair crossed her legs channing told you about our little theater party yes he did id forgotten sydney the name was a sigh youre making me worry about you automatically sydney crossed to the liquor cabinet to pour margerite a glass of her favored brand of sherry theres no need im fine no need margerites pretty coraltipped fingers fluttered you turn down dozens of invitations couldnt even spare an afternoon to shop with your mother last week bury yourself in that office for positively hours on end and theres no need for me to worry she smiled indulgently and she accepted the glass well were going to fix all of that i want you to go in and change into something dashing well meet channing and the rest of the party at doubles for a drink before curtain the odd thing was sydney realized shed very nearly murmured an agreement so ingrained was her habit of doing what was expected of her instead she perched on the arm of the sofa and hoped she could do this without hurting margerites feelings mother im sorry if ive been turning down invitations its because the transition at hayward is taking up most of my time and energy darling margerite gestured with the glass before she sipped thats exactly my point but sydney only shook her head and the simple fact is i dont feel the need to have my social calendar filled every night any longer as for tonight i appreciate i really do the fact that youd like me to join you but as i explained to channing i have plans irritation sparked in margerites eyes but she only tapped a nail on the arm of the chair if you think im going to leave you here to spend the evening cooped up with some sort of nasty paperworkвђ im not working this weekend sydney interrupted actually im going out of town forвђthe quick rap at the door relieved her excuse me a minute the moment shed opened the door sydney reached out a hand for him mikhail myвђ obviously he didnt want to talk until hed kissed her which he did thoroughly in the open doorway pale and rigid margerite pushed herself to her feet she understood as a woman would that the kiss she was witnessing was the kind exchanged by lovers mikhail sydney managed to draw back an inch im not finished yet one hand braced against his chest as she gestured helplessly with the other my motherвђ he glanced over caught the whitefaced fury and shifted sydney easily to his side a subtle gesture of protection margerite isnt there a rule she said stiffly about mixing business and pleasure she lifted her brows as her gaze skimmed over him but then you wouldnt be a rule follower would you mikhail some rules are important some are not his voice was gentle but without regret and without apology honesty is important margerite i was honest with you she turned away refusing to acknowledge the truth of that id prefer a moment with you alone sydney there was a pounding at the base of her skull as she looked at her mothers rigid back mikhail would you take my bag to the car ill be down in a few minutes he cupped her chin troubled by what he read in her eyes ill stay with you no she put a hand to his wrist it would be best if you left us alone just a few minutes her fingers tightened please she left him no choice muttering to himself he picked up her suitcase the moment the door closed behind him margerite whirled sydney was already braced it was rare very rare for margerite to go on a tirade but when she did it was always an ugly scene with vicious words you fool youve been sleeping with him i dont see that as your concern but yes i have do you think you have the sense or skill to handle a man like that there was the crack of glass against wood as she slapped the little crystal goblet onto the table this sordid little liaison could ruin you ruin everything ive worked for god knows you did enough damage by divorcing peter but i managed to put that right now this sneaking off for a weekend at some motel sydneys fists balled at her sides there is nothing sordid about my relationship with mikhail and im not sneaking anywhere as for peter i will not discuss him with you eyes hard margerite stepped forward from the day you were born i used everything at my disposal to be certain you had what you deserved as a hayward the finest schools the proper friends even the right husband now youre tossing it all back at me all the planning all the sacrificing and for what she whirled around the room as sydney remained stiff and silent oh believe me i understand that mans appeal id even toyed with the idea of having a discreet affair with him myself the wound to her vanity was raw and throbbing a womans entitled to a wild fling with a magnificent animal now and again and his artistic talents and reputation are certainly in his favor but his background is nothing less than nothing gypsies and farmers and peasants i have the experience to handle himвђhad i chosen to i also have no ties at the moment to make an affair awkward you however are on the verge of making a commitment to charming do you think hed have you if he ever learned youd been taking that magnificent brute to bed thats enough sydney moved forward to take her mothers arm thats past enough for someone whos so proud of the hayward lineage you certainly made no attempt to keep the name yourself it was always my burden to be a proper hayward to do nothing to damage the hayward name well ive been a proper hayward and right now im working day and night to be certain the hayward name remains above reproach but my personal time and whom i decide to spend that personal time with is my business pale with shock margerite jerked her hand away not once from the day shed been born had sydney spoken to her in such a manner dont you dare use that tone with me are you so blinded with lust that youve forgotten where your loyalties lie ive never forgotten my loyalties sydney tossed back and at the moment this is the most reasonable tone i can summon it surprised her as well this fast torrid venom but she couldnt stop it listen to me mother as far as channing goes i have never been on the verge of making a commitment to him nor do i ever intend to do so thats what you intended and i will never never be pressured into making that kind of commitment again if it would help disabuse channing of the notion id gladly take out a fullpage ad in the times announcing my relationship with mikhail as to that you know nothing about mikhails family you know nothing about him as a man you never got beyond his looks margerites chin lifted and you have yes i have and hes a caring compassionate man an honest man who knows what he wants out of life and goes after it youd understand that but the difference is hed never use or hurt anyone to get it he loves me and iвђ it flashed through her like light clear warm and utterly simple i love him love stunned margerite reared back now i know youve taken leave of your senses my god sydney do you believe everything a man says in bed i believe what mikhail says now im keeping him waiting and we have a long trip to make head high chin set margerite streamed toward the door then tossed a last look over her shoulder hell break your heart and make a fool of you in the bargain but perhaps thats what you need to remind you of your responsibilities when the door snapped shut sydney lowered onto the arm of the sofa mikhail would have to wait another moment he wasnt waiting he was prowling back and forth in front of the garage elevators he paced hands jammed into his pockets thoughts as black as smoke when the elevator doors slid open he was on sydney in a heartbeat are you all right he had her face in his hands no i can see you are not i am really it was unpleasant family arguments always are for him family arguments were fierce and furious and inventive they could either leave him enraged or laughing but never drained as she was now come we can go upstairs leave in the morning when youre feeling better no id like to go now im sorry he kissed both of her hands i dont like to cause bad feelings between you and your mama it wasnt you really because she needed it she rested her head on his chest soothed when his arms came around her it was old business mikhail buried too long i dont want to talk about it you keep too much from me sydney i know im sorry she closed her eyes feeling her stomach muscles dance her throat drying up it couldnt be so hard to say the words i love you mikhail the hand stroking her back went still then dived into her hair to draw her head back his eyes were intense like two dark suns searching hers he saw what he wanted to see what he needed desperately to see so youve stopped being stubborn his voice was thick with emotion and his mouth when it met hers gave her more than dozens of soft endearments you can tell me again while we drive i like to hear it laughing she linked an arm through his as they walked to the car all right and while you drive i tell you eyes wide she stopped i drive yes he opened the passenger door for her i start then you have a rum you have license yes she glanced dubiously at the gauges on the dash yes you arent afraid she looked back up to see him grinning not tonight im not it was after midnight when mikhail pulled up at the big brick house in shepherdstown it was cooler now there wasnt a cloud in the starscattered sky to hold in the heat beside him sydney slept with her head resting on a curled fist he remembered that she had taken the wheel on the turnpike driving from new jersey into delaware with verve and enthusiasm soon after theyd crossed the border into maryland and shed snuggled into the passenger seat again shed drifted off always he had known he would love like this that he would find the one woman who would change the zigzagging course of his life into a smooth circle she was with him now dreaming in an open car on a quiet road when he looked at her he could envision how their lives would be not perfectly to see perfectly meant there would be no surprises but he could imagine waking beside her in the morning in the big bedroom of the old house they would buy and make into a home together he could see her coming home at night wearing one of those pretty suits her face reflecting the annoyance or the success of the day and they would sit together and talk of her work of his one day her body would grow ripe with child he would feel their son or daughter move inside her and they would fill their home with children and watch them grow but he was moving too quickly they had come far already and he wanted to treasure each moment he leaned over to nuzzle his lips over her throat ive crossed the states with you milaya she stirred murmuring sleepily over rivers and mountains kiss me she came awake with his mouth warm on hers and her hand resting against his cheek she felt the flutter of a night breeze on her skin and smelled the fragrance of roses and honeysuckle and the stir of desire was just as warm just as sweet where are we the sign said wild wonderful west virginia he nipped at her lip you will tell me if you think it is so any place any place at all was wild and wonderful when he was there she thought as her arms came around him he gave a quiet groan then a grunt as the gearshift pressed into a particularly sensitive portion of his anatomy i must be getting old it is not so easy as it was to seduce a woman in a car i thought you were doing a pretty good job he felt the quick excitement stir his blood fantasized briefly then shook his head im intimidated i because my mama may peek out the window any minute come well find your bed then ill sneak into it she laughed as he unfolded his long legs out of the open door now im intimidated pushing her hair back she turned to look at the house it was big and brick with lights glowing gold in the windows of the first floor huge leafy trees shaded it pretty box hedges shielded it from the street when mikhail joined her with their bags they started up the stone steps that cut through the slope of lawn and here were the flowers the roses she had smelled and dozens of others no formal garden this but a splashy display that seemed to grow wild and willfully she saw the shadow of a tricycle near the porch in the spill of light from the windows she noted that a bed of petunias had been recently and ruthlessly dug up i think ivan has been to work mikhail commented noting the direction of sydneys gaze if he is smart he hides until its time to go home again before they had crossed the porch she heard the laughter and music it sounds as though theyre up sydney said i thought they might have gone to bed we have only two days together we wont spend much of it sleeping he opened the screen door and entered without knocking after setting the bags near the stairs then taking sydneys hand he dragged her down the hall toward the party sounds sydney could feel her reserve settling back into place she couldnt help it all the early training all the years of schooling had drummed into her the proper way to greet strangers politely coolly giving no more of yourself than a firm handshake and a quiet how do you do shed hardly made the adjustment when mikhail burst into the music room tugging her with him ha he said and swooped down on a small gorgeous woman in a purple sundress she laughed when he scooped her up her black mane of curling hair flying out as he swung her in a circle youre always late natasha said she kissed her brother on both cheeks then the lips what did you bring me maybe i have something in my bag for you he set her on her feet then turned to the man at the piano you take good care of her when she lets me spence kimball rose to clasp hands with mikhail shes been fretting for you for an hour i dont fret natasha corrected turning to sydney she smiledвђthe warmth was automaticвђthough what she saw concerned her this cool distant woman was the one her family insisted mikhail was in love with you havent introduced me to your friend sydney hayward a little impatient by the way sydney hung back he nudged her forward my sister natasha its nice to meet you sydney offered a hand im sorry about being so late its really my fault i was only teasing youre welcome here you already know my family they were gathering around mikhail as if it had been years since the last meeting and this is my husband spence but he was stepping forward puzzlement and pleasure in his eyes sydney sydney hayward she turned the practiced smile in place it turned to surprise and genuine delight spence kimball i had no idea offering both hands she gripped his mother told me youd moved south and remarried youve met natasha observed exchanging looks with her own mother as nadia brought over fresh glasses of wine ive known sydney since she was freddies age spence answered referring to his eldest daughter i havent seen her sinceвђ he trailed off remembering the last time had been at her wedding spence may have been out of touch with new york society in recent years but he was well aware the marriage hadnt worked out its been a long time sydney murmured understanding perfectly is small world yuri put in slapping spence on the back with fierce affection sydney is owner of building where mikhail lives until she pays attention to him he sulks i dont sulk grumbling a bit mikhail took his fathers glass and tossed back the remaining vodka in it i convince now she is crazy for me back up everyone rachel put in his egos expanding again mikhail merely reached over and twisted his sisters nose tell them youre crazy for me he ordered sydney so this one eats her words sydney lifted a brow how do you manage to speak when your mouths so full of arrogance alex hooted and sprawled onto the couch she has your number mikhail come over here sydney and sit beside me im humble you tease her enough for tonight nadia shot alex a daunting look you are tired after your drive she asked sydney a little iвђ im sorry instantly natasha was at her side of course youre tired ill show you your room she was already leading sydney out if you like you can rest or come back down we want you to be at home while youre here thank you sydney replied before she could reach for her bag natasha had hefted it its kind of you to have me natasha merely glanced over her shoulder youre my brothers friend so youre mine but she certainly intended to grill spence before the night was over at the end of the hall she took sydney into a small room with a narrow fourposter faded rugs were tossed over a gleaming oak floor snapdragons spiked out of an old milk bottle on a table by the window where gauzy priscillas fluttered in the breeze i hope youre comfortable here natasha set the suitcase on a cherrywood trunk at the foot of the bed its charming the room smelled of the cedar wardrobe against the wall and the rose petals scattered in a bowl on the nightstand im very happy to meet mikhails sister and the wife of an old friend id heard spence was teaching music at a university he teaches at shepherd college and he composes again thats wonderful hes tremendously talented feeling awkward she traced a finger over the wedding ring quilt i remember his little girl freddie she is ten now natashas smile wanned she tried to wait up for mikhail but fell asleep on the couch her chin angled she took ivan with her to bed thinking i would not strangle him there he dug up my petunias tomorrow i thinkвђ she trailed off head cocked is something wrong no its katie our baby automatically natasha laid a hand on her breast where her milk waited she wakes for a midnight snack if youll excuse me of course at the door natasha hesitated she could go with her instincts or her observations shed always trusted her instincts would you like to see her after only an instants hesitation sydneys lips curved yes very much across the hall and three doors down the sound of the childs restless crying was louder the room was softly lit by a nightlight in the shape of a pink sea horse there sweetheart natasha murmured in two languages as she lifted her baby from the crib mamas here now as the crying turned to a soft whimpering natasha turned to see spence at the doorway i have her shes wet and hungry thats all but he had to come in he never tired of looking at his youngest child that perfect and beautiful replica of the woman hed fallen in love with bending close his cheek brushing his wifes he stroked a finger over katies the whimpering stopped completely and the gurgling began youre just showing off for sydney natasha said with a laugh while sydney watched they cuddled the baby there was a look exchanged over the small dark head a look of such intimacy and love and power that it brought tears burning in her throat unbearably moved she slipped out silently and left them alone she was awakened shortly past seven by high excited barking maniacal laughter and giggling shouts coming from outside her window moaning a bit she turned over and found the bed empty mikhail had lived up to his promise to sneak into her room and she doubted either of them found sleep in the narrow bed much before dawn but he was gone now rolling over she put the pillow over her head to smother the sounds from the yard below since it also smothered her she gave it up resigned she climbed out of bed and pulled on her robe she just managed to find the doorknob and open the door when rachel opened the one across the hall the two disheveled women gave each other blearyeyed stares rachel yawned first when i have kids she began theyre not going to be allowed out of bed until ten on saturday mornings noon on sunday and only if theyre bringing me breakfast in bed sydney ran her tongue over her teeth propping herself on the doorjamb good luck i wish i wasnt such a sucker for them she yawned again got a quarter because she was still halfasleep sydney automatically searched the pockets of her robe no im sorry hold on rachel disappeared into her room then came back out with a coin call it excuse me heads or tails winner gets the shower first loser has to go down and get the coffee oh her first inclination was to be polite and offer to get the coffee then she thought of a nice hot shower tails rachel flipped caught the coin and held it out damn cream and sugar black ten minutes rachel promised then started down the hall she stopped glanced around to make sure they were alone since its just you and me are you really crazy about mikhail since its just you and me yes rachels grin was quick and she rocked back on her heels i guess theres no accounting for taste thirty minutes later refreshed by the shower and coffee sydney wandered downstairs following the sounds of activity she found most of the family had centered in the kitchen for the morning natasha stood at the stove in a pair of shorts and a tshirt yuri sat at the table shoveling in pancakes and making faces at the giggling baby who was strapped into one of those clever swings that rocked and played music alex slouched with his head in his hands barely murmuring when his mother shoved a mug of coffee under his nose ah sydney alex winced at his fathers booming greeting papa have some respect for the dying he only gave alex an affectionate punch on the arm you come sit beside me yuri instructed sydney and try tashs pancakes good morning natasha said even as her mother refilled sydneys coffee cup i apologize for my barbaric children and the mongrel who woke the entire house so early children make noise yuri said indulgently katie expressed agreement by squealing and slamming a rattle onto the tray of the swing everyones up then sydney took her seat spence is showing mikhail the barbecue pit he built natasha told her and set a heaping platter of pancakes on the table theyll stand and study and make men noises you were comfortable in the night sydney thought of mikhail and struggled not to blush yes thank you oh please she started to protest when yuri piled pancakes on her plate for energy he said and winked before she could think how to respond a small curlyhaired bullet shot through the back door yuri caught him on the fly and hauled the wriggling bundle into his arms this is my grandson brandon he is monster and i eat monsters for breakfast chomp chomp the boy of about three was wiry and tough squirming and squealing on yuris lap papa come watch me ride my bike come watch me you have a guest nadia said mildly and no manners resting his head against yuris chest brandon gave sydney a long owlish stare you can come watch me too he invited you have pretty hair like lucy thats a very high compliment natasha told her lucy is a cat miss hayward can watch you later she hasnt finished her breakfast you watch mama unable to resist natasha rubbed a hand over her sons curls soon go tell your daddy he has to go to the store for me papa has to come knowing the game yuri huffed and puffed and stuck brandon on his shoulders the boy gave a shout of laughter and gripped tight to yuris hair as his grandfather rose to his feet daddy look look how tall i am brandon was shouting as they slammed out of the screen door does the kid ever stop yelling alex wanted to know you didnt stop yelling until you were twelve nadia told him and added a flick with her dishcloth feeling a little sorry for him sydney rose to pour more coffee into his mug herself he snatched her hand and brought it to his lips for a smacking kiss youre a queen among women sydney run away with me do i have to kill you mikhail asked as he strolled into the kitchen alex only grinned we can arm wrestle for her god men are such pigs rachel observed as she walked in from the opposite direction why the question came from a pretty goldenhaired girl who popped through the doorway behind mikhail because freddie they think they can solve everything with muscles and sweat instead of their tiny little brains ignoring his sister mikhail pushed plates aside sat down and braced an elbow on the table alex grinned at the muttered ukrainian challenge palms slapped together what are they doing freddie wanted to know being silly natasha sighed and swung an arm around freddies shoulder sydney this is my oldest freddie freddie this is miss hayward mikhails friend disconcerted sydney smiled at freddie over mikhails head its nice to see you again freddie i met you a long time ago when you were just a baby really intrigued freddie was torn between studying sydney or watching mikhail and alex they were knee to knee hands clasped and the muscles in their arms were bulging yes i ahвђ sydney was having a problem herself mikhails eyes flicked up and over her before returning to his brothers i knew your father when you lived in new york there were a couple of grunts from the men at the table rachel sat at the other end and helped herself to pancakes pass me the syrup with his free hand mikhail shoved it at her smothering a grin rachel poured lavishly mama do you want to take a walk into town after i eat that would be nice ignoring her sons nadia began to load the dishwasher she preferred the arm wrestling to the rolling and kicking theyd treated each other to as boys we can take katie in the stroller if you like natasha ill walk in with you and check on the shop natasha washed her hands i own a toy store in town she told sydney oh sydney couldnt take her eyes off the two men natasha could very well have told her she owned a missile site thats nice the three stanislaski women grinned at each other sentimental nadia began to imagine a fall wedding would you like more coffee she asked sydney oh iвђ mikhail gave a grunt of triumph as he slapped his brothers arm on the table dishes jumped caught up in the moment freddie clapped and had her baby sister mimicking the gesture grinning alex flexed his numbed fingers two out of three get your own woman before sydney could react mikhail scooped her up planted a hard kiss on her mouth that tasted faintly and erotically of sweat then carried her out the door chapter contents prev next you might have lost you know amused by the lingering annoyance in her voice mikhail slid an arm around sydneys waist and continued to walk down the sloping sidewalk i didnt the pointвђ she sucked in her breath shed been trying to get the point through that thick slavic skull off and on for more than an hour the point is that you and alex arm wrestled for me as if i were a sixpack of beer his grin only widened a sixpack would make him a little drunk but that was nothing to what hed felt when hed looked up and seen the fascination in her eyes as shed stared at his biceps he flexed them a little believing a man had a right to vanity and then she continued making sure her voice was low as his family was wandering along in front and behind them you manhandled meвђin front of your mother you liked it i certainlyвђ did he finished remembering the hot helpless way shed responded to the kiss hed given her on his sisters back porch so did i she would not smile she would not admit for a moment to the spinning excitement shed felt when hed scooped her up like some sweaty barbarian carrying off the spoils of war maybe i was rooting for alex it seems to me he got the lions share of your fathers charm all the stanislaskis have charm he said unoffended he stopped and bending down plucked a painted daisy from the slope of the lawn they passed see hmm sydney twirled the flower under her nose perhaps it was time to change the subject before she was tempted to try to carry him off its good seeing spence again when i was fifteen or so i had a terrible crush on him narrow eyed mikhail studied his brotherinlaws back yes yes your sisters a lucky woman family pride came first hes lucky to have her this time she did smile i think were both right brandon tired of holding his mothers hand bolted back toward them you have to carry me he told his uncle have to with an enthusiastic nod brandon began to shimmy up mikhails leg like a monkey up a tree like papa does mikhail hauled him up then to the boys delight carried him for a while upside down hell lose his breakfast nadia called out then we fill him up again but mikhail flipped him over so brandon could cling to his back pink cheeked the boy grinned over at sydney im three years old he told her loftily and i can dress my own self and very well too amused she tapped his sneakered foot are you going to be a famous composer like your father nah im going to be a water tower theyre the biggest i see it was the first time shed heard quite so grand an ambition do you live with uncle mikhail no she said quickly not yet mikhail said simultaneously and grinned at her you were kissing him brandon pointed out how come you dont have any kids thats enough questions natasha came to the rescue plucking her son from mikhails back as her brother roared with laughter i just wanna knowвђ everything natasha supplied and gave him a smacking kiss but for now its enough you know you can have one new car from the shop he forgot all about babies his chocolatebrown eyes turned shrewd any car any little car you did kiss me mikhail reminded sydney as brandon began to badger his mother about how little was little sydney settled the discussion by ramming her elbow into mikhails ribs she found the town charming with its sloping streets and little shops natashas toy store the fun house was impressive its stock running the range from tiny plastic cars to exquisite porcelain dolls and music boxes mikhail proved to be cooperative when sydney wandered in and out of antique shops craft stores and boutiques somewhere along the line theyd lost the rest of the family or the family had lost them it wasnt until theyd started back uphill with his arms loaded with purchases that he began to complain why did i think you were a sensible woman because i am he muttered one of the few ukrainian phrases she understood if youre so sensible why did you buy all this how do you expect to get it back to new york pleased with herself she fiddled with the new earrings she wore the pretty enameled stars swung jauntily youre so clever i knew youd find a way now youre trying to flatter me and make me stupid she smiled you were the one who bought me the porcelain box trapped he shook his head shed studied the oval box its top decorated with a womans serene face in basrelief for ten minutes obviously in love and just as obviously wondering if she should be extravagant you were mooning over it i know she rose on her toes to kiss his cheek thank you you wont thank me when you have to ride for five hours with all this on your lap they climbed to the top of the steps into the yard just as ivan tail tucked securely between his legs streaked across the grass in hot pursuit were a pair of long lean cats mikhail let out a manful sigh he is an embarrassment to the family poor little thing sydney shoved the package she carried at mikhail ivan she clapped her hands and crouched down here boy spotting salvation he swung about scrambled for footing and shot back in her direction sydney caught him up and he buried his trembling head against her neck the cats sinuous and smug sat down a few feet away and began to wash hiding behind a woman mikhail said in disgust hes just a baby go arm wrestle with your brother chuckling he left her to soothe the traumatized pup a moment later panting freddie rounded the side of the house there he is the cats frightened him sydney explained as freddie came up to stroke ivans fur they were just playing do you like puppies freddie asked yes unable to resist sydney nuzzled yes i do me too and cats weve had lucy and desi for a long time now im trying to talk mama into a puppy petting ivan she looked back at the mangled petunias i thought maybe if i fixed the flowers sydney knew what it was to be a little girl yearning for a pet its a good start want some help she spent the next thirty minutes saving what flowers she could orвђsince shed never done any gardeningвђfollowing freddies instructions the pup stayed nearby shivering when the cats strolled up to wind around legs or be scratched between the ears when the job was done sydney left ivan to freddies care and went inside to wash up it occurred to her that it was barely noon and shed done several things that day for the first time shed been the grand prize in an arm wrestling contest shed played with children been kissed by the man she loved on a public street shed gardened and had sat on a sunny lawn with a puppy on her lap if the weekend kept going this way there was no telling what she might experience next attracted by shouts and laughter she slipped into the music room and looked out the window a softball game she realized rachel was pitching one long leg cocking back as she whizzed one by alex obviously displeased by the call he turned to argue with his mother she continued to shake her head at him bouncing brandon on her knee as she held firm to her authority as umpire mikhail stood spread legged his hands on his hips and one heel touching a ripped seat cushion that stood in as second base he tossed in his own opinion and rachel threw him a withering glance over her shoulder still displeased that hed caught a piece of her curve ball yuri and spence stood in the outfield catcalling as alex fanned for a second strike intrigued sydney leaned on the windowsill how beautiful they were she thought she watched as brandon turned to give nadia what looked like a very sloppy kiss before he bounded off on sturdy little legs toward a blueandwhite swing set a screen door slammed then freddie zoomed into view detouring to the swing to give her brother a couple of starter pushes before taking her place in the game alex caught the next pitch and the ball flew high and wide voices erupted into shouts surprisingly spry yuri danced a few steps to the left and snagged the ball out of the air mikhail tagged up streaked past third and headed for home where rachel had raced to wait for the throw his long strides ate up the ground those wonderful muscles bunching as he went into a slide rachel crowded the plate apparently undisturbed by the thought of nearly six feet of solid male hurtling toward her there was a collision a tangle of limbs and a great deal of swearing out nadias voice rang clearly over the din in the majors they called it clearing the benches every member of the family rushed toward the plateвђnot to fuss over the two forms still nursing bruises but to shout and gesture rachel punched mikhail in the chest he responded by covering her face with his hand and shoving her back onto the grass with a happy shout brandon jumped into the fray to climb up his fathers back sydney had never envied anything more we can never play without fighting natasha said from behind her she was smiling looking over sydneys shoulder at the chaos in her backyard her arms still felt the slight weight of the baby shed just rocked to sleep youre wise to watch from a distance but when sydney turned natasha saw that her eyes were wet oh please quickly she moved to sydneys side to take her hand dont be upset they dont mean it no i know desperately embarrassed she blinked the tears back i wasnt upset it was justвђit was silly watching them was something like looking at a really beautiful painting or hearing some incredibly lovely music i got carried away she didnt need to say more natasha understood after spences explanation of sydneys background that there had never been softball games horseplay or the fun of passionate arguments in her life you love him very much sydney fumbled that quiet statement wasnt as easy to respond to as rachels cocky question had been its not my business natasha continued but he is special to me and i see that youre special to him you dont find him an easy man no no i dont natasha glanced outside again and her gaze rested on her husband who was currently wrestling both freddie and brandon on the grass not so many years before she thought shed been afraid to hope for such things does he frighten you sydney started to deny it then found herself speaking slowly thoughtfully the hugeness of his emotions sometimes frightens me he has so many and he finds it so easy to feel them understand them express them ive never been the type to be led by mine or swept away by them sometimes he just overwhelms me and thats unnerving he is what he feels natasha said simply would you like to see some of it without waiting for an answer she walked over to a wall of shelves lovely carved and painted figures danced across the shelves some of them so tiny and exquisite it seemed impossible that any hand could have created them a miniature house with a gingerbread roof and candycane shutters a high silver tower where a beautiful womans golden hair streamed from the topmost window a palmsized canopy bed where a handsome prince knelt beside a lovely sleeping princess he brought me this one yesterday natasha picked up the painted figure of a woman at a spinning wheel it sat on a tiny platform scattered with wisps of straw and specks of gold the millers daughter from rumpelstiltskin she smiled tracing the delicate fingertips that rode the spindle theyre lovely all of them like a magical world of their own mikhail has magic natasha said for me he carves fairy tales because i learned english by reading them some of his work is more powerful tragic erotic bold even frightening but its always real because it comes from inside him as much as from the wood or stone i know what youre trying to show me here is his sensitivity its not necessary ive never known anyone more capable of kindness or compassion i thought perhaps you were afraid he would hurt you no sydney said quietly she thought of the richness of heart it would take to create something as beautiful as fanciful as the diminutive woman spinning straw into gold im afraid ill hurt him sydneyвђ but the back door slammed and feet clambered down the hall the interruption relieved sydney confiding her feelings was new and far from comfortable it amazed her that she had done so with a woman shed known less than a day there was something about this family she realized something as magical as the fairytale figures mikhail carved for his sister perhaps the magic was as simple as happiness as the afternoon wore on they ebbed and flowed out of the house noisy demanding and very often dirty nadia eventually cleared the decks by ordering all of the men outside how come they get to go out and sit in the shade with a bottle of beer while we do the cooking rachel grumbled as her hands worked quickly expertly with potatoes and a peeler becauseвђ nadia put two dozen eggs on boil in here they will pick at the food get big feet in my way and make a mess good point stillвђ theyll have to clean the mess we make natasha told her satisfied rachel attacked another potato her complaints were only tokens she was a woman who loved to cook as much as she loved trying a case if vera was here they wouldnt even do that our housekeeper natasha explained to sydney while she sliced and chopped a mountain of vegetables shes been with us for years we gave her the month off to take a trip with her sister could you wash those grapes obediently sydney followed instructions scrubbing fruit fetching ingredients stirring the occasional pot but she knew very well that three efficient women were working around her you can make deviled eggs nadia said kindly when she noted sydney was at a loss they will be cool soon i ahвђ she stared marginally horrified at the shiny white orbs shed rinsed in the sink i dont know how your mama didnt teach you to cook it wasnt annoyance in nadias voice just disbelief nadia had considered it her duty to teach every one of her childrenвђwhether theyd wanted to learn or not as far as sydney knew margerite had never boiled an egg much less deviled one sydney offered a weak smile no she taught me how to order in restaurants nadia patted her cheek when they cool i show you how to make them the way mikhail likes best she murmured in ukrainian when katies waking wail came through the kitchen intercom on impulse natasha shook her head before nadia could dry her hands and go up to fetch her granddaughter sydney would you mind with a guileless smile natasha turned to her my hands are full sydney blinked and stared you want me to go get the baby please more than a little uneasy sydney started out of the kitchen what are you up to tash rachel wanted to know she wants family with a hoot of laughter rachel swung an arm around her sister and mother shell get more than her share with this one the baby sounded very upset sydney thought as she hurried down the hall she might be sick what in the world had natasha been thinking of not coming up to get katie herself maybe when you were the mother of three you became casual about such things taking a deep breath she walked into the nursery katie her hair curling damply around her face was hanging on to the side of the crib and howling unsteady legs dipped and straightened as she struggled to keep her balance one look at sydney had her teardrenched face crumpling she flung out her arms tilted and landed on her bottom on the bright pink sheet oh poor baby sydney crooned too touched to be nervous did you think no one was coming she picked the sniffling baby up and katie compensated for sydneys awkwardness by cuddling trustingly against her body youre so little such a pretty little thing on a shuddering sigh katie tipped her head back you look like your uncle dont you he got embarrassed when i said he was gorgeous but you are downstairs three women chuckled as sydneys voice came clearly through the intercom ohoh after giving the little bottom an affectionate pat sydney discovered a definite problem youre wet right look i figure your mother could handle this in about thirty seconds flatвђthat goes for everybody else downstairs but everybody else isnt here so what do we do katie had stopped sniffling and was blowing bubbles with her mouth while she tugged on sydneys hair i guess well give it a try ive never changed a diaper in my life she began as she glanced around the room or deviled an egg or played softball or any damn thing whoops no swearing in front of the baby here we go she spotted a diaper bag in bold green stripes oh god katie theyre real ones blowing out a breath she took one of the neatly folded cotton diapers okay in for a penny in for a pound well just put you down on here gently she laid katie on the changing table and prepared to give the operation her best shot hey mikhail bounded into the kitchen and was greeted by three hissing shhs what sydneys changing katie natasha murmured and smiled at the sounds flowing through the intercom sydney mikhail forgot the beer hed been sent to fetch and stayed to listen okay were halfway there katies little butt was dry and powdered perhaps a little over powdered but better to err on the side of caution sydneyd figured her brow creased as she attempted to make the fresh diaper look like the one shed removed sans dampness this looks pretty close what do you think katie kicked her feet and giggled youd be the expert okay this is the tricky part no wriggling of course she did the more she wriggled and kicked the more sydney laughed and cuddled when shed managed to secure the diaper katie looked so cute smelled so fresh felt so soft she had to cuddle some more then it seemed only right that she hold katie up high so the baby could squeal and kick and blow more bubbles the diaper sagged but stayed generally where it belonged okay gorgeous now were set want to go down and see mama mama katie gurgled and bounced in sydneys arms mama in the kitchen four people scattered and tried to look busy or casual sorry it took so long she began as she came in she was wet she saw mikhail and stopped her cheek pressed against katies when their eyes met color washed to her cheeks the muscles in her thighs went lax it was no way no way at all she thought for him to be looking at her with his mother and sisters in the room ill take her stepping forward he held out his arms katie stretched into them still watching sydney he rubbed his cheek over the babys head and settled her with a natural ease on his hip come here before sydney could respond he cupped a hand behind her head and pulled her against him for a long bloodthumping kiss well used to such behavior katie only bounced and gurgled slowly he slid away then smiled at her ill come back for the beer juggling katie he swaggered out slamming the screen door behind him now nadia took a dazed sydney by the hands you make deviled eggs the sun was just setting on the weekend when sydney unlocked the door of her apartment she was laughingвђand she was sure shed laughed more in two days than she had in her entire life she set the packages she carried on the sofa as mikhail kicked the door closed you put more in here to come back than you had when you left he accused and set her suitcase down one or two things smiling she walked over to slip her arms around his waist it felt good wonderfully good especially knowing that his would circle her in response dyakuyu she said sampling thank you in his language you mangle it but youre welcome he kissed both her cheeks this is the traditional greeting or farewell she had to bite the tip of her tongue to hold back the grin i know she also knew why he was telling herвђagain shed been kissed warmly by each member of the family not the careless touch of cheek to cheek she was accustomed to but a firm pressure of lips accompanied by a fullblooded embrace only alex hadnt settled for her cheeks your brother kisses very well eyes as solemn as she could manage sydney touched her lips to mikhails cheeks in turn it must run in the family you liked it wellвђ she shot mikhail a look from under her lashes he did have a certain style hes a boy mikhail muttered though alex was less than two years his junior oh no this time a quick laugh bubbled out hes definitely not a boy but i think you have a marginal advantage marginal she linked her hands comfortably behind his neck as a carpenter youd know that even a fraction of an inch can be vitalвђfor fit his hands snagged her hips to settle her against him so i fit you hayward yes she smiled as he touched his lips to her brow it seems you do and you like my kisses better than alexs she sighed enjoying the way his mouth felt skimming down her temples over her jaw marginally her eyes flew open when he pinched her well reallyвђ but that was all she managed to get out before his mouth closed over hers she thought of flash fires ball lightning and electrical overloads with a murmur of approval she tossed heat back at him now instantly aroused he scooped her up in his arms i suppose i must prove myself sydney hooked her arms around his neck if you insist a dozen long strides and he was in the bedroom where he dropped her unceremoniously onto the bed by the time she had her breath back hed yanked off his shirt and shoes what are you grinning at he demanded its that pirate look again still smiling she brushed hair out of her eyes all you need is a saber and a black patch he hooked his thumbs in frayed belt loops so you think im a barbarian she let her gaze slide up his naked torso over the wild mane of hair the stubble that proved he hadnt bothered to pack a razor for the weekend to his eyes those dark dramatic dangerous eyes i think youre dazzling he would have winced but she looked so small and pretty sitting on the bed her hair tumbled from the wind her face still flushed from his rough impatient kiss he remembered how shed looked walking into the kitchen carrying katie her eyes had been full of delight and wonder and shyness shed flushed when his mother had announced that sydney had made the eggs herself and again when his father had wrapped her in a bear hug but mikhail had seen that shed hung on that her fingers had curled into yuris shirt just for an instant there were dozens of other flashes of memory how shed snuggled the puppy or taken brandons hand or stroked freddies hair she needed love she was strong and smart and sensible and she needed love frowning he sat on the edge of the bed and took her hand uneasiness skidded down sydneys spine what is it what did i do wrong it wasnt the first time hed heard that strain of insecurity and doubt in her voice biting back the questions and the impatience he shook his head nothing its me turning her hand over he pressed a soft kiss in the center of her palm then to her wrist where her pulse was beating as quickly from fear as from arousal i forget to be gentle with you to be tender shed hurt his feelings his ego she hadnt been responsive enough too responsive oh god mikhail i was only teasing about alex i wasnt complaining maybe you should no shifting to her knees she threw her arms around him and pressed her lips to his i want you she said desperately you know how much i want you even as the fire leaped in his gut he brought his hands lightly to her face fingers stroking easily the emotion he poured into the kiss came from the heart only and was filled with sweetness with kindness with love for a moment she struggled for the heat afraid she might never find it but his mouth was so soft so patient as her urgency turned to wonder his lips rubbed over hers and the friction sparked not the familiar flash fire but a warm glow golden so quietly beautiful her throat ached with it even when he took the kiss deeper deeper there was only tenderness weakened by it her body melted like wax her hands slid limp and useless from his shoulders in total surrender beautiful so beautiful he murmured as he laid her back on the bed emptying her mind stirring her soul with long drowning kisses i should be shot for showing you only one way i cantвђ think breathe move shh gently with an artists touch he undressed her tonight is only for you only to enjoy his breath caught as the dying sunlight glowed over her skin she looked too fragile to touch too lovely not to let me show you what you are to me everything she was everything after tonight he wanted her to have no doubt of it with slow worshipful hands he showed her that beyond passion beyond desire was a merging of spirits a generosity of the soul love could be peaceful selfless enduring her body was a banquet fragrant dazzling with erotic flavors but tonight he sampled slowly savoring sharing each sigh each shudder filled him with gratitude that she was his he wouldnt allow her to race helpless to resist she floated down the long dark river where he guided her through air the essence of silk never not even during their most passionate joining had she been so aware of her own body her own texture and shape and scent and his oh lord and his those rockhard muscles and brute strength now channeled into unimagined gentleness the subtlety of movement elicited new longings fresh knowledge and a symphony of understanding that was exquisite in its harmony let me give you let me show you let me take sensitive fingertips traced over her lingering to arouse moving on to seek out some new shattering pleasure and from her pleasure came his own just as sweet just as staggering just as simple she could hear her own breathing a quiet trembling sound as the room deepened with night a tribute to beauty tears dampened her cheeks and thickened her voice when she spoke his name his mouth covered hers again as at last he slipped inside her enfolded in her cradled by her he trembled under the long sighing sweep of sensation her mouth opened beneath his her arms lifted circled held more he remembered that he had once fought desperately for more now with her he had all even with hot hammers of need pounding at him he moved slowly knowing he could take her soaring again and again before that last glorious release i love you sydney his muscles trembled as he felt her rise to meet him only you always you chapter contents prev next when the phone rang it was pitchdark and they were sleeping tangled together like wrestling children sydney snuggled closer to mikhail squeezing her eyes tighter and muttered a single no determined to ignore it with a grunt mikhail rolled over her seriously considered staying just as he was as her body curved deliciously to his milaya he murmured then with an oath snatched the shrilling phone off the hook what because sydney was pounding on his shoulder he shifted off her alexi the sound of his brothers voice had him sitting straight up firing off in ukrainian only when alex assured him there was nothing wrong with the family did the sick panic fade youd better be in the hospital or jail neither he sat back rapped his head on the brass poles of the headboard and swore again why are you calling in the middle of the night rubbing his hand over his face mikhail gave sydneys clock a vicious stare the glowing dial read what struggling to tune in he shifted the phone to his other ear damn it when ill be there he slammed the phone down and was already up searching for his clothes when he realized sydney has turned on the light her face was dead pale your parents no no its not the family he sat on the bed again to take her hand its the apartment vandals the sharp edge of fear dulled to puzzlement vandals one of the cops who answered the call knows alex and that i live there so he called him theres been some damage to the building her heart was beginning to pound heavy and slow in her throat yes no one was hurt he watched her eyes close in relief at that before she nodded spray paint broken windows he bit off an oath two of the empty apartments were flooded im going to go see what has to be done give me ten minutes sydney said and sprang out of bed it hurt it was only brick and wood and glass but it hurt her to see it marred filthy obscenities were scrawled in bright red paint across the lovely old brownstone three of the lower windows were shattered inside someone had used a knife to gouge the railings and hack at the plaster in mrs wolburgs apartment water was three inches deep over the old hardwood floor ruining her rugs soaking the skirts of her sofa her lacy doilies floated like soggy lily pads they clogged up the sinks alex explained by the time they broke the windows downstairs and woke anyone up the damage here was pretty much done yes the damage was done sydney thought but it wasnt over the other unit up on two empty they did a lot of painting up there too he gave sydneys arm a squeeze im sorry were getting statements from the tenants butвђ it was dark sydney finished everyone was asleep and no ones going to have seen anything nothings impossible alex turned toward the babble of voices coming from the lobby where most of the tenants had gathered why dont you go on up to mikhails place its going to take a while to calm everyone down and clear them out no its my building id like to go talk to them with a nod he started to lead her down the hall funny they didnt bother to steal anythingвђand that they only broke into the two empty apartments she slanted him a look he might not have been wearing his uniform but he was definitely a cop is this an interrogation alex just an observation i guess youd know who had access to the tenants list i guess i would she replied i have a pretty fair idea whos responsible alex she touched a hand to the ruined banister oh not who tossed paint or flooded the rooms but who arranged it but i dont know if ill be able to prove it you leave the proving up to us she glanced at the streak of paint along the wall would you she shook her head before he could reply once im sure ill turn everything over to you thats a promiseвђif you promise to say nothing to mikhail thats a tough bargain sydney im a tough lady she said steadily and walked down to talk to her tenants by eight oclock she was in her office poring over every word in lloyd binghams personnel file by ten shed made several phone calls consumed too many cups of coffee and had a structured plan shed authorized mikhail to hire more men had spoken with the insurance investigator personally and was now prepared for a little psychological warfare she put the call through to lloyd bingham herself and waited three rings hello lloyd sydney hayward she heard the rasp of a lighter got a problem not that cant be fixed it was really a very pitiful gesture lloyd i dont know what youre talking about of course you dont the sarcasm was brisk almost careless next time id suggest you do more thorough research you want to come to the point the point is my building my tenants and your mistake its a little early in the day for puzzles the smug satisfaction in his voice had her fingers curling its not a puzzle when the solution is so clear i dont imagine you were aware of just how many service people live in the building and how early some of those service people get up in the morning have their coffee glance out the window or how cooperative those people would be in giving descriptions to the police if something happened to your building thats your problem he drew hard on his cigarette i havent been near it i never thought you had been she said easily youve always been good at delegating but once certain parties are picked up by the police i think youll discover how unsettling it is not to have loyal employees she could have sworn she heard him sweat i dont have to listen to this no of course you dont and i wont keep you oh lloyd dont let them talk you into a bonus they didnt do a very thorough job ciao she hung up immensely satisfied if she knew her quarry he wouldnt wait long to meet with his hirelings and pay them off and since the investigator had been very interested in sydneys theory she doubted that meeting would go unobserved she flicked her intercom janine i need food before we start interviewing the new secretaries order anything the deli says looks good today and double it you got it i was about to buzz you sydney your mothers here the little bubble of success burst in her throat tell her imвђ coward no tell her to come in but she took a deep breath before she rose and walked to the door mother sydney dear lovely in ivory linen and smelling of paris she strolled in and bussed sydneys cheek im so sorry iвђwhat ive had to wait all weekend to contact you and apologize margerite took a steadying breath herself twisting her envelope bag in her hands may i sit of course im sorry would you like anything to completely erase friday evening from my life seated margerite gave her daughter an embarrassed glance this isnt easy for me sydney the simple fact is i was jealous oh mother no please margerite waved her daughter to the chair beside her i dont enjoy the taste of crow and hope youll let me get it done in one large swallow as embarrassed as her mother sydney sat and reached for her hand it isnt necessary that you swallow at all well just forget it margerite shook her head i hope im big enough to admit my failings i like thinking im still an attractive and desirable woman you are margerite smiled fleetingly but certainly not an admirable one when i find myself eaten up with envy to see that a man id hoped to well enchant was instead enchanted by my daughter i regret very much my behavior and my words there she said on a puff of breath will you forgive me of course i will and ill apologize too for speaking to you the way i did margerite took a little square of lace from her bag and dabbed at her eyes you surprised me i admit ive never seen you so passionate about anything hes a beautiful man dear i wont say i approve of a relationship between you but i can certainly understand it she sighed as she tucked the handkerchief back into her bag your happiness is important to me sydney i know that her eyes still glistened when she looked at her daughter im so glad we cleared the air and i want to do something for you something to make up for all of this you dont have to do anything i want to really have dinner with me tonight sydney thought of the dozens of things she had to do of the quiet meal shed hoped for at the end of it all with mikhail then she looked at her mothers anxious eyes id love to wonderful the spring was back in her step as margerite got to her feet eight oclock le cirque she gave sydney a quick and genuine hug before she strolled out by eight sydney would have preferred a long solitary nap but stepped from her car dressed for the evening in a sleeveless silk jumpsuit of icy blue my mothers driver will take me home donald very good ms hayward enjoy your evening thank you the maitre d recognized her the moment she walked in and gracefully led her to her table himself as she passed through the elegant restaurant filled with sparkling people and exotic scents she imagined mikhail sitting at his scarred workbench with a bottle of beer and a bowl of goulash she tried not to sigh in envy when she spotted her motherвђwith channingвђat the comer table she tried not to grit her teeth there you are darling so certain her surprise was just what her daughter needed margerite didnt notice the lights of war in sydneys eyes isnt this lovely lovely sydneys voice was flat as channing rose to pull out her chair she said nothing when he bent close to kiss her cheek you look beautiful tonight sydney the champagne was already chilled and open she waited while hers was poured but the first sip did nothing to clear the anger from her throat mother didnt mention youd be joining us tonight that was my surprise margerite bubbled like the wine in her glass my little makeup present following a prearranged signal she set her napkin aside and rose im sure you two will excuse me while i powder my nose knowing he only had fifteen minutes to complete his mission channing immediately took sydneys hand ive missed you darling it seems like weeks since ive had a moment alone with you skillfully sydney slipped her hand from him it has been weeks how have you been channing desolate without you he skimmed a fingertip up her bare arm she really had exquisite skin when are we going to stop playing these games sydney i havent been playing she took a sip of wine ive been working a trace of annoyance clouded his eyes then cleared he was sure margerite was right once they were married she would be too busy with him to bother with a career it was best to get right to the point darling weve been seeing each other for months now and of course weve known each other for years but things have changed she met his eyes yes they have encouraged he took her hand again i havent wanted to rush you but i feel its time we take the next step i care for you very much sydney i find you lovely and amusing and sweet and suitable she muttered of course i want you to be my wife he slipped a box from his pocket opened the lid so that the round icy diamond could flash in the candlelight charmingвђ it reminded me of you he interrupted regal and elegant its beautiful channing she said carefully and cold she thought so very cold and im sorry but i cant accept it or you shock came first then a trickle of annoyance sydney were both adults theres no need to be coy what im trying to be is honest she shifted in her chair and this time it was she who took his hands i cant tell you how sorry i am that my mother led you to believe id feel differently by doing so shes put us both in an embarrassing position lets be candid channing you dont love me and i dont love you insulted he pokered up i hardly think id be offering marriage otherwise youre offering it because you find me attractive you think id make an excellent hostess and because i come from the same circle as you those are reasons for a merger not a marriage she closed the lid on the diamond and pressed the box into his hands i make a poor wife channing that much i know and i have no intention of becoming one again he relaxed a little i understand you might still be a bit raw over what happened between you and peter no you dont understand at all what happened between me and peter to be honest that has nothing to do with my refusing you i dont love you channing and im very much in love with someone else his fair skin flushed dark red then i find it worse than insulting that you would pretend an affection for me i do have an affection for you she said wearily but thats all i have i can only apologize if i failed to make that clear before this i dont believe an apology covers it sydney stiffly he rose to his feet please give my regrets to your mother straight as a poker he strode out leaving sydney alone with a miserable mix of temper and guilt five minutes later margerite came out of the ladies room beaming well now she leaned conspiratorially toward her daughter pleased to see that channing had given them a few moments alone tell me everything channings gone mother gone bright eyed margerite glanced around what do you mean gone i mean hes left furious i might add because i declined his proposal of marriage declined margerite blinked youвђsydney how could you how could i her voice rose and catching herself she lowered it to a whisper how could you you set this entire evening up of course i did frazzled margerite waved the oncoming waiter away and reached for her wine ive planned for months to see you and channing together and since it was obvious that mikhail had brought you out of your shell the timing was perfect channing is exactly what you need hes eligible his family is above reproach he has a beautiful home and excellent bearing i dont love him sydney for heavens sake be sensible ive never been anything else and perhaps thats been the problem i believed you when you came to see me this morning i believed you were sorry that you cared and that you wanted something more than polite words between us margerites eyes filled everything i said this morning was true id been miserable all weekend thinking id driven you away youre my daughter i do care i want whats best for you you mean it sydney murmured suddenly unbearably weary but you also believe that you know whats best for me i dont mean to hurt you but ive come to understand youve never known whats best for me by doing this tonight you caused me to hurt channing in a way i never meant to a tear spilled over sydney i only thoughtвђ dont think for me she was perilously close to tears herself dont ever think for me again i let you do that before and i ruined someones life i dont want you to be alone margerite choked out its hateful being alone mother though she was afraid she might weaken too much too soon she took margerites hands listen to me listen carefully i love you but i cant be you i want to know that we can have an honest caring relationship itll take time but it cant ever happen unless you try to understand me unless you respect me for who i am and not for what you want me to be i cant marry channing to please you i cant marry anyone oh sydney there are things you dont know things i dont want to talk about just please trust me i know what im doing ive been happier in the last few weeks than ive ever been stanislaski margerite said on a sigh yes stanislaski and hayward she added and me im doing something with my life mother its making a difference now lets go fix your makeup and start over at his workbench mikhail polished the rosewood bust he hadnt meant to work so late but sydney had simply emerged in his hands there was no way to explain the way it felt to have her come to life there it wasnt powerful it was humbling hed barely had to think though his fingers were cramped proving how long he had carved and sanded and polished he could barely remember the technique hed used the tools didnt matter only the result now she was there with him beautiful warm alive and he knew it was a piece he would never part with sitting back he circled his shoulders to relieve the stiffness it had been a viciously long day starting before dawn hed had to channel the edge of his rage into organizing the cleaning up and repair the worst of the damage now that the impetus that had driven him to complete the bust was passed he was punchy with fatigue but he didnt want to go to bed an empty bed how could he miss her so much after only hours why did it feel as though she were a world away when she was only at the other end of the city he wasnt going to go through another night without her he vowed as he stood up to pace she was going to have to understand that he would make her understand that a woman had no right to make herself vital to a mans existence then leave him restless and alone at midnight dragging a hand through his hair he considered his options he could go to bed and will himself to sleep he could call her and satisfy himself with the sound of her voice or he could go uptown and beat on her door until she let him in he grinned liking the third choice best snatching up a shirt he tugged it on as he headed for the door sydney gave a surprised gasp as he yanked it open just as her hand was poised to knock oh what instincts she pressed the hand to her heart im sorry to come by so late but i saw your light was on so iвђ he didnt let her finish but pulled her inside and held her until she wondered her ribs didnt crack i was coming for you he muttered coming for me i just left the restaurant i wanted you i wanted toвђ he broke off and snapped her back its after midnight what are you doing coming all the way downtown after midnight for heavens sakeвђ its not safe for a woman alone i was perfectly safe he shook his head cupping her chin next time you call ill come to you then his eyes narrowed an artists eyes a lovers eyes saw beyond carefully repaired makeup youve been crying there was such fury in the accusation she had to laugh no not really mother got a bit emotional and there was a chain reaction i thought you said youd made up with her i did i have at least i think weve come to a better understanding he smiled a little tracing a finger over sydneys lips she does not approve of me for her daughter thats not really the problem im afraid shes feeling a little worn down she had her plans blow up in her face tonight youll tell me yes she walked over intending to collapse on his badly sprung couch but she saw the bust slowly she moved closer to study it when she spoke her voice was low and thick you have an incredible talent i carve what i see what i know what i feel is this how you see me its how you are he laid his hands lightly on her shoulders for me then she was beautiful for him sydney thought and she was trembling with life and love for him i didnt even pose for you you will he brushed his lips over her hair talk to me when i met mother at the restaurant channing was with her over sydneys head mikhails eyes darkened dangerously the banker with the silk suits you let him kiss you before you let me i knew him before i knew you amused sydney turned and looked jealousy in the eye and i didnt let you kiss me as i recall you just did he did so again ruthlessly you wont let him again no good he drew her to the sofa then he can live with a laugh she threw her arms around him for a hug then settled her head on his shoulder none of its his fault really or my mothers either its more a matter of habit and circumstance shed set up the evening after persuading channing that the time was ripe to propose propose mikhail spun her around to face him he wants to marry you not really he thought he did he certainly doesnt want to marry me anymore but he was shoving her out of the way so he could get up and pace theres no reason to be angry sydney said as she smoothed down her jumpsuit i was the one in the awkward position as it is i doubt hell speak to me again if he does ill cut out his tongue slowly mikhail thought working up the rage no one marries you but me ive already explainedвђ she trailed off as breath lodged in a hard ball in her throat theres really no need to go into this she managed as she rose its late you wait mikhail ordered and strode into the bedroom when he came back carrying a small box sydneys blood turned to ice sit no mikhail pleaseвђ then stand he flipped open the top of the box to reveal a ring of hammered gold with a small center stone of fiery red the grandfather of my father made this for his wife he was a goldsmith so the work is fine even though the stone is small it comes to me because i am the oldest son if it doesnt please you i buy you something else no its beautiful please dont i cant she held her fisted hands behind her back dont ask me i am asking you he said impatiently give me your hand she took a step back i cant wear the ring i cant marry you with a shake of his head he pulled her hand free and pushed the ring on her finger see you can wear it its too big but well fix it no she would have pulled it off again but he closed his hand over hers i dont want to marry you his fingers tightened on hers and a fire darted into his eyes more brilliant than the shine of the ruby why i dont want to get married she said as clearly as she could i wont have what we started together spoiled marriage doesnt spoil love it nurtures it you dont know she snapped back youve never been married i have and i wont go through it again so struggling with temper he rocked back on his heels this husband of yours hurt you makes you unhappy so you think ill do the same damn it i loved him her voice broke and she covered her face with her hand as the tears began to fall torn between jealousy and misery he gathered her close murmuring endearments as he stroked her hair im sorry you dont understand let me understand he tilted her face up to kiss the tears im sorry he repeated i wont yell at you anymore its not that she let out a shuddering breath i dont want to hurt you please let this go i cant let this go or you i love you sydney i need you for my life i need you explain to me why you wont take me if there was anyone she began in a rush then shook her head before she could even wish it mikhail i cant consider marriage hayward is too much of a responsibility and i need to focus on my career this is smoke to hide the real answer all right bracing herself she stepped away from him i dont think i could handle failing again and losing someone i love marriage changes people how did it change you i loved peter mikhail not the way i love you but more than anyone else he was my best friend we grew up together when my parents divorced he was the only one i could talk to he cared really cared about how i felt what i thought what i wanted we could sit for hours on the beach up at the hamptons and watch the water tell each other secrets she turned away saying it all out loud brought the pain spearing back and you fell in love no she said miserably we just loved each other i can hardly remember a time without him and i cant remember when it started to become a given that wed marry someday not that we talked about it ourselves everyone else did sydney and peter what a lovely couple they make isnt it nice how well they suit i suppose we heard it so much we started to believe it anyway it was expected and wed both been raised to do what was expected of us she brushed at tears and wandered over to his shelves you were right when you gave me that figure of cinderella ive always followed the rules i was expected to go to boarding school and get top grades so i did i was expected to behave presentably never to show unacceptable emotions so i did i was expected to marry peter so i did she whirled back there we were both of us just turned twentytwoвђquite an acceptable age for marriage i suppose we both thought it would be fine after all wed known each other forever we liked the same things understood each other loved each other but it wasnt fine almost from the beginning honeymooning in greece we both loved the country and we both pretended that the physical part of marriage was fine of course it was anything but fine and the more we pretended the further apart we became we moved back to new york so he could take his place in the family business i decorated the house gave parties and dreaded watching the sun go down it was a mistake mikhail said gently yes it was one i made one i was responsible for i lost my closest friend and before it was over all the love was gone there were only arguments and accusations i was frigid why shouldnt he have turned to someone else for a little warmth but we kept up appearances that was expected and when we divorced we did so in a very cold very controlled very civilized manner i couldnt be a wife to him mikhail its not the same for us he went to her no its not and i wont let it be youre hurt because of something that happened to you not something you did he caught her face in his hands when she shook her head yes you need to let go of it and trust what we have ill give you time no desperate she clamped her hands on his wrists dont you see its the same thing you love me so you expect me to marry you because thats what you wantвђwhat you think is best not best he said giving her a quick shake right i need to share my life with you i want to live with you make babies with you watch them grow theres a family inside us sydney she jerked away he wouldnt listen she thought he wouldnt understand marriage and family arent in my plans she said suddenly cold youre going to have to accept that accept you love me im good enough for that good enough for you to take to your bed but not for changing plans all because you once followed rules instead of your heart what im following now is my common sense she walked by him to the door im sorry i cant give you what you want you will not go home alone i think itll be better if i leave you want to leave you leave he stalked over to wrench the door open but ill take you it wasnt until she lay teary and fretful in her bed that she realized she still wore his ring chapter contents prev next it wasnt that she buried herself in work over the next two days it was that work buried her sydney only wished it had helped keeping busy was supposed to be good for the morale so why was hers flat on its face she closed the biggest deal of her career at hayward hired a new secretary to take the clerical weight off janine and handled a fullstaff meeting hayward stock had climbed three full points in the past ten days the board was thrilled with her and she was miserable an officer stanislaski on two ms hayward her new secretary said through the intercom stanвђoh her spirits did a jig then settled officer yes ill take it thank you sydney pasted on a smile for her own peace of mind alex hey pretty lady thought youd want to be the first to know they just brought your old pal lloyd bingham in for questioning her smiled faded i see the insurance investigator took your advice and kept an eye on him he met with a couple of bad numbers yesterday passed some bills once they were picked up they sang better than springsteen then lloyd did hire someone to vandalize the building so they say i dont think youre going to have any trouble from him for a while im glad to hear it you were pretty sharp homing in on him brains and beauty he said with a sigh that nearly made her smile again why dont we take off to jamaica for a couple of days drive mikhail crazy i think hes already mad enough hey hes giving you a hard time just come to uncle alex when she didnt respond the teasing note dropped out of his voice dont mind mik sydney hes got moods thats all its the artist hes nuts about you i know her fingers worried the files on her desk maybe you could give him a call tell him the news sure anything else you want me to pass on tell himвђ no she decided no ive already told him thanks for calling alex no problem let me know if you change your mind about jamaica she hung up wishing she felt as young as alex had sounded as happy as easy but then alex wasnt in love and he hadnt punched a hole in his own dreams is that what shed done sydney wondered as she pushed away from her desk had she sabotaged her own yearnings no shed stopped herself and the man she loved from making a mistake marriage wasnt always the answer she had her own example to prove it and her mothers once mikhail had cooled off hed accept her position and they could go on as they had before who was she kidding he was too stubborn too bullheaded too damn sure his way was the right way to back down for an instant and what if he said all or nothing what would she do then snatching up a paper clip she began to twist it as she paced the office if it was a matter of giving him up and losing him or giving in and risking losing himвђ god she needed someone to talk to since it couldnt be mikhail she was left with pitifully few choices once she would have taken her problems to peter but that wasвђ she stopped snapping the mangled metal in her fingers that was the source of the problem and maybe just maybe the solution without giving herself time to think she rushed out of her office and into janines i have to leave town for a couple of days she said without preamble janine was already rising from behind her new desk butвђ i know its sudden and inconvenient but it cant be helped theres nothing vital pending at the moment so you should be able to handle whatever comes in if you cant then it has to wait sydney you have three appointments tomorrow you take them you have the files you have my viewpoint as soon as i get to where im going ill call in but sydney janine scurried to the door as sydney strode away where are you going to see an old friend less than an hour after sydney had rushed from her office mikhail stormed in hed had it hed given the woman two days to come to her senses and she was out of time they were going to have this out and have it out now he breezed by the new secretary with a curt nod and pushed open sydneys door excuse me sir excuse me mikhail whirled on the hapless woman where the hell is she ms hayward is not in the office she said primly im afraid youll have toвђ if not here where ill handle this carla janine murmured from the doorway yes maam carla made her exit quickly and with relief ms haywards not here mr stanislaski is there something i can do for you tell me where she is im afraid i cant the look in his eyes had her backing up a step i only know shes out of town for a day or two she left suddenly and didnt tell me where she was going out of town he scowled at the empty desk then back at janine she doesnt leave her work like this i admit its unusual but i got the impression it was important im sure shell call in ill be happy to give her a message for you he said something short and hard in ukrainian and stormed out again i think id better let you tell her that yourself janine murmured to the empty room twentyfour hours after leaving her office sydney stood on a shady sidewalk in georgetown washington dc a headlong rush of adrenaline had brought her this far far enough to have her looking at the home where peter had settled when hed relocated after the divorce the impulsive drive to the airport the quick shuttle from city to city had been easy enough even the phone call to request an hour of peters time hadnt been so difficult but this this last step was nearly impossible she hadnt seen him in over three years and then it had been across a wide table in a lawyers office civilized god yes theyd been civilized and strangers it was foolish ridiculous taking off on this kind of tangent talking to peter wouldnt change anything nothing could yet she found herself climbing the stairs to the porch of the lovely old row house lifting the brass knocker and letting it rap on the door he answered himself looking so much the same that she nearly threw out her hands to him as she would have done once he was tall and leanly built elegantly casual in khakis and a linen shirt his sandy hair was attractively rumpled but the green eyes didnt light with pleasure instead remaining steady and cool sydney he said backing up to let her inside the foyer was cool and light speaking subtly in its furnishings and artwork of discreet old money i appreciate you seeing me like this peter you said it was important to me well then knowing nothing else to say he ushered her down the hall and into a sitting room manners sat seamlessly on both of them causing her to make the right comments about the house and him to parry them while offering her a seat and a drink youre enjoying washington then very much he sipped his own wine while she simply turned her glass around and around in her hand she was nervous he knew her too well not to recognize the signs and she was as lovely as ever it hurt he hated the fact that it hurt just to look at her and the best way to get past the pain was to get to the point what is it i can do for you sydney strangers she thought again as she looked down at her glass they had known each other all of their lives had been married for nearly three years and were strangers its difficult to know where to start he leaned back in his chair and gestured pick a spot peter why did you marry me i beg your pardon i want to know why you married me whatever hed been expecting it hadnt been this shifting he drank again for several of the usual reasons i suppose you loved me his eyes flashed to hers you know i loved you i know we loved each other you were my friend she pressed her lips together my best friend he got up to pour more wine we were children not when we married we were young but we werent children and we were still friends i dont know how it all went so wrong peter or what i did to ruin it so completely butвђ you he stared the bottle in one hand the glass in the other what do you mean you ruined it i made you unhappy miserably unhappy i know i failed in bed and it all spilled over into the rest until you couldnt even bear to be around me you didnt want me to touch you he shot back damn it it was like making love toвђ an iceberg she finished flatly so you said fighting guilt he set his glass down i said a lot of things so did you i thought id gotten past most of it until i heard your voice this afternoon im sorry she rose her body and voice stiff to compensate for shattered pride ive just made it worse coming here i am sorry peter ill go it was like making love with my sister the words burst out and stopped her before she crossed the room my pal damn sydney i couldntвђ the humiliation of it clawed at him again i could never get beyond that and make you well a wife it unmanned me and i took it out on you i thought you hated me he slapped the bottle back on the table it was easier to try to hate you than admit i couldnt arouse either one of us that i was inadequate but i was baffled she took a step toward him i know i was useless to you in bedвђbefore you told me i knew it and you had to go elsewhere for what i couldnt give you i cheated on you he said flatly i lied and cheated my closest friend i hated the way youd started to look at me the way i started to look at myself so i went out to prove my manhood elsewhere and hurt you when you found out i did the manly thing and turned the blame on you hell sydney we were barely speaking to each other by that time except in public i know and i remember how i reacted the hateful things i said to you i let pride cost me a friend i lost a friend too ive never been sorrier for anything in my life it cost him to walk to her to take her hand you didnt ruin anything syd at least not alone i need a friend peter i very badly need a friend he brushed a tear away with his thumb willing to give me another shot smiling a little he took out his handkerchief here blow your nose and sit down she did clinging to his hand was that the only reason it didnt work because we couldnt handle the bedroom that was a big one other than that were too much alike its too easy for us to step behind breeding and let a wound bleed us dry hell syd what were we doing getting married doing what everyone told us there you go comforted she brought his hand to her cheek are you happy peter im getting there how about you president hayward she laughed were you surprised flabbergasted i was so proud of you dont youll make me cry again ive got a better idea he kissed her forehead come out in the kitchen ill fix us a sandwich and you can tell me what youve been up to besides big business it was almost easy there was some awkwardness little patches of caution but the bond that had once held them together had stretched instead of broken slowly carefully they were easing the tension on it over rye bread and coffee she tried to tell him the rest have you ever been in love peter marsha rosenbloom that was when we were fourteen and shed already given up a training bra he said with his mouth full i was deeply in love then he smiled at her no ive escaped that particular madness if you were if you found yourself in love with someone would you consider marriage again i dont know id like to think id do a better job of it but i dont know who is he stalling she poured more coffee hes an artist a carpenter which both he sculpts and he builds ive only known him a little while just since june moving quick sydney i know thats part of the problem everything moves fast with mikhail hes so bold and sure and full of emotion like his work i suppose as two and two began to make four his brows shot up the russian ukrainian she corrected automatically good god stanislaski right theres a piece of his in the white house is there she gave peter a bemused smile he didnt mention it he took me home to meet his family this wonderful family but he didnt tell me his works in the white house it shows you where his priorities lie and youre in love with him yes he wants to marry me she shook her head i got two proposals in the same night one from mikhail and one from channing warfield lord sydney not channing hes not your type she shoved the coffee aside to lean closer why in the first place hes nearly humorless hed bore you mindless the only thing he knows about daddys business is how to take clients to lunch and his only true love is his tailor she really smiled ive missed you peter he took her hand again what about your big bold artist he doesnt have a tailor or take clients to lunch and he makes me laugh peter i couldnt bear to marry him and have it fall apart on me again i cant tell you if its right and if i were you i wouldnt listen to anyones goodintentioned advice this time around but youll give me some anyway but ill give you some anyway he agreed and felt years drop away dont judge whatever you have with him by the mess we made just ask yourself a couple of questions does he make you happy do you trust him how do you imagine your life with him how do you imagine it without him and when i have the answers youll know what to do he kissed the hand joined with his i love you sydney i love you too answer the questions she thought as she pushed the elevator button in mikhails lobby it was twentyfour hours since peter had listed them but she hadnt allowed herself to think of them hadnt had to she corrected as she stepped inside the car she already knew the answers did he make her happy yes wildly happy did she trust him without reservation her life with him a roller coaster of emotions demands arguments laughter frustration without him blank she simply couldnt imagine it she would have her work her routine her ambitions no shed never be without a purpose again but without him it would all be straight lines so she knew what to do if it wasnt too late there was the scent of drywall dust in the hallway when she stepped out of the elevator she glanced up to see the ceiling had been replaced the seams taped mudded and sanded all that was left to be done here was the paint and trim he did good work she thought as she ran her hand along the wall in a short amount of time hed taken a sad old building and turned it into something solid and good there was still work ahead weeks before the last nail would be hammered but what he fixed would last pressing a hand to her stomach she knocked on his door and hoped there wasnt a sound from inside no blare of music no click of work boots on wood surely he hadnt gone to bed she told herself it was barely ten she knocked again louder and wondered if she should call out his name a door openedвђnot his but the one just down the hall keely poked her head out after one quick glance at sydney the friendliness washed out of her face hes not here she said her champagne voice had gone flat keely didnt know the details but she was sure of one thing this was the woman who had put mikhail in a miserable mood for the past few days oh sydneys hand dropped to her side do you know where he is out keely struggled not to notice that there was misery in sydneys eyes as well i see sydney willed her shoulders not to slump ill just wait suit yourself keely said with a shrug what did she care if the woman was obviously in love this was the woman whod hurt her pal as an actress keely prided herself on recognizing the mood beneath the actions mikhail might have been fiercely angry over the past few days but beneath the short temper had been raw seeping hurt and shed put it there what did it matter if she was suffering too of course it mattered keelys sentimental heart went gooey in her chest listen hell probably be back soon do you want a drink or something no really im fine hows ah your apartment coming new stove works like a champ unable to be anything but kind keely leaned on the jamb theyve still got a little of this and thatвђespecially with the damage those idiots did she brightened hey did you know they arrested a guy yes janine had told her about lloyds arrest when shed called in im sorry he was only trying to get back at me its not your fault the guys a jerk anyway they sucked up the water and mik mixed up some stuff to get the paint off the brick they had to tear out the ceiling in the apartment below that empty place and the floors buckled up pretty bad she shrugged again you know mik hell fix it up yes she knew mik do you know if there was much damage to mrs wolburgs things the rugs are a loss a lot of other things were pretty soggy theyll dry out more comfortable keely took a bite of the banana shed been holding behind her back her grandson was by shes doing real good using a walker and everything already and crabbing about coming home were planning on throwing her a welcomeback party next month maybe youd like to come idвђ they both turned at the whine of the elevator the doors opened and deep voices raised in some robust ukrainian folk song poured out just ahead of the two men they were both a little drunk more than a little grubby and the way their arms were wrapped around each other it was impossible to say who was supporting whom sydney noticed the blood first it was smeared on mikhails white tshirt obviously from the cuts on his lip and over his eye my god the sound of her voice had mikhails head whipping up like a wolf his grin faded to a surly stare as he and his brother stumbled to a halt what do you want the words were thickened with vodka and not at all welcoming what happened to you she was already rushing toward them was there an accident hey pretty lady alex smiled charmingly though his left eye was puffy with bruises and nearly swollen shut we had a hellva party shouldve been there right bro mikhail responded by giving him a sluggish punch in the stomach sydney decided it was meant as affection as mikhail then turned locked his brother in a bear hug kissed both his cheeks while mikhail searched his pockets for keys sydney turned to alex what happened who did this to you did what he tried to wink at keely and winced oh this he touched ginger fingers to his eye and grinned hes always had a sneaky left he shot his brother a look of bleary admiration while mikhail fought to fit what seemed like a very tiny key in an even tinier lock i got a couple good ones in under his guard wouldnt have caught him if he hadnt been drunk course i was drunk too he weaved toward keelys door hey keely my beautiful goldhaired dream got a raw steak no but having sympathy for the stupid she took his arm come on champ ill pour you into a cab lets go dancing he suggested as she guided him back to the elevator like to dance i live for it she glanced over her shoulder as she shoved him into the elevator good luck she told sydney she was going to need it sydney decided as she walked up behind mikhail just as he managed to open his own door he shoved it back nearly caught her in the nose but her reflexes were better than his at the moment youve been fighting with your brother she accused so he thought it was a shame a damn shame that the sight of her was sobering him up so quickly you would rather i fight with strangers oh sit down using her temporary advantage she shoved him into a chair she strode off into the bathroom muttering to herself when she came back with a wet washcloth and antiseptic he was up again leaning out the window trying to clear his head are you sick he pulled his head in and turned back disdain clear on his battered face stanislaskis dont get sick from vodka maybe a little queasy he thought when the vodka was followed by a couple of solid rights to the gut then he grinned his baby brother had a hell of a punch just drunk then she said primly and pointed to the chair sit down ill clean your face i dont need nursing but he sat because it felt better that way what you need is a keeper bending over she began to dab at the cut above his eye while he tried to resist the urge to lay his cheek against the soft swell of her breast going out and getting drunk beating up your brother why would you do such a stupid thing he scowled at her it felt good oh im sure it feels marvelous to have a naked fist popped in your eye she tilted his head as she worked that eye was going to bruise dramatically before morning i cant imagine what your mother would say if she knew she would say nothing shed smack us both his breath hissed when she slopped on the antiseptic even when he starts it she smacks us both indignation shimmered explain that im sure you both deserved it pathetic she muttered then looked down at his hands idiot the skin on the knuckles was bruised and broken youre an artist damn it you have no business hurting your hands it felt good incredibly good to have her touching and scolding him any minute he was going to pull her into his lap and beg i do what i like with my own hands he said and thought about what hed like to be doing with them right now you do what you like period she tossed back as she gently cleaned his knuckles shouting at people punching people drinking until you smell like the inside of a vodka bottle he wasnt so drunk he didnt know an insult when he heard one nudging her aside he stood and staggering only a little disappeared into the next room a moment later she heard the shower running this wasnt the way shed planned it sydney thought wringing the washcloth in her hands she was supposed to come to him tell him how much she loved him ask him to forgive her for being a fool and he was supposed to be kind and understanding taking her in his arms telling her shed made him the happiest man in the world instead hed been drunk and surly and shed been snappish and critical well he deserved it before she had time to think shed heaved the washcloth toward the kitchen where it slapped wetly against the wall then slid down to the sink she stared at it for a minute then down at her own hands shed thrown something and it felt wonderful glancing around she spotted a paperback book and sent it sailing a plastic cup gave a nice ring when it hit the wall but shed have preferred the crash of glass snatching up a battered sneaker she prepared to heave that as well a sound in the doorway had her turning redirecting aim and shooting it straight into mikhails damp naked chest his breath woofed out what are you doing throwing things she snatched up the second shoe and let it fly he caught that one before it beaned him you leave me go away without a word and you come to throw things thats right eyes narrowed he tested the weight of the shoe he held it was tempting very tempting to see if he could land it on the point of that jutting chin on an oath he dropped it however much she deserved it he just couldnt hit a woman where did you go she tossed her hair back i went to see peter he shoved his bruised hands into the pockets of the jeans hed tugged on you leave me to go see another man then you come back to throw shoes at my head tell me why i shouldnt just toss you out that window and be done with it it was important that i see him that i talk to him and iвђ you hurt me he blurted out the words burned on his tongue he hated to admit it do you think i care about getting a punch in the face youd already twisted my heart this i can fight he said touching the back of his hand to his cut lip what you do to me inside leaves me helpless and i hate it im sorry she took a step toward him but saw she wasnt yet welcome i was afraid id hurt you more if i tried to give you what you wanted mikhail listen please peter was the only person who cared for me for me my parentsвђ she could only shake her head theyre not like yours they wanted what was best for me im sure but their way of giving it was to hire nannies and buy me pretty clothes send me to the best boarding school you dont know how lonely it was impatient she rubbed her fingers over her eyes to dry them i only had peter and then i lost him what i feel for you is so much bigger so much more that i dont know what id do if i lost you he was softening she could do that to him as well no matter how he tried to harden his heart she could melt it you left me sydney im not lost i had to see him i hurt him terribly mikhail i was convinced that id ruined the marriage the friendship the love what if id done the same with us with a little sigh she walked to the window the funny thing was he was carrying around the same guilt the same remorse the same fears talking with him being friends again made all the difference im not angry that you talked to him but that you went away i was afraid you wouldnt come back she turned from the window im finished with running i only went away because id hoped i could come back to you really come back he stared into her eyes trying to see inside have you yes she let out a shaky breath all the answers are yes we walked through this building once and i could hear the voices all the sounds behind the doors the smells the laughing i envied you belonging here i need to belong i want to have the chance to belong to have that family you said was inside us she reached up drawing a chain from around her neck at the end the little ruby flashed its flame shaken he crossed the room to cup the ring in his hand you wear it he murmured i was afraid to keep it on my finger that id lose it i need you to tell me if you still want me to have it his eyes came back to hers and locked even as he touched his lips to hers gently he watched her i didnt ask you right the first time i didnt answer right the first time she took his face in her hands to kiss him again to feel again you were perfect i was clumsy angry that the banker had asked you before me eyes wet she smiled what banker i dont know any bankers unfastening the chain from around her neck he set it aside it was not how id planned it there was no music i hear music no soft words no pretty light no flowers theres a moon i still have the first rose you gave me touched he kissed her hands i told you only what i wanted not what id give you have my heart sydney as long as it beats my life is your life he slipped the ring onto her finger will you belong to me she curled her fingers to keep the ring in place i already do
