chapter this the old woman said is for you allena studied the pendant that swung gently from the thickly braided links of a silver chain really shed only come in to browse her budget didnt allow for impulse buys which were of course the most fun and the most satisfying and her affection for all things impulsive was the very reason she couldnt afford to indulge herself she shouldnt have entered the shop at all but who could resist a tiny little place tucked into the waterfront of a charming irish village especially a place called charms and cures certainly not allena kennedy its beautiful but i theres only one the womans eyes were faded and blue like the sea that slapped and spewed against the stone wall barely a stones throw from the door her hair was steel gray and bundled into a bun that lay heavy on her thin neck she wore a fascinating rattle of chains and pins but there was nothing allena thought like the pendant she held in her bony fingers only one the silver was cured in dagdas cauldron over the midsummers fire and carved by the finger of merlin he that was arthurs merlin allena was a sucker for tales of magic and heroics her stepsister margaret would have sniffed and said no she was simply a sucker the high kings sorcerer wandered through ireland in his time it was here he found the giants dance and coveting it for arthur floated it away over the irish sea to britain but while he took magic from this land some he also left watching allena she set the pendant swaying here is some and it belongs to you well i really cant but allena trailed off her gaze locked on the pendant it was a long oval dulled and tarnished a bit and centered in it was a carving in the shape of a bursting star it seemed to catch the murky cloudfiltered light coming through the small shop window hold it expand it so that it glittered hypnotically in allenas eyes it seemed the star shimmered i just came in to look around sure and if you dont look you cant find can you you came looking all the way from america shed come allena tried to remember to assist margaret with the tour group margarets business a civilized adventure was very successful and very regimented everyone said that allena needed some regimentation and margaret had been clear brutally clear that this opportunity was her last chance be organized be prepared and be on time margaret had told her as shed sat behind her polished desk in her perfectly terrifying and perfectly ordered office in new york if you can manage that there might be a chance for you if you cant i wash my hands of you lena it wouldnt be the first time someone had washed their hands of her in the past three years shed lost three jobs well four but it didnt seem necessary to count those hideous two days shed spent as assistant to her uncles motherinlaws sister it wasnt as if shed spilled ink on the white valentino gown on purpose and if the social dragon hadnt insisted that she use a fountain pen i mean really for all correspondence there wouldnt have been ink to spill but that wasnt the point she reminded herself as she stared at the pendant shed lost that job and all the others and now margaret was giving her a chance to prove she wasnt a complete moron which allena feared she probably was you need to find your place blinking allena managed to tear her gaze away from the pendant and look back into the old womans eyes they seemed so kind and wise maybe i dont have one oh there now each of us has one but there are those who dont fit so easily into the world the way others see it and us youve only been looking in the wrong places till now this she said again belongs to you i really cant afford it there was apology in her voice even as she reached out just to touch and touching she felt heat from the silver and terrible longing inside her a thrill raced up her spine even as something heavy seemed to settle over her heart it couldnt hurt to try it on surely there was no harm in just seeing how it looked on her how it felt as if in a dream she took the chain from the old woman slipped it around her neck the heaviness in her heart shifted for a moment the light through the window strengthened beamed brilliantly over the trinkets and pots of herbs and odd little stones crammed on the shelves and counters an image swam into her mind an image of knights and dragons of wild wind and water of a circle of stones standing alone under a black and raging sky then a shadow that was a man standing still as the stones as if waiting in her heart she knew he waited for her as no one had before and no one would after and would wait eternally allena closed her hand over the pendant ran her thumb over the star joy burst through her clear as the sunlight ah she thought of course its mine just as im his and hes mine how much is it she heard herself say and knew no price would be too dear ten pounds as a token ten she was already reaching for her purse it has to be worth more a kings ransom a sorcerers spell a lovers dream it is of course but the woman merely held out her hand for the single note and so are you go on your journey a chuid and see thank you youre a good lass the woman said as allena walked to the door and when it shut her smile turned bright and crafty he wont be pleased but youll bring him round by midsummers eve and if you need a bit of help well that will be my pleasure outside allena stared at the sea wall the dock the line of cottages as if coming out of a dream odd she thought hadnt that all been wonderfully odd she traced a finger over the pendant again only one cast in dagdas cauldron carved by merlin of course margaret would sneer and tell her that the old woman had a dozen more in the stockroom ready to pass them off to birdbrained tourists and margaret as always was probably right but it didnt matter she had the pendant and a wonderful story to go with it and all for ten pounds quite a bargain she glanced up now wincing the sky was heavy with clouds and all of them were thick and gray margaret would not be pleased that the weather wasnt falling in line with todays plans the ferry ride to the island had been meticulously arranged tea and scones would be served on the trip over while margaret lectured her twentyperson group on the history of the place they were about to visit it had been allenas job to type up margarets notes and print the handouts first stop would be the visitors center for orientation there would be a tour of a ruined abbey and graveyard which allena looked forward to then lunch picnic style which the hotel had provided in hampers lunch was to last precisely sixty minutes they would then visit the beehive cottages and margaret would deliver a lecture on their history and purpose the group would be allotted an hour to wander on their own into the village the shops down to the beach before gathering at fourthirty on the dot for high tea at the restored castle with naturally another lecture on that particular spot it was allenas job to keep all of margarets lecture notes in order to help herd the group to watch valuables to haul parcels should there be any and to generally make herself available for any and all menial chores for this she would be paid a reasonable salary by margarets definition but more important it was explained she would receive training and experience that her family hoped would teach her responsibility and maturity which by the age of twentyfive she should have learned already there was no point in explaining that she didnt want to be responsible and mature if it turned her into another margaret here she was four days into her first tour and already something inside her was screaming to run away dutifully she quashed the rebellion glanced at her watch stared at it dumbfounded that couldnt be it was impossible shed only meant to slip into the shop for a few minutes she couldnt possibly have spent an hour in there she couldnt oh god she couldnt have missed the ferry margaret would murder her gripping the strap of her bag she began to run she had long dancers legs and a slim build the sturdy walking shoes margaret had ordered her to buy slapped pavement on her race to the ferry dock her bag bounced heavily against her hip inside was everything ordered from the civilized adventure directive and a great deal more the wind kicked in from the sea and sent her short blond hair into alarmed spikes around her sharpboned face the alarm was in her eyes gray as the clouds as well it turned quickly to despair and selfdisgust when she reached the dock and saw the ferry chugging away damn it allena grabbed her own hair and pulled viciously thats it and thats all i might as well jump in and drown myself which would be more pleasant she had no doubt than the icy lecture margaret would deliver shed be fired of course there was no doubt of it but she was used to that little byproduct of her professional endeavors the method of termination would be torture unless there had to be another way to get to the island if she could get there throw herself on margarets stingy supply of mercy work like a dog forfeit her salary make an excuse surely shed be able to come up with some reason for missing the damn ferry she looked around frantically there were boats and if there were boats there were people who drove boats shed hire a boat pay whatever it cost are you lost then startled she lifted a hand closed it tight over her pendant there was a young man hardly more than a boy really she noted standing beside a small white boat he wore a cap over his strawcolored hair and watched her out of laughing green eyes no not lost late i was supposed to be on the ferry she gestured then let her arms fall i lost track of time well times not such a matter in the scheme of things it is to my sister i work for her quickly now she headed down toward him where the sea lapped the shore is this your boat or your fathers aye it happens its mine it was small but to her inexperienced eye looked cheerful she had to hope that made it seaworthy could you take me over i need to catch up ill pay whatever you need it was just that sort of statement allena thought the minute the words left her mouth that would make margaret cringe but then bargaining wasnt a priority at the moment survival was ill take you where you need to be his eyes sparkled as he held out a hand for ten pounds today everythings ten pounds she reached for her purse but he shook his head it was your hand i was reaching for lady not payment payment comes when you get where youre going oh thanks she put her hand in his and let him help her into the boat she sat starboard on a little bench while he cast off closing her eyes with relief she listened to the boy whistle as he went about settling to stern and starting the motor im very grateful she began my sisters going to be furious with me i dont know what i was thinking of he turned the boat a slow and smooth motion and couldnt she have waited just a bit margaret the thought made allena smile it wouldnt have occurred to her the bow lifted and the little boat picked up speed it would have occurred to you he said and then they were skimming over the water thrilled she turned her face to the wind oh this was better much better than any tame ferry ride lecture included it was almost worth the price she would pay at the end and she didnt mean the pounds do you fish she called out to him when theyre biting it must be wonderful to do what you want when you want and to live so near the water do you love it ive a fondness for it yes men put restrictions on men thats an odd thing to my way of thinking i have a terrible time with restrictions i can never remember them the boat leaped bounced hard and made her laugh at this rate well beat the ferry the idea of that the image of her standing on shore and giving margaret a smug look when the ferry docked entertained allena so much she didnt give a thought to the shiver of lightning overhead or the sudden ominous roar of the sea when the rain began to pelt her she looked around again shocked that she could see nothing but water the rise and fall of it the curtain that closed off light oh she wont like this a bit are we nearly there nearly aye nearly his voice was a kind of crooning that smoothed nerves before they could fray do you see there through the storm there just ahead is where you need to be she turned through the rain and wind she saw the darker shadow of land a rise of hills the dip of valley in shapes only but she knew she already knew its beautiful she murmured like smoke it drifted closer she could see the crash of surf now and the cliffs that hulked high above then in the flash of lightning she thought just for an instant she saw a man before she could speak the boat was rocking in the surf and the boy leaping out into the thrashing water to pull them to shore i cant thank you enough really drenched euphoric she climbed out onto the wet sand youll wait for the storm to pass wont you she asked as she dug for her wallet ill wait until its time to go youll find your way lady through the rain the paths there thanks she passed the note into his hand shed go to the visitors center take shelter find margaret and do penance if you come up with me ill buy you some tea you can dry off oh im used to the wet someones waiting for you he said then climbed back into his boat yes of course she started to run then stopped she hadnt even asked his name im sorry but when she rushed back there was nothing there but the crash of water against the shore alarmed that hed sailed back into that rising storm she called out began to hurry along what she could see of the shore to try to find him lightning flashed overhead more vicious than exciting now and the wind slapped at her like a furious hand hunching against it she jogged up the rise onto a path shed get to shelter tell someone about the boy what had she been thinking of not insisting that he come with her and wait until the weather cleared she stumbled fell jarring her bones with the impact panting to catch her breath as the world went suddenly mad around her everything was howling wind blasting lights booming thunder she struggled to her feet and pushed on it wasnt fear she felt and that baffled her she should be terrified why instead was she exhilarated where did this wicked thrill of anticipation of knowledge come from she had to keep going there was something someone waiting if she could just keep going the way was steep the rain blinding somewhere along the way she lost her bag but didnt notice in the next flash of light she saw it the circle of stones rising out of the rough ground like dancers trapped in time in her head or perhaps her heart she heard the song buried inside them with something like joy she rushed forward her hand around the pendant the song rose like a crescendo filling her washing over her like a wave and as she reached the circle took her first step inside lightning struck the center the bolt as clear and well defined as a flaming arrow she watched the blue fire rise in a tower higher higher still until it seemed to pierce the lowhanging clouds she felt the iced heat of it on her skin in her bones the power of it hammered her heart and she fainted chapter contents prev next the storm made him restless part of the tempest seemed to be inside him churning crashing waiting to strike out he couldnt work his concentration was fractured he had no desire to read to putter to simply be and all of those things were why he had come back to the island or so he told himself his family had held the land worked it guarded it for generations the oneils of dolman had planted their seed here spilled their blood and the blood of their enemies for as far back as time was marked and further still back into the murky time that was told only in songs leaving here going to dublin to study and to work had been conals rebellion his escape from what others so blithely accepted as his fate he would not as hed told his father be the passive pawn in the chess game of his own destiny he would make his destiny and yet here he was in the cottage where the oneils had lived and died where his own father had passed the last day of his life only months before telling himself it had been his choice didnt seem quite so certain on a day where the wind lashed and screamed and the same violence of nature seemed to thrash inside him the dog hugh which had been his fathers companion for the last year of his life paced from window to window ears pricked up and a low sound rumbling in his throat more whimper than growl whatever was brewing the dog sensed it as well so that his big gray bulk streamed through the cottage like blown smoke conal gave a soft command in gaelic and hugh came over bumping his big head under conals big hand there they stood watching the storm together the large gray dog and the tall broadshouldered man each with a wary expression conal felt the dog shudder nerves or anticipation something all conal could think was out there in the storm waiting the hell with it lets see what it is even as he spoke the dog leaped toward the door prancing with impatience as conal tugged a long black slicker off the peg he swirled it on over rough boots and rougher jeans and a black sweater that had seen too many washings when he opened the door the dog shot out straight into the jaws of the gale hugh cuir uait and though the dog did stop skidding in the wet he didnt bound back to conals side instead he stood ears still pricked despite the pounding rain as if to say hurry cursing under his breath conal picked up his own pace and let the dog take the lead his black hair nearly shoulderlength and heavy now with rain streamed back in the wind from a sharplyhoned face he had the high long cheekbones of the celts a narrow almost aristocratic nose and a welldefined mouth that could look as it did now hard as granite his eyes were a deep and passionate blue his mother had said they were eyes that saw too much and still looked for more now they peered through the rain and down as hugh climbed at the turbulent toss of the sea with the storm the day was almost black as night and he cursed again at his own foolishness in being out in it he lost sight of hugh around a turn on the cliff path more irritated than alarmed he called the dog again but all that answered was the lowthroated urgent bark perfect was all conal could think now the both of us will likely slip off the edge and bash our brains on the rocks he almost turned away at that point very nearly retreated for the dog was surefooted and knew his way home but he wanted to go on too much wanted to go on as if something was tugging him forward luring him on higher and higher still to where the shadow of the stone dance stood singing through the wind because part of him believed it part of him he had never been able to fully quiet he deliberately turned away he would go home build up the fire and have a glass of whiskey in front of it until the storm blew itself out then the howl came a wild and primitive call that spoke of wolves and eerie moonlight the shudder that ran down conals spine was as primal as the call grimly now he continued up the path to see what caused young hugh to bay the stones rose gleaming with wet haloed by the lightning strikes so that they almost seemed to glow a scent came to him ozone and perfume hot sweet and seductive the dog sat his handsome head thrown back his great throat rippling with his feral call there was something in it conal thought that was somehow triumphant the stones dont need guarding conal muttered he strode forward intending to grab the dog by the collar and drag them both back to the warmth of the cottage and saw that it wasnt the stones hugh guarded but the woman who lay between them half in and half out of the circle with one arm stretched toward the center she lay on her side almost as if sleeping for a moment he thought he imagined her and wanted to believe he did but when he reached her side his fingers instinctively going to her throat to check her pulse he felt the warm beat of life at his touch her lashes fluttered her eyes opened they were gray as the stones and met his with a sudden and impossible awareness a smile curved her lips parted them as she lifted a hand to his cheek there you are she said and with a sigh closed her eyes again her hand slid away from his cheek to fall onto the raintrampled grass delirious he told himself and most likely a lunatic who else would climb the cliffs in a storm ignoring the fact that hed done so himself he turned her over seeing no choice but to cart her back to the cottage and when he started to gather her into his arms he saw the pendant saw the carving on it in another spit of lightning his belly pitched his heart gave one violent knock against his chest like an angry fist damn it he stayed crouched as he was closing his eyes while the rain battered both of them she woke slowly as if floating lazily through layers of thin white clouds a feeling of wellbeing cushioned her like satin pillows edged with the softest of lace savoring it she lay still while sunlight played on her eyelids cruised warm over her face she could smell smoke a pleasant earthy scent and another fragrance a bit darker that was man she enjoyed that mix and when she opened her eyes her first thought was shed never been happier in her life it lasted seconds only that sensation of joy and safety of contentment and place then she shot up in bed confused alarmed lost margaret shed missed the ferry the boat the boy in the boat and the storm shed gotten caught in it and had lost her way she couldnt quite remember couldnt quite separate the blurry images stones higher than a man and ringed in a circle the blue fire that burned in the center without scorching the grass the wild scream of the wind the low hum of the stones a wolf howling then a man tall dark fierce with eyes as blue as that impossible fire such anger in his face but it hadnt frightened her it had amused her how strange dreams of course just dreams shed been in some sort of accident now she was in someones house someones bed a simple room she thought looking around to orient herself no not simple she corrected spartan plain white walls bare wood floor no curtains at the window there was a dresser a table and lamp and the bed as far as she could tell there was nothing else in the room but herself gingerly now she touched her head to see if there were bumps or cuts but found nothing to worry her using the same caution she turned back the sheet let out a little sigh of relief whatever sort of accident thered been it didnt appear to have hurt her then she gaped realizing she wore nothing but a shirt and it wasnt her own a mans shirt faded blue cotton frayed at the cuffs and huge okay that was okay shed been caught in the storm obviously she had gotten soaked she had to be grateful that someone had taken care of her when she climbed out of bed the shirt hung halfway to her knees modest enough at her first step the dog came to the door her heart gave a little hitch then settled so at least youre real arent you handsome she held out a hand and had the pleasure of him coming to her to rub his body against her legs and friendly good to know wheres everyone else with one hand on the dogs head she walked to the bedroom door and discovered a living area that was every bit as spartan a couch and chair a low burning fire a couple of tables with some relief she saw her clothes laid over a screen in front of the fire a check found them still damp so she hadnt been asleep unconscious for long the practical thing to do now that shed apparently done everything impractical was to find her rescuer thank him wait for her clothes to dry then track down margaret and beg for mercy the last part would be unpleasant and probably fruitless but it had to be done bolstering herself for the task allena went to the door opened it and let out a soft cry of sheer delight the watery sunlight shimmered over the hills and the hills rolled up green in one direction tumbled down in the other toward the rockstrewn shore the sea reared and crashed the walls of waves high and wonderful she had an urge to rush out to the edge of the slope and watch the water rage just outside the cottage was a garden gone wild so that flowers tangled with weeds and tumbled over themselves the smell of them of the air of the sea had her gulping in air holding her breath as if to keep that single sharp taste inside her forever unable to resist she stepped out the dog beside her and lifted her face to the sky oh this place was there ever a more perfect spot if it were hers she would stand here every morning and thank god for it beside her the dog let out one quiet woof at which she rested her hand on his head again and glanced over at the little building with its rough stone thatched roof wideopen windows she started to smile then the door of it opened the man who came out stopped as she did stared as she did then with his mourn hard set he started forward his face swam in front of her the crash of the sea filled her head with roaring dizzy she held out a hand to him much as she had to the dog she saw his mouth move thought she heard him swear but she was already pitching forward into the dark chapter contents prev next she looked like a faerie standing there in a wavery sunbeam tall and slender her bright hair cropped short her eyes longlidded tilted at the tips and enormous not a beauty her face was too sharp for true beauty and her mouth a bit topheavy but it was an intriguing face even in rest hed thought about it even after hed dumped her in bed after carrying her in from the storm undressing her had been an annoying necessity which hed handled with the aloof detachment of a doctor then once she was dry and settled hed left her without a backward glance to burn off some of the anger in work he worked very well in a temper he didnt want her here he didnt want her and he told himself he wouldnt have her no matter what the fates decreed he was his own man but now when he came out saw her standing in the doorway in the sunlight he felt the shock of it sweep through him longing possession recognition delight and despair all of those in one hard wave rose inside him swamped him before he could gain his feet she was swaying he didnt manage to catch her oh in the storybooks he imagined his feet would have grown wings and hed have flown across the yard to pluck her nimbly into his arms before she swooned but as it was she slid to the ground melted wax pooling into the cup and taking all the candle as well before hed closed half the distance by the time he reached her those long gray eyes were already opening again cloudy and dazed she stared at him the corners of her mouth trembling up i guess im not steady yet she said in that pretty american voice i know its a cliché and predictable but i have to say it where am i she looked ridiculously appealing lying there between the flowers and made him all too aware she wore nothing but one of his shirts youre on oneil land i got lost a bad habit of mine the storm came up so fast why are you here oh i got separated from the group well i was late another bad habit and missed the ferry but the boy brought me in his boat she sat up then i hope hes all right he must be as he seemed to know what he was doing and it was such a quick trip anyway is the visitors center far the visitors center i should be able to catch up with them though it wont do me a lot of good margaretll fire me and i deserve it and who is margaret my stepsister she owns a civilized adventure im working for her or i did work for her for the last twentythree days she let out a breath tried the smile again im sorry im allena kennedy the moron thank you for helping me he glanced down at the hand she held out then with some reluctance took it instead of shaking it he pulled her to her feet ive a feeling youre more lost than you know miss kennedy as theres no visitors center here on dolman island dolman but thats not right the hand in his flexed balled into a little fist of nerves im not supposed to be on dolman island oh damn it damn it its my fault i wasnt specific with the boy he seemed to know where i was going was supposed to be going or maybe he got turned around in the storm too i hope hes all right she paused looked around sighed not just fired she murmured disinherited banished and mortified all in one morning i guess all i can do is go back to the hotel and wait to face the music well it wont be today excuse me conal looked out to sea studying the crashing wall of waves you wont find your way back today and likely not tomorrow as theres more coming our way but she was talking to his back as he walked inside as though he hadnt just sealed her doom i have to get back shell be worried therell be no ferry service in these seas and no boatman with a brain in his head would chance the trip back to the mainland she sat on the arm of a chair closed her eyes well that caps it is there a phone could i use your phone to call the hotel and leave a message the phones are out of course they are she watched him go to the fire to add some bricks of turf her clothes hung on the screen like a recrimination mr oneil conal he straightened turned to her all the women i undress and put into bed call me conal it was a test deliberately provocative but she didnt flush or fire instead her eyes lit with humor all the men who undress me and put me into bed call me lena i prefer allena really so do i but it seems to be too many syllables for most people anyway conal is there a hotel or a bedandbreakfast where i can stay until the ferrys running again theres no hotel on dolman its a rare tourist who comes this far and the nearest village of which there are but three is more than eight kilometers away she gave him a level look am i staying here apparently she nodded rubbing her hand absently over hughs broad back as she took stock of her surroundings i appreciate it and ill try not to be a nuisance its a bit late for that but well deal with it when her only response was to lift her eyebrows and stare steadily he felt a tug of shame can you make a proper pot of tea yes he gestured toward the kitchen that was separated from the living area by a short counter the makings are in there ive a few things to see to then well talk this out over a cup fine the word was rigidly and properly polite only the single gunshot bang of a cupboard door as he started out again told him she was miffed shed make the damn tea she thought jerking the faucet on to fill the kettle which was no easy matter since the castiron sink was loaded with dishes and shed be grateful for conal oneils hospitality however reluctantly however rudely given was it her fault shed ended up on the wrong island was it her fault shed gotten turned around in a storm and passed out and had to be carted back to his house was it her fault she had nowhere else to go well yes she rolled her eyes and began to empty the dishes out of the sink so that she could fill it with soapy water and wash them yes technically it was her fault which just made it all the more annoying when she got back to new york she would be jobless again and once more shed be the object of pity puzzlement and pursed lips and that was her fault too her family expected her to fail now flighty scatterbrained lena worse she realized was that she expected it too the problem was she wasnt particularly good at anything she had no real skill no craft and no driving ambitions she wasnt lazy though she knew margaret would disagree work didnt frighten her business did but that was tomorrows problem she reminded herself as she dealt with the dishes and waited for the kettle to boil todays problem was conal oneil and how to handle the situation shed put them both into a situation she thought as she went about stacking dishes wiping counters heating the teapot that should have been thrilling a stormswept island a handsome brooding man a cozy if rustic cottage isolated from the world this she decided perking up was an adventure she was going to find a way to enjoy it before the axe fell when conal came back in the old teapot was sitting snugly in a frayed and faded cozy cups and saucers were set on the table and the table scrubbed clean the sink was empty the counters sparkling and the chocolate biscuits hed had in a tin were arranged prettily on a plate i was hungry she was already nibbling on one i hope you dont mind no hed nearly forgotten what it was like to sit down and have tea in tidiness her little temper snap appeared to be over as well he noted she looked quietly at home in his kitchen in his shirt so she sat down to pour the one thing she was good at was conversation shed often been told she was too good at it you live here alone i do with your dog hugh he was my fathers my father died some months back she didnt say she was sorry as so many too many would have but her eyes said it and that made it matter more its a beautiful spot a perfect spot thats what i was thinking before i fell into your garden you grew up here i did i grew up in new york in the city it never fit somehow she studied him over her teacup this fits you its wonderful to find the right fit everyone in my family fits except me my parents and margaret and james my brother and sister their mother died when margaret was twelve and james ten their father met my mother a couple of years later then they married and had me and youre cinderella no nothing as romantic as that but she sighed and thought how lovely it would be just the misfit theyre all brilliant you see every one of them my fathers a doctor a surgeon my mothers a lawyer james is a wildly successful cosmetic surgeon and margaret has her own business with a civilized adventure who would want an adventure civilized yes delighted allena slapped a palm on the table thats exactly what i thought i mean wouldnt regimenting it mean it wasnt an adventure at all but saying that to margaret earned me a twentyminute lecture and since her business is thriving there you go the light was already shifting he noted as a new sea of clouds washed in but there was enough of the sun yet to sprinkle over her hair into her eyes and make his fingers itch for a pencil he knew just what he would do with her exactly how it would be planning it he let his gaze wander over her and nearly jolted when he saw the pendant hed all but forgotten it where did you get that shed seen those vivid blue eyes travel down had felt a shiver of response and now another of relief that she hoped it was the pendant that interested him this its the heart of my problem shed meant it as a joke but his gaze returned to her face all but seared the flesh with the heat of it where did you get it though the edge to his voice puzzled her she shrugged there was a little shop near the waterfront the display window was just crammed with things wonderful things magic magic elves and dragons books and jewelry in lovely fascinating shapes a hodgepodge but a crafty one irresistible i only meant to go in for a minute i had time before we were to meet at the ferry but the old woman showed me this and somehow while we were talking time just went away i didnt mean to buy it either but i do a lot of things i dont mean to do you dont know what it is no she closed her hand over it felt that low vibration that couldnt be there blinked as something tried to slide in on the edge of her vision it feels old but it cant be old not valuably old because it only cost ten pounds values different for one than for another he reached out it was irresistible with his eyes steady and level he closed his hand over hers that held the pendant the jolt snapped into her sharp as an electric current the air seemed to turn the blue of lightning she was on her feet her head tipping back to keep her eyes locked with his as he shoved back from the table with enough violence to send his chair crashing that same violence was in him when his mouth crushed hers the need so bright so strong so right whipped through her even as the wind rushed sudden and sharp through the window at her back her hand fisted in his hair her body lifted itself to his and fit the pounding of her heart was like a song each note a thrill here with him it was enough even if the world crumbled to dust around them he couldnt stop the taste of her was like water cool and clean after a lifetime of thirst empty pockets he hadnt known he carried inside him filled bulged overflowed his blood was a rage of heat his body weak with wanting he gathered the back of the shirt in his bunched fingers prepared to rip then they dropped the pendant they held between them to reach for each other and he snapped back as if from a blow this is not what i want he took her shoulders intending to shake her but only held her she looked dazed faeriestruck this is not what ill accept would you let me go her voice was low but it didnt quaver when he did and stepped back she let out a short quiet breath there was no point in being a coward she told herself i have a couple of choices here she began one is i hit my head when i fell and i have a concussion the other is that i just fell in love with you i think i prefer the concussion theory and i imagine you do too you didnt hit your head he jammed his hands in his pockets and strode away from her the room was suddenly too small and people dont fall in love in an instant over one kiss sensible ones dont im not sensible ask anyone but if there was ever a time to try to be it was now i think i should get dressed take a walk clear my head or whatever anothers storms brewing allena tugged her clothes off the screen youre telling me she muttered and marched into the bedroom chapter contents prev next conal wasnt in the cottage when she came out again but hugh sat by the fire as if waiting for her he got up as she came through and pranced to the door turning his big head so that his eyes met hers want a walk me too it was a pity about the gardens allena thought as she paused between them shed have enjoyed getting down into them yanking out those choking weeds pinching off deadheads an hours pleasant work she thought maybe two and instead of looking wild and neglected those tumbling blossoms would just look wild which is what was needed here not her job she told herself not her home not her place she cast an eye at the little outbuilding he was probably in there doing whatever the hell he did and doing it she imagined angrily why was there so much anger in him not her problem she thought not her business not her man though for a moment when their hands and mouths were joined he had seemed to be i dont want this i dont want you hed made himself very clear and she was tired of finding herself plopped down where she wasnt wanted the wind raced in off the sea driving thick blackedged clouds toward the island as she began to walk she could see the pale and hopeful blue being gradually inevitably consumed conal was right a storm was coming walking along the shoreline couldnt do any harm she wouldnt climb the hills though she longed to she would just stick to the long curve of surf and sand and enjoy the jittery thrill of watching the fierce waves crash hugh seemed content to walk at her side almost she thought like a guard eight kilometers to the nearest village she remembered that wasnt so very far she could wait for the weather to clear then walk it if conal wouldnt drive her thered been a truck parked between the cottage and the outbuilding a sleek and modern thing anachronistic but surely serviceable why had he kissed her like that no that wasnt right it hadnt been his doing it had simply happened to both of them for both of them thered been a roar in her head in her blood that shed never experienced before more than passion she thought now more than lust it was a kind of desperate recognition there you are finally at last that of course was ridiculous but she had no other way to explain what had spurted to life inside her and what had spread from that first hot gush felt like love you couldnt love what you didnt know you couldnt love where there was no understanding no foundation no history her head told her all these sensible rational things and her heart laughed at them it didnt matter she could be conflicted puzzled annoyed even willing to accept but it didnt matter when he didnt want her or what had flamed to life between them she stopped let the wind beat its frantic wings over her let the spray from the waves fly on her overhead a gull white as the moon let out its triumphant scream and streamed off in the current of electric air oh she envied that freedom for the heart of flight was inside her to simply fly away wherever the wind took her and to know that when she landed it would be her place her time her triumph but you have to live in the present dont you lena her mothers patient and puzzled voice murmured in her ear you have to apply yourself to pay attention you cant keep drifting this way and make something of yourself its time you focused on a career put your considerable energy into making your mark and under that voice unsaid was you disappoint me i know it im sorry its awful i wish i could tell you how awful it is to know im your only failure she would do better allena promised herself shed talk margaret into giving her a second chance somehow then shed work harder pay more attention be responsible be practical be miserable the dog bumped his head against her leg rubbed his warm fur against her the small gesture comforted her and turning away from the water she continued to walk along its verge shed come out to clear her head she reminded herself not to fill it with more problems surely there couldnt be a more perfect spot for easing heart and mind under those threatening skies the rough hills shone the wicked cliffs gleamed wildflowers dots and splashes of color tangled in the green and gray and she saw a shadowy spread of purple that was heather she wanted to gather it fill her arms with it bury her face in the scent delighted with the idea she turned to scramble over rocks where sprigs of it thrived in the thin soil then higher to mounds bumpy and thick until the fragrance of it overpowered even the primitive perfume of the sea when her arms were full she wanted more laughing she hurried along a narrow path then stopped dead startled she shook her head she heard the oddest hum she started to step forward again and couldnt simply couldnt it was as if a wall of glass stood between her and the next slope of rock and flowers my god what is this she lifted a trembling hand sending sprigs of heather falling then flying free in the wind she felt no barrier but only a kind of heat when her hand pressed the air and try as she might she couldnt push through it lightning burst thunder rolled through it she heard the sound of her name she looked down to the beach half expecting to see dragons or sorcerers but it was only conal standing with his legs spread his hair flying and his eyes annoyed come down from there youve no business clambering up the rocks when a storms breaking what a picture she made hed come after her out of responsibility he liked to think but hed been dumbstruck when hed seen her walking the cliff path in the eerie light her hair fluttering her arms overflowing with flowers it made him want to climb after her to whirl her and her flowers into his arms to press his mouth to hers again while the wind whipped savagely over them because he wanted it could all but taste her his tone was bladesharp when she met him on the beach have you no more sense than to pick flowers in such weather apparently not would you walk down there what just humor me and walk down the beach five more feet maybe you did rattle your brains he started to grab her hand pull her away but she took a nimble step aside please itll only take you a minute he hissed out an oath then strode off one foot two three his abrupt halt had allena closing her eyes shivering once you cant do it can you you cant go any farther than that neither could i she opened her eyes again met his furious ones when he turned what does it mean it means we deal with it well go back ive no desire to find myself drenched to the skin a second time in one day he said nothing on the way back and she let him have his silence the first fat drops of rain splattered as they reached the cottage door do you have anything to put these in she asked him theyll need water and id like to keep my hands busy while you explain things to me he shrugged made a vague gesture toward the kitchen then went to add more turf to the fire it was a downpour the wind rose to a howl and she began to gather vases and bottles and bowls when he remained silent scowling into the fire she heated up the tea he glanced over when she poured the cups then went into the kitchen himself to take out a bottle of whiskey a healthy dollop went into his own tea then he lifted a brow holding the bottle over hers well why not but when it was laced she picked up the flowers instead of the cup and began to tuck them into vases what is this place who are you ive told you that already you gave me names the homey task calmed her as shed known it would when her gaze lifted to his again it was direct and patient thats not what i meant he studied her then nodded whether she could handle it or not she deserved to know do you know how far out in the sea you are a mile two more than ten ten but it couldnt have taken more than twenty minutes to get here and in rough weather more than ten miles out is dolman island from the southwest coast of ireland here we straddle the atlantic and celtic seas some say the silkies come here to shed their hides and sun on the rocks in human form and the faeries come out of their rafts under the hills to dance in the moonlight allena slipped the stems of shorter blossoms into a squat bottle do you say it some say he continued without answering that my greatgrandmother left her raft her palace under the hill and pledged herself to my greatgrandfather on the night of the summer solstice while they stood by the king stone of the dance on the cliffs one hundred years ago as a hundred years before another with my blood stood with his woman in that same place to pledge and a century before that as well and always on that same night in that same place when the star shows itself she touched her pendant this star they say and in two days its the solstice and your turn if i believed my greatgrandmother was other than a simple woman that i have elfin blood in my veins and could be directed to pledge to a woman because of the way a star shines through the stones i wouldnt be in this place i see she nodded and carried one of the vases into the living room to set it on a table so youre here to prove that everything youve just told me is nonsense can you believe otherwise she had no idea what she believed but had a feeling there was a great deal a very great deal that she could believe why couldnt i walk away from here conal why couldnt you she left the question hanging walked back into the kitchen she took a sip of her tea felt the hot flow of whiskey slide into her then began to select her other arrangements and put them where she liked it would be hard for you being told this story since you were a child being expected to accept it can you accept it he demanded can you just shrug off education and reason and accept that youre to belong to me because a legend says so i wouldve said no pleasing herself she set bottles of heather on the narrow stone mantel over the simmering fire i would have been intrigued amused maybe a little thrilled at the idea of it all then i would have laughed it off i would have she said as she turned to face him until i kissed you and felt what i felt inside me and inside you desires an easy thing thats right and if that had been it if that had been all wed both have acted on it if that had been all you wouldnt be angry now with yourself and with me youre awfully bloody calm about it i know she smiled then couldnt help herself isnt that odd but then im odd everyone says so lena the duck out of water the square peg the fumbler always just off center but i dont feel odd or out of place here so its easier for me to be calm nor did she look out of place he thought wandering through the cottage placing her flowers i dont believe in magic and ive looked for it all my life she took a sprig of heather held it out to him so ill make you a promise you dont owe me promises you dont owe me anything its free i wont hold you with legends or magic when i can leave if thats what you want ill go why im in love with you and love doesnt cling humbled he took the heather slipped it into her hair allena it takes clear eyes to recognize whats in the heart so easily i dont have them ill hurt you he skimmed his fingers down her cheek and i find id rather not im fairly sturdy ive never been in love before conal and i might be terrible at it but right now it suits me and thats enough he refused to believe anything could be so simple im drawn to you i want my hands on you i want you under me if thats all it might not be enough for you or for me in the end so its best to stand back he walked to the peg tugged down his slicker i need to work he said and went out into the rain it would be more than shed had she realized and knew that if necessary she could make it enough the storm was only a grumble when he came back evening was falling soft and misty the first thing he noticed when he stepped inside was the scent something hot and rich that reminded his stomach it was empty then he noticed the little changes in the living room just a few subtle touches a table shifted cushions smoothed he wouldnt have noticed the dust but he noticed the absence of it and the faint tang of polish shed kept the fire going and the light mixed with that of the candles shed found and set about was welcoming shed put music on as well and was humming along to it as she worked in the kitchen even as he hung up his slicker the tension hed carried through his work simply slid off his shoulders i made some soup she called out i hunted up some herbs from the kitchen bed foraged around in here you didnt have a lot to work with so its pretty basic it smells fine im grateful well we have to eat dont we you wouldnt say that so easy if id been the one doing the cooking shed already set the table making the mismatched plates and bowls look cheerful and clever instead of careless there were candles there too and one of the bottles of wine hed brought from dublin stood breathing on the counter she was making biscuits allena you neednt have gone to such trouble oh i like puttering around cookings kind of a hobby she poured him wine actually i took lessons i took a lot of lessons this time i thought maybe id be a chef or open my own restaurant and theres a lot more to running a restaurant than cooking im horrible at business as for the chef idea i realized you had to cook pretty much the same things night after night and on demand to suit the menu you know so it turned into one of my many hobbies she slipped the biscuits into the oven but at least this one has a practical purpose so she dusted her hands on the dishcloth shed tucked into her waistband i hope youre hungry he flashed a grin that made her heart leap im next to starving good she set out the dish of cheese and olives shed put together then you wont be critical where he would have ladled the soup straight from the kettle she poured it into a thick white bowl already shed hunted out the glass dish his mother had used for butter and that he hadnt seen for years the biscuits went in a basket lined with a cloth of blue and white checks when she started to serve the soup he laid a hand over hers ill do it sit the scents alone were enough to make him weep in gratitude the first taste of herbed broth thick with hunks of vegetables made him close his eyes in pleasure when he opened them again she was watching him with amused delight i like your hobby he told her i hope youll feel free to indulge yourself with it as long as youre here she selected a biscuit studied it it was so gratifying to see him smile thats very generous of you ive been living on my own poor skills for some months now his eyes met hers held you make me realize what ive missed im a moody man allena really her voice was so mild the insult nearly slipped by him but he was quick he laughed shook his head and spooned up more soup it wont be a quiet couple of days im thinking chapter contents prev next he slept in his studio it seemed the wisest course he wanted her and that was a problem he had no doubt she would have shared the bed with him shared herself with him as much as he would have preferred that to the chilly and narrow cot crammed into his work space it didnt seem fair to take advantage of her romantic notions she fancied herself in love with him it was baffling really to think that a woman could make such a decision state it right out in a fingersnap of time but then allena kennedy wasnt like any of the other women whod passed in and out of his life a complicated package she was he thought it would have been easy to dismiss her as a simple almost foolish sort at a first and casual glance but conal wasnt one for casual glances there were layers to her thoughtful bubbling passionate and compassionate layers odd wasnt it he mused that she didnt seem to recognize them in herself that lack of awareness added one more layer and that was sweetness absently with his eyes still gritty from a restless night he began to sketch allena kennedy from new york city the square peg in what appeared to be a family of conformists the woman who had yet to find herself yet seemed perfectly content to deal with where shed landed a modern woman certainly but one who still accepted tales of magic no more than accepted he thought now she embraced them as if shed just been waiting to be told where it was shed been going all along that he wouldnt do refused to do all his life hed been told this day would come he wouldnt passively fall in give up his own will he had come back to this place at this time to prove it and he could almost hear the fates giggling scowling he studied what hed drawn it was allena with her long eyes and sharp bones the short and shaggy hair that suited that angular face and slender neck and at her back hed sketched in the hint of faerie wings they suited her as well it annoyed the hell out of him conal tossed the pad aside he had work to do and hed get to it as soon as hed had some tea the wind was still up the morning sun was slipping through the stacked clouds to dance over the water the only thunder now was the crash and boom of waves on the shore he loved the look of it that changing and capricious sea his years in dublin hadnt been able to feed this single need in him for the water and the sky and the rough and simple land that was his however often he left wherever he went he would always be drawn back for here was heart and soul turning away from the sea he saw her she knelt in the garden flowers rioting around her and the quiet morning sun shimmering over her hair her face was turned away from him but he could see it in his mind she would have that halfdreaming contented look in her eyes as she tugged away the weeds hed ignored already the flowers looked cheerful as if pleased with the attention after weeks of neglect there was smoke pluming from the chimney a broom propped against the front wall shed dug a basket out of god knew where and in this she tossed the weeds her feet were bare warmth slid into him before he could stop it and murmured welcome in his ear you dont have to do that she looked up at his voice and she was indeed happy they needed it besides i love flowers i have pots of them all over my apartment but this is so much better ive never seen snapdragons so big she traced a finger on a spike of butteryellow blooms they always make me think of alice alice in wonderland ive already made tea she got to her feet then winced at the dirt on the knees of her trousers i guess i shouldve been more careful its not like i have a vast wardrobe to choose from at the moment so how do you like your eggs he started to tell her she wasnt obliged to cook his breakfast but he remembered just how fine the soup had been the night before scrambled would be nice if its no trouble none and its the least i can do for kicking you out of your own bed she stepped up to the door then turned her eyes were eloquent and patient you could have stayed i know it she held his gaze another moment then nodded you had some bacon in your freezer i took it out last night to thaw oh and your shower dripped it just needed a new washer he paused at the doorway remembered as he hadnt in years to wipe his feet you fixed the shower well it dripped she was already walking into the kitchen you probably want to clean up ill get breakfast started he scratched the back of his neck im grateful she slanted him a look so am i when he went into the bedroom she did a quick dance hugged herself oh she loved this place it was a storybook and she was right in the middle of it shed awakened that morning half believing it had all been a dream but then shed opened her eyes to that misty early light had smelled the faint drift of smoke from the dying fire the tang of heather shed put beside the bed it was a dream the most wonderful the most real dream shed ever had and she was going to keep it he didnt want it didnt want her but that could change there were two days yet to open his heart how could his stay closed when hers was so full love was nothing like shed expected it to be it was so much more brilliant she needed the hope the faith that on one of the days left to her he would wake up and feel what she did love she discovered was so huge it filled every space inside with brightness there was no room for shadows for doubts she was in love with the man with the place with the promise it wasnt just in the rush of an instant though there was that thrill as well but twined with it was a lovely settled comfort an ease of being of knowing and that was something she wanted for him for once in her life she vowed she wouldnt fail she would not lose closing her eyes she touched the star that hung between her breasts ill make it happen she whispered then with a happy sigh she started breakfast he didnt know what to make of it he couldnt have said just what state the bathroom had been in before but he was dead certain it hadnt sparkled there may or may not have been fresh towels out the last time hed seen it but he thought not there hadnt been a bottle of flowers on the windowsill the shower had dripped that he remembered hed meant to get to that he could be certain that it was a great deal more pleasant to shower and shave in a room where the porcelain gleamed and the air smelled faintly of lemon and flowers because of it he guiltily wiped up after himself and hung the towel to dry instead of tossing it on the floor the bedroom showed her touch as well the bed was tidily made the pillows fluffed up shed opened the windows wide to bring in the sun and the breeze it made him realize hed lived entirely too long with dust and dark then he stepped out she was singing in the kitchen a pretty voice and the scents that wafted to him were those of childhood bread toasting bacon frying there was a rumble he recognized as the washer spinning a load he could only shake his head how long have you been up and about he asked her i woke up at dawn she turned to pass him a mug of tea over the counter it was so gorgeous i couldnt get back to sleep ive been piddling youve a rare knack for piddling my father calls it nervous energy oh i let hugh out he bolted to the door the minute my feet hit the floor so i figured that was the routine he likes to run around in the mornings dog piddling i suppose it made her laugh as she scooped his eggs from skillet to plate hes terrific company i felt very safe and snug with him curled up at the foot of the bed last night hes deserted me for a pretty face he sat then caught her hand wheres yours i had something earlier ill let you eat in peace my father hates to be chattered at over breakfast ill just hang out the wash im not your father would you sit please he waited until she took a seat and for the first time noticed nerves in the way she linked her fingers together now what was that about allena do you think i expect you to cater to me this way cook and serve and tidy no of course not the lift had gone out of her voice out of her eyes ive overstepped im always doing that i didnt think thats not what i meant not at all his eyes were keen part of his gift and they saw how her shoulders had braced her body tensed what are you doing waiting for the lecture with a shake of his head he began to eat theyve done what they could havent they to stifle you why is it people are always so desperate to mold another into their vision their way im saying only that youre not obliged to cook my meals and scrub my bath while youre here you should do what pleases you i guess i have been fine you wont hear any complaints from me i dont know what youve done with these humble eggs unless its magic she relaxed again thyme and dill from your very neglected herb bed if i had a house id plant herbs and gardens imagining it she propped her chin on her fist id have steppingstones wandering through it with a little bench so you could just stop and sit and look it would be best if it was near the water so i could hear the beat of it the way i did last night pounding like a quickened heart she blinked out of the image found him staring at her what oh i was running on again she started to get up but he took her hand a second time come with me he got to his feet pulled her to hers the dishes can wait this cant hed already started it that morning with the sketch in his head it was all but finished and the energy of it was driving him so he strode quickly out of the house toward his studio she had to run to keep up conal slow down im not going anywhere ignoring her he shoved open the door pulled her in after him stand by the window but she was already moving in eyes wide and delighted youre an artist this is wonderful you sculpt the single room was nearly as big as the main area of the cottage and much more cramped a worktable stood in the center crowded with tools and hunks of stone pots of clay a half dozen sketch pads were tossed around shelves and smaller tables were jammed with examples of his work mystical magical creatures that danced and flew a blue mermaid combed her hair on a rock a white dragon breathed fire faeries no bigger than her thumb ringed in a circle with faces sly a sorcerer nearly as tall as she held his arms high and wept theyre all so alive so vivid she couldnt help herself she had to touch and so she ran her finger down the rippling hair of the mermaid ive seen this before she murmured not quite this but the same feeling of it but in bronze at a gallery in new york she looked over then where he was impatiently flipping through a sketch pad ive seen your work in new york you must be famous his answer was a grunt i wanted to buy it the mermaid i was with my mother and i couldnt because shed have reminded me i couldnt afford the price i went back the next day because i couldnt stop thinking about it but it was already sold in front of the window turn to me that was two years ago and ive thought about her a dozen times since isnt it amazing that she was yours muttering an oath he strode to her pulled her to the window lift your head like that hold it there and be quiet are you going to draw me no im after building a boat here of course im drawing you now be quiet for one bloody minute she shut her mouth but couldnt do anything about the grin that trembled on her lips and that he thought was precisely what he wanted just that trace of humor of energy of personal delight he would do a clay model he thought and cast her in bronze something that gleamed gold and warmed to the touch she wasnt for stone or wood he did three quick studies of her face moving around her for a change of angle then he lowered his pad i need the line of your body your shape take off your clothes excuse me i have to see how youre made the clothes are in the way of you you want me to pose nude with an effort he brought himself back from his plans met her eyes if this was a matter of sex i wouldnt have slept on that rock in the corner last night youve my word i wont touch you but i have to see you if this was a matter of sex i wouldnt be so nervous okay she shut her eyes a minute bolstered her courage im like a bowl of fruit she told herself and unbuttoned her shirt when she slipped it off folded it set it aside conal lifted a brow no youre like a woman if i wanted a bowl of fruit id get one chapter contents prev next she was slim leaning toward angular and exactly right eyes narrowed mind focused he flipped up a fresh page and began no keep your head up he ordered faintly irritated that she should be so exactly right hold your arms back just a bit more palms down and flat no youre not a flaming penguin spread your fingers a little ah it was then he noticed the faint flush spreading over her skin the stiffness in her movements moron he told himself and bit back a sigh of course she was nervous and embarrassed and hed done nothing to put her at ease hed grown too used he supposed to professional models who undraped without a thought she liked to talk so he would let her talk tell me about these lessons of yours what the lessons you said youd taken a number of lessons on this and that what was it you studied she pressed her lips together fought back the foolish urge to cross her arms over her breasts i thought you said i wasnt supposed to talk now im saying you can she heard the exasperation rolled her eyes what was she a mind reader i ah took art lessons did you now turn to the right just a bit and what did you learn from them that im not an artist she smiled a little im told i have a good eye for color and shapes and aesthetics but no great skill with the execution yes it was better when she talked her face became mobile again alive again that discouraged you not really i draw now and then when im in the mood another hobby oh im loaded with them like music i took music lessons ah she was relaxing the doeinthecrosshairs look was fading from her eyes whats your instrument the flute im reasonably adept but im never going to have a chair with the philharmonic she shrugged and he bit back a sharp order for her not to change the line i took a course in computer programming and that was a complete wash as most of my business courses were which scuttled the idea i had of opening a little craft shop i could handle the craft part but not the shop part her gaze was drawn back to the mermaid she coveted that not just the piece itself but the talent and vision that had created it stand on your toes thats it thats lovely hold a minute why dont you take on a partner for what the shop if its what you want someone businessminded mostly because i have enough business sense to know i could never afford the rent in new york the startup costs she moved a shoulder overhead equipment stock i guess running a business is a study in stress margaret always says so ah he thought the inestimable margaret whom hed already decided to detest what do you care what she says no thats not right its not quite right turn around you have a beautiful back i do surprise had her turning her head to look at him there hold that lower your chin a little more to your shoulder keep your eyes on me that was what he wanted no shyness here coyness was something different altogether there was a hint of that in the upward angle of her gaze the tilt of her head and just a bit of smugness as well in the slight curve of her lips allena of the faeries he thought already eager to begin in clay he ripped the sheets off the pad began tacking them to the wall ill do better with you as well as the sketches relax a minute while i prep the clay as he passed he touched a hand absently to her shoulder he stopped christ youre cold why didnt you say something she was turning toward him a slow shift of her body i didnt notice i didnt think to keep the fire going his hand skimmed over her shoulder fingers tracing the blade where he imagined wings ill build one now even as he spoke he was leaning toward her his eyes locked on hers her lips parted and he could feel the flutter of her breath he jerked back like a man snapping out of a dream lifted his hand then held them both up away from her i said i wouldnt touch you im sorry the rising wave of anticipation in her broke then vanished as he walked away to yank a blanket from the cot i wish you werent sorry i mean he stood with the table between them the blanket in his hands and felt like a man drowning there was no shyness in her now nor coyness but the patience was there and the promise i dont want this need for you do you understand you want me to say yes she was laid bare now she realized much more than her body laid bare it would make it easier if i said that i understand but i cant i dont i want that need conal and you another place another time he murmured thered be no need to understand another place another time id want it as well this is here she said quietly and this is now its still your choice he wanted to be sure of it wanted to know there was nothing but her will you take that off she lifted a hand to the pendant her last shield saying nothing she slipped the chain over her head then walked to the table set it down do you think ill feel differently without it theres no magic between us now were only who and what we are he stepped to her swept the blanket around her shoulders its as much your choice as mine allena youve a right to say no then she laid her hands on his shoulders brought her lips to within a breath of his ive also a right to say yes it was she who closed that tenuous distance so mouths and bodies met and she who let the blanket drop when her arms went around him she gave completely utterly all the love so newly discovered in her heart poured out for him her lips seduced her hands soothed her body yielded there was a choice she had made hers but he still had his own to draw back step away and refuse or to gather close and take before his blood could take over before it was all need and heat he took her face in his hands until their eyes met again with no promises allena he suffered she could see the clouds and worry in his eyes and said what she hoped would comfort and be the truth as well and no regrets his thumbs skimmed over her cheeks tracing the shape of her face as skillfully as hed drawn it on paper be with me then the cot was hard and narrow but might have been a bed of rose petals as they lay on it the air was chill still damp from the storm but she felt only warmth when his body covered hers here at last he knew his hands were big the palms rough and calloused from his work and very often careless he would not be careless with her would not rush through the moment they offered each other so he touched her gently giving himself the pleasure of the body hed sketched long limbs long bones and soft white skin her sigh was like music the song his name she tugged off his sweater sighing again when flesh met flesh and again murmuring his name against the pulse of his own throat with only that she gave him the sweetness hed denied himself whatever he had of that simple gift inside him he offered back under him she lifted and moved as if theyd danced this dance together for a lifetime flowed with and against him now fluid now strong and the quickening pulse that rose in her was like his own her scent was soap her taste fresh as rain he watched her glide up the faerie again soaring on one long spread of wings as she crested her eyes opened met his and she smiled no one had brought her so much or shown her how much she had to offer her body quivered from the thrill of it and in her heart was the boundless joy of finding home she arched up opened so he would fill her as he slid inside her the beauty dazzled and the power hummed while they took each other neither noticed the star carved in silver glowing blue as flame she lay over him now snug under his arm with her cheek upon his chest it was lovely to hear how his heart still pounded a kind of rage she thought though hed been the most tender of lovers no one could have shown her that kind of caring if there wasnt caring inside and that she thought closing her eyes was enough youre cold he murmured am not she snuggled against him and would have frozen to the bone before she let him move but she lifted her head so she could grin at him allena kennedy his fingers trailed lightly down the back of her neck you look smug i feel smug do you mind i would be a foolish man to mind she bent down to kiss his chin a sweet and casual gesture that moved him and conal oneil is not a foolish man or is he she angled her head if we cant go beyond a certain point and walk to the village wouldnt it follow that no one from the village can come here i suppose it would then lets do something foolish lets go swim naked in the sea you want to swim naked in the sea ive always wanted to i just realized it this minute she rolled off the cot and tugged at his hand come be foolish with me conal leannan the first wavell flatten you will not leannan she had no idea what it meant but it sounded tender and made her want to dance she raked both hands through her hair then the light of challenge lighted her eyes race you she darted off like a rabbit and had him scrambling up wait damn it the seas are too rough for you bird bones he thought snatching up the blanket on his way she would crack half a dozen of them in minutes no she didnt run like a rabbit he realized she ran like a bloody gazelle with long loping strides that had her nearly at the foaming surf he called out her name rushing after her his heart simply stopped when she raced into the water and dived under its towering wall sweet jesus hed gotten no farther than the beach when she surfaced laughing oh its cold she struggled to the shallows slicking her hair back lifted her face her arms for the second time his heart stopped but now it had nothing to do with alarm youre a vision allena no ones ever said that to me before she held out a hand no ones ever looked at me the way you do ride the sea with me it had been he decided much too long since hed been foolish hold on then it tossed them up a rush of power it sucked them down into a blind thundering world the tumult of it was freedom a cocky dare to fate wrapped around each other they spun as the waves rolled over them breathless they surfaced only to plunge in again her scream wasnt one of fear but a cry of victory as latched around him she was swept into the air again youll drown us both he shouted but his eyes were lit with wicked humor i wont i cant nothing but wonders today once more she locked her arms around his neck lets go under just once more to her shrieking delight he snatched her off her feet and dived into the cresting wave with her when they stumbled out panting their hands were linked your teeth are chattering i know i loved it but she snuggled into the blanket he wrapped around them both ive never done anything like that i guess youve done it dozens of times not with the likes of you it was she thought the perfect thing to say she held the words to her for a moment even as she held him hard against her heart what does leannan mean hmm her head was on his shoulder her arms linked around his waist everything inside him was completely at peace leannan you said that to me i wondered what it means his hand paused in midstroke on her hair its a casual term he said carefully a bit of an endearment is all sweetheart would be the closest i like it he closed his eyes allena you ask for too little and hope for everything she thought you shouldnt worry conal im not now before we both turn blue out here ill make fresh tea and youll build up the fire she kissed him right after i pick up some of these shells she wiggled away leaving him holding the blanket and shaking his head most of the shells that littered the beach had been broken by the waves but that didnt appear to bother her he left her to it and went into the studio to tug on his jeans she had a pile of shells when he came back offering her his sweater and her pendant i wont wear it if it bothers you its yours deliberately as if challenging the fates he slipped it around her neck here put this on before you freeze she bundled into it then crouched to put the shells into the blanket i love you conal whether im wearing it or not and since loving you makes me happy it shouldnt worry you she rose dont spoil it she murmured lets just take today then see about tomorrow all right he took her hand brought it to his lips ill give you a promise after all ill take it today will always be precious to me and so will you chapter contents prev next she dug out an ancient pair of conals jeans found a hunk of frayed rope and went to work with scissors as a fashion statement the chopped jeans rough belt and baggy sweater said island shipwreck but they did the job as he insisted on making the tea this time around she busied herself hanging the wash and dreaming it could be just this way she thought long wonderful days together conal would work in his studio and shed tend the house the gardens and oh the children when they came along she would paint the shutters and the little back porch shed put an arbor in front plant roses the only roses she would have so that theyd climb up and twine and ramble and it would be like walking through a fairy tale every time she went into the house and it would be her fairy tale ever after they would need to add rooms of course for those children a second floor she imagined with dormer windows another bath a bigger kitchen but nothing that would take away from the lovely cottagebythesea feeling shed make wonderful meals keep the windows sparkling sew curtains that would flutter in the breeze she stopped pegging a sheet that flapped wetly her mother would be appalled household chores were something you hired other people to do because you had a career you were a professional something of course it was all just fantasy she told herself as she moved down the clothesline she had to make a living somehow but shed worry about that later for now she was going to enjoy the moment the thrilling rush of being in love the jittery ache of waiting to be loved in return they would have today and their tomorrow whatever happened after shed have no regrets with the last of the laundry hung she stepped back lifted the basket to rest it on her hip she saw hugh prancing down the hill well so you decided to come home what have you got there her eyes widened as she recognized the brown bulk he carried in his mouth my bag she dropped the basket and rushed to him and hugh sensing a game began to race in circles around her conal watched from the doorway the tea was steeping in the pot and hed been about to call to her now he simply stood sheets billowed like sails in the wind he caught the clean wet scent of them and the drift of rosemary and lemon balm from the herb bed shed weeded that morning her laughter lifted up bright and delighted as she raced with the dog his tattered old jeans hung on her though shed hacked them off to above her ankles shed rolled up the cuffs pushed up the sleeves on his sweater but now as she ran around with hugh theyd come down again and fell over her hands she hadnt put on her shoes she was a joy to watch and when he wondered had he stopped letting joy into his life the shadow of his fate had grown longer with each passing year hed huddled under it he thought now telling himself he was standing clear he had let no one touch him let nothing be important to him but his work he had estranged himself from his father and his home those had been his choices and his right now watching allena play tugofwar with the big dog in a yard filled with sun and sailing white sheets he wondered for the first time what hed missed along the way and still whatever hed missed she was here the pendant was here the solstice was closing in he could refuse it he could deny it however much this woman called to his blood he would at the end of that longest day determine his own fate it would not be magic that forced his destiny but his own will he saw allena yank hugh release she stumbled back clutching something to her chest then landed hard on her back conal was out the door and across the yard in a single skipping heartbeat are you hurt he issued one sharp order to the dog in gaelic that had hugh hanging his head of course not she started to sit up but conal was already gathering her stroking murmuring something in gaelic that sounded lovely loving her heart did one long slow cartwheel conal the damn dog probably outweighs you and youve bones like a bird we were just playing there now youve hurt hughs feelings come here baby its okay while conal sat back on his heels and scowled she hugged and cuddled the dog its all right he didnt mean it whatever it was did you conal conal caught the sidelong glance the dog sent him and had to call it smug i did she only laughed and kissed hughs nose such a smart dog such a good dog she crooned he found my bag and brought it home i on the other hand am a moron i forgot all about it conal studied the oversized purse it was wet filthy and now riddled with teeth marks that didnt seem to bother her a bit its taken a beating i mustve dropped it in the storm everythings in here my passport my credit cards my ticket my makeup she hugged the bag thrilled to have her lipstick back oh and dozens of things including my copy of margarets itinerary do you think the phones working now without waiting for him to answer she leaped up i can call her hotel let her know im all right she must be frantic she dashed into the house clutching the bag and conal stayed as he was he didnt want the phones to be working he didnt want that to break their bubble realizing it left him shaken here he thought at the first chance to reach out of their world shed run to do it of course she had he pressed his fingers to his eyes wouldnt he have done the same she had a life beyond this beyond him the romance of it had swept her away for a while just as it had nearly swept him she would get her feet back under her and move on that was as it should be and what he wanted but when he rose to go after her there was an ache inside him that hadnt been there before i got through allena sent him a brilliant smile she stood by the counter the phone in her hand and what appeared to be half her worldly goods dumped on the table shes cheeked in and theyre going to ring her room i only hope she didnt call my parents id hate to think theyd margaret oh im so glad youre she broke off again and conal watched the light in her eyes go dim yes i know im so sorry i missed the ferry and saying nothing he moved past her and got down mugs for tea he had no intention of leaving her to her privacy yes youre right it was irresponsible inexcusable yes that too to leave you shorthanded this way i tried to he saw the moment she gave up when her shoulders slumped and her face went carefully blank i understand no of course you cant be expected to keep me on after this oh yes i know it was against your better judgment in the first place you were very clear about that im sorry i let you down yes again shame fatigue resignation closed in on her a dingy fog of failure she shut her eyes no margaret excuses dont matter when people are depending on you did you call mom and dad no youre right what would have been the point bloody bitch conal muttered theyd just see how margaret liked being on the other end of a tonguelashing he decided and grabbed the phone out of allenas hand the buzz of the dial tone left him no victim for his outrage she had to go allena managed schedule i should excuse me no damned if i will he took her shoulders in a firm grip before she could escape there were tears on her lashes he wanted margarets neck in his hands youll not go off to lick your wounds why did you take that from her she was right i was irresponsible she has every reason to fire me shed never have taken me on in the first place without family pressure family pressure bugger it where was her family concern did she ask if you were all right what had happened where you were did she once ask you why no a tear spilled over slid down her cheek and inflamed him where is your anger he demanded what good does it do to be angry wearily she brushed the tear away i brought it on myself i dont care about the job thats the problem really i dont care about it i wouldnt have taken it if id had a choice margarets probably right i bungle this way on purpose margaret is a jackass no really shes not she managed a wobbly grin shes just very disciplined and goaloriented well theres no use whining about it she patted his hand then moved away to pour the tea ill call my parents after ive settled down a little explain oh god pressing her palms to the counter she squeezed her eyes shut i hate disappointing them this way over and over like a cycle i cant break if i could just do something if i could just be good at something shaking her head she went to the refrigerator to take out last nights soup to heat for lunch you dont know how much i envy you your talent and your confidence in it my mother always said if id just focus my energies instead of scattering them a dozen different ways id move beyond mediocre it should have shamed her to say such a thing to you surprised by the violence in his tone she turned back she didnt mean it the way i made it sound you have to understand theyre all so smart and clever and well dedicated to what they do my fathers chief of surgery my mothers a partner in one of the most prestigious law firms on the east coast and i cant do anything there was the anger it whipped through her as she slammed the pot on the stove pleased to see it conal folded his arms leaned back and watched it build theres james with his glossy practice and his gorgeous trophy wife and certified genius child whos a complete brat by the way but everyone says shes simply precocious as if precocious and rude are synonymous and margaret with her perfect office and her perfect wardrobe and her perfect home and her perfectly detestable husband who wont see anything but art films and collects coins she dumped soup into the pot and every thanksgiving they all sit around patting each other on the back over how successful and brilliant they are then they look at me as if im some sort of alien who got dumped on the doorstep and had to be taken in for humanitarian purposes and i cant be a doctor or a lawyer or a goddamn indian chief no matter how hard i try because i just cant do anything now you should be ashamed what she pressed her fingers to her temples temper made her dizzy and fuzzyheaded which is why she usually tried to avoid it what come here he grabbed her hand pulled her into the living room what did you do here about what what are the things you did in here i dusted to hell and back again with the dust allena look here at your flowers and candles and your bowl of broken shells and out here he dragged her to the door shoved it open heres a garden that was suffering from neglect until the morning wheres the sand that was all over the walk that i didnt even notice until it was gone there are sheets drying in the wind out back and soup heating in the kitchen the bloody shower doesnt drip now who did those things anyone can sweep a walk conal not everyone thinks to not everyone cares to and not everyone finds pleasure in the doing of it in one day you made a home out of this place and it hasnt been one in too long so that id all but forgotten the feel of a home around me do you think thats nothing do you think theres no value in that its just ordinary she said for lack of a better word i cant make a career out of picking wildflowers a living can be made where you find it if a living must be made youve a need to pick wildflowers and seashells allena and there are those who are grateful for it and notice the difference you make if she hadnt loved him already she would have fallen at that moment with his words still echoing and his eyes dark with impatience thats the kindest thing anyones ever said to me she laid her hands on his cheeks the very kindest softly she touched her lips to his thank you before he could speak she shook her head then rested it on his shoulder chapter contents prev next they shut out the world turned off time conal would have bristled at the idea that they were making a kind of magic but for allena there was no other word for it she posed for him again in the studio where the afternoon sun slanted through the windows and she watched herself be born in clay because she asked he told her of his years in dublin his studies and his work the lean student years when hed lived on tinned food and art then the recognition that had come like a miracle in a dingy gallery the first sale had given him the luxury of time room to work without the constant worry of paying the rent and the sales that followed had given him the luxury of choice so that hed been able to afford a studio of his own still though he spoke of it easily she noticed that when he talked of dublin he didnt refer to it as home but she said nothing later when hed covered the clay with a damp cloth and washed in the little sink they went for a walk along the shore they spoke of a hundred things but never once of the star she wore against her heart or the stone circle that threw its shadows from the cliff they made love while the sun was still bright and the warmth of it glowed on her skin when she rose over him as the day moved to evening the light remained shimmering as though it would never give way to night she entertained herself mending the old lace curtains shed found on a shelf in the closet while conal sketched and the dog curled into a nap on the floor between them she had the most expressive face he thought dreamy now as she sat and sewed everything she felt moved into her eyes of soft clear gray the witch behind those eyes had yet to wake and when she did he imagined that any man she cast them on would be spellbound how easily she had settled in to him his home his life without a break of rhythm he thought and with such contentment and how easy it would be to settle in to her even with these edgy flashes of need and desire there was a comfort beneath what was he to do about her where was he to put these feelings shed brought to life inside him and how was he to know if they were real conal she spoke quietly his troubled thoughts were like a humming in the air a warning cant you put it aside for now cant you be content to wait and see no it irritated him that shed read his mood in his silence letting others shape your life is your way not mine her hand jerked as if it had been slapped then continued to move smoothly yes youre right ive spent my life trying to please people i love and it hasnt gotten me anywhere they dont love me enough to accept me he felt a hitch in his gut as if hed shoved her away when he should have taken hold allena no its all right they do love me under it all just not as much or in the same way or however i love them they want things for me that im not capable of or that i just dont want for myself enough to make a real effort i cant put restrictions on my feelings im not made that way and i can he rose paced its not a matter of feelings but of being i cant and wont be led i care for you more than should be possible in this short a time and because of that you dont trust whats happened whats happening between us she nodded and clipping the thread set her needle aside thats reasonable what do you know of reason he demanded youre the damnedest most irrational woman ive ever met she smiled at that quick and bright its so much easier to recognize reason when you have so little yourself his lips twitched but he sat down how can you be so calm in the middle of all this ive had the most amazing two days of my life the most exciting the most beautiful she spread her hands nothing can ever take that away from me now that ive had it and ill have one more one more long and wonderful day so she got to her feet stretched i think ill get a glass of wine and go outside and watch the stars come out no he took her hand rose ill get the wine it was a perfect night the sky as clear as glass the sea swept in drew back then burst again in a shower of water that caught those last shimmers of day and sparkled like jewels you should have benches allena began here and here with curved seats and high backs in cedar that would go silver in the weather he wondered why he hadnt thought of it himself for he loved to sit and watch the sea what else would you have were you me well id put big pots near the benches and fill them with flowers that spilled out and spiked up dark blue crocks she decided then slanted him a look you could make them i suppose i could flowerpots the idea was amusing no one had ever expected flowerpots from him before he skimmed a hand over her hair as he sipped his wine and realized he would enjoy making them for her would like to see her pleasure in them dark blue she repeated to match the shutters when theyre fixed up with the paint i found in the laundry room now im painting shutters no no no your talents are much too lofty for such mundane chores you make the pots sturdy ones and ill paint the shutters i know when someones laughing at me she merely sent him a sly wink and walked down toward the water do you know what im supposed to be doing tonight what would that be i should be manning the slide projector for margarets afterdinner lecture on megalithic sites well then youve had a narrow escape havent you youre telling me do you know what im going to do instead ah come back inside and make wild love with me she laughed and spun in a circle im definitely putting that on the schedule but first im going to build a sand castle a sand castle is it a grand one she claimed and plopped down on the beach to begin the construction of sand castles is one of my many talents of course id do better work if i had a spade and a bucket both of which she added looking up at him from under her lashes can be found in the laundry room and i suppose as my talent for this particular art is in doubt im delegated to fetch your legs are longer so youll get there and back faster cant argue with that he brought back the garden spade and the mop bucket along with the bottle of wine as the first bold stars came to life he sat and watched her build her castle of sand you need a tower on that end he told her youve left it undefended its a castle not a fortress and my little world here is at peace however id think a famous artist could manage to build a tower if he saw the need for one he finished off his glass of wine screwed the stem in the sand and picked up the challenge she added more turrets carefully shaping then smoothing them with the edge of her spade and driven by his obviously superior talent with his hands began to add to the structure elaborately and what id like to know is that lump youve got there its the stables or will be when im finished its out of proportion he started to reach over to show her but she slapped his hand away as you like but your horses would have to be the size of hugh to fit in there she sniffed rocked back on her heels damn it he was right im not finished she said coolly she scooped up more sand and worked it in and what is that supposed to be it will be the drawbridge a drawbridge delighted she leaned over to study the platform he fashioned with his quick clever hands oh thats wonderful youre definitely sand castleskilled i know just what it needs she scrambled up and raced to the house she came back with some wooden kitchen matches and a bit of red ribbon that shed cut in a triangle chain would be better but well be innovative she poked the tip of the long match into the side of the drawbridge slid the other end into the castle wall fortunately the royal family here is having a ball so the drawbridge stays down she set a second match in the other side she broke a third match looped her ribbon around it then hoisted her makeshift flag on the topmost tower now thats a sand castle she plucked up the bottle of wine and poured for both of them to dolman castle a dream she thought theyd made together after clinking her glass to his she drew up her knees and looked out to sea its a beautiful night so many stars you cant see sky like this in new york just slices of it pieces between buildings so you forget how big it is when i was a boy i used to come out at night and sit here she turned her head rested her cheek on her knee what else did you do when you were a boy climbed the cliffs played with my friends in the village worked very hard to get out of chores that would have taken less time and less effort than the eluding of them took fished with my father he fell into silence and the depth of it had allena reaching out to take his hand you miss him i left him alone i didnt know he was ill that last year he never told me never once asked me to come back and tend to him he died by himself rather than ask me for that he knew youd come back he should have told me i couldve brought him to dublin gotten him to hospital for treatments specialists its always so much harder on the ones whore left behind she murmured he wanted to be here conal to die here oh aye to die here that was his choice and knowing he was ill and frail he climbed the cliffs and there at the stone dance is where his heart gave out that was his choice it makes you angry it makes me helpless which is the same thing to me so i miss him and i regret the time and distance that was between us the time and distance i put between us i sent him money instead of myself and he left me all he had the cottage and hugh he turned to her then and pulled the chain at her neck until the pendant slid clear and this he left this for me in that small wood box you see on the dresser in the bedroom the shiver raced over her skin chill and damp i dont understand his mother had given it to him on his eighteenth birthday as it had been given to her and he gave it to my mother on the day he asked her to marry him at the stone circle as is the oneil tradition she wore it always and gave it back to him to hold for me on the night she died cured in dagdas cauldron carved by the finger of merlin its yours she murmured no no longer mine never mine as i refused it the day i buried my father i came here and i threw this into the sea that i told myself was the end of things theres only one the old woman had told her it belonged to her she had found it or it had found her and led her allena thought to him how could she feel anything but joy at knowing it and how being who he was could conal feel anything but anger for her it was a key for him a lock allena touched his cheek i dont know how to comfort you neither do i he rose pulled her to her feet no more of this tonight no more castles and stars i want whats real my need is real enough he swept her up and so are you chapter contents prev next she couldnt sleep no matter how short the night she couldnt bear to waste it in dreams so she lay quiet and wakeful reliving every moment of the day that had passed theyd ended it she thought now with love not the slow and tender sort theyd brought each other the first time thered been a desperation in conal when he carried her into bed from the beach a kind of fierce urgency that had streaked from him and into her so that her hands had been as impatient as his her mouth as hungry and her body she thought oh her body had been so very alive that kind of craving was another sort of beauty wasnt it a need that deep that strong that willful could dig deep and lasting roots why wouldnt he let himself love her she turned to him and in sleep he drew her against him im here she wanted to say i belong here i know it but she kept the words inside her and simply took his mouth with hers soft seductive drawing what she needed and giving back slow and silky a mating of lips and tongues the heat from bodies wrapped close weighing heavy on the limbs he drifted into desire as a man drifts through mists the air was thick and sweet and she was there for him warm and willing and real he heard her breath catch and sigh out felt her heart beat to match the rhythm of his own and she moved against him under him bewitching in the dark when he slid into her she took him in with a welcome that was home together they lifted and fell steady and smooth mouths met again as he felt her rise up to peak as he lost himself gave himself and emptied allena he said her name only her name as he once more gathered her against him comforted settled he slipped back into sleep never knowing that she wept before dawn she rose afraid that if she stayed beside him any longer in the dark she would ask more afraid that if he offered some pale substitute for love and lifetimes she would snatch at it pitifully she dressed in silence and went out to wait for the dawn of the longest day there was no moon now and no stars nothing to break that endless spreading dark she could see the fall of land the rise of sea and to the west the powerful shadows of the jagged cliffs where the stone circle stood and waited the pendant weighed heavy on her neck only hours left she thought she wouldnt lose hope though it was hard in this dark and lonely hour to cling to it shed been sent here brought here it didnt matter what mattered was that she was here and here she had found all the answers she needed she had to believe that conal would find his in the day that was left to them she watched dawn break a slow almost sly shifting of light that gave the sky a polish mists slipped and slid over the ground rose into the air like a damp curtain and there in the east it flamed gold then spread to red over sky and water brighter and brighter still until the world woke the air went from gray to the shimmer of a pearl on the beach the castle had been swamped by the tide and seeing what could be so easily washed away broke her heart a little she turned away from it and went back inside she needed to keep her hands busy her mind busy she could do nothing about the state of her heart but she wouldnt mope today of all days when hugh came padding out she opened the door so he could race through she put on the kettle for tea she already knew how conal liked his almost viciously strong with no sugar or cream to dilute the punch while it steeped she got a small pot from a cupboard conal had mentioned there were berries ripening this time of year if she could find them and there were enough theyd have fresh fruit for breakfast she went out the back past the herb garden and a huge shrub covered with dozens of conical purple blossoms that smelled like potpourri she wondered how they would look dried and spearing out of a big copper urn ground fog played around her ankles as she walked and made her think it was something like wading in a shallow river the wind didnt reach it but fluttered at her hair as she climbed the gentle rise behind the cottage far off was the sound of hughs deepthroated bark and somewhere nearer the liquid trill of a bird over it all was the forever sound of the sea on impulse she slipped off her shoes to walk barefoot over the cool wet grass the hill dipped then rose again steeper now with the mist thickening like layers of filmy curtain she glanced back once saw the cottage was merely a silhouette behind the fog a prickle over her skin had her pausing nearly turning back then she heard the dog bark again just up ahead she called out to him turned in the direction of his bark and kept climbing on the top of the next rise was a scattering of trees sculpted by wind and with them the bushes brambles and berries she hunted pleased with her find she set down her shoes and began to pick and taste and climb still higher to where the ripest grew she would make pancakes she thought and mix the berries in the batter her pot was half full when she scrambled up on a rock to reach a solitary bush pregnant with fat fruit of rich and deep purple the most tempting are always the ones just out of reach allenas breath caught and she nearly overturned her pot when she saw the woman standing on the rough track on the other side of the bush her hair was dark and hung past her waist her eyes were the moody green of the ocean at dawn she smiled and rested her hand on hughs head as he sat patiently beside her i didnt know anyone was here could be here she thought i she looked back now with some alarm and couldnt see the cottage i walked farther than i realized its a good morning for a walk and for berry picking those you have thered make a fine mixed jam ive picked too many i wasnt paying attention the womans face softened sure you can never pick too many as long as someone eats them dont fret she said quietly hes sleeping still his minds quiet when he sleeps allena let out a long breath who are you whoever you need me to be an old woman in a shop a young boy in a boat oh surrendering to shaky legs she sat on the rock god it shouldnt worry you theres no harm meant not to you or to him hes part of me his greatgrandmother he said they say the womans smile widened they do indeed struggling for composure allena reached under her sweater drew out the pendant this is yours it belongs to whom it belongs to until it belongs to another conal said he threw it into the sea such a temper that boy has her laugh was light and rich as cream over whiskey it does me proud he could throw it to the moon and still it would come to whom it belongs to when it was time this time is yours he doesnt want to love me oh child she touched allenas cheek and it was like the brush of wings love cant be wanted away it simply is and you already know that you have a patient heart sometimes patience is just cowardice thats wise the woman nodded obviously pleased and helped herself to one of the berries in the pot and true as well but already you understand him and are coming to understand yourself which is always a more difficult matter thats considerable for such a short time and you love him yes i love him but he wont accept love through magic tonight when the longest day meets the shortest night when the star cuts through with power and light the choice you make both you and he will be what was always meant to be then she took allenas face in her hands kissed both her cheeks your heart will know she said and slipped into the mist like a ghost how allena closed her eyes you didnt give us enough time when hugh bumped his head against her legs she bent down to bury her face in his neck not enough time she murmured not enough to mope about it either i dont know what to do except the next thing i guess thats breakfast she wandered back the way she had come with hugh for company on this trip the fog was already burning off at the edges and drawing into itself it seemed that fate had decreed one more clear day for her when the cottage came into view she saw conal on the little back porch waiting for her you worried me he walked out to meet her knowing his sense of relief was out of proportion what are you doing roaming away in the mist berries she held up the pot youll never guess what i she trailed off as his gaze tracked down to the pendant ill never guess what no she thought she couldnt tell him what had happened whom she had seen not when the shadows were in his eyes and her heart was sinking because of them what im going to make for breakfast he dipped a hand into the pot berries watch she told him and took her gatherings into the house and learn he did watch and it soothed him hed wakened reaching for her and that had disturbed him how could a man spend one night with a woman then find his bed so cold so empty when she wasnt in it then that panic that drawing down in the gut when he hadnt been able to find her now she was here mixing her batter in a bowl and the world was right again was there a name for this other than love you really need a griddle she set the bowl aside to heat a skillet but well make do allena hmm she glanced back something in his eyes made her dizzy yes when she turned the pendant swung and caught at the sunlight the star seemed to flash straight into his eyes taunting him without moving conal took a deliberate step back no he would not speak of love where are your shoes my shoes hed spoken with such gentle affection that her eyes stung as she looked down at her own bare feet i must have left them behind silly of me so you wander barefoot through the dew pretty allena words strangled in her throat she threw her arms around him burying her face at his shoulder as emotions whirled inside her allena he pressed his lips to her hair and wished for both of them he could break this last chain that held his heart what am i to do about you love me just love me i can handle all of the rest i can make you happy if only youd let me i can make you happy and what of you there are two of us here how can you believe and accept all ive told you and be willing to change your life for it he drew her back touched a fingertip to the pendant how can you allena so easily accept this because it belongs to me she let out a shaky breath then took one in and her voice was stronger until it belongs to another steadier she took a ladle from a drawer and spooned batter into the skillet you think im naive and gullible and so needy for love that ill believe anything that offers the possibility of it i think you have a soft heart and a malleable one the cool gaze she sent him was a surprise as was her nod you may be right trying to fit yourself into forms so that the people you love will love you back the way you want keeps the heart malleable and while i hope to be done with that while im going to try to be done with that i prefer having a heart that accepts imprints from others a patient heart she thought but by god if it was a cowardly one deftly she flipped the pancakes what hardened yours conal youve good aim when you decide to notch the arrow maybe i havent reached into the quiver often enough but she would now movements smooth and unhurried she turned the pancakes onto a platter spooned more batter into the pan why dont you ever speak of your mother bullseye he thought and said nothing as she set him a place at the table i have a right to know you do yes she got out honey cinnamon poured the tea sit down your breakfast will get cold with a half laugh he did as she asked she was a puzzle and why had he believed hed already solved her he waited until shed emptied the skillet turned it off and come to the table to join him my mother was from the near village he began her father was a fisherman and her mother died in childbirth when my own mother was a girl the baby died as well so my mother was the youngest and the only daughter and pampered she told me by her father and brothers you have uncles in the village i do three and their families though some of the younger have gone to the mainland or beyond my father was an only child she drizzled honey on her pancakes passed the bottle to conal he had family she thought and still kept so much alone so you have cousins here too some number of them we played together when i was a boy it was from them that i first heard of what runs in me i thought it a story like others you hear like silkies and mermaids and faerie forts he ate because it was there and shed gone to the trouble to make it my mother liked to draw to sketch and she taught me how to see things how to make what you see come out in pencil and chalk my father he loved the sea and thought i would follow him there but she gave me clay for my eighth birthday and i he paused lifted his hands stared at them through narrowed eyes they were very like his fathers big blunt and with strength in them but they had never been made for casting nets the shaping of it the finding what was inside it i was compelled to see and wood carving away at it until you could show others what youd seen in it she understood that she knew that your father was disappointed puzzled more i think conal moved his shoulders picked up his fork again how could a man make a living after all whittling at wood or chipping at hunks of rock but it pleased my mother so he let it be for her and i learned later because in his mind my fate was already set so whether i sculpted or fished wouldnt matter in the end when he fell silent looked back at the pendant allena slipped it under her sweater and feeling the quiet heat of it against her heart waited for him to continue chapter contents prev after me my parents tried for more children twice my mother miscarried and the second late in her term damaged her i was young but i remember her having to stay in bed a long time and how pale she was even when she could get up my father set a chair out for her so she could be outside and watch the sea she was never well after that but i didnt know you were just a boy when she touched a hand to his he looked down smiled a little soft heart allena he turned his hand over squeezed hers once then released she was ill the summer i was twelve three times that spring my father took her on the ferry and i stayed with my cousins she was dying and no one could find a way to save her part of me knew that but i pushed it out of my mind every time she came home again i was certain it was all right poor little boy allena murmured he doesnt deserve as much sympathy as you think that summer when i was twelve she walked down to the sea with me she shouldve been in bed but she wouldnt go she told me of the stone dance and the star and my place in it she showed me the pendant youre wearing now though id seen it countless times before she closed my hand around it with her own and i felt it breathe i was so angry i wasnt different from the other lads i knew no different from my cousins and playmates why would she say so she told me i was young to have it passed on to me but she and my father had discussed it hed agreed to let her do it in her time and her own way she wanted to give me the pendant before she left us you didnt want it no by god i didnt i wanted her i wanted things to be as they were when she was well and i was nothing more than a lad running over the hills i wanted her singing in the kitchen again the way she did before she was ill everything inside her ached for him but when she reached out conal waved her off i shouted at her and i ran from her she called after me and tried to come after me but i was strong and healthy and she wasnt even when i heard her weeping i didnt look back i went and hid in my uncles boat shed it wasnt till the next morning that my father found me he didnt take a strap to me as i might have expected or drag me home by the ear as i deserved he just sat down beside me pulled me against him and told me my mother had died in the night his eyes were vivid as they met allenas she wondered that the force of them didnt burn away the tears that swam in her own i loved her and my last words to her were the bitter jabs of an angry child do you think oh conal can you possibly believe those words are what she took with her i left her alone and you still blame a frightened and confused twelveyearold boy for that shame on you for your lack of compassion her words jolted him he rose as she did years later when i was a man i did the same with my father thats selfindulgent and untrue briskly she stacked plates carried them to the sink it wasnt sympathy he needed she realized but plain hard truth you told me yourself you didnt know he was ill he didnt tell you she ran the water hot poured detergent into it stared hard at the rising foam you curse the idea you have what did you call it elfin blood but you sure as hell appear to enjoy the notion of playing god if shed thrown the skillet at his head hed have been less shocked thats easy for you to say when you can walk away from all of this tomorrow thats right i can she turned the faucet off and turned to him i can finally do whatever i want to do i can thank you for that for helping me see what i was letting happen for showing me that i have something of value to give and i want to give it conal i want to make a home and a family and a life for someone who values me who understands me and who loves me i wont take less ever again but you will youre still hiding in the boat shed only now you call it a studio vile and hateful words rose up in his throat but he was no longer a young boy and he rejected them for the sharper blade of ice ive told you what you asked to know i understand what you want but you have no understanding of what i need he walked out letting the door slap shut behind him youre wrong she said quietly i do understand she kept herself busy through the morning if she did indeed go away the next day she would leave something of herself behind he wouldnt be allowed to forget her she hung the curtains shed mended pleased when the sunlight filtered through the lace into patterns on the floor in the laundry room she found tools and brushes and everything she needed with a kind of defiance she hauled it all outside she was going to scrape and paint the damn shutters the work calmed her and that malleable heart shed spoken of began to ache now and then she glanced over at the studio he was in there she knew where else would he be though part of her wanted to give up to go to him she did understand his needs he needed time but its running out she murmured stepping back she studied the results of her labors the paint gleamed wet and blue and behind the windows the lace fluttered in the breeze now that it was done and there was nothing else her body seemed to cave in on itself with fatigue nearly stumbling with it she went into the house she would lie down for a little while catch up on the sleep shed lost the night before just an hour she told herself and stretching out on the bed went under fast and deep conal stepped back from his own work his hands were smeared with clay to the wrists and his eyes half blind with concentration allena of the faeries she stood tall slim her head cocked slyly over one shoulder her eyes long and her mouth bowed with secrets she wasnt beautiful nor was she meant to be but how could anyone look away how could he her wings were spread as if she would fly off at any moment or fold them again and stay if you asked her he wouldnt ask her not when she was bound by something that was beyond both of them god shed infuriated him he went to the sink began to scrub his hands and arms snipping and sniping at him that way telling him what he thought and felt he had a mind of his own and hed made it up hed done nothing but tell her the truth of that of everything from the beginning he wanted peace and quiet and his work and his pride he thought as his hands dripped water the pride that refused to accept that his path was already cut in the end would he be left with only that the emptiness stretched out before him staggeringly deep were these then after all his choices all or nothing acceptance or loneliness hands unsteady he picked up a towel drying off as he turned and studied the clay figure you already know dont you you knew from the first he tossed the towel aside strode to the door the light shifted dimmed even as he yanked it open storm clouds crept in already shadowing the sea he turned for the cottage and what he saw stopped him in his tracks shed painted the shutters was all he could think the curtains shed hung danced gaily in the rising wind shed hung a basket beside the door and filled it with flowers how was a man to resist such a woman how could it be a trap when shed left everything even herself unlocked and unguarded all or nothing why should he live with nothing he strode toward the cottage and three steps from the door found the way barred to him no denial and a lick of fear roughened his voice as he shoved uselessly at the air damn you youd keep me from her now he called out to her but her name was whisked away by the rising wind and the first drops of rain pelted down all right then so be it panting he stepped back well see what comes at the end of the day so he went through the storm to the place that called to his blood she woke with a start the sound of her own name in her ears and woke in the dark conal disoriented she climbed out of bed reached for the lamp but no light beamed when she turned the switch a storm she thought blearily it was storming she needed to close the windows she fumbled for the candle then her hand jerked and knocked it off the little table dark how could it be dark time what time was it frantically she searched for the candle found a match before she could light it lightning flashed and she saw the dial of the little windup clock eleven oclock no it was impossible shed slept away all but the last hour of the longest day conal she rushed out of the room out of the house into the wind rain drenched her as she ran to his studio fought to open the door gone he was gone struggling against despair she felt along the wall for the shelves and on the shelves for the flashlight shed seen there the thin beam made her sigh with relief then her breath caught again at what stood in the line of that light her own face her own body made fanciful with wings did he see her that way clever and confident and lovely i feel that way for the first time in my life i feel that way slowly she shut the light off set it aside she knew where hed gone and understood somehow that she was meant to find her own way there as he had in the dark the world went wild as she walked as wild as the day she had come to this place the ground shook and the sky split and the sea roared like a dragon instead of fear all she felt was the thrill of being part of it this day wouldnt pass into night without her closing her hand over the star between her breasts she followed the route that was clear as a map in her head steep and rough was the path that cut through rock and slippery with wet but she never hesitated never faltered the stones loomed above giants dancing in the tempest in its heart the midsummer fire burned bright and gold despite the driving rain and facing it the shadow that was a man her heart as shed been told knew conal he turned to her his eyes were fierce as if whatever wild was in the night pranced in him as well allena no ive something to say she walked forward unhurried though the air trembled theres always a choice conal always another direction do you think id want you without your heart do you think id hold you with this in a violent move she pulled the pendant from around her neck and threw it no he grabbed for it but the star only brushed his fingertips before it landed inside the circle can you cast it off so easily and me with it if i have to i can go make a life without you and part of me will always grieve or i can stay make a home with you bear your children and love you for everything you are those are my choices you have yours she held out her arms theres nothing but me here to hold you there never was emotions tumbled through him end over end twice ive let the people i loved go without telling them even when i came here tonight i thought i might do so again he pushed dripping hair away from his face im a moody man allena so you told me once before i never would have known it otherwise his breath came out in a half laugh youd slap at me at such a time he took a step toward her you painted the shutters so what ill make you pots in dark blue to fill with your flowers why because i love you she opened her mouth closed it again took a careful breath because i painted the shutters yes because you would think to because you mended my mothers curtains because you pick berries because you swim naked in the sea because you look at me and see who i am whatever brought you here brought us here doesnt matter what i feel for you is all there is please god dont leave me conal the storm inside her and around her quieted you only have to ask they say theres magic here but its you who brought it would you take me allena he reached for her hand clasped it and give yourself to me make that home and that life and those children with me i pledge to you ill love you and ill treasure you ever hour of every day he lifted her hand pressed his lips to it id lost something and you brought it back to me youve brought me my heart so she thought hed found the key after all ill take you conal and give myself to you her eyes were dry and clear and steady and everything we make well make together i promise to love you now and ever after as she wrapped her arms around him the mists cleared in the dark sea of the sky a star began to pulse the fire shimmered down to a pool of gold flame tipped red as ruby the air went sharp and cool so the stones stood out like a carving in glass and they sang in whispers do you hear it allena murmured yes there he turned her held her close to his side as the shimmering beam from the midsummer star shot through the stones and like an arrow pinned its light to its mate on the ground the pendant burst blue a clean fire starshaped and brilliant while star joined star the circle was the world full of light and sound and power then the longest day passed slipping into the shortest night the light rippled softened faded the stones sighed to silence conal drew her farther into the circle the fire rose up again and shot sparks into her eyes stroked warmth over his skin he bent to pick up the pendant and slipping the chain around her neck sealed the promise this belongs to you and so do i it belongs to me she pressed their joined hands against it until it belongs to another ill always be yours she kissed him there inside the echo of magic then stepped back come home she said some say that the faeries came out of their raft to celebrate and danced round the midsummer fire while the star showered the last of its light but those who had magic in their hearts and had pledged it left the circle walked from the cliffs and along the quiet beach to the cottage with dark blue shutters that waited by the sea
