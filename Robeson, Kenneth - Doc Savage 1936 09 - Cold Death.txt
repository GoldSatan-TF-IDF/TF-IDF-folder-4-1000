threatens doc chapter three visitors chapter the runaway plane chapter hand in a crowd doc savage knew a hand had touched his pocket there was a swift wraithlike movement of fingers then the hand was gone the touch was fleeting enough but doc savage knew it had not been for the purpose of robbery the fingers had not been explorative they had merely deposited something in docs pocket doc savage did not pause nor did he make any effort to apprehend the man who had touched him it would have been simple to have laid hands upon him corded bronze hands to have trapped him doc knew the man was not a thief he was aware nothing had been removed doc pressed the back of a hand on the outside of the pocket and felt a square white card the man who had placed it there had slipped aside in the crowd no doubt he believed he had succeeded in delivering his message without being detected if he had known doc savage better he would have known this to be an impossible feat it was docs principle to avoid public encounter unless the circumstance was compelling he contented himself with a seconds glimpse of the man who had touched him he saw the back of a head the hair was scraggly unshorn this strung from under the frayed brim of a disreputable hat the neck was scrawny little more than a bony upper spine with skin wrapped around it doc savage removed the card from his pocket he did not slacken his speed he had been moving through the wall street crowd with the easy movement of a jungle animal though there was a press on the sidewalk it being five oclock it was amazing how this bronzeskinned man avoided contact with others doc was careful to hold the card by its edges the hands of the scraggly man had been bare there should be fingerprints doc cupped the card his eyes flicked across it docs eyes were like flaky gold with stirring whirlwinds in their depths the whirlwinds seemed to move more rapidly now for a few seconds there was a haunting trilling note those who might have been watching the smooth bronze face of doc would have detected no movement of his lips there were many thus watching for the man of bronze was a marked figure the trilling seemed to emanate from all of his huge symmetrical body it was a sound of which doc himself was hardly conscious it might presage danger or that the man of bronze was upon the eve of a discovery the message on the card in his hand was brief but explicit to clark savage jr if you would prevent death danger to thousands call union tonight at eight the words had been printed with a leaky pen there was no signature but the back of a mans head was all the signature doc would need intuitively he knew he would see the man again perhaps many times doc savage continued through the wall street crowd now he moved with greater speed but still he touched no one the man of bronze had an errand in wall street he completed his brief business before returning to his headquarters but his mind was busy with the problem the card in his pocket might represent because of his amazing adventures his worldwide assistance to those in trouble and his punishment of crooks doc savage was always besieged with appeals a few merited his attention and he was likewise a target for many who feared him even this small card in his pocket might be the bait for a trap when he had returned to his laboratory doc set about reading what he considered vastly more important than the mere printed words on the white card this laboratory on the eightysixth floor of manhattans most impressive skyscraper was most amazing in its equipment not even the latest equipment of the police or the federal department of justice equalled the means here for scientific investigation in addition as the man of bronze had entered the doors of smooth chrome steel closed him in no locks appeared on these doors but their electroscopic fastenings made them possible of opening only to doc and his five companions in adventure doc first dusted the card bearing the mysterious message the distinct imprints of a thumb and forefinger appeared the card was a trifle grimy the hand delivering it had been that of a man who worked the soiled spots had a brownish tinge the bronze man dropped a colorless liquid upon these spots the reagent brought out a definite greenish color for the time doc made no further tests he had arrived at one conclusion which was significant the hands placing the card in his pocket had been those of a working chemist the bronze man placed the card carefully in a glass case the voice of a man was speaking from the library adjoining the laboratory it was fretful and complaining you danged shyster i waited where you said but you didnt show up daggonit you wont get the chance to stand me up again the speaker was lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair his voice was shrill and childlike but his appearance was that of an ungainly ape covered with reddishbrown hair because of this he was known as monk he was one of the worlds leading industrial chemists monk had been speaking into the telephone the man he had called a shyster was brigadier general theodore marley brooks otherwise known as ham he was the legal luminary of doc savages group hearing monks voice doc savage removed the card from the glass case he came into the library and laid the card on the table before monk i received this about three hours ago doc stated those greenish spots were brown monk touched the edge of the card the no reagent brought out the green then he named a littleknown chemical which had an acid reaction that is correct monk the bronze man approved the card was placed in my pocket a huge man with a melancholy face peered at the card and frowned solemnly he was colonel john renwick the engineer of the group the hand renny extended toward the card lacked little being the size of a ham he read the words gloomily union exchange huh the third man in the library said thats over in jersey and every time we have business with jersey there is trouble this man had an unhealthy pallor he was small compared to the others but many larger men had been sharply surprised by his strength and fighting ability he was major thomas j roberts electrical wizard his appearance had given him the name of long tom as long tom finished speaking a clock started chiming with musical notes doc savage crossed to the desk and picked up the telephone the clock chimes touched the final stroke of eight oclock with a harmonious lingering union said doc when he had the new jersey connection a voice started to speak from the other end without preliminaries the voice said youre doc sav then it seemed as if the receiver had exploded the voice was sliced off no reverberation followed there was no lingering roll of sound such as could have been expected if the instrument had remained even for a few seconds in service that was a powerful blast doc said the phone was torn out the man who tried to talk was an old man doc didnt explain further he didnt waste more time in speech he had thumbed the receiver bar two minutes later he was given a traceback on the jersey call blind number he said to the others its off the newarktrenton highway in a marshy strip doc moved ahead through the outer door his three companions paused only to make a swift collection of a few special devices they might need the bronze man did not seem hurried but the others were compelled to move fast docs special elevator dropped with the speed of a rocket it slowed with a cushiony rebound when it reached the bronze mans private garage in the basement docs long low car with its extrapowerful motor under the long hood and its windows of bulletproof glass set in armor steel glided toward the holland tunnel chapter the house in the marsh shortly before the eight oclock telephone call made by doc savage a battered old roadster turned off a paved new jersey highway headlight beams laid ghostly fingers across a foggy strip of marshland when he was perhaps a mile and a half from the main highway the driver abruptly switched off the lights he parked the little car in concealment of bushes beside a crooked lane climbing from the car the driver walked cautiously ahead dim lights made a blur in the fog they indicated some habitation close up this might have been seen to be an old log house it appeared to squat gloomily in the murky depths of the jersey marsh the bulk of its presence was marked only by faint illumination from an upper window and one slanting finger of dancing varicolored light emanating from what seemed a mere slit at ground level from the basement or some underground chamber came a low throbbing a trained observer would have said delicate machinery of some sort was being operated apparently there was but one outside watcher and his figure was only a furtive shadow among other sinister shadows cast by this strange penetrating light at times the escaping light gave forth a rainbow glow a rutty obscure road that was little more than a twisting trail through overgrowths of waving swamp grass apparently was the only traffic communication between the old house and the highway of civilization some two miles distant across the swamp a pair of telephone wires had been strung along available trees most of them gauntlimbed and dead in the upper story of the old house there was no movement except for the faint light at the one window there was no evidence the structure was then occupied by a living person the man from the roadster apparently feared something or some one within the old log house as he walked it might have been observed he was a vague catlike figure he kept to the tall marsh grass beside the road pausing every few yards to listen intently in the swamp at a point off the road some considerable distance from the old house was a single glowing eye of fire the man hissed an oath under his breath he crossed the soggy yielding ground with such quick lightness his feet seemed to leave no imprints before he reached the spot the red eye of fire winked out hunter maybe the man murmured well hes picked a poor spot for a camp as if the possible presence of another human no longer interested him the luminouseyed man retraced his steps he glanced at the radium hands of a wrist watch the time is near he mumbled if old jackson hasnt been having hallucinations picking out a slightly higher dry spot some two hundred yards to one side of the house the thin figure became a motionless part of the deeper marsh shadows his thin lips continued to emit whispered words the great doc savage will be calling at eight oclock or old jackson has guessed him wrong again he glanced at his watch it lacked five minutes to eight oclock there was no doubt but he had some objective which was closely related with the phone call doc savage had been requested to make from manhattan it wont work out he muttered suddenly through gritted teeth and doc savage saw me i could feel him looking at the back of my head i never really touched him but somehow i believe he knew i was there the radium hands of the wrist watch showed two minutes to eight oclock to the watchers apparently rawnerved senses the lonely marsh had become alive with voices his teeth chewed nervously at his lower lip he glanced at a deadarmed tree it seemed almost as if he were waiting to read the message that might go out over the wires he knew were strung there the thin threads of communication between this eerie desolation and the teeming modern heart of manhattan one minute to eight oclock the spear of multicolored light piercing the slit of the underground window of the squatting old house winked out the wind moaned a little as if the withdrawal of the rainbow gleam were a signal the catlike man became rigid he glanced over his shoulder the red eyes of fire deeper in the marsh had not reappeared perhaps this unexpected camper was no longer in the swamp eight oclock from the heart of the marsh from no definite direction came a low whirring sound vicious as the warning of a poisonous rattler the cateyed watcher had reared to his feet he had turned and was running away the soggy ground of the swamp rocked and swayed the earth heaved with a convulsive shuddering blast the explosion started at the place of the old house a knife of giant flame shot upward and moved with ripping effect across the marsh the fleeing man was twice hurled from his feet each time his face and clothing were befouled by the ooze in which he fell the man staggered at last to the side road the slicing destruction that had seemed almost to be racing with him had died as swiftly as it had come the blast had been accompanied by an expanding phosphorescent glowing of steely blue light as the fugitive from his own apparent terror reached the spot where he had concealed his roadster darkness again had enwrapped the silence that was of itself by contrast terrific over all of the marsh the air had taken on an icy chill the dank sulphuric odor of death permeated the country for many miles shuddering the man leaped into the roadster he glanced only once at the place where the old log house had squatted evilly in the marsh only blackness emptiness was there there was no light of any sort not even the deeper bulking shadow that had been the house something like hatred twisted the mans thin face his lips slavered and his eyes burned then he turned the old roadster and sent it leaping away over the rutty side road toward the main highway chapter the canal of death the mysterious watcher had ample time to get far from the scene of the explosion before state police were aroused to investigate the narrow lane to the old log house was some ten miles from the city of newark some time therefore elapsed before the tearing jolt of the blast had been definitely traced but cars of the state police were blocking the marsh side road when doc savage drove into it holy cow what a job growled renny look doc its a canal straight as if it was laid out with instruments and this was intended for a feed reservoir renny saw everything from an engineers point of view it does seem to have remarkable symmetry replied the man of bronze its the first explosion i ever came upon that seemed to have been done to a geometrical pattern howlin calamities muttered squat monk his homely apelike features showing puzzlement its about the completest mess i ever bumped into completes the word all right assented long tom and it looks as if it wiped out some highclass electrical machinery look here doc they were then beside a deep rounded crater it could be seen from a few remaining foundation stones imbedded in the earth that this had been the site of a house but underneath it the ground had been scooped out as if by the swing of a giant shovel on three sides of the cavernous hole in the spot where the house had stood the explosive force had apparently lifted directly upward an ordinary powder blast if of sufficient strength and buried deeply could have done this but doc was coming to some startling conclusions as he glanced along the fourth side of the explosion crater instead of spreading in a mushroom burst the blast had been definitely directional passing up for the moment the smashed electrical equipment long tom had pointed out doc led the others away from the blasts place of origin they saw the explosive force had moved laterally along the ground cutting through the marsh by reason of the road having curved in a wide bend more than two miles in extent the great ditch that had been cut was as evenly grooved along its sagging banks as if a steam shovel had heaved out the soggy mud where the house had been this canal was its exact width as doc and his companions made their way along the sucking marshland the cut gradually narrowed they had proceeded about a fourth of a mile when renny grunted doc would you look at this a man lay at the edge of the knifedout ditch the torso head and arms were there the legs were missing the man had been sliced in half it was as if a giant cleaver had suddenly descended a shotgun and a pack showed the victim had been a hunter doubtless he had made his lonely camp waiting for dawn and the first flight of fowl ashes of a dead fire were near by doc examined the explosion cut more closely under his generator flashlight the character of the clean incision in the soft earth and the phenomenon of the hunters body having been neatly severed in the middle were supplying him with information long tom said theres a busted electrical machine back there something must have gone up accidentally but that would mean tremendous voltage giant generators would be needed to create the energy for a lightning blast like that unless unless said doc the secret of cracking the atom has been coupled up with transmitted electromagnetic force or something similar to that a short distance from the dead man possibly a mile from the annihilated house the canal cut petered out it terminated in a rising indentation only a few inches wide and an inch or two deep doc had placed the warning message card in his pocket now he led the others rapidly toward the site of the greater explosion in all that mass of scattered wreckage the state police had passed up the thought of discovering fingerprints doc produced his own outfit he had noticed every detail of the wrecked electrical machine indicated by long tom a polished copper ball had fallen to one side with state police watching curiously doc dusted the gleaming surface the lines of a forefinger then of a thumb took form under a powerful glass doc studied the grimy message card then the convolutions and whorls of the lines on the copper ball returning the card to his pocket he said one and the same man a scraggly little fellow with the prehensile type fingers a state police sergeant stared at him youre doc savage arent you he inquired yes wouldnt worry any more about those prints then said the sergeant if he was in there he isnt much use to anybody now come over here mr savage the man who had been in the house would neither be a menace nor a help to any one again only one foot remained the leg severed roughly at the top of a highlaced boot such as a man might be wearing in the marshy ground doc only glanced at it no he said this wasnt the man its some other person i think this may be the one who was on the phone docs final words were addressed in a low tone for his own companions only to hear doc was piecing together the scanty material he had some one in the house in the marsh must have known he was under a sentence of death at least he was aware of some menace hovering over him this other man he of the scraggly person had been sent with a message that might be it but doc was not thoroughly satisfied perhaps the person or persons responsible for the gruesome tragedy might have a reason for bringing him to the scene this thought stuck with him strongly he pondered the possibility of this having been a demonstration the messenger might have intended to have him on the telephone when the blast was set off he would be sure doc savage would go directly to the scene then his purpose had been fulfilled no more likely evidence appeared in the wideflung jangle of house wreckage the booted foot was all that told a man had been in the house doc led his men to his car during the investigation of the explosion an automobile had been playing hide and seek with state police and other cars arriving at the scene of the great explosion several times the automobile was swung into side roads as sirens screamed warnings that forces of the law were arriving at last the police having passed the elusive car came into the main highway and sped northward toward newark a motorcycle patrolman who had remained watching the highway was hidden around a curve as the speeding auto flashed by he immediately swung onto the concrete and gave chase the motorcycle forged abreast of the autos rear fender the driver of the car jammed his foot suddenly on his brakes the auto swayed and rubber squealed when it skidded the motorcycle patrolman hadnt a chance the motorcycle catapulted into the air it turned over three times the policeman became only a limp bundle in the ditch the driver of the car glanced along the highway no other lights were showing the man talked rapidly for perhaps a minute it was peculiar behavior for he seemed making some sort of a speech then he climbed from the car he kicked around in the loose soil a few yards from where the motor cop lay motionless the driver then got back under the wheel and the car sped toward newark by this time some of the state police were returning from the scene of the explosion when doc savage and his men reached this spot a state police car had just discovered the policeman in the ditch the motor cop was beginning to revive he had only been knocked out he was able to say it was a car of wellknown make that had wrecked him the license plate had been smeared with mud doc eased from his car two other police cars stopped passing motorists halted their machines soon there was a small crowd around the motor cop the mans face was badly slashed from the last of the civilian cars to stop three men got out none noticed the driver of this car turn off into a nearby side road at this moment the small group around the injured patrolman had frozen to silence from the wall of foggy darkness over the marsh beside the highway floated a highpitched voice doc savage beware do not seek more information i cannot be overcome i control the worlds most terrible force of destruction i will not brook interference for i am var the mysterious voice ceased abruptly holy cow grunted renny what is it doc doc had scanned every foot of the nearby ground it had been much trampled the flashlight produced nothing well have a look along the edges of the marsh advised doc you might try kicking around a bit in the loose grass monks short body with his gorilla arms trailing vanished in the fog the chemist peered closely from the eyes deepset in rolls of bristly gristle daggone it he growled i did hear it he was not referring to the sepulchral tones coming from nowhere on the highway monk had heard another faint voice it had sounded like a mans hoarse cry for help where any one needed help there might be a fight monk pushed forward hopefully separated from his companions monk decided he would rather handle this alone than wait and miss it pushing deeper into the marsh he saw a man waistdeep in the sucking mud of a bog the man was sinking deeper with each second keep your chin up fella monk called and started to wade into the mire from the tall grass figures sprang upon him there were three of the men they had monk at a disadvantage he was already kneedeep in the bog one man hurtled through the air and landed on monks back it was his mistake monks long arms snapped up and back his clasped hands hooked behind the other mans head monks shoulders barely twisted and the man turned over twice in midair before he splashed face down in the mud unable to release his mired feet monk whipped a fist into another mans face the man sat down with a whoosh the third man had been more wary he had held back when he moved a thick heavy club swished down upon monks unprotected skull monk fell as if he had suddenly sunk in the quagmire oozing mud and water choked his mouth and nostrils after several minutes of fruitless searching for the origin of the spoken warning doc renny and long tom came back to the highway they waited ten minutes but monk did not appear a big car with a rear trunk compartment opening under the wide seat came from the side road a hundred yards away unnoticed it wheeled into line with the parade of cars now returning to the city from the scene of the explosion doc and the others combed the marsh for more than an hour then doc summoned renny and long tom theyve got monk he said i found the place in the swamp where they fought it out doc had retrieved monks muddy hat chapter ghost voice again further search here would be useless announced doc savage monks captors undoubtedly have returned directly to the city i judge that for the present he will be unharmed we are confronted by an organization in control of a hitherto unknown force in a remarkably brief space of time docs car was piloted down the ramp of his special garage under the skyscraper headquarters when they had ascended the bronze man apparently had arrived at some definite conclusion for some time he said nothing his smoothly corded hands were assembling some small but powerful electrical amplifying coils his knowledge of explosive forces especially of electromagnetic energy and powerful rays and waves surpassed that of any other living man when he spoke docs words had little connection with what his hands were doing there is a woman in the strange happenings of the night he said calmly holy cow exploded renny i didnt see any evidence of one yes there is a woman in it stated doc she was speaking only a murmur but perhaps arguing with this man who calls himself var all of us heard a ghostly voice in speech i was listening to two voices renny exhibited no further surprise docs auditory perception was maintained by his daily twohour exercises on a specially devised scale of vibrations his hearing was selective youre planning some form of new electrical detector long tom remarked watching docs skillful bronze hands assembling some wound copper coils and a series of tiny but powerful generators to be combined in a single power unit hardly that stated doc the explosion was brought about most likely by the accidental unleashing of tremendous electrical force a hitherto undiscovered means of producing high voltage seems to have been involved the day is close when we shall find vast explosive energy confined in small compact machines the special device established in the elevator corridor of docs headquarters gave a warning buzz in the square of glass at one side of the laboratory a figure appeared walking from the elevator toward doc savages door he was a youthful smilingfaced telegraph messenger his expression seemed proof he was somewhat awed but much pleased at this opportunity to visit the headquarters of the famed doc savage the messenger stood by as doc signed the book and opened the yellow envelope the message read have unearthed bones of prehistoric platypus which predates paleozoic mammals stop will be domiciled at casper for forthcoming fortnight if you should desire to communicate johnny johnny was william harper littlejohn he was the archaeologist and geologist of the doc savage group for several weeks he had been in wyoming investigating a new discovery of prehistoric bones when the book was signed the messenger reddened a little and stammered mmr savage ccould i just have one look into your laboratory pplease absorbing the telegram doc said certainly stand here by the door the youthful messenger gasped as he gazed upon the hundreds of glittering devices of polished metal and glass within the big room gee he exclaimed gee he turned and walked toward the outer door crossing the office as if he were a little dizzy from what he had seen at this instant the ghost voice came again thin but strident doc savage i am too strong even for you i have your man monk keep out of this or he will be destroyed without a trace one by one your other companions will be taken you too must die if you persist nothing can stop me before my purpose has been accomplished for i am var the messenger boy stopped an instant eyes widening he looked at doc and his two companions none of the three had spoken the messenger turned and fled toward the elevators holy cow growled renny theyve planted something here while we were out come on long tom long tom joined him in the beginning of a search they were pulling out desk drawers long tom started to lift a corner of a rug doc picked up the telephone he gave the number of the nearest telegraph office in a few seconds he replaced the instrument we wont tear up the place the bronze man announced calmly the voice walked out with our smiling messenger boy i could have stopped him but just now perhaps it is better to permit this var to play his hand a bit farther there has been no telegram sent from johnny no message grunted long tom then this fellow who calls himself var must know all about us and what were doing thats it doc said grimly var not only has remarkable scientific knowledge but he is cleverbrained in other directions brothers we are opposed to perhaps the most dangerous mind of our experience a buzz of the desk phone interrupted further speech doc picked up the instrument this is the police commissioner doc savage well theres hades popping youre probably the only man who can be of help this is something too big for my men to grapple with doc said what is it it looks as if that explosion over in jersey wasnt any accident said the commissioner doc said nothing waiting and were up against something else continued the commissioner the next blast is scheduled for long island its due to happen any time you know j afton carberry the fellow who made millions lending money in south america and europe i know him said doc retired after the depression trimmed many other financiers dealing in foreign stuff disappeared for a year announced he was writing a book on cellular origin of the human species quite a smart chap you know everybody grunted the commissioner but carberry isnt so smart right now hes scared green called in a few minutes ago had a crazy warning he said from some sort of a voice where there wasnt anybody carberrys lost his head what was the message interposed doc did it fix a time nearly as he could repeat it the message said you have fortyeight hours to accede to my demand and place your fortune at my service other financiers will be quickly forced to follow your lead i have a force none can oppose before dawn you will see a demonstration of it you cant combat me for i am var i shall be awaiting you at carberrys home stated doc the bronze man delayed only to direct long tom to carry out the electrical experiment he had begun the electrical wizard returned reluctantly to the laboratory youll accompany me renny doc instructed renny who had gathered part of the phone conversation already was inside a special bulletproof vest of docs invention the bronze man flowed toward the rocket elevator they dropped with the speed of a falling plummet to the basement garage docs powerful armored car threaded through the thinned traffic of the darkened streets while he drove doc was considering the possibilities of the threat against j afton carberry docs amazing manysided brain also was recalling all known forces which might be employed to give explosive energy a definite path of destruction chapter monk is silenced at the moment doc savage and renny were speeding to the home of j afton carberry monk awoke in a coffinlike space his long arms and short body were folded and cramped a hard metal wall jammed his head down upon his thick neck his feet were drawn up for once monk was thankful his legs were shorter than his arms daggoned if i aint dead an buried he grunted trying to wedge himself into an easier position nope i aint dead my head mustve been busted wide open monk breathed with laboring lungs his mighty chest heaved with the effort to extract a supply of ozone from the foul air in the confined space strength flowed back into his body anyway i aint in the graveyard yet he muttered or id a been smothered an by the calamities i aint staying here monks body housing the strength of half a dozen ordinary men began to swell he filled his lungs to capacity and his iron chest heaved elbows levered against the walls of his metal prison the maker of the trunk under the rear seat of the automobile had not designed it to withstand any such concentrated dynamite the metal clasp and the brass tongue of the lock snapped the curved upright lid of the underseat trunk flapped open with a bang monks landing was in keeping with his apelike contours he hit on his feet low growls of warning amazement impinged on his hairy ears a man uttered a low curse and hurtled toward him other figures converged in a rush they were in a dimly lighted concrete garage monk saw it was apparently in the basement of some larger building heavy iron doors were closed and barred monk lithely evaded the first rushing figure with an incredibly fast sweep of one arm he gripped the mans thick neck his assailant was heavy but monks iron muscles contracted with the force of an immense rubber slingshot his attacker was lifted from his feet his body traveled a short arc through the air the mans head deeply dented the metal back of the car above the flapping lid of the trunk he collapsed to the floor without a groan the human skull was never designed for withstanding such an impact a jungle bellow issued from monks throat cmon you yella rats he growled come an get it three men relying on strength of numbers accepted the invitation both of monks fists made definite sickening contact with flesh and bone one of his feet twisted between the third mans legs he sprawled on top of his two companions others were coming at him but monk glimpsed one man standing back this man was short of body broad of shoulders and face his small eyes glittered piglike in rolls of eyerimming fat in his moon face the mouth was a small aperture set above a double chin that was adding a third roll of lard above his collar the tiny mouth gave him a grotesque appearance monk saw he was badly outnumbered leaping clear of the floor on his short legs he projected his body between two more men the backs of their heads cracked the floor another man hit monk a dizzying blow behind the ear with some blunt weapon monk staggered he was facing the moonfaced fellow with the little rathole for a mouth the man had a polished piece of metal in one hand it was shaped like the round box for holding steel tape from this box a slender stream of sizzling vapor shot into monks face monk gritted his teeth against the pain it was an ammonia gun blinded scarcely able to breathe monk went to his hands and knees under a rush of bodies a minute later he was firmly bound about the arms and was being propelled up a stairway monks captors placed him in an elevator operated automatically eyes smarting from the burning fumes of the ammonia gun monk could only guess at the number of floors they ascended then he was led along a hallway one of the men swore and muttered wheres that button wheeze though he was only beginning to see dimly monk knew it was the moonfaced man who was called wheeze right under siss that little picture siss by the molding dumbhead came the reply in the wheezing voice wheeze talked like a chronic case of asthma monk could see enough now to know they were in the room of an elaborately furnished apartment a panel in the wall swung open it revealed a spiral stairway the mean snout of an automatic was pushed into monks back at the top of the stairway they emerged into a vaulted room of lavishly rich fittings the walls of the room were odd they were covered with paintings in oil all of these represented some of the lower forms of marine life in spite of his ticklish position monk was intrigued by this unusual display of art nobody but a nutd ever lived in this dump he muttered he heard one of the men address wheeze by another name it was mcgovern apparently his last name soft pedal the titles smoke rapped wheeze stick to the handles the chief tacked on by that monk judged the chief of this gang was not among those present monk was pushed into a chair wheeze came and stood before him so youre the big ape doc savage uses for some of his chemical tricks he stated well siss theres one or two little tricks we want to find out also mister youre going to tell us something about doc savages setup there are several things we need to know try an make me gritted monk wheezes little mouth puckered and his small eyes gleamed wickedly i gather from all those misfit words you imagine youre not going to talk eh he sissed at monk well well see smoke is the convincer all set the man called smoke smiled genially the convincers always ready he put forth right this way a single wide glass door was opened at the side of the room monk was pulled to his feet and propelled into the adjoining space this was a bare small room with enameled walls and no furnishings the single man occupying it required no chair he was of shining armor metal and he stood erect in the middle of the floor the binding cords suddenly fell from monks arm but two men with automatics poked the snouts into his ribs we try to avoid shedding the blood of any person wheeze sissed in a sanctimonious voice every mans blood must be on his own head so we monk was shoved close to the armored figure he saw the contraption was some sort of robot it appeared to be hollow and large enough to admit the person of a very large man monks stillsmarting eyes blinked at the robots halfbent arms for in the metal fingers were clutched two longpointed knives these were directed inward toward the robots gleaming breast it looked as if the metal man was thinking of taking his own life in one enameled wall was a black switchboard it contained a complicated array of electrical switches coils and other gadgets in its center was what seemed to be the circle of an enlarged microphone everybody quiet ordered wheeze his companions instantly became silent none even moved now watch you wise ape one man stepped to the switchboard and turned a button when he stepped back wheeze spoke in a low tone do your stuff big boy he said slowly the metal arms of the robot moved inward the pointed knives approached two slits in the armored breast the movement was so slow as to be almost imperceptible slowly chillingly even though the shining figure was but cold metal the arms continued to bend the points of the knives disappeared into the shelllike cavity of the robots chest a minute two minutes passed monk growled in his throat both knives at last were buried to their hilts the mechanism ceased to whirr just one little word will do it murmured wheeze one little whisper or a sneeze and the mike picks up the sound and starts the robot were going to leave you with the convincer after ive attended to some special business well come back if youve kept that big yap of yours quiet that long maybe youll be about ripe to loosen up with some conversation thats what you think barked monk youll get nothin outta me thatll be just too bad for you sissed wheeze softly the automatics crowded monks spine then his stomach as the metal robot opened on oiled hinges helpless to resist he was shoved inside his long arms were forced into the bent hollow of the robots arms the torturing device was swung shut the speech control button on the switchboard was off while this took place wheeze looked up into monks orbs blinking through the armored eyeholes of the robot now you can talk your head off or your heart out grinned wheeze ready smoke everybody out click er on wheeze followed his men through the single door of glass it closed silently monk could see the men outside talking gesturing he could not hear their voices he was alone with the robot and his thoughts in the soundproof room monk glanced over at the round disk of the big microphone he could see the long knives inverted directly toward his heart many things came to monk that he would have liked to have said but he took it out in thinking chapter cold light strikes monk was confident doc savage would pick up his trail quickly he would have been much more downcast had he known that doc and renny were at this moment rushing along a long island road the man of bronze was even now scrutinizing a lowering sky over little neck this exclusive residence section just within the boundary line of new york city was sleeping great elms spread protective arms over the homes of millionaires at the terminus of a scattered row of ornate dwellings was set the colonialstyle mansion of j afton carberry unlike the others the carberry pile of architecture was ablaze with lights when they were half a mile from the place doc and renny could see this glaring illumination against the trees the light was reflected with a dull glow upon the lowflying clouds holy cow grunted renny youd think a smart guy like this carberry would have more brains than to light his house up like a christmas tree suppose this var fellow happened to be flying around upstairs what a swell target that would make good guess renny approved doc thats the way it may come this time well see what we can do about it police were thickly spotted in the carberry grounds the white gravel of the driveway showed like a winding serpent among the trees it was perhaps two hundred yards from the entrance gate to the illuminated mansion doc drove about fifty yards along the gravel his own powerful motor was only a whispering song under the cars long hood the humming drone that swiftly increased to a drumming throb among the scudding clouds was distinctly audible and there you are renny began to say a narrow band of bluesteel light shot from the murky sky like a long silvery knife it stood out against the night its point touched the driveway only a few yards ahead of docs car but it was moving swiftly swinging directly toward the car itself doc pulled the steering wheel around swerving the car into the trees with a swift movement he pushed renny to the outside rennys big body was through the door doc slid from under the wheel his heels crunched in the gravel with gliding speed he moved to one side his direction was toward the house the thing cant miss it renny yelled all those lights would it was one of the few times in his life that doc savage failed to hear distinctly the drums of his ears suddenly thundered it was as if a gigantic knife of ice had been thrust all the way through his body from his brain to his toes docs arms and legs were instantly numbed his motor nerves refused to respond to the bidding of his brain his keen sight was dimmed by a frost that seemed to rim his eyes he felt himself falling forward cold light was docs instant thought like the illumination created by the inhabitants of the land of alwaysnight only their light was cold and harmless this was deadly more like a bath in liquid air doc was temporarily paralyzed he tried to warn renny to keep away but no words issued from his constricted throat he felt consciousness fading then he was suffused with a vast warm wave by comparison it was like a fire that set his skin prickling and brought waves of jerking pain to his muscles slowly doc got to his feet overhead the airplane was flying low it carried no riding lights but the descending spike of cold light revealed it as a small dark object renny had whipped out his supermachine pistol and was shooting into the air his fire was futile the plane was beyond the reach of the mercy bullets renny was beside doc again police surged toward the house get back all of you warned doc he hadnt raised his voice he never did the peculiar quality of docs calmest words always carried to those listening the rare mellow whistle filled the space around him the sound may have come from his lips but it seemed an aura of vibration that always thrilled its hearers with the imminence of deadly danger doc guessed what was coming the air sucked away renny and the nearest coppers felt as if they were standing in a vast vacuum their mouths opened and their chests heaved as they gulped for breath the air seemed to have been snatched from the depths of their lungs docs eyes were fixed upon the carberry mansion he expected to see the milliondollar mass of architecture disintegrate but the residence remained intact from the thicker woods well back in the wide estate came the roar as of a rushing wind the sound was of cyclonic intensity in the hurricane hiss of displaced air came the crackling report of great trees being snapped off the long spike of bluesteel flashed off it was as if a switch had been thrown in the midst of chaos the rolling reverberation of the long explosion abruptly died only the trembling ground the hissing sighing echoes across the countryside the heavy bumping and plopping of falling trees and shorn branches remained as an aftermath of the blast policemen were climbing to their feet dusting off their clothes for a minute no one moved either toward or away from the scene of the bursting cold light that is none but doc savage instead of heading for the spot where the blast had taken place he was moving toward the carberry mansion docs stride was unhurried but renny who immediately followed was forced to shuffle into a trot to keep up with him the drumming of the plane was dying away it was flying out over long island sound with the stoppage of the cold light the pyramid of blue flame had suddenly disappeared it had seemed to ascend for half a mile or more doc wondered if the cold light had remained on would the flame have reached the plane renny was at docs shoulder they passed the policemen guarding the carberry doors inside doc instantly identified the financier though he had seen only his photographs in the news carberrys face was the color of gray chalk the area of color denoting his terror extended up his high narrow forehead into the baldness between strangely thick tufts of graying hair the man was so tall he was compelled to bend and droop his narrow shoulders to hold a shivering sobbing woman in his arms doc for the moment believed this woman to be the financiers daughter she appeared to be only about half the age of the retired capitalist the woman was wearing a lacy negligee her skin was smooth velvety renny paused admiringly the womans face was white as polished ivory all color had been drained from it apparently she had just come into the room aroused by the explosion darling oh what is it what is it the hand of the financier on the womans shoulder was blueveined and thin it trembled as he gently patted the womans alluring rounded arm its its nothing much dear the man quavered hoarsely doc walked toward them carberry stared at him an instant then his lips parted in a half fearful smile youre doc savage he said controlling his voice with an effort the commissioner said he would call you ive never met you sir and you are mr carberry doc stated yes and this is mrs carberry doc savage the woman gave him a tremulous smile her slight body shivered before doc could acknowledge the introduction another voice interrupted at its first note carberry stiffened and his arm fell away from his wifes shoulders his slightly protruding eyes of a lightbluish shade roved quickly desperately about the room doc was reminded of some scared animal in a trap holy cow ejaculated renny its coming from the bulky figure of the engineer barged across the room in the direction of the wide chimney doc laid a hand on rennys arm the voice had addressed itself to j afton carberry now it spoke with a sibilant ghostly cadence carberry now you have seen a demonstration of my power you have fortyeight hours i shall communicate with you at the expiration of that time i shall find you wherever you are i need your millions i know the police have appealed to doc savage this time he will fail for i am var rennys keen instinct for direction had been correct the voice was coming from the fireplace from the chimney a log blazed between the tiled sides heedless of the blaze doc thrust his body into the chimney opening looking upward he had the glimpse of a head silhouetted against the sky a shadowy shaggy head showering ashes and fire as he emerged into the room doc was at the outside door in a flowing stride the policeman at the door gaped after him he had hardly seemed to move but he was already at the corner of the house nearest the chimney from there doc seemed almost to float up the wall of the house the residence with its many slight projections was like a smooth road to the bronze man doc bounded onto the roof as he came erect lead pounded the overlapping slates at his feet an automatic was spitting fire from the opposite end of the mansion center gable but fast as the attacker had been doc was far to one side as the remaining slugs came higher in a searching stream then doc pivoted the ground was thirty feet below he poised only an instant then sprang outward he alighted with the cushioned ease of a body set on coiled springs gliding toward the corner of the house doc encountered two city coppers in uniform one was holding an automatic that still smoked he was saying i think i got the guy he fell off the roof doc halted the two men you just shot at a man on the roof sure said the cop i al good gosh its doc savage was that you up there i was on the roof observed doc did you see another man come down or running away i heard a noise up there said the cop but it must have been you i shot at i didnt see any other man renny was inside investigating the chimney the log fire had been drowned no marks appeared to show that anybody or anything had been in the chimney aperture carberry was sitting on a couch his wife still clung close to him what would you advise us to do mr savage carberry asked id take mrs carberry and go away as secretly as possible doc advised make it a point not to inform even your servants of your destination i hope within fortyeight hours we may have something more definite on this man who calls himself var doc and renny departed from the house doc slipped under the wheel of his car his intended destination was the nearest airport he had little hope of tracing the cold light plane but believed communication with some of the airports might give him a lead renny exclaimed look at this doc the engineer had noticed the leather flap of the side pocket was open and lifted as if to attract attention renny held two square white cards one was small the other large the larger card showed a printed message under the pencil ray of docs flashlight the small card bore words plainly written with bright blue ink there was no attempt to disguise the hand of the man who had written it admit bearer with password to inner circle i am var what do you make of it said renny read this replied doc passing over the larger card go at once to washington yellow house in th block on k street third from corner do not delay var will be there at am this morning he has tricked ham into meeting you there they will not kill monk until he has talked with you the password for the card is rav rules vars name reversed the card was unsigned under the pencil ray it showed stains of a brownish tinge doc was sure the fingerprints would be the same he had encountered twice before the man whose fingerprints were on the polished copper ball at the death house in the marsh had escaped the explosion chapter monk sneezes monk at this moment would have been relieved if he could have known of the new cards in doc savages possession but no hint had been given he was not to die before he talked with doc the enlarged microphone on the black switchboard seemed to wink at him ominously monk could almost hear it speaking with its own diaphragm talk go on and talk why dont you say something the thing seemed to be mocking him monk not only had no desire to talk now he was fairly sure he never would talk again he had no especial fear but he couldnt avoid looking at the two pointed knives he kept recalling how slowly they had been pushed into the slits that now faced his own gorillalike breast monk could see the movements of the men in the larger room with its unique oil paintings wheeze mcgovern had been giving orders for nearly half an hour monk was sweating wondering how long this phase of the little game was to be continued like doc and his other companions monk could read the lips of others when the men were facing him he could understand what they were saying as well as if they had been beside him so he understood when wheeze picked out six of his men and ordered them to washington wheeze picked up the telephone he was facing the glass door of the soundproof room monk read wheezes lips the moonfaced boss of this group of men was calling a telegraph office monk saw that he called himself doc savage wheeze was giving a message it was addressed to theodore marley brooks wheeze recited the message slowly monk quickly realized a trap was being set for his bickering lawyer companion ham the message as it was being given was telling ham to go at once to washington there he was to meet doc savage in a yellow house on k street the house was designated as the third house from the corner in the fourteenth block even as rage fairly sizzled through his veins monk made a mental note of the address he was amazed at the knowledge possessed by this wheeze it struck monk that doc and his friends must have been under some malevolent eye or rather many such eyes for considerable time before tonights flashing events for wheeze had the name of the hotel in manhattan where ham was attending a gathering of noted legal personages monk knew it because ham had ditched him on a theater date to go to this distinguished affair monk came then to the brink of apoplexy it was more than the big chemist could endure trying to maintain silence and keep his hide unpunctured the surge of blood to his head brought a sudden fierce desire to sneeze his huge arms were tightly locked in the robots terrible hollowed sheets of armor monks sneeze exploded loudly in the soundproof room the robots armor instantly vibrated somewhere close beside him a motor had started the fearful knives began their cruelly slow descent toward the slits over monks heart their needlelike points gleamed with wicked menace monk felt the arms of the metal man slowly drawing inward silence being no longer of consequence he released a flood of choice language slowly slowly the knives pushed inward toward the slits over his heart the motor pulling the inexorable arms with torturing delay kept up a steady whirring in the other room wheeze was standing with the gloating smile of some vile beast of prey two men remained with wheeze because of the soundproof doors monks unfortunate sneeze and his following outburst had been unnoticed at that instant the inwardly moving knives entered the slits their needle points touched monks shrinking skin they became painfully penetrating agony which he could no longer evade two or three minutes would be required before the slicing edges touched a vital spot when they did they would release a scarlet flood which could never be stopped by human agency but the knife points were never destined to reach monks heart the first touch freed all the electrifying rage so long pent up in the big chemists huge body his sudden bellow might have come from the snarling throat of some trapped jungle beast monk drew gallons of air into his capacious lungs his body swelled the mammoth shoulders were bowed and braced the long arms contracted and then expanded the slender rods of universal jointage necessary to operation of the robots arms were of strongest steel but after all they were by the requirements of space very slim monks giant arms driven by his released fury were gigantic in their expansion hold er ham he bellowed daggone it shyster im comin he voiced the truth the rods of slender steel were snapping they made cracking sounds as if a mans finger joints had been bent backward the ribbed fastenings of the metal man snapped asunder monk did not heed the rake of the knife points across his hardmuscled breast he did not even pause to regret the absence of his special bulletproof vest because he did not feel the slicing of his flesh the trickling of blood also went unnoticed for monk had torn loose the robots jointed arms he swung one in each ponderous hand wheeze and his men had been turned from the glass door of the soundproof room at the instant catastrophe overtook their torturing metal man they wheeled on their toes only when the apelike shape of monk crashed through the thick transparent plate one of the men whipped out an automatic and fired pointblank steelpointed slugs played jangling sparks of fire from one of the swinging metal arms in monks hands chewed lead stung one of the enraged chemists hairy ears a shot from the blazing automatic flew across the room and scarred one of the oil paintings it completely erased a fantastic conception of nonexistent marine life the thing was a slimy creature on oils half human half crab monk did not observe this despoilation of weird art one of his armored weapons had cracked the forearm bones of the man who had been shooting he was a giant of a fellow but he howled in agony and fell writhing to the floor wheezes other companion hurled a heavy vase off a table the improvised weapon shattered to bits across monks ironhard forehead a little blood trickled into the chemists eyes his other armored weapon struck this mans thigh bone he joined his brokenarmed partner in howling on the rich oriental rug wheeze had slipped through the smashed glass door something on the switchboard crackled with lurid blue flame shortcircuited wires blanked out the rooms were plunged into stygian darkness monk found his special generator flashlight the beam was pointed as a pencil he sent it roving about there was no sound then in the distance somewhere was a wheezing laugh a door slammed shut wheeze had escaped realizing the tricky affair of the concealed stairway they had used in bringing him in the house monk at once decided pursuit would be useless besides more important business confronted him he must get a warning to doc perhaps he could head off ham from starting for washington vainly monk jiggled the receiver bar of the phone the wire was dead wheeze had thoughtfully removed this means of communication his flight had been solely in the interest of saving his own hide apparently the battle in the penthouse monk had discovered his prison quarters to be such had been unheard by the residents of apartments in the twelvestory building the apartment directly underneath was vacant though its furnishing were rich the shorted wires from above had also plunged this place in darkness monk found and employed the concealed stairway he buzzed for an elevator the car was automatic monk made the street with a blankfaced doorman staring after him monk noted the apartment building was a block west of central park covering blocks with his rapid ungainly stride monk reached columbus circle though it was well after the hour for the broadway deluge of humanity at theater closing time monk found himself caught in a flowing river of men and women he marked this was not the usual aftertheater crowd of dressy individuals it was a crowd with a distinct disharmony of apprehension of fear in some their voices approaching terror a huskyvoiced newspaper vendor threaded through the human stream read all about it he bawled big explosion in manhattan var will blow up whole city block read it monk plowed his way to the man he snatched a paper howlin calamities he squealed ive gotta get to doc monk headed for a public phone booth he dialed the number of docs headquarters long toms voice came impatiently a call had instructed him to stand by for another message from doc the bronze man had said he would have some plans for long tom to work out in connection with a new machine he called an exneutralizer if it could be made to work doc wanted it to combat the cold light ray long tom saw a night of work ahead he wished the bronze chief were here to direct him instead of sending his instructions by phone he was relieved however to hear monks voice whereve you been demanded long tom what happened let it ride said monk wheres doc headed for washington replied long tom but heres renny hell talk ive got a job to do where in time have you renny began daggone it interrupted monk tell me something whats going on anyway this fellow who calls himself var has turned all hades loose obliged renny the latest is his announcement with that ghost voice of his that hes blowing up a whole city block in uptown manhattan at nine oclock in the morning thats today turned the voice loose in one of the newspaper editorial rooms the big towns gone batty over it you tellin me grunted monk wheres this blowup comin off over in the upper east side said renny giving an address only two blocks from the east river this var warned the police to clear the whole block of those who wanted to keep on living he said the blast would rock the town and destroy everything directly in its path said he doesnt want any loss of life daggone it renny rapped monk what are we coming to that monk docs in a red arrow transport plane called in by radiophone said if i found you were to get into that block var is planning to shoot off and see what we can find i dont know what were to look for but itll take me an hour to fight my way over there and see you when you get there cut in monk im on my way monk reached a taxicab by the simple expedient of hulking his ponderous body directly into the crowd news bulletins were running in the lights around a building near times square var announces the explosion in manhattan will take place at am he says it will be cut loose five minutes after the passing over manhattan of the washingtonnew york passengerandmail plane monks cab pulled away chapter trail of a shadow while monk was on his way to the menaced block in manhattan following doc savages instructions to his headquarters the man of bronze had taken up another trail rather doc had put himself directly in the way of a shadow he believed was watching his movements closely word of the new threat of the cold light over manhattan had caused the bronze giant to send renny to join long tom at headquarters at this time doc knew nothing of monks escape the ray of cold light causing the explosion at the home of j afton carberry had given the bronze man something definite with which to grapple docs intricate knowledge of all forms of electrical energy had taught him that some of the most potent electromagnetic forces could be lessened or neutralized altogether by the setting up of other similar but opposing rays or waves he had left long tom working upon an electrical experiment it came to him how a possible neutralizing force could be created to combat the mysterious cold light as exneutralizer that would be it as doc worked out this idea he was speeding toward the red arrow passenger airport he had instantly decided to follow the bidding of his mysterious messenger and go to the yellow house in washington ordinarily the bronze man would have used one of his own fast planes for the trip but he judged he was being closely shadowed by going directly to the passenger port of the red arrow he would be followed doubtless the emissary or enemy of var whichever he might be also would become a passenger on the plane from a concealed vantage after booking his seat the bronze man waited he saw all other passengers go aboard he smiled grimly as he watched the last man to take his seat then doc himself vanished into the wash room in a few seconds the plane would be taking off when it took the air no person remotely resembling doc savage was aboard in seat no on the righthand side of the red arrow passenger plane sat an ugly specimen of humanity nature had been unkind apparently in the beginning of the mans career he had been endowed with ropy towcolored hair and washedout paleblue eyes in size the man was of magnificent proportions except for the hunching of one shoulder and a malformation of his neck added to these marring features the mans nose had been broken and badly set his cheeks were puffed and had an unhealthy pallor in the no seat on the lefthand side of the plane a little man sat hunched into the big collar of an overcoat only the peak of his slouch hat was visible for more than half an hour this passenger had not moved the bucking of the plane in many of the air pockets was trying even to some of the veteran passengers suddenly in the recovery of a level keel something of minor importance happened in the pilots cabin a service wire in the passenger cabin was shortcircuited for the fraction of a second the mishap was sufficient to blow out a fuse gasps came from women passengers never mind came the calm voice of the trim stewardess its only a fuse the copilot will fix it the copilot pushed his way along the aisle in seat no the collarconcealed head of the little man slowly turned the movement brought a little scream from one of the women who had been chewing gum the homely mug in seat no was watching with interest the shock to the timid woman was amply justified for the eyes of the man in seat no glowed in the darkness with the luminous fire of a predatory cat prowling the night in them one other man in the plane read hatred colored by fear such as might cause the beady eyes of a rat to shine with desperation when cornered when the fuse was replaced and the lights came on the ugly mug from seat no got up and followed the copilot toward the control room what do you want growled the copilot passengers have got to stay in their seats hey nobodys allowed up in the ugly mug calmly disregarded the admonition pushing past he went through the little door inside concealed from the passengers he murmured a few words directly into the ear of the pilot at the controls never mind skip it barked the pilot at his scowling partner take a seat in back a few minutes its o k the puzzled copilot went back and slipped into seat no the paleeyed brokennosed passenger had slipped into the copilots seat and pulled on the radio earphones for the space of some eight or ten minutes this strange substitute for the regular man at the secondary controls seemed very much at home as he talked into the phone his gloved hands played automatically on the control wheel any person would have supposed he was a flier the veteran red arrow pilot was not even supposing he knew well enough the man with the broken nose was a better flier than he would be if he lived a couple of centuries his conversation to the ground finished the ugly mug relinquished his place thanks he said to the pilot ill remember the favor the copilot still scowled as he came up to swap places with the extraordinary passenger who could so readily make hash of all the rules but the passenger did not notice this he was without seeming to do so absorbing every visible detail of the little man in seat no from this position it could be seen that the man whose eyes had been luminous in the darkness was rather an inconsequential personality every article of clothing appeared to have been worn to the point of dissolution his hat brim was soiled and frayed his overcoat collar was faded and threaded out the mans collar looked sawedged this scraggly appearance was continued to the mans person his hair was stringy and uneven his face was hatchetthin with an oddly turnedup nose the chin was longpointed and stubbly with beard the mans adams apple rambled up and down he displayed no interest in what was transpiring in the plane in his now normal eyes was a disappointed look the man he had come aboard to find had not appeared the scrambledfaced passenger returned to seat no when the cabin radio started staccato bulletins of the menace hovering over manhattan the man seemed to have dropped into a doze the scraggly little man in seat no was the last person to alight from the plane at the washington airport he scrutinized each of his fellow passengers hopefully as they passed him with a grunt of disappointed resignation he climbed from the plane walking over to the information desk he inquired has any other passenger plane or private crate from new york landed in the past hour yes a white liner came in half an hour ago the girl said the little mans face brightened some he went toward the taxicab stand with short hopping steps entering a taxi he rode only to the first darkly shadowed avenue leaning forward he handed the driver a dollar and said keep moving im leaving you here he was back among the trees when another taxicab came from the direction of the airport and turned the corner following the first car the luminous eyes shone more brightly as this cab passed had me fooled all right he muttered but i guess this puts me one up on him when the first of the taxicabs stopped and turned after proceeding a couple of blocks the brokennosed man in the second cab observed that it was empty expected he would do that the man remarked to himself all right driver take me to dupont circle ill walk the rest of the way the open radius known as dupont circle was not far distant from a yellow house in the fourteenth block on k street this yellow house in washington was before the day was very old to become a rendezvous for several mysterious figures with doc savage already near this house in a guise which had passed him on the red arrow plane ham summoned by a faked telegram and monk aware of the trick the identity and intentions of the scraggly little man remained an enigma and while monk was delaying a possible effort to assist ham in order to investigate the threat of a new explosion in manhattan still another puzzling figure was planning a trip to washington this last man had been pacing the floor of a palatial apartment during the greater part of the night he was walking restlessly up and down at the time the blast shook the home of j afton carberry this apartment was near the west side of central park the man was known as charles arthur vonier noted explorer vonier had heard radio announcements of the carberry explosion there had been a police report saying that even the redoubtable doc savage was baffled that the police commissioner believed the blasts were planned by some scientist who was remarkably sane vonier had switched off this report impatiently and id counted on doc savage to he broke off the muttered phrase vonier was an emaciated seemingly bloodless man his thin sensitive nose was a single arching bone with tautly drawn skin covering it his eyes were set under projecting caverns of his bony skull but they were intensely blue and coldly direct even now under apparent stress that made his bony hands fumble the eyes were unflickering a spread newspaper on the table headlined the new jersey log cabin explosion vonier opened a library table drawer and drew out a sheet of paper on it were scrawled words in bright blue ink the explorer sucked his lips between teeth protruding from his skeletonhard jaws he folded the paper and placed it in his pocket picking up the desk tray of pens and ink he selected a bottle the tray was of old soft gold done in finely wrought hand carvings it was reminiscent of the workmanship of one of the lost though highly civilized mountain folk of indochina vonier let a single drop of the ink fall from the bottle on a square of white paper the color was brightest blue the strange trick of circumstance sometimes will involve the most innocent he murmured doc savages microscopic eyes never would overlook a detail like that he replaced the bottle with his smile becoming whimsical apparently a vein of humor lay under the explorers unappealing exterior a womans dress rustled vonier arose to greet his wife im glad you came in my dear he said i can delay no longer it is necessary that i make personal contact with doc savage at once the womans voice was throaty but calm do you think its best she said i cant quite understand why you must see him mrs vonier was slender of figure as revealed by the silken gown of scarlet her features were clearcut and regular ive discovered it is always best to strike the first blow to meet an enemy before he gets himself set stated the explorer i have been busy doc savage will be on his way to washington i shall see him there you will be careful the woman pleaded after all the dangers you have bosh interrupted vonier doc savage must have the message the news will have it that the bronze wizard is baffled by these strange explosions as usual the news is undependable vonier called a private air field it was apparent he was ordering one of his own planes tuned up for a quick takeoff to washington as he was preparing to depart the phone buzzed the call was long distance it was from washington from voniers words some special emergency had arisen in his affairs before he replaced the receiver he said i shall take care of that i am just preparing to leave for washington chapter monks sweet tooth about the time the plane of charles arthur vonier was being prepared for a quick flight to washington monk was impatiently pursuing his investigation on the east side he had discovered the warning of the threatened explosion had created pandemonium there was the block where the fiendish var had announced the cold light would strike at nine oclock of the following morning a few policemen were being overrun in their effort to keep order without resorting to the use of their sticks occupants of many surroundings blocks were joining the general exodus there were perhaps some two hundred families living in this sixstory block the street level housed small shops all of the several hundred persons involved seemed determined to be the first out with their various belongings monk to gain entry kept close to the police the squad had discovered nothing that savored of a planted explosive monk aroused the policemens interest when he produced his pocket chemical laboratory with a colorless liquid an instantaneous reagent chemical monk made a quick analysis of each spot on the walls or elsewhere when it seemed the stain had been recently made he was aware that some of the most deadly explosive could be employed in liquid form perhaps even in the character of some powerful chemical that could be dried and still continue to send forth some vaporous element for many hours after several efforts however monk wondered if all the scores of families in the block threw cups of coffee at each other a booming voice announced renny had arrived on the trail of monk when the big engineer swung his many pounds of brawn through a door monk was preparing to depart he had been through all the block docs worked out an idea to stop that cold light ray renny told monk doc explained it to long tom by radiophone from a red arrow plane on the way to washington now why would doc go by one of the passenger planes wondered monk dont know but its my guess hes laying a trap for somebody said renny anyway this thing he calls an exneutralizer may stop the explosions if long tom can get the right gadgets together long tom at the moment was attempting to step up an electrical current to sufficient power for creation of an electromagnetic exneutralizer on the principal of the hertzian wave long tom was familiar with the practical application of the hertzian wave or ray it had been employed for the killing of airplane motors at a distance no place remained where it seemed likely the smallest sort of bomb could have been hidden renny and monk agreed the explosive force of var was carried in his mysterious terrible cold light ill stick here an see if the cops give it another going over said renny youve got me worrying about ham all he ever carries is that trick sword cane an if they stick him in some robot like you say you were in he wouldnt have much use for a cane monk chewed thoughtfully on a gumdrop some child had left a paper bag of the candy on a sink drainboard in the hasty exodus the thought of ham in the hands of vars ruthless agents turned the candy suddenly bitter in monks mouth daggone it nothin even tastes right complained monk and he spat out the gumdrop monk stopped on his way to the hudson river warehouse hangar where docs private planes were kept to phone long tom again long tom replied impatiently no nothing new he said monk took off from the hudson river in one of docs fastest amphibian planes the cabin craft shot across the murky night sky at a speed of nearly three hundred miles an hour monk felt somewhat ill he attributed this to apprehension for the safety of ham he had a bitter taste in his mouth it had been there since he had left renny with the police on the east side the big chemist had the feeling he had overlooked something vitally important in the block threatened by the cold light he felt it was something he should have recognized anyway the sooner he got to doc the quicker the thing might appear docs uncanny power to read the thoughts and reactions of his five companions had been the salvation of monk on many occasions it was much the same with the giant fistslinging renny doc had extricated renny and monk from many hazardous spots in the east slight streamers of light were telling of an early dawn the dawn over manhattan that was the beginning of a chaotic day monk had planned to leave docs plane at a washington airport and there take a taxicab to the vicinity of the address he had heard wheeze mcgovern give in the telegram sent to ham over the suburbs of the capital city monk angled to a lower altitude on half throttle the small plane skimmed along a couple of hundred feet above the tops of the trees suddenly monk angled even lower a blotch of bright yellow had appeared among the greenery monk took one of docs own inventions an electronic glass or rather powerful binoculars created by doc on the electronic principle the lenses of this telescopic device not only brought distant scenes close to the eyes but they also amplified them in the vision much the same as radio tones are amplified for the listener by the loudspeaker one look through the glasses as he held the little plane in a tight spiral and monk growled in his throat howlin calamities he barked i got here just in time hold em you daggoned shyster im comin monk shoved the plane into a dive the staccato thunder of its direct drop awakened hundreds of washingtonians before their usual hour of arising chapter hams in a jam brigadier general theodore marley brookss arrival in washington somewhat preceded the coming there of doc savage and of monk if ham had called docs headquarters after receiving the bogus telegram from wheeze mcgovern the outcome might have been different ham was a natty figure as he yawned his way from a passenger plane he was wearing a spiffy topcoat with a light hat pulled with jaunty effect over one eye he swung what appeared to be a light walking stick in reality it was the sheath for a sword blade of the finest steel several inches of the sword tip covered with an anaesthetic drug the smallest prick with the point was sufficient to render an opponent temporarily insensible ham at this moment knew little of the var explosions only the radio report of the carberry blast and the warnings of the expected attack upon manhattan had reached him though uninformed of his companions connection with the rapidly developing menace ham suspected this sudden call in the night might have some connection with it ham left the airport in a taxicab he gave dupont circle as an address close to the residence where he had been instructed to appear it was somewhat puzzling why doc should have commanded a meeting at the unearthly hour of four oclock in the morning ham alighted at dupont circle and made his way toward k street the yellow house was anything but modest its goldenyellow bulk affronted its more decorous neighbors heavy curtains were drawn at the windows but knifelike lines of brilliant light appeared at the edges a dim light burned in the entrance hall the front door was set in a deep alcove approached by a wide porch hams step was light as he crossed the porch his fingers twiddled the cane in a flourishing circle it was the mistake of an unseen man that he growled a command to others instead of attacking silently hams reaction to the menacing voice was instant his heavy cane was traveling in a vicious arc before he had seen any person or any movement the swinging cane rapped the man flatly across one ear the man grunted once and slipped to his knees ham bounced the cane from the fallen one to a spot above a white face that loomed up from the alcove a ringing rap of metal on hard bone and a howl of pain was the response if all of his unexpected assailants had been on the one side ham might have disposed of the four who had been in ambush but two others were behind him ham heard their rush and attempted to draw the rapier blade from its sheath a hardknuckled fist struck his spine a paralyzing blow at the base of his skull a sinuous arm enwrapped his throat snapping his head backward the dim light in the entrance hallway danced then it went out completely the light came back but now it was a painful glare against hams aching eyes the lawyer was seated in an oldfashioned chair of the victorian period before he looked into the faces of his captors he noted the big room was furnished with articles antique collectors like to call early american ham guessed shrewdly this old washington home had either been leased or purchased furnished for whatever purpose the gang surrounding him intended using it glancing at the nearest men he quickly revised the thought of a gang ham counted eleven men voices of others sounded from another room in the rear quite a reception committee ham drawled one man with mild blue eyes blinked behind thick lenses i cant say exactly what the chief may want he volunteered you will be given a message later you are to be informed that you are at the mercy of var your friend the chemist you call monk has been in vars hands for several hours the chief instructed you were to be told that monk will be destroyed by the armored robot in which he is now imprisoned if you refuse to do exactly as you are told your leader doc savage has been rendered helpless hams keen face sobered at the reference to monk the mans words were too sincerely spoken to have been an invention but at the statement doc had been rendered helpless ham grinned the speaker withdrew and the men swung into small groups they talked in low tones hams eyes had been busy every minute he had been speaking his sword cane still intact he noted was only a few feet away in a corner two buttons controlling the lights were plainly in view on the wall a little to one side of the cane more than hams eyes had been at work for him on the middle finger of his right hand was what appeared to be a gold ring of heavy pattern concealed by his back ham had crossed his pliant fingers one crossed finger pressed a spot in the head of the ring ham suppressed a grimace a sharp tiny blade had darted along his palm and the wrist above it but the blade operated on the spring forming the inside of the gold ring had darted inside the cord tying his wrists together and in turn his body to the heavy chair the deft finger worked rapidly the spring recoiled and the blade dropped back again it was sent darting along his palm ham knew blood was oozing from the cut in his hand he maneuvered to keep its dripping from being noticed by pulling his hands well upon the chairs cushion the cord parted there were still several wrappings to be sliced the front door buzzer burred viciously ham risked severing an artery with his swift play of the blade of the ring he was still tightly held as four men moved in a group toward the door it will be vars messenger but take no chances warned one of the men i wouldnt know if it were var himself growled another ive never seen him none of us have except wheeze the first man replied but make sure of the password and the card the four men were in the hallway the eyes of all the others were fixed in that direction hams hands were slippery with blood but he was free he waited tensely until he heard the outer doors bolt being drawn now or never he decided heaving his body forward he kicked the heavy chair sidewise it caught the nearest man in the stomach hams lithe figure reached the wall one hand was clicking the light buttons as the other grasped the sword cane the room was plunged into darkness one of the buttons had also switched off the dim light in the entrance hallway the outer door had opened and a heavy voice had muttered rav rules for three or four seconds no one moved except the man who had got the chair in his stomach ham grinned to himself over his temporary advantage though dawn was breaking outside the heavy draperies over the windows excluded all light ham played his sword blade sharp as a razor in experimental thrusts the point contacted a yielding body a man grunted with pain he thumped to the floor on his face this terminated the breathless suspense ham could hear the rush of bodies his sword blade became a darting tongue it barely pinked two more men a couple of others fell over this pair as they went down look out cried a voice hes got the sword out of that cane one man started dragging back a curtain to let in light another man knocked him aside keep em closed you fool he commanded get him quick the order was easily given laying hands upon the waspish elusive figure of the fencing lawyer was much more difficult one man had filled his hand with a silenced automatic a yellowishblue tongue of fire licked across the room at that instant one man became distinctly visible to ham or rather his eyes could be seen they seemed to float into the room without a body they glowed with the luminosity of a cats eyes on the prowl at night put up that gun said a highpitched strident voice he isnt to be hurt understand the gun ceased to flame the eyes came directly toward ham as if their owner could see the lawyer plainly in the darkness a door opened toward the rear of the house faint light from somewhere above revealed a narrow stairway ham shifted sidewise and pinked another man two of the gang rushed and collided with each other ham was backing toward the narrow stairway he figured if he could reach it he could stand off an army as long as the order held against shooting him the room he was leaving was filled with milling men seeking him in the darkness the luminous eyes floated to one side apparently this man was withdrawing the eyes vanished ham had his feet on the bottom stair here he could be plainly seen he started backing slowly upward from the gloom of the space ham had just vacated came an eerie mellow sound it was like the low piping note of some rare tropical bird the softly whistled cadence filled all the rooms for an interval of a few seconds who did that rasped a voice the short puzzled oaths following filled ham with elation doc savage was among the men in that room none had ever before heard the peculiar emanation of sound that came from the bronze man the realization of docs presence strengthened ham whirling the sword point he retreated up the stairs a dozen men crowded after him but carefully maintained a discreet distance ham found two more flights and backed up these one of the men below him laughed let him go he ordered he cant get off the roof well have him wheres the little persuader ham had determined to make a stand in the narrow stairway below the skylight leading to the roof only one man at a time could reach him he had hoped he would be safe nothing but bullets would ever get past the shimmering sword blade something did get past it this was the little persuader the man had mentioned ham was smiling he was really enjoying his position especially since he was aware doc was at hand at any instant he expected a tornado to break loose he waited hopefully prepared to launch himself downward as soon as doc went into action ham could picture the amazement when the bronze man exploded in the midst of these men not even the gigantic renny or the apelike monk was half the equal of doc when he started using his mighty fists but the group clustered at the foot of the stairs remained intact suddenly there was a sizzling stream ascending it was being shot from a small circular affair such as would hold a steel tape line ham gasped he was compelled to use his left arm to shield his face and eyes ammonia fumes were clogging his nostrils he couldnt breathe then he heaved himself upward and his shoulder carried away the window sash of the skylight inhaling a long breath ham bounded to the roof as other feet pounded on the stairs ham sprang to one side he was confident he would discover a nearby tree or some other means of descending from the fourstory roof he realized his mistake too late he should have held his opponents at the top of the narrow stairway now some ten men were in the open on the roof they were grimly determined on recapturing their prisoner half the men carried short clubs and other improvised weapons ham spotted a chimney and backed up to it his enemies ringed him closely in the dawning light they were able to keep clear of his flying sword ham was deliberately refraining from taking the offensive doc was there somewhere he wished he knew docs plans the bronze adventurer always had carefully calculated reasons for his every action that doc had done no more than apprize ham of his presence was proof he had some definite goal ham wished he knew more to guide his own play he scrutinized the faces around him we was fairly sure two persons were missing from the ring of men now closing in from the stairs came a highpitched voice there was a scuffling sound a body bumped in the hallway below the roof almost at once an ugly malformed face appeared in the skylight a deep voice complained some guy down there made a mistake he swung for me but when i tried to grab him he got away its all right gobo ejaculated one of the men quickly that probably was scraggs i was taking you to him when this sword slinger broke loose come here and help grab this fellow the hulking man who came onto the roof had puffed unhealthy cheeks his towcolored hair was matted and his nose was broken of all the men ham had seen this was the only one who had the marks of being a bruiser ham smiled inwardly he knew this man to be doc savage ham knew now whence the whistle had come it had been this mans voice at the entrance giving the password rav rules without glancing at ham the new arrival said circle the chimney and get him from behind the chief said he didnt want him injured he wants to use him ham judged he should make a final pretense of fighting his way out then permit himself to be overwhelmed the bronze man had not looked at him directly in fact doc was warily closing in on him from behind ham deliberately pinked another man then a club was flung at him his sword arm took the blow and ham staggered low overhead a small airplane suddenly roared in a dive it was monk coming in from new york after sighting the vividly yellow house monk pulled docs small amphibian into a tight spiral two maple trees grew beside the fourstory house they were spaced so near each other their leafy branches seemed to be interlaced monk drew in one long breath shifted the plane elevators and dived he clicked off the ignition as the trees the house and the lawn leaped up to meet the hurtling plane with wind screaming in the wires the diving ship thrust between the trees the silvery wings stripped off the speed of the cabinet fuselage was slightly checked the next instant monk was being carried through the wall of the yellow house with the speed of a stone thrown from a catapult the forward part of the cabin was crushed through this aperture the body of monk continued onward monks rebound to his feet was fast it was as if his ungainly body were made of rubber he was in an upper room of the house dashing through the first doorway monk glimpsed two men dropping down the stairway from the roof each carried a short club the big chemists cry was one of delight one man threw his club he was not quick enough monks long arms had reached the men were of average size both were taller than monk but their heads took the impact of the hallway wall at the same instant monk had heaved one over each shoulder plaster and laths scattered under the blows from their skulls monks broad shoulders filled the narrow stairway and the skylight he gained the roof two other men were quick enough one with his fists and another with the flat side of an automatic pistol they hammered at monks head as he came up the chemists breath hissed through his teeth he caught an ankle and twisted once the owner squealed with pain and dropped the gun back in manhattan monk had been given no chance to replace the supermachine pistol wheezes men had taken from him now he caught up the automatic from the roof he was about to shoot at another man rushing toward him but he refrained there now were only six men on the roof around ham monk contented himself with rushing into the attackers the automatic swinging as a club to monks disgusted amazement ham had dropped the point of his sword you would bust in on a gentlemens party came sharply from ham cant that ape brain of yours understand when one is just practicing monks short legs pivoted him to a stop his homely face went blank with amazement well ill be flabbergasted he jerked out you tricky lowdown shyster now what are you hams surprising words pulled his eyes away from his closest enemy one of the short clubs smacked him viciously behind the ear monk folded to his knees and fell forward his hard skull had barely resisted the impact his senses had faded out ham groaned he hadnt meant that to happen he had hoped to see monk seized but it was too late for regret now the brokennosed man with the washedout blue eyes had glided swiftly between monk and the man with the club dont hit him again he commanded in a guttural threat that got instant respect the chief doesnt want these fellows hurt it had been docs unspoken order that had caused ham to prevent monk from finishing the job of cleaning up the roof ham had seen the lips of the brokennosed man moving just as monk sprang into the encounter he had read the brief message all of docs men were expert lip readers doc had said hold it ham stop monk let them take you escape police we want var doc believed he was on a trail that would lead quickly to the cold light murderer perhaps they could discover var in time to avert the menace over manhattan chapter var blinds his trail ham and monk securely bound were shoved into two closed cars there were three cars in waiting these leaped away along an alley ham and monk were unloaded at the rear of an isolated tumbledown house at the northern edge of washington nine men with doc had accompanied the cars behind these cars trailing them until the prisoners had been taken inside was a small battered roadster the driver of this car was the little man with the scraggly face and clothes he halted his small car a block away and made his way cautiously forward unseen he slipped through a window into the basement of the old house in the darkness of the cellar his eyes took on the luminous propensities of a prowling cat keeping to his role doc savage saw monk and ham deposited temporarily in a small room with boarded windows the other men assembled in a larger room with cheap rough furnishings high narrow windows gave forth a little light as ham was dumped unceremoniously on the floor doc made an excellent pretense of handling him roughly at the same time he was whispering follow all instructions these men mean nothing they seem expecting this var himself ham was astute enough to play his part though docs role of the brokennosed thug had been a surprise his actions had been cleverly carried out the men of the var ring apparently were unsuspecting docs swift analysis of their character led him to believe that several were far more intelligent than the average type of criminal the bronze man was confronted with the problem of being almost sure two or three had never before engaged in a crooked enterprise it made their association with var all the more puzzling all had the air of expectant waiting this was suddenly rewarded by the tones of a highpitched voice this came from a ventilator leading up from the basement brothers of the ring our action here has been deferred the chief has decided to wait until after the cold light has fallen upon new york then doc savages man will receive the message he is to deliver to the white house the manhattan explosion will make certain a commission will be formed as var wishes coming from doc savage the word to the white house will be impressive enough to gain attention bring in this man ham hams legs were now tightly bound as well as his arms he was carried in and placed in a chair doc unostentatiously shifted his position closer to a door he had marked as leading to the cellar of the old house he was convinced he knew the owner of that voice his character study brought before him a skinny neck in which a nervous adams apple would be jumping up and down doc knew these men never had seen their chief the man called var the strangely delivered message was the first direct link that seemed to connect with the perpetrator of the cold light explosions the voice spoke again briefly five of you will remain here to guard the prisoners the others will go at once to the place designated we will then the speech was cut off abruptly by a smash of docs mighty fist a panel of the locked basement door was shattered to splinters the door was of ancient flimsy construction the lock was torn loose and went flying down the basement stairway though the bronze man apparently made no leap his feet were on the damp concrete floor of the cellar when the lock banged with a ringing sound his surprising movement and his quickness converted the room he had just left into roaring confusion in the basements gloom doc flashed the searching ray of his generator flashlight his other hand held a stupefying capsule no larger than a small glass pill he located the coldair shaft leading from the dead furnace doc had expected to see the figure of the scraggy little man crouched somewhere close by he was surprised to see no one swinging the light around he discovered the small basement room seemed to be empty one more glance was sufficient to reveal the clever trick performed by this elusive emissary of the man var the coldair pipe had been dislodged close to the outer wall of the foundation one stone had been removed the aperture led into the ventilator located in the room above vars messenger had apparently been crouched on the ground outside the house the man had ceased speaking when the basement door crashed he had vanished so swiftly doc could not hear his running feet before doc could reach the stairs the men above were descending upon him doc flipped a gas capsule and it fell at the feet of the foremost man but the rush carried the men over the gas before it could become effective the bronze man was holding his own breath then an automatic pistol slashed its blaze into the gloomy basement and a sizzling stream of ammonia searched for docs eyes and nostrils with his eyes tightly closed doc charged directly into the members of vars ring though he was not breathing the ammonia was pungent in his nostrils two men crashed into opposite walls under fists so fast and so effective they had no chance to use their weapons against them but one man had fallen locking his arms around docs legs the bronze man staggered he was free in an instant and the other man had rolled over limply docs thumb had simply pressed into a clotted nerve group in the ringsters neck the man would be paralyzed for several minutes five men in all cluttered the basement floor as the bronze man reached the top of the short stairway in a determined effort to free himself and go to docs aid ham had succeeded only in upsetting the chair he was squirming on the floor as doc reached him a car roared away outside doc sprang to a window in the space of seconds he was back and had sliced the cords from hams arms and legs the other room doc gasped ham theyve done something to monk if theyve put him out ill run them to the end of the world but apparently the men who had escaped had not put monk out they had taken him with them the room was empty doc and ham got to the outside two of the three closed cars were still there but the hoods of both motors were thrown open the ignition wires had been ripped loose from the instrument boards the fleeing car was just disappearing on a side road headed in the direction of the city docs deduction was almost instant wherever they had monk a prisoner he saw too much he stated var needs your legal experience for some purpose ham but this probably upsets his idea hell go ahead now with that explosion in manhattan we must return at once but how about monk doc i could make a try at doc looked thoughtfully into the sky to the eastward im very sure monk right now is on his way back to new york he stated he did not explain his reason for believing this before they had reached a corner where a taxicab could be summoned the thin glass shells had been removed from over the eyes of flaky gold their hypnotic pools again stirred with little whirlwinds doc was thinking the luring of ham and then himself to washington had been for the purpose of making sure they would not be in manhattan at nine oclock this morning the taxicab was rushing toward the airport doc saw he would have just time to catch the plane that would arrive in new york at the time set by var for the explosion of the city block he said to ham youll wait and take the white liner back it arrives an hour after the red arrow if there is a little man on board with a ragged haircut and a loose adams apple we want to know where he goes his clothes are as ragged as his hair and if you happen to hear him speak it will likely be the voice that came through the ventilator would that be the one i heard them call scraggs ham suggested the name would fit and you couldnt miss him said doc hell be on one or the other of the planes docs conjecture was partly correct the scraggly little man at that moment was preparing to board a plane but it was neither the red arrow nor the white liner vonier the explorer was in the waiting room at the red arrow airport his intense blue eyes lighted a little when his gaze automatically followed the turning of all faces toward the big man who came unhurriedly through the wide doors i can well believe all the adventures credited to him murmured the explorer he looks like a bad one to get in anybodys soup ten seconds later vonier added again to himself its almost unbelievable but id bet my last dollar doc savage knows ive been waiting here in the hope of catching him and he hasnt even seemed to glance this way this was true the smooth bronzed face had not once turned in the explorers direction the eyes of flaky gold had not appeared to have observed any person in particular then doc walked across the big room and stopped before vonier a man ive always wanted to meet the bronze man stated as if introductions already had been effected your paper on your last trip into the arctic afforded me great pleasure im glad to meet you here vonier you came here to meet me did you not vonier fixed him with a steady gaze then he glanced down his thin nose and shook his head that savors of the occult savage he smiled no other person on earth except my wife knew i had it in mind to find you in washington are you a mind reader not at all vonier doc smiled in return by this time all manhattan is stirred by something of which it never before heard that is cold light you are one of perhaps only seven men in new york who has seen cold light even though it is of a far different variety the other six men are my five closest companions and myself yes assented vonier that is true but how would that give you such absolute certainty you knew we had visited months ago the caverns of the strange race in the arctic ice field added doc you had learned that we have been drawn into the mystery of the man called var perhaps you have learned something you believe i should know vonier laughed shortly a note of uneasiness he glanced around as if making certain they could not be overheard it may sound simple enough to you doc savage but the average man would suspect you of being linked up with the supernatural however it is something more vital to me than you think something that impelled me to reach you as quickly as possible then youve had a message from this var doc stated it is perhaps his idea that he can use your vast knowledge vonier spread his thin bony bands i give it up he said probably you know all that is in the message hardly that the bronze man smiled but weve only two minutes i must be in new york at nine i knew that and it was why i was waiting here vonier said as soon as we are aboard the plane ill show you the note that has kept me awake and which seemed unbelievable until last night i am threatened with death if i do not join vars organization the pilot grinned down at doc savage as he climbed aboard because of an emergency the same flier was taking the early morning red arrow plane back to the newark airport vonier had maneuvered a seat next to the one doc had thoughtfully reserved on his arrival in washington the seat just ahead of doc was vacant he thought the passenger had missed the plane if it had been engaged for the door was being closed then the door reopened and a breathless man came in the pulsing blood had reddened the bald spot between tufts of white hair doc recalled that only a few hours before that same bald spot had been the color of gray chalk the man was carberry the retired financier carberrys palebluish eyes slightly protruding seemed to jump with recognition at the sight of doc savage he extended one thin blueveined hand i wish id have known you were in washington doc savage he exclaimed id have asked you to go with me to the federal agents even with all that has happened the government agents dont want to take this thing seriously j afton carberry was shaking his hands jerked continuously he had apparently not noticed the explorer vonier until the latter had spoken i believe weve met carberry he remarked you may recall i had occasion to congratulate you on your book dealing with the origin of species yes oh yes admitted carberry that is right we were on the same program at the museum however vonier ive never taken my own theories seriously ive made a hobby of many curious things after a mans made his money thats about all he has left doc apparently was watching the preparation for the takeoff he was studying both men they were the direct opposites of each other vonier might perish in any one of countless ways but his nerve never would be shaken carberry was of a volatile disposition the menace over him had apparently unnerved him to the point of physical discomfort his blueveined hands continued shaking i thought you had planned to take mrs carberry away suggested doc yes oh yes i have the financier replied she is perfectly safe where she is ill admit though im gravely concerned over this thing this man vars a dangerous maniac thats not my idea disagreed vonier so far as ive learned it his scheme of destruction is too perfectly planned in detail to be the work of a lunatic carberry seemed to be fumbling for a reply the red arrow plane had taken off and circled with the wind on its tail it was already making up the lost time of departure in the direction of manhattan then came the voice thin but stridently clear it filled the space of the passenger cabin doc savage carberry vonier eyes of those in the seats leaped from one to another all had heard of vars mystic warnings vonier looked steadily at doc savage a slight smile on his lips there had been a pause in the voice yes doc savage he said calmly i think this var is dangerously sane chapter death over manhattan in the passenger cabin the first excited murmuring of the inmates hushed only the steady beat of the motors could be heard then the voice again this is my final warning doc savage you will forget what you have learned one of your men is in my hands vonier and carberry you will do as already instructed this is my final word for i am var the voice seemed everywhere it had the elusive quality of direction which a good ventriloquist imparts docs hypnotic eyes had observed vonier and carberry in turn carberry was shaking as if with palsy vonier was calmly rubbing one finger along his thinly arching nose then doc was on his feet swiftly he directed the stewardess go through every article of the womens baggage there were four women aboard ill take the men myself the stewardess hesitated the broadfaced pilot had given the controls over to the copilot his mirror had shown the excited movement in the cabin though he had not heard the voice taking a cue from the attitude of the stewardess a male passenger started to say by what right have you youll do as doc savage directs snapped the pilot he has full police authority on the red arrow lines the bronze mans hunt was quick but thorough the stewardess aided as best she could doc and the others missed seeing a hand steal through a twoinch opening of a window ventilator a small object started on a mile drop to the gliding earth below vonier suddenly exclaimed glancing at his wrist watch were a little late arent we pilot its two minutes to nine oclock the pilot moving back toward his cabin sighted through a window the sky needles of manhattan were shining in the brilliant sun only a few miles ahead ten minutes or so off schedule the pilot grinned weve been held up a little figured maybe you folks would appreciate a grandstand seat in the sky for the big blowoff down there if there is one clearly the pilot was doubtful of the reason for all the madness in manhattan for heavens sake man gasped carberry you mean well be over manhattan at nine oclock correct brother the pilots grin broadened it oughta be worth an extra fare id say we are in the safest possible spot stated vonier calmly perhaps said doc savage vonier leaned closer to him when we get down savage he said in a low tone i believe i have something new on the formula for cold light id like you to see it the explorers lips were drawn back from his skeleton hard jaws even with his coolness the smile was gruesomely reminiscent of a bony deathshead ill appreciate that greatly doc replied doc savage during the flight to washington had worked out and transmitted to long tom the formula for creating the exneutralizer with which he planned to combat the destructive cold light while in the role of the brokennosed man he had employed the planes radiophone to good advantage his instructions to long tom had been detailed and explicit doc had brought an advanced theory into practical working form with less than an hour of thinking back in manhattan long tom was at work in the creation of a machine that would build a wall doc had enlarged upon an idea of a ray to meet a ray he had so analyzed the explosion at the home of j afton carberry as to become positive it had a double origin from some inexplicable source perhaps from the magnetized earth itself a gigantic destructive force had leaped to meet the ray of cold light therefore a neutralizing ray to clash with that other ray in its deathdealing path would hardly be sufficient doc judged the force must be something more like a wall that would be the answer an electromagnetic wall which the cold light ray could neither penetrate nor cross just now with the red arrow plane flying toward the sky line of manhattan at a speed of more than two miles a minute doc was hoping long tom might have the new machine ready for its first test and the explorer vonier was calmly telling him he had something new to offer on the formula of cold light the bronze man studied the intensely blue eyes of the man voniers eyes were the exact shade of the bright blue ink on the passport card that had admitted him to vars inner organization an aquamarine blue the kind of a blue that only the occasional artistic genius can capture in oils on a canvas the financier carberry his thin lips twitching also was observing vonier closely though voniers words regarding the formula had been directed at doc only carberrys straining ears had caught them the financier apparently was in that state of extreme fear which led him to suspect any person who might be familiar with such mysterious elements as cold light as the island of manhattan swam closer with the broad hudson widening into the harbor below the red arrow plane was between five and ten minutes behind its schedule the goodhumored pilot angled the plane lower it was exactly nine oclock around the red arrow passenger plane the sky was empty plainly other pilots were not interested in occupying grandstand seats for the explosion the police commissioner taking every precaution had issued an explicit order grounding all aircraft in the manhattan area but that order had failed to reach the red arrow pilot apparently another pilot also had disregarded it but this second plane was at so great an altitude as to be indistinguishable against the sun from the ground level if it was seen at all it appeared as only a possible tiny black speck in the observers eye it was a small plane and it was flying at an altitude of more than four miles high as carberry announced the time as nine oclock a steelyblue ray knifed downward from the higher heavens though the daylight was clear this spikelike band could be plainly seen it struck instantly all the way to the earth below crowds back of police lines blocks from the heart of the threatened area gasped to these hundreds of thousands of spectators it seemed as if the fiendish hand of the destroyer above had directed the cold light ray directly upon the red arrow passenger plane the hushed crowds saw this simultaneously a chilling blast of air swept across all of the central manhattan area the normal breathing of the terrorridden but curious multitude of citizens was sharply interrupted the air was sucked upward in a mighty cyclonic whirlwind then the air came slapping back with the force of some tangible substance thousands of those closest to the explosion area would have been blown from their feet had not the packed mass of the crowd kept them erect the whole sea of upturned faces seemed to rock in a slow rippling wave as individuals fought to maintain their balance the sixstory block designated by var instantly ceased to exist in its place arose an intense blue cloud this was seen by those at a distance as a gigantic pyramid with a pointed apex reaching toward the sky the blueness of the sky seemed dim in comparison to the color of the geometrically formed blast of vapor from this leaping single tongue wreckage spewed over many surrounding blocks the island of manhattan swayed new york was given a brief demonstration of what it feels like to be caught in an earthquake in the red arrow plane doc savage has seen the first flash of the cold light so highly keyed were the reactions of the bronze mans senses he had seen something so clearly that he had arrived at a new conclusion in the infinitesimal part of a second some force more definite than the magnetic response of the earth itself was leaping to meet the chilling ray of deadly cold light from below the strange blue vapor of the blast was rushing upward all of the sustaining air had been instantly sucked away from the propellers and wings of the red arrow plane dйbris was riding into the sky on the aquamarine pyramid all the air seemed to return upon the passenger plane with cyclonic assault the red arrow ship was whirled over and over it became a mere helpless leaf blown by a hurricane chapter monk bails out at the moment the red arrow plane plunged into a seemingly fatal spin monk was awakening to aching consciousness though his skull was hard as granite the battering of the past hours had been such as to have given a stone monument a headache monks first impression was that he had been carried away in a boat then he quickly realized the jerking lurches of the floor on which he was lying could mean only one thing he was traveling in an airplane monk flexed the muscles of his long arms and short legs all of his bones were intact moreover his feet and hands were free clearly some one among his recent enemies must be foolhardy then monk became aware his freedom of body did not afford all the opportunity he had believed he was breathing with difficulty all his body was cold when he moved his arms he discovered they were numbed this was no phenomenon for the huge apelike chemist was slowly being frozen the temperature about him was several degrees below zero the plane was riding at a high altitude the rarefied atmosphere did not provide oxygen enough for his unaccustomed lungs this and the frigid bath prevented his greatly abnormal strength from returning quickly twisting his head monk peered through narrowed eyes under his gristly jutting brows he was in a small cabin plane the ship had twin control seats a man occupied each of these monk could see their faces in a cabinview mirror above the instrument board the man then handling the plane was smoothly sleek and darkskinned he had not been among either of the groups monk had encountered the pilot was stamped mostly by a goldtoothed smile a fixed smile of evil as it showed in the strip of mirror the man in the other seat was scraggly of person and clothing monk did not know this but it was the mysteriously moving scraggs doc had guessed scraggs might be returning to new york on either the red arrow or the white liner plane for this hams departure from washington had been delayed in the hope of picking up the trail of the elusive messenger for var monk lay quite still watching the two men the plane was still taking on more altitude the chemist gritted his teeth to prevent their chattering he was gathering strength for an attack his big hands cautiously explored his clothing not a weapon or device had been left upon his person he must depend upon his bare hands alone monk grinned to himself there were only two men the luminous dial on the instrument board showed a few seconds to nine oclock the goldtoothed man muttered but his words were snatched away by the thundering beat of the propeller scraggss long wraithlike hands took over control monk saw the other man was bringing forth a flat instrument this was somewhat the shape and size of a largecalibered automatic pistol but the metal was of steely blue monk judged it was some new alloy of which he did not know the goldtoothed man pressed one side of a series of buttons appearing on one side from the device came a vicious whirring much the same vibrant sibilancy as that of a rattlesnake about to strike monk identified the sound as coming from some tiny but powerful generator the goldtoothed man pressed another button the scraggly little man drew monks gaze he had cried out sharply as if in warning the planes motor had missed it was coughing in the midst of what had been a smooth rhythm of power monk crouched his chance was at hand the little plane was staggering with a slowing propeller an oath ripped from the goldtoothed man his thumb pressed a trigger on the side of the steely blue instrument monk could not have told if the air in the small cabin suddenly took on more frigidity the cold about him already was under the zero mark but his skin suffered a tingling prickly sensation thousands of tiny needles seemed to be thrusting into him monk saw an edged ray of light directed at the floor of the planes cabin though knifelike it had an weird intangible quality for it was passing directly through the metal that formed the planes fuselage the goldtoothed man was pointing it downward one second or five monk could not have told some tremendous invisible force was lifting the whole body of the small ship it was as if the blue cold light itself was a motive force impelling the plane upward at that instant the motor died monk was in the act of springing at the two men but he was held back the support whirled from under his feet the scraggly little man at the controls dived into the metal frame of the windshield glass his thin body collapsed between the seats the goldtoothed man had shut off the coldproducing beam this was a convulsive automatic act rather than one of intent the sender of the explosive ray into the heart of manhattan was hurled into the roof of the plane monk felt as if he were in the exact center of a whirlpool his body shuttled this way and that twice banging his hard head but he kept his senses the plane did a complete wingover and went into a tail spin monk fighting against being knocked out could tell the convulsions of the ship were due to something far different from ordinary air current the plane seemed to be plunging into a vortex a vacuum of the sky this was in reality the vaporous burst shooting upward from the heart of manhattan even in that flashing instant the cold light having been flicked off the cloud began to recede below bricks and metal were raining upon the city thousands of skyscraper windows were being smashed for blocks around the center of the blast the windows and many walls of older buildings had buckled monk got a grip on one of the control seats his mighty muscles held him until he could get into position the bucking whirling plane at first resisted every effort to throw the ailerons and elevator into neutral without much hope monk pressed the inertia starter to his immense surprise the propeller whirled and the motor caught he battled the ship to a level keel monk then had time to notice his battered unconscious airmates the scraggly man had a deep cut across his forehead his sunken cheeks looked bloodless but one longfingered hand moved at random over his skinny breast the other man could no longer indulge in a goldtoothed smile nose mouth and chin had been flatly smashed blood seeped over his chin but he was still breathing heavily from one of the wings came a crackling tearing sound the plane staggered and fell off it was temporarily out of control with a flapping aileron monk shifted the side sticks to compensate for the drag monk saw the plane had dropped nearly two miles in its dive into the turmoil of the explosion all possibility of gliding to a landing field was removed ten thousand feet below loomed the green expanse of central park but now only the greenery of the trees was showing monk had hoped there might be space enough on one of the lawns to land the plane all these areas were black packed with terrified humanity monk could mark the sea of white upturned faces to attempt a landing would kill and injure many persons as packed mobs sometimes will the thousands now in central park saw doom rushing downward and remained motionless it was the individual thought also as crowd madness that death would hit only the other fellow monk set the stabilizer device on the controls this could not compensate for the damaged wing the plane started a slow circling drop the two unconscious men were wearing seatpack parachutes in a cabin rack were two other chutes monk did not hesitate before he slipped into the harness of the air life preserver he lifted the limp form of the goldtoothed man pushing him through the door monk ripped the mans chute as he sent him hurtling into space five seconds later monk muttered i done all i could the parachute of the monster whose hand had rocked manhattan had only halfway blossomed some of its cords had tangled the small umbrella only partly checked the descent of the body then it was torn apart by the rushing wind vars aide probably his chief lieutenant fell nearly two miles the body struck the cornice of a skyscraper dismembered every possible identifying feature of the man was lost nor was there about his clothing any mark or papers by which he might have been traced the plane continued its crazy circling as monk pulled back beside the slight figure of the scraggly little man daggone it muttered the big chemist i wouldnt wanta see that happen again once more he tried the controls the whirling motion had disrupted the planes tail assembly the elevator was tightly stuck the packed vista of central park was rushing upward monk made a quick determined effort he let go of the controls when he had made sure the plane would crash among some of the trees well away from the densely packed crowds with a growl he caught up the light figure of the scraggly man the ground was still nearly a mile below a strong wind had whipped up following the explosion monk stepped off into space the light little man was in his huge arms their bodies cleared the gyrating plane by only scant inches monk was somersaulting but his head was clear one thick finger hooked into the little mans parachute ring he ripped the pack the chute spread as it checked their momentum monk let go his hold he feared their combined weight might tear the umbrella apart he pulled his own ring when he was still two thousand feet up the chute billowed and danced under his weight caught by the wind it drifted rapidly south with some satisfaction monk saw he would fall below central park he was dropping toward the seventh avenue hotel section around fiftieth street just before a flat roof offered the best chance of landing safely monk could see small bluecoated figures rushing along the avenue then it came to him that he was falling from the plane that had brought madness destruction and death to manhattan daggone it he mumbled now im in for it his feet struck the roof of a hotel some three blocks from central park only a few seconds after the cold light plane tore itself to fragments in a treetop as monk regained his balance and struggled out of the chute harness all of the hundreds who could reach the spot were tearing away the loose parts of the cold light plane when police arrived on the scene the cold lightray gun had disappeared monk made for the nearest skylight and pried it open it had been locked but lock bolt and all the fastenings came loose in his ponderous grasp they might as well have been made of papiermвchй monk was in a hurry he slid down the steep stairs leading to the roof numerous brawny arms of the law were waiting to receive him regardless of monks protests of innocence they took him to headquarters on suspicion of being connected with the cold light chapter a girl seeks scraggs as the red arrow passenger plane winged over in the first mad hurricane of the explosion the dozen passengers were pitched from their seats all except the seemingly cool and imperturbable man of bronze doc savage had set his cablelike tendons for the shock his fingers were locked in the back of his seat doc saw the pilot had been conked the copilot was a limp bundle under his own wheel in the control room the motors threatened to tear themselves loose from their mountings the pilot had been flying low that is rather low over the skypiercing masses of manhattan doc had a glimpse of thrusting towers the superb heights of the radio city buildings glittered near they were dangerously close even under this stress the bronze mans eyes of flaky gold got camera flashes he was seeking reactions of those closest to him his bony legs thrust out as braces vonier the explorer was calmly seeking to prevent himself from being tossed about with the other passengers and across his skeletonhard mouth lay a faint smile the financier carberry was jammed between another man and the roof of the cabin the roof was now under their feet blood oozed from a cut in carberrys forehead the mans countenance looked as if every drop of life fluid already had drained through that single gash over one eye the scared chalky pallor had been replaced by the grayness usually seen only on the face of a corpse carberry did not seem to be breathing the man lying beside carberry was evidently a traveling salesman for he still clutched a sample case by its handle he was very much alive his free hand clawed for some new support as the plane winged completely over for the second time with this new somersault doc saw the towers of radio city rushing upward a bare thousand feet more and the red arrow ship would be split into fragments over one of the edges of the cornices the bronze mans movement toward the control cabin was neither a leap nor a hurried swinging of his body everything within the big plane was topsyturvy the stricken passengers were huddled lumps either of inert flesh and clothing or squirming bodies seeking some relief from the pain of many hurts the man of golden bronze glided through and over all of these the motors were threatening to shake the fuselage to bits upside down though it was doc performed the feat of getting into the pilots seat gripping the control wheel with one hand he got the safety belt around him the pilot had not been using it his copilot had been hooked into his own his raglike body still clung there now the earth or the tangled menacing part of it that was manhattan was for the moment the bronze mans sky as he took the controls the air of the explosion rushed back the propellers bit into the atmosphere as if it were a swiftly flowing stream looping a passenger plane even with the combined power of its motors is among the unrecorded feats of the worlds greatest pilots but the red arrow ship had succeeded in winging over on its back doc played the controls with hands as strong and sensitive as those of some master pianist the motors had more than full power now the ship was a leaf apparently in the rushing wind from the cold light blast doc started the nose climbing into that turbulent river of air the wings screamed it almost seemed as if no human agency could have constructed materials capable of resisting the tearing strain but the bronze man put the plane up and over bumps and groans rolled from the passenger cabin those still conscious suddenly found their positions reversed the floor once more was under their feet with the plane upright doc was forced to throw the ship into a bank that almost stalled its motors even voniers eyes flickered then one wing tip had come so close it appeared to brush the sharp corner of the tallest radio city tower doc leveled off the plane was shooting directly toward another clifflike skyscraper the distance was only a matter of yards similar masses of gleaming granite and glass hedged the ship in on two other sides doc saw he was trapped no human hand could ever pilot a plane over these heights there was no space in which to circle in even the sharpest stalling bank only parts of seconds separated the red arrow craft and all in it from crashing headon into one or the other of the buildings the speed was terrific there could be but one answer to that docs golden eyes flashed downward this was well within the area that had been deserted some scattered dйbris from wrecked buildings had fallen to the streets doc was thankful this was manhattan in almost any other city there would have been interlacing wires phone and power poles here there were none the spread of the big plane was so nearly the width of the street that the wing tips grazed the buildings on either side doc without apparent anxiety without a tremor of those bronzed sure hands was coolly flying the red arrow ship along a street doc had no time to think about what street it might be the signs flew past in a blur he saw only that a wider space loomed ahead the nearest open space was the widening triangle of broadway and seventh avenue between fortythird and fortyseventh streets doc depressed the elevators suddenly the nose whipped up the big plane seemed almost to hang suspended by only the power of its motors the wide wings were flat against a vertical wall of air the red arrow ship dropped its landing wheels were in the exact middle of broadway one wing tip was over a sidewalk the plane shot forward a deserted bus had been left standing in the middle of the street just before the explosion on one side reared the curved cavelike entrance to a subway station between the bus and this obstacle the wings were trapped one wing struck the bus and half of it was sheered off the cabined fuselage skidded on one side those of the nearest crowds behind the police lines were breaking through ambulances and police squad cars that had been held in readiness before the explosion racketed into a combined screaming of sirens doc was out of the control room of the plane lifting a woman in his arms he carried her to the door the metal frame had jammed two men were frantically trying to pry it loose the door was unyielding without releasing the burden of the woman docs cabled hand closed on a metal part where the glass was broken out the tendons of the arms stood out like whipcords metal crunched and ground the two men gasped as the door twisted out of its frame vonier was just behind doc he was carrying the limp figure of carberry the financiers eyes opened he moaned and tried to stand supported by the explorer he succeeded vonier was looking directly at doc the bronze man was making his third trip from inside the plane two police doctors were working over the victims its a miracle said one of the medical men nothing but shock concussion three with minor fractures and bruises some ten minutes elapsed before all were out and the medical men were ready to start three patients to the hospital doc stood flexing his muscles not a mark bruise or scratch marred the smooth bronze skin he was glancing around the circle of faces of those who had been in the plane suddenly the voice that had startled all in the plane that had put a whole city in terror spoke doc savage my power has been proved the world is in my hands stop before it is too late you and your friends will be the next to go one of my own aides is close beside you i am var the financier carberry gave a great convulsive gasp vonier uttered a low short oath he and carberry were darting sharp glances at the others who had been in the plane the man who had been carrying a salesmans kit grew suddenly pale his eyes were widening upon doc the bronze mans lips had not moved his flaky golden eyes now were turned upon this man they were hypnotic orbs that seemed for an instant to hold the man then doc moved slowly toward him doc had simply applied his ventriloquistic talent so adept was he in this especial ability that none would ever have known the latest voice of var had issued from his own motionless lips the voice had been thin strident but clear it might have come from any spot within a fiftyfoot radius but upon that one man who knew of only one source from which the real voice of var might be summoned there was the immediate palsy of fear doc was beginning to believe that the voice also fell with dire significance upon the startled ears of another man within the passenger group because of this second theory he permitted the salesman passenger to recover enough to begin edging back through the crowd the bronze mans eyes again were upon vonier the explorer was smiling but his lips were drawn back from the skeleton teeth pretty good he murmured in fact almost perfect doc savage i wonder if the doctors have finished with the others if one would have a look at my arm i think its broken in two places doc was forced to admire the mans stoical calm his left arm was not only broken but in one place a sharp splinter of bone had been pushed through the skin doc shifted his eyes back to the salesman he saw only his back the man was getting away doc took one step a girls anxious voice inquired suddenly im looking for a passenger named scraggs he was to have arrived on the red arrow plane at nine oclock have any of you seen him he is a little man wearing very old clothes his hair is long and kind of ragged doc pivoted slowly he was instantly struck by the womans clearcut beauty her face was as perfect as an etching as a carved cameo perhaps it was her apprehension for the safety of the man she sought her voice was edged by a sharp metallic quality the pilot had recovered consciousness we had such a man booked miss he said he went down with us on the washington flight but i guess he missed the plane coming back he had his seat reserved but at the last minute another man came with a note and took it maybe he knows hes that the pilot to whom doc savage had amply repaid the favor extended to him on the washington flight gave a quick look at his grounded passengers why i guess hes gone added the pilot he looked like a salesman he was here a minute ago this clicked with doc he was sure the pseudo salesman had been the medium of bringing vars voice into the plane now it was indicated he had been in the seat reserved by the man called scraggs the bronze man pondered deeply who then really was var and who was the woman whose voice had murmured in accompaniment to the first manifestation of vars ghostly tones on the new jersey highway oh then he must still be in washington the girl breathed then unexpectedly she looked at the bronze man and said youre the famous doc savage arent you did the girls widespaced eyes express fear or were they merely widened in wondering awe at being brought in contact with the world famed adventurer it was difficult to judge doc quickly decided she was a rare combination the girl had unusual beauty her quick glance was one of keen discernment not often had the bronze man been thus studied and measured by a woman in the brief space of seconds this girl had weighed him her brows contracted in a little frown the bronze man read in her clear eyes what might have been either a great grief or a lurking fear doc inclined his head and replied i am doc savage at that the young woman turned as if she had lingered too long her slender figure cloaked in a coat of light blue seemed to melt into the crowd vonier and carberry watching doc scarcely detected the movement which took him from their view one second the girl and doc were there the next both had vanished doc had suddenly determined the loose and puzzling end of the var mystery lay with the little man scraggs he did not think the strange girl believed scraggs still to be in washington she would know where to seek him next the girls forward progress seemed impeded by the pressing of the crowd the bronze man suffered no such impediment his lithe body passed through the river of humanity without the touching of any other person the girl disappeared around a corner doc stepped aside to the curb to evade a packed group of chattering bystanders you have something to explain mr savage rapped a commanding voice one of your men was in the plane of that blasting devil up there weve got him the commissioner wants to talk to you several hundred policemen in uniform and others in plain clothes were in broadway and adjoining streets they had been called in from outside precincts to serve as explosion guards four of these blocked docs progress the force held doc savage and his men in the greatest respect these men were respectful but their manner showed firm intention to carry out the order they said they had been given doc considered quickly had it been ham recaptured or had it been monk in the cold light plane before he had time to question the four policemen guns pressed to his sides were indicating he should get into a closed squad car standing near by doc made no protest the bronze man was quick to sense a deception these men were not policemen but he decided the command to attempt the trick must have come directly from the controller of the cold light being taken to var would be much more important than following a willothewisp trail of the girl in blue the bogus squad car jerked ahead then quick hands closed the curtains revolvers were jammed viciously into docs sides step on it smoke one of the men snarled chapter the magnetic wall a short time before the crash long tom had been working at headquarters as directed by doc multiple coils amplifiers condensers compact generators and other electrical appliances were scattered about before the cold light blast had struck long tom had believed docs experiment was on the verge of success at this time renny had been with the electrical wizard long tom grinned up at him his face was jubilant weve got it he exclaimed docs ideas always work now why couldnt i have thought out this one myself renny grunted he knew all about his own profession engineering but long toms gadgets always filled him with suspicion until he saw them in operation now watch this long tom directed the box the electrical expert had created was covered with a variety of indicator needles it was about one foot square but barely three inches thick it was packed with amplifying coils and long toms own special generators of diminutive size when he threw a switch there was a whirring sound but there was no visible ray holy cow grunted renny how would i know anything about something i cant see it was true the ray or emanation from one side of the box was invisible but long tom knew the electromagnetic ray had been created it was more than a mere ray it spread invisibly in the shape of a mammoth fan at the distance of a few yards it became a wall extending from floor to ceiling of the laboratory renny grunted several times in the following few minutes it was his way of displaying appreciation for he saw the exneutralizer cut off in turn the violet ray the x ray and a dozen other such electrical manifestations the interruption of a highfrequency current was disastrous a polished globe exploded and rained fragments among the retorts and tubes of fragile glass a fuse went out and for a few seconds the laboratory was in darkness take it easy long tom advised renny maybe this thing will kick back on you its absolutely harmless insisted long tom wouldnt hurt a fly with the lights on he again turned on the exneutralizer he directed it as a dividing wall across the laboratory there were two rats in a cage on these monk had been testing the effectiveness of certain anaesthetic but noninjurious chemicals the invisible electromagnetic wall was projected toward the cage without special intent long tom shifted the box holy cow grunted renny now youve done it wouldnt hurt a fly huh the rats didnt even squeal both dropped as if bullets had been imbedded in their scanty brains when renny reached the cage they were still and dead dont let that thing touch me cautioned renny hastily the rats went out like a light now what could have done that muttered long tom his homely face registered deep gloom his tone indicated he would have liked to put responsibility elsewhere but it was his job in some uncanny fashion the exneutralizer had become a death ray long tom set to work with frantic haste he wished heartily that doc were here to advise him in a few minutes he believed he had found the flaw and remedied it but just then he had no further opportunity for proving his theory renny was glancing at his watch he went through the door to the window of the outer office nine oclock long tom he called if theres to be fireworks theyre due right now holy cow his words were snatched away by the reverberating blast good gosh exclaimed long tom theres the red arrow plane doc was coming back on it the pair saw the cold light ray steelyblue in color seeming to cut through the big passenger plane renny seized a pair of the electronic binoculars his breath hissed from his big chest as the red arrow ship winged over and over like a leaf in a cyclone immediately after the crash of the plane renny and long tom had sought to trace doc savage contact with the police proved to them the bronze man had apparently been duped and taken prisoner they also learned that monk had been aboard the cold light plane and had been taken by the police in the meantime another man also was trailing docs captors the little man known as scraggs who had escaped with monk was running along a street on the east side scraggss progress was much like that of a fleeing rat his thin body slithered through holes where there didnt seem room for a man to pass his frayed hat was pulled low scraggs was abruptly halted it was the girl in the bright blue cloak oh its you she exclaimed i was at the plane that fell you werent there i started for the old houseboat hangar you said youd meet me and that her words tumbled out scraggs pushed off her detaining hand go back to the house in the woods his thin voice commanded stridently i havent time to explain youll have to wait for me there but scraggs i saw doc savage the girl insisted weve got to do something quick weve scraggs interrupted impatiently already moving away i know more about that than you do his thin voice rasped and thats what im on my way to do the girl remained motionless for a long minute after scraggs had disappeared her perfectly chiseled features were as set as a marble mask the paleness of either deep despair or implacable purpose only enhanced the cameolike beauty of her face doc savage had hoped the police trick on the part of the crooks would lead him straight to the man known as var even after the car curtains were drawn doc permitted his captors to think he had been tricked doc knew nothing of the man scraggs having witnessed his departure from the wrecked red arrow plane nor did he know of scraggs having been in the cold light plane and having been saved by monk from scraggss dash toward east river the little man evidently knew more of docs destination than the bronze man himself could have guessed but the bronze mans thought was that this was the quickest and surest way to come face to face with the cold light destroyer docs conjecture was roughly shattered the car was jouncing along a waterfront street on east river without any warning one of the guns was whipped from his side the weapon crashed on his skull with stunning effect fighting back a swimming black cloud doc felt his arms gripped to his sides a hoodlike affair was pulled swiftly over his head under ordinary conditions the bronze man had defeated the purpose of assailants who sought to administer an anaesthetic his ability to hold his breath was that of the longestwinded pearl diver of the south seas some of these divers had been known to remain under water for periods of three to four minutes only half conscious suffocated by the sack over his head as well as by the etherizing vapor clouding his throat and nostrils doc lost all knowledge of what was transpiring as he slowly recovered the bronze man had no means of knowing how many hours had elapsed he was only sure the day had passed the pall of night was relieved by twinkling stars he could see through a slitted window under doc the floor quivered jerked thunder beat upon his ears his first effort to move convinced him a thorough job of tying had been done rawhide thongs had been expertly bound not only around his arms and legs but another had been passed around his throat this had been secured by spikes or staples to the floor or to a wooden crosspiece the long coffinlike space in which he lay was moving up and down speeding ahead the dipping motion was sickening doc knew instantly he was in an airplane there was no pilot at the controls twisting his head with great effort doc could see no other person in the cabin he was alone a side roll of the plane revealed rows of long white wave tops not so far below the bronze man was hurtling out to sea on a oneman flight but no other man controlled the plane and doc had been rendered powerless chapter the dive of death doc attempted to roll over the rawhide thong around his neck cut off his breath so rigidly were his arms and legs bound with many wrappings the bronze man could obtain no leverage against the choking cord he tensed his throat muscles and put his weight against the rawhide this prevented the cord choking him but his weight was insufficient now he could see the lights of the planes instrument board he saw that his fate had been made cleverly fiendishly sure the plane was controlled by an automatic radio device but in this plane the alternative hand controls had been removed only the special mechanism which operated the small cabin ship on waves of sound was flying it the monster var had taken no chances even were doc savage by some of his almost supernatural powers able to free himself no means had been left for controlling the ultimate destiny of the plane now far out over the ocean the plane suddenly dipped in a breathtaking dive but it only swooped down close to the surface and then zoomed for altitude doc put all the strength of his neck against the binding thong it would not yield even in this terrible predicament doc was thinking back there was this scraggs furtive elusive ratlike scraggs afraid of being identified with his own efforts scraggs had acted at first as if he was trying to avert the explosions of the cold light to stop the evil workings of the mysterious var doc pondered another item who was this girl seeking scraggs when vars voice had first been heard a feminine voice had murmured with it circumstances as yet had led to no definite conclusion doc could almost feel the landing gear of the plane slapped by the tops of the ocean swells as the little ship dived again the rawhide thong was slowly lessening his freedom to breathe up again higher this time doc had been awaiting the moment when the plane would be sent farther up he could almost see the brain reasoning out the finish for the last dive the var operator perhaps var himself would cause the plane to take on more altitude this would make certain the disrupting effect of the final drop if docs throat muscles had not been held as rigidly as a bar of iron the drying rawhide would have throttled him before this time the plane was still climbing docs supersense put every nerve on the alert slowly he forced his head over the bronze skin rasped from his neck as he turned he was looking into the shadowed space at the rear of the coffinlike cabin from the darkness a voice spoke it was thin and strident i guess youve had enough to know var is ruthless he will stop at nothing what seemed to be a bundle of disreputable unkempt clothing rolled into view and stretched into a skinny little man it was scraggs in the semidarkness of the planes cabin his eyes glowed like a cats doc eyed him closely scraggs had a pointed knife in his hand it moved toward docs throat the bronze man was helpless but the furtive elusive scraggs had only good intent in this movement the edged knife slit the tightening rawhide thong at docs throat the plane still was climbing the knife slid down along the other bindings doc stretched his cramped arms and legs got to his feet thanks he said thats a good turn ill not forget but how did you happen to be here scraggss tongue licked along his bloodless lips i overheard what had been planned when you returned to manhattan there were too many for me to try to rescue you i beat them to the plane and hid in the cabin i thought i could get you out before it was sent off but now well now there aint anything we can do scraggss explanation sounded sincere anyway it was clear the furtive little man was in the same tight spot as doc the nose of the plane suddenly dipped the struts screamed in a fullpowered dive doc pushed scraggs ahead of him he forced open the door of the plane against the terrific pressure of the wind jump from the door commanded doc you will have to hurry but i cant well be killed no no scraggs pulled away plainly he feared the plunge into the open sea docs strong hand gripped his shoulder and the little man winced he was powerless to resist the viselike hold then the plane suddenly leveled off the swells were again so close the white teeth of the combers could be seen plainly doc let go of scraggs and sprang to the radio mechanism his corded hands fastened on the machinery with one wrench he had ripped the controls loose wires snapped under his superhuman strength ailerons flapped the tail assembly jerked loose erratic weaving with crumpling devastating force the ripping propeller smashed into the sea the planes tail went up and the little ship went far under the surface in its final dive of death chapter scraggs joins doc doc could easily have freed himself his enormous lung capacity made him as nearly an amphibian as it is possible for any man to be as the plane cracked up and sank doc had absorbed enough air to keep him alive for several minutes instead of pulling himself out he let go his supporting hold scraggss first scream died in a gasping gurgle doc groped his way to the confined space where the little man was trapped gripping fingers fastened on a bony ankle fortunately the amount of air in docs lungs increased his own buoyancy pulling scraggss shoulders into a scissors hold of his locked legs the bronze man used his hands to drive them toward the surface even docs tremendous lung capacity was tested when his head emerged the first long breath pierced him like many tiny knives he rolled treading scraggs was shifted over one arm from the bronze mans clothing came a special restorative chemical docs trained hands forced the water from scraggss lungs a tiny needle pierced the little mans muscles near his spine with briny water slapping and stinging his eyes and nostrils the little man gasped and started kicking doc turned him on his back perhaps one man in a million could have fixed direction as the bronze man accomplished it lying too low in the sea to glimpse the lights of shore doc simply made a quick study of the stars he fixed the position of the great dipper this lined with the north star doc rolled and commenced swimming shoreward with the moaning scraggs one hand held the little man the other arm and his legs beat the swells with churning impact docs progress was much like that of the porpoise to gain speed his mighty body plunged under some of the swells the distance may have been two miles or five docs tireless limbs moved with the speed of motordriven pistons even so nearly an hour elapsed before he was pulling scraggs from the frothing wash onto a landing of flat rocks scraggss thin body was draped with clinging kelp the weeds gave the little man the appearance of some drowned sea animal doc worked him back to consciousness again strange combinations were forming theories scraggss appearance the cold light of the explosion and the blast itself with the queer coloring of aquamarine the few words in the plane of the explorer vonier and the financier carberry over some of their theories all of these seemed to trend to the sea they touched upon the mysteries of the vast littleknown life of the oceans themselves in the analytical brain of doc savage they became a directly separable quantity the greatest source of life lay in the sea therefore why not the most terrible forces of destruction scraggs began talking in a hoarse strained voice who who saved us he stammered who who got us out we had luck doc stated the tide was with us scraggs sat up staring at him the mans eyes glowed with a hint of phosphorescent light it was this made him resemble a cat in the darkness docs own flaky eyes also were glowing he shot a question youre safe now who is var scraggs cringed as if he had been struck a blow his thin lips trembled i i cant tell you that he mumbled because i dont know ive never seen him yes you believe ive been working for him i have but never directly the little man clearly was on guard there was something he did not intend to reveal the bronze mans hypnotic eyes held the sunken orbs of the other no the little man almost shouted youre trying to make me tell something i dont know i never saw var i tell you but he murdered my best friend the scientist jackson and i was his helper there now was sincere grief in scraggss voice jackson was the man killed in the first explosion the bronze man suggested before he could talk over the telephone you put a message in my pocket then i conjecture you went back to the house in the marsh scraggs stared at doc no yes i did go back he said i saw jackson killed i couldnt stand it i ran away i didnt dare be found there jackson was the best and kindest and smartest man that ever lived he was inventing this explosive for the man who called himself var didnt var come to the house in the marsh questioned doc yes but only at night and i was never permitted to see him insisted scraggs i knew some experiments were planned jackson told me where one test was to be made that was one in the woods near carberrys home in little neck thats how i happened to be out there the message indicated jackson was afraid doc said doc knew part of what scraggs was telling must be the truth but only part of it yes said scraggs at the last jackson was afraid the chief kept him a prisoner in the house there was no way out except by the one road and it was guarded var seems to have many men said doc they are not ordinary criminals no i dont know well yes you are right stammered the little man var has a big organization all of his men are smart jackson told me var had first planned to use his explosive for establishment of a new social justice jackson told you all of this yes yes he told me exclaimed scraggs im being honest with you jackson sent me with the message to find you it was too late vars plans were complete he had no more use for jackson you want to avenge the death of your friend and employer is that it said doc yes thats it replied scraggs ive tried to help you all i could cant you see i even hid in the plane to try and rescue you then we were both trapped and you saved me are you sure there wasnt some way to have controlled that plane without the radio some way that you knew doc quizzed no i expected to get you out before the plane was sent off east river doc pondered this quickly had scraggs a reason of his own for wanting to appear as the bronze mans rescuer it might be a part of vars plan to establish a closer contact with docs movements scraggs suddenly interrupted his flow of thought but i want to have your help scraggs said ill go with you and your men i know much i can tell you there are several places you would never find alone ill help you if youll let me stay with you doc considered this a moment without speaking then scraggs seemed to recall something important doc savage he cried while you have been here some of your own men may have been wiped out ive heard of a new plan of vars he intends to get your men in your headquarters maybe blow up the building scraggs was trembling there was evidence of desperate sincerity in his warning you can come with me the bronze man decided we will find an automobile at about this time ham was arriving by a white liner plane at the newark airport chapter ham gets poison he was his usually nattyappearing self as he alighted from the passenger plane the waspish wellclothed figure took on a hasty stride he pushed impatiently into the crowd awaiting arrival of other planes i might have known i wouldnt have any luck he muttered scraggs had not been aboard the white liner ham believed the man he wanted would be on the red arrow the excited comment of those around him and screaming headlines informed ham the manhattan explosion had taken place on schedule ham seized a paper as he entered the limousine used by the air transport company to carry passengers back and forth between manhattan and the airport reading avidly he groaned good heavens he grunted it cant be possible not doc the edition of the newspaper he had bought had been issued within a few minutes after the manhattan blast this story had it the red arrow plane had crashed against a building in radio city ham felt for his handkerchief a small box was in the pocket the box had been slipped into his coat either on the plane or in the airport terminal buildings across the box were printed a few words i take this means of getting this strange poison gas to doc savage when placed in water these pills free enough poison vapor to kill hundreds i believe only doc savage can analyze and discover their formula when he has done this he can communicate with me at box queens post office a friend ham opened the box it contained four round pills about the size of small marbles these were of jellylike substance ham carefully replaced the poison gas pills but more recent editions of the newspapers in manhattan caused ham to forget the pills of poison gas he read that doc had saved the red arrow plane but his jubilation was shortlived for the papers had reported the manner of docs disappearance the police were futilely searching for four phony coppers in a bogus squad car monk had been freed by the police and had joined his companions at docs headquarters ham hastened directly there monk and ham might have been expected to congratulate each other on their separate escapes from vars clutches hams mouth twisted into a sneering grin as he looked at the big chemist so they got one look at that classic profile of yours in the explosion plane said ham and then they jumped out well that mug must have been a shock howlin calamities squealed out monks highpitched voice an it takes a smart shyster like you to get me conked when all im doin is tryin to save your worthless skin tellin me to quit on that roof sayin youre just practicin monk referred to the encounter on the washington roof where ham had heeded docs instructions and stopped the battle with vars men whats the latest news of doc inquired ham anxiously of long tom and renny thats just our trouble grunted the worried renny there isnt any nothin to start on or get a hold on do you suppose wed be coolin our heels here if we had a lead weve been hoping every minute the police would report something to start us off so the fake police car went up in thin air mused ham aloud went toward east river yeah said long tom but the river patrol hasnt reported a thing the days shadows lengthened toward night a much subdued and unusually timid broadway was flashing its first lights ive got it ive found it long tom suddenly proclaimed found what groaned renny a way to discover where docs gone thats all i want to know right now well no admitted long tom gloomily nothing like that but his electromagnetic wall is o k ive fixed it so it wouldnt harm a fly you said that before complained renny an look what happened to monks rats aw rats muttered long tom then he brightened visibly thats the idea he added monk how about getting us some more rats grumbling that something might happen monk finally agreed and departed the three companions left in the laboratory made a concerted spring for the front office when the phone buzzed ham picked up the instrument thinly stridently a voice started speaking we have doc savage you will never see him again tomorrow the afternoon washingtonnew york express train will be next to feel the power of var tell ham the lawyer he must go back to washington if ham goes to washington and follows instructions the train will be saved i am var with a bitter invective ham jiggled the receiver bar a half minute later he replaced the instrument the operator says its a dial phone in a public booth somewhere and cant be traced he informed the others brothers were faced by a situation that seems to be beyond our control only one thing the voice didnt say doc had been killed and if he hasnt well see him again and it wont be long monk came back bringing two rats in a wire cage they were common gray rodents monk set the cage at one end of the long spacious laboratory he joined renny and ham at one side watching long tom now said long tom the hertzian ray already has been perfected to the point where it will kill electrical force at a great distance it can be used to stop airplanes in the air but this is the first electromagnetic force to neutralize any other electrical ray long tom moved a switch generators whirred in the square flat box the exneutralizer wall formed an invisible partition across the laboratory daggone it squeaked monk even if they was rats y needntve murdered em i was wantin em to try out a new kind of poison gas long tom stared mournfully at the wire cage upon which the exneutralizer was directed the pair of gray sewer rats had rolled on their backs their legs were rigid they hadnt even kicked holy cow barked renny see that you keep that thing turned off the rest of us long toms hand was moving to switch off the exneutralizer monk started over to examine the rats the apelike chemist jumped back as if he had been stung howlin calamities he ejaculated wouldja look at that keep that death machine on long tom keep it on a mysterious deadly ray of cold light sliced through the thick stone and steel of the manhattan skyscraper as a knife might have passed through soft cheese it penetrated half of the laboratory seen close up it was like an edged flat band of bright blue steel long tom backed hastily toward the open office door thus the box in his hand cast a fanlike ray that covered every inch of the test room from floor to ceiling it works by heavens it works he shouted the skins of every one prickled with the sensation of cold but the deadly explosive cold light did not reach its objective whatever it might have been its frigid band reached long toms invisible electromagnetic wall there it was abruptly cut off the magnetic insulation converted half the laboratory into an impregnable refuge ham monk and renny were within this haven for a long minute the cold light remained fixed into the room in the streets below thousands of persons saw it shining across the night crowds scurried for shelter then the cold light disappeared a traffic policeman had fixed its origin in a nearby skyscraper within ten minutes squads of policemen were scouring this building but they found nothing the cold light then was being reported from farther uptown in reality it had come from several miles its penetrating ray had pierced scores of office buildings mostly emptied for the night nothing had interfered with its progress until it had encountered docs electromagnetic wall the four men felt as if they were freezing the cold light had vanished but the temperature of the room rose slowly monk found chattering speech the exneutralizer had been switched off lookit he shouted the rats theyve come back to life with long toms exneutralizer turned off the gray rats were frisking about as if they had never been laid cold daggone it squeaked monk thats nothin but a hypnotizin machine long tom you try it on me betcha it wont knock me out ham laughed derisively hypnotism takes effect on the brain monk that wouldnt be much use as a test he suggested rats have got some brains howlin calamities squeaked out monk maybe you think that shyster brain of yours would help i suggest we test it together remarked ham suppose we both walk through it long tom demurred but the rats apparently were wholly unharmed he figured he could switch the electromagnetic wall off if the two bickering friends showed any evidence of succumbing again the invisible wall partitioned the laboratory long tom directed it deliberately upon the rats cage the rodents blinked their beady eyes and promptly curled up their toes side by side ham and monk walked around the long table filled with globes retorts and a variety of tubes monk edged a little ahead part of his great bulk was in the invisible wall hams own waspish body was touching it dont feel a thing asserted monk and moved across cmon shyster you scared renny and long tom had their eyes fixed on ham and monk the latter two were looking at each other keeping up a fire of sarcastic conversation thus none of them saw the cold light ray suddenly reappear the bluesteel band knifed through the skyscraper wall monks big hands went to his face he was almost blinded by chilling cold ham seeing something was wrong reached for him his own body had not yet crossed the protective exneutralizer the door opening into the outer office burst open from the doorway came the weird mellow warning of doc savage the bronze man was standing there his wet hair and skin were smooth and sleek just back of him stood the sodden figure of scraggs stay where you are all of you doc commanded his flaky gold eyes caught and followed the shifting cold light he saw it dissolve in the electromagnetic wall long tom moved to flick off the exneutralizer switch doc seized long toms wrist leave it on he directed wait until the cold light stops it would get all of us monk staggered back to the safe side of the electromagnetic wall his huge body shook as with an ague he felt as if he were freezing monks bulk struck ham and sent the slighter figure of the lawyer to his knees you big blundering ape sputtered ham look where youre going i think monk just saved our lives doc said calmly scraggss mouth twitched as he stared at the cold light ray it didnt explode he muttered amazedly but i was right doc savage you see i was telling you the truth ham walked toward him you were in that house in washington you know what all this is about im not so sure scraggs does know all about the cold light ray said the bronze man perhaps he helped to save your life if you had crossed the exneutralizer all of us would have been annihilated chapter plotted poisoning again the cold light had been withdrawn for the second time during the evening the police were unsuccessfully seeking its source it had been directed upon doc savages stronghold from a new direction doc directed long tom to set about duplicating the exneutralizer at once scraggs watched silently the bronze man apparently ignored him but he was studying the little mans reactions closely well probably need as many machines as we can get together he advised at least well need two to try and save the express train youve told me about ham had told doc of the threat against the train but had made it a point to keep scraggs from hearing now scraggs looked up with quickened interest you know about the train he exclaimed ham looked intently at scraggs perhaps doc if scraggs stays with us there wont be any need to save the express he said significantly it wouldnt make any difference scraggs muttered but if you could prevent an explosion here you could do it there thats what we hope to do doc stated doc produced a thin book from inside his shirt fingers flicked through the pages monk could see the riffled pages the little book was illustrated by brightly colored plates monk grunted and peered more closely daggone it he exclaimed ive seen somethin like that picture there doc glanced at him quickly sure of that monk when did you see it cant seem to remember where or when i saw it doc but i know i did the books illustration was a picture of marine life it was done in intense blue the figure shown was apparently half human half crab gold letters gave the name of the author the writer was vonier the explorer clearly vonier had had good reason for his admiration for and his disagreement with carberry the financier over a treatise carberry had written for carberrys one plunge into science had dealt with the cellular origin of the human species such a study must necessarily lead to the established origin of all life that of the sea the phone rang it was vonier calling from a booth in the building lobby doc invited him to come up at once if vonier recognized scraggs his impassive face gave no hint but doc marked scraggs staring intently at the explorer voniers arm was neatly bandaged in a sling his bony face was as calm as ever he announced he believed an attempt had been made on his life when i reached my home and went into my office he explained quickly i found these in my desk top i couldnt have missed them he produced two jellylike globules no larger than marbles a note was with them vonier said it was signed just a friend it directed me to analyze them for a mysterious poison and said the pills possessed a rare form of germs that could be employed to pollute the whole water supply of a great city ham was staring at the man scraggs arose and walked nervously about the laboratory the note said they contained germs to be released in water ham questioned then the first thing you probably would do would be to put one of the balls in water to see what would happen then why didnt you doc said perhaps that was what was wanted vonier to have you place them in water i thought of that remarked vonier dryly thats why i came to you you are reported to be a wizard on the safe analysis of any form of poison ham took his own poison pills from his pocket he laid them on the desk then he produced the note he had received doc read it at a glance voniers lips were drawn in a smile over his skeleton teeth i would say the whole things the work of our good friend var he stated ive heard the cold light ray has been jumping about again tonight something has gone wrong there has been no explosion so var seems out to get us by a more devious device doc said ill analyze these pills he glanced at the nervous scraggs in the meantime ill place them in the laboratory safe where i keep my radium even poison gas cant escape from that this safe heavily insulated with lead and a special rubberlike composition contained docs radium it was one of the largest amounts in the world in the possession of a single individual scraggs watched the pills being locked away his eyes glowed as if a sudden idea had struck him im going out for a while he said when i return i may have something important to tell you doc savage doc merely nodded hams face was dark with suspicion as scraggs sidled toward the elevators doc apparently gave the matter no further attention he turned to vonier did any one of your household observe any suspicious person no said vonier only the japanese houseman was there mrs vonier has gone to our house on the shore im convinced this var means business you are more of a threat to him than i am savage but i havent the slightest intention of complying with his demand that i join his organization another phone call came from the skyscraper lobby it was the hoarse strained voice of carberry the financier in heavens name let me come up and stay with you tonight came the excited voice i dont believe var intends to wait fortyeight hours he has learned i was in washington now there has been an attempt to poison me docs flaky golden eyes glinted strangely come right up carberry he invited he told the others what carberry had said vonier seemed about to impart something more of importance then he merely said i think perhaps when you get to the bottom of this cold light thing youll find yourself mixed up with some of the mysteries of our little known marine life monk gulped started to speak and changed his mind it had come to him where he had seen the picture of the halfcrab and halfhuman creature it had been one of those done in oil on the walls of the room where he had fought wheeze mcgoverns men doc had slipped voniers book on marine life into a drawer of his desk carberry was a shaking figure when he entered his protruding eyes appeared ready to jump from their sockets the bald spot between his white tufts of hair had a ghastly hue what you here too vonier were his first words im glad to see youre safe i was afraid to stay out at my home and i dont dare risk being trailed to where my wife is hidden you said an attempt was made to poison you suggested doc it would be some sort of pill how in heavens name did you know that exclaimed carberry producing a little box holy cow grunted renny theyre different look like sugar cubes yes yes thats it and thats where they were stammered the financier in the sugar a houseboy got hold of one the butler found him dead he had turned purple after the butler went through the sugar and found these i thought you could find out more quickly savage what they are there were two square cubes though they were white and shaped like sugar a close inspection proved them to be less granular there was a smooth crust hardened over a jellylike substance in a few seconds the new poison pills were behind the thick insulated door of the laboratory safe long tom came in announcing he had the second exneutralizer ready doc invited vonier and carberry to witness a demonstration on several different electrical rays could one of them be made for me savage questioned carberry ill let you name your own price if doc interrupted we never accept pay for what we do carberry but youre welcome to any safeguard we can devise i would suggest both you and vonier remain here tonight you shall sleep between invisible walls of the exneutralizer during the night doc savage perfected a plan for saving the washingtonnew york express from the cold light threat in the early morning long tom and renny left the headquarters they were carrying the exneutralizer boxes their destination was the hudson river hangar where docs planes were kept ham and monk were on their way to the warehouse hangar by a different route doc savage followed another direction carberry had left with vonier saying he would stay with the explorer during the day daylight braces me up the financier announced but when night comes i begin to get the jitters and my fortyeight hours are up tonight he added well be back late this afternoon said doc meet us here again tonight though carberry seemed to have some doubt as to vonier it was apparent he did not want to be alone doc had not informed either the explorer or the financier of their destination after communicating with the railroad offices doc had advised that the washingtonnew york express be allowed to come through on schedule he had suggested however that a regular train for passengers be run as a second section only the necessary crew was to be carried on the first section doc was at the controls of the plane long tom was making sure the exneutralizers were in perfect order if the warning from var had been genuine and none thus far had failed the washingtonnew york express would have one invisible passenger the name would be death about the moment docs special cabin plane was taking off from the hudson river a window was softly raised high in the tower of manhattans tallest cloudpiercer the afternoon had seen the advent of a slow drizzling rain it had misted over the city with the usual smoky fog no person in the street below could have seen the slender rope swaying from the high window nor did any person observe the slim shadowy figure coming down the man was light his body almost wraithlike though supported only by his hands he swung out over space with a confidence of movement which proved he was accustomed to great heights the mans feet poised lightly on the ledge of an eightysixth floor window a blunt instrument appeared in one hand the glass crashed inward to the rug without much sound an instant later the intruder had raised the sash and admitted himself in the office he produced a case of small instruments the locked laboratory door yielded to a control electroscope like that used by doc savage and his men from his clothing came a flat metal case a button was pressed and a tongue of purple flame was reflected this flame increased in intensity the insulated laboratory safe was not burglarproof the insulating composition and the lead were relatively soft materials after two minutes a square opening appeared under the flame the intruder chuckled again the purple flame licked out but this time it did not seem to be of a destructive nature rather the cut square of the safe door had been replaced the flame curled over the surface the figure emitted another ironic chuckle the square was being healed into place afterward an observing eye might have noted the rewelding of the crevices but the average person would not have known the wall of the vault had been tampered with shortly thereafter the outside door of docs headquarters opened a man came out and took the stairway upward from the window a few floors above the thin rope was drawn in the window was closed the poison pills were no longer in the vault they were close to a water faucet in the laboratory perhaps it was only by chance that a faulty valve caused dropping water to dampen the surface of the metal on which the poison pills had been laid chapter the walls of life even while the mysterious visitor was in his laboratory doc savage was piloting a cabin plane over the eastern pennsylvania hills he was following a train to set the plane down he selected a flat field where a paved highway paralleled the railroad track apparently a worried engineer had been expecting them for the air brakes started steel grating on steel as doc and his four companions appeared on the track ahead the youthful firemans eyes rolled as docs bronze figure swung up on the grabiron into the cab you get up front doc told long tom and monk one on each side of the pilot its a ticklish spot for riding but well want every possible inch of the train covered by the exneutralizers turn on the machines and keep the rays playing theyre effective for at least a thousand yards perhaps more renny and ham and i will take the rear end monk growled and grunted as he clung to a pilot standard with one arm and worked the exneutralizer wall ill betcha he squealed above the rush of the wind and the pounding of piston heads that fashionplate shyster has found himself a soft seat on the cushions you keep that box working shouted long tom and slant it straight back the invisible walls formed two magnetic shields as the washingtonnew york express gathered speed instructing ham to continue a patrol through the coaches doc took renny with him to the observation platform on the rear car he had judged the cold light if and when it came would have to be directed from an airplane or from some automobile on the highway in case the danger came from above long tom had been instructed to swing to the locomotive stack and cover the top of the train this feat long tom was ready to perform by docs instructions the engineer kept the train to the low speed of around thirty miles per hour renny and doc on the observation platform were scanning every passing auto and every distant plane in the sky the cars of the express poured into a shallow grade cut it roared out onto a long straightaway half a dozen cars were in view on the highway making sure his own special grenades a powerful chemical explosive were at hand doc scanned each of these cars in turn nothing out of the ordinary showed for some time when the cold light ray flashed on it came from a distance the edged band bluesteel in color was striking across the country from a wooded spot nearly two miles away the knifelike emanation played along the sides of the speeding cars doc breathed with relief for when the ray struck the invisible wall of the exneutralizer on that side it seemed to waver then dissolve but a big closed car between the train and the wooded spot was not so fortunate the driver of this automobile was speeding his car was passing the train the cold light played upon the driver it seemed to jump along with the automobile doc saw the driver stiffen in his seat then the man reared up took his hands from the steering wheel and clawed blindly at his face he pitched forward his head striking the windshield the automobile left the highway careening down the bank it somersaulted twice and came to rest on flattened wheels two men were hurled out the first person to reach the scene of the crash reported to the unbelief of others that the driver and his companions seemed to have been frozen stiff three were dead the other was seriously hurt the bronze man waited neither for the slowing of the train or for inspection of the wrecked car dropping to the ground docs feet seemed to glide along the gravel he was upright when he let go and landed on his feet with a single bound over the rightofway ditch renny followed his huge body lacked the springy resiliency of the bronze mans renny failed to compensate for the speed of the train his big feet tangled with an enraged bellow he started rolling it was well his muscles were ironhard and his neck was thicksinewed after the third somersault renny managed to stagger to his feet he was close behind doc following orders the train proceeded on its way ham monk and long tom stuck by it monk saw doc and renny speeding across the nearby field over the highway there seemed to be no side road leading from the wooded spot to the main highway doc noted the square mile or so of bushy expanse appeared to have no visible outlet renny was forced to give all he had to keep up with the bronze man doc did not seem to run his speed was evolved from a gliding sinuous movement in which all of his trained muscles coordinated in even the crisis of this seeking of the maker of cold light docs brain was working on other angles of the problem monk had informed him of his recognition of the illustration in the vonier book on marine species in voniers welldone treatise on little known elements of the deeper oceans were many direct references to as yet undiscovered atomic energy greater than anything the worlds leading scientists had revealed doc could readily understand how vonier might be valuable indeed to var the man who according to scraggs had started out with the idea of reforming world society and now wanted world domination might well find an individual of voniers erudition immensely valuable to his further schemes var also might fear vonier possessed a knowledge that would enable him to solve the mystery of the cold light force doc considered this point how much did vonier really know of the elements that might have gone into the creation of cold light as a destroying agency the bronze man also pondered the actions of the mysterious scraggs the presence of vonier or something connected with the failure of the cold light to explode in the laboratory had caused the little man to invent an excuse to get away doc was sure of this then there was the girl in blue who had been seeking scraggs at the wrecked red arrow plane there had been a woman close to var as he had uttered his message after the first of his explosions each of the suspects had a woman closely related to him or his activities the bronze man and renny arrived at the fringe of woodland they paused a moment listening birds trilled in the brush as if nothing had been there to disturb them the strip of woods was about a quarter of a mile in width its extent in the other direction could only be guessed you take the other side directed doc keep under cover of the trees and move quietly if you run onto anything fire the pistol doc was gone slithering through the bushes his progress was that of a jungle cat or a deer rennys woodcraft was not nearly so skillful doc heard the huge engineer crashing into the brush doc weaved from side to side his swiftness covered half the wooded strip thoroughly under the trees the ground was damp and mossy only a keen eye would have detected the dull coppery shining of a bit of metal at the bottom of a shallow pond doc scooped up the small object it was a narrow cylinder of brass it much resembled some form of cartridge open at one end it seemed to have contained a sort of explosive powder and had been recently fired the empty shell bore no imprint of hammer pin if it had been exploded the force had been other than by impact he instantly decided the cartridge had contained some element employed in the cold light machine the mystery of this was heightened by the absence of any footprints or marks around the edges of the little pond docs gaze roved upward a freshly broken leaf dangled on its stem bark had been slightly scraped on a branch the stunted trees here were close together it was plain enough some acrobatic individual had swung along from tree to tree a second later doc was in the branches a few yards above the ground he followed a trail in the trees that led toward the other side of the woods pausing he listened for renny there was only silence renny must be near he called cautiously he received no reply when renny parted from doc he proceeded to the opposite side of the wooded strip the air was balmy the whole scene was peaceful renny plunged into the trees underbrush impeded his progress he had covered perhaps two hundred yards birds hushed into silence close around him but when he paused the distant ones resumed their trilling apparently nothing had disturbed them suddenly this was changed renny came upon a robin on the ground the redbreasted bird was hopping about aimlessly sometimes it fell over when renny pursued the robin seemed not to see or hear him a halfgrown rabbit lay on its back kicking the little creature appeared to be recovering from a blow renny picked it up the body felt icy the rabbit had been almost frozen recalling the effect of the cold light in the laboratory renny was instantly on guard still no sound or movement disturbed the bush renny pushed through a tangle of berry bushes directly in his face an icy wall sprung up the cold light ray filtered through trees as if they did not exist renny was bathed in an icy chill the effect was much the same as liquid air the engineer had seen no one he had heard no movement instinctively he attempted to draw his supermachine pistol his fingers clawed stiffly his arms were almost instantly numbed renny tried to shout his throat was constricted his tongue was powerless to utter a sound the engineer was the first person upon whom the cold light had been directly played renny felt as if his whole body were being frozen but he tried to struggle onward he went to his hands and knees he crawled slowly blurred figures came from the bush around him tape was slapped over his mouth and eyes thongs enwrapped his arms and legs his stiff form was lifted and carried to an automobile warmth returned to renny this was a warm wave renewed circulation brought tingling pain all over his body much the same as when frostbite is being relieved too quickly the automobile jounced and jumped over the rough road why didnt we wait and grab doc savage himself growled one harsh voice with him at liberty anything might happen a hoarse voice strangely familiar replied curtly keep your advice smoke hes being saved for the big blowoff the world may suspect but none will ever be able to prove what became of this socalled invincible bronze man renny strained at his bindings the effort availed nothing perhaps five minutes later doc savage came upon the spot where renny had been seized tracks of the auto ran out to the highway by this time there were many cars moving the man of bronze whipped back to the spot where he and his men had landed their plane before boarding the train trailing the car in which renny was a prisoner was impossible but doc was convinced he could quickly gain a lead to the place where renny would be taken chapter the woman in it doc savage had instructed monk ham and long tom to join him at the hudson river hangar when they arrived back in new york the man of bronze planned to visit the penthouse apartment where monk had first been held prisoner he had his own reason for delaying this visit until nightfall likewise the bronze man wished his companions to remain away from the skyscraper headquarters for this he offered no explanation vonier and carberry had said they would not return until darkness vonier had not yet imparted his own theory of the cold light leaving his companions at the hudson river hangar the bronze man vanished during the late afternoon he was engaged in visiting various real estate offices handling properties on manhattans east side he was especially interested in the block destroyed by the cold light explosion darkness was falling over the city when doc returned to the hangar and the coming of night was bringing another moving angle of the mysterious cold light this new angle revolved around an isolated house buried deep in a wooded section of long island the furnishing of this obscure house was exotic a raftered room with a high ceiling had heavy window drapes tightly drawn a woman sat in this room her features were flawless of chiseled perfection but the face lacked any warmth grayishgreen eyes were like bright agate a mask of a face it might have been cast of plaster of paris the mouth was a pallid curve of bitterness when she spoke the name was hissed doc savage the luck of the devils with him the luck of satans own imps i should have used a knife in a crowd as i suggested she drew a thin stiletto blade from a silver sheath in the bosom of her dress the blade was needlepointed somewhere in the back of the house was the tinkle of silver and dishes a softfooted servant was moving about the woman walked with a sinuous movement to one of the heavily draped windows she pulled aside the corded cloth overhead the sky was speckled with coldly winking stars the calm peace of the night apparently stirred her to tigerish fury the fool she said venomously were not safe until this doc savage is put out of the way she moved back to one of the chairs he had the greatest power in the world and he cant get one man she said in a low brittle tone and now what is he doing since the first night i havent been in on any of it she crossed the room and pulled a silken cord two darkskinned men appeared from a rear room tako the woman said commandingly i want you and scov to find your master at once try the river place and if he isnt there he may be in the uptown apartment you are to bring him here to me understand i understand said the man addressed and if he doesnt want to come the woman smiled but it only made her mouth harder you will bring him to me she repeated softly i will wait no longer the two men withdrew sparks glinted in the womans grayishgreen eyes after all she mused aloud the creator of the killing ray is dead he can never come back our supply is almost inexhaustible the secret of its origin is lost forever a glass clinked in another room the woman arose and closed a pair of heavy double doors she turned a key in the great brass lock crossing the room she came to an alcove containing a case of books it appeared to have been built solidly into the structure of the house the woman glanced at the draped window she touched a light switch and all but a single dim eye faded out the woman moved one book the bookcase swung silently outward back of it appeared a solid steel door she whirled the knob of a combination a little light showed in the vaulted space behind the door this was high enough to admit the womans figure there were a dozen piled cases each was about a foot long and possibly four inches in width and depth they were like small caskets of a dull lusterless metal each casket was fastened with screwed steel clamps the womans long fingers sought one of the clamps she swiftly unscrewed the casket fastening the lid lifted under the raised top she could see the contents of the little casket she lifted it the weight did not appear to be great not as if the queerly devised boxes contained jewels or other treasure yet the movement of the womans hands was almost caressing for perhaps two minutes the woman stood motionless her lips moved without sound whatever her ruthless purpose it no doubt involved the contents of the dull metal caskets as she stood thus she could not see the key in the ponderous brass lock of the double doors this key was turning slowly in the room at the rear of the house had sounded a muffled blow it had been followed by a sighing moan the key was being turned so slowly from the other side of the door its movement was almost imperceptible but as it caught the tumblers of the brass lock there was a sharp click without waiting to screw down the clamp of the small casket the woman sprang back into the room the double doors were swinging back on silent hinges in the aperture appeared a moonlike face the small mouth was merely a hole above a thick double chin you gasped the woman whats happened what are you doing here wheeze mcgovern leered at the woman his darting eyes had confirmed his belief she was alone his gaze fell upon the open door of the steel vault perfect better siss than id hoped for he wheezed now just dont move the woman was transfixed for an instant where where is var she stammered why sent me to get em cut in wheeze an i see siss you were expectin me no no the woman gave a little gasp youre lying var her slim hand pushed at the vault door it was heavy two other men crowded the door behind wheeze he rolled his fat body across the room with incredible speed one of the womans hands was caught and squeezed in the door she fought to close wheeze mcgoverns pudgy fist struck her under one shelllike ear the blow staggered her but with a furious hissing breath she flung herself upon the stout figure of vars aide curved fingers clawed at his face the nails welted a bloody track across its moonshaped surface i know what youre after the woman screamed id been expecting it to happen others have brains if var hasnt but youll never get them wheeze snarled and caught the womans neck in a twist of his heavy arm disregarding her clawing fingers he forced her body to the floor you listen to me siss an maybe we can get together on this he wheezed with the stuff weve got we can have millions the woman was breathing rapidly her eyes widened yes id thought of that she said one hand was sneaking to the bosom of her dress what would you do with them she added what do you think could be done wheeze mcgovern laughed softly what collect millions he gloated why id make the big boys pay plenty the times ripe to collect he had relaxed his hold on the woman she came to her feet with the quickness of a cat there was a silvery flashing glitter in her hand for all of his apparently clumsy weight wheeze leaped aside with agile speed he ripped out an oath as the stiletto pierced the cloth of his coat and ripped a furrow along the flesh of his arm why you siss hellcat he grunted if youd been only halfway reasonable well he was chopping out the words even as his fingers closed on the womans throat his strength bent her downward and backward he twisted the stiletto from her hand with a brutal force that cracked a bone in the womans slender wrist she tried to scream but the grip on her throat was inexorable the face of chiseled marble turned slowly a greenish hue wheeze threw her limp body to one side take her smoke ordered wheeze an tie her up plenty he pushed into the vault he rapped out a command to another man wheezes hands trembled a little as he started passing out the small caskets then he came to the last one this was the dull metal box the woman had partly opened the lid was up a few inches in the screw clamp wheeze gazed at the contents of the casket not a bad idea he muttered might as well leave it like it is when all the caskets were in the car standing in the driveway outside wheeze reлntered the womans slim body lay in the cool green depths of a seaweed rug with her hands tightly secured and her ankles lashed to a heavy shelllike chair the woman was powerless to move across her mouth tape had been fixed not that it matters grunted wheeze wont anybody be comin along this forsaken road nobody but var would have the idea and that wont mean anything the womans bosom was heaving convulsively her eyelids fluttered open in the graygreen depths of her orbs glowed killing hate wheeze shivered and looked away then he smiled a little he went into the big vault when he came out he had made sure the lid of the one casket remained open he left the heavy steel door slightly ajar as he went out he pushed a button the oddly furnished room was plunged in darkness in the darkness the bound woman was staring at the partly open door of the vault none could see the terror that had replaced all other emotion wheeze mcgoverns closely curtained sedan swung onto the main paved highway about a mile from the house hidden in the woods for persons leaving the scene of a crime the occupants of the car seemed in no great haste once the car speeded up wheeze laid his hand on the drivers arm there isnt any grand rush he cautioned nobodys chasin us and this is one of the times siss we dont want to be picked up by any speed cop take it easy the car proceeded at a sedate pace it was a mile up the concrete from the side road to the house in the woods two or three cars had passed in the opposite direction a couple had sped by toward the city where myriad lights were reflected in the sky another car with weak headlights appeared meeting the sedan the face of this driver was white and strained the car was a roadster old and almost paintless the man was driving fast in the darkness wheeze and his men could not distinguish the face if they had their controlled speed toward the city might have been altered the driver of the roadster was the furtive mysterious scraggs though wheeze mcgovern had not guessed the identity of the man in the roadster it was apparent scraggs had recognized the other car a short distance down the road the little car squealed to a stop turning scraggs was perhaps half a mile from the sedan his foot pressed the gas and he sped toward it it being early evening traffic from the city showed a dozen dancing headlights at the same time three other cars passed wheeze while scraggss car was creeping up behind the sedan the driver of one of these cars also slowed down only a minute later a big car whizzed by both scraggs and the sedan coming from the rear out of the night from the midst of the blazing headlights another light suddenly appeared it was blue and cold the cold light the happenings of the succeeding moments were so fast an observer would have had no time to fix details in mind only it seemed the cold light had been directed at wheeze mcgoverns big car the bluesteel ray must have missed for the sedan abruptly spurted ahead the long beam of the cold light shifted from the highway the sender undoubtedly was seeking to pick out wheeze the knifelike ray laid a silver pathway that could have been seen for miles but for only a second perhaps only a fraction of that the cold light picked out the wooded area from which wheeze and his men had lately emerged the following roaring explosion had the might of an unleashed volcanic crater vivid blue flame rushed through the trees toward the highway an excavation the width of the east river was being ripped across the formerly peaceful countryside for miles the earth rocked and trembled the suction of the tremendous blast was so great that a dozen cars were caught in the fury of the air stream they slid from the highway catapulting into the ditches two automobiles were deposited up in the edge of the field through which the lurid blue blaze had rushed the cold light was flicked off instantly the tumult and fury of the main explosion died only the reverberations and echoes remained at the scene of the apparent origin of the tearing explosion when the first state police arrived was only an immense crater here the woods and all the surrounding territory had been gouged out to great depths an area of more than ten acres was a deep excavation not a stick or even the splinter of a tree remained it was as if the house with its exotically furnished living room had never existed though the cold light had deliberately sought out the sedan of wheeze mcgovern the car had escaped its direct force other cars near by had hurtled from the highway even before the tearing chaos of the explosion had begun to die down globules of sweat were popping from wheeze mcgoverns forehead his double chin trembled and shook it siss got her step siss on it no wait ahead of the sedan a closed car had turned over in the ditch a woman was crawling from a window she was screaming blood ran from a cut on her forehead one arm dangled wheeze sprang from the car the woman moaned oh my son please my sons down in there wheeze got down and pulled the inert figure of a boy from the crashed auto the youth was undoubtedly past all human aid wheeze opened the rear door of the sedan and got the body inside then he helped the woman get in he followed now you can siss step on it plenty he wheezed the sedan whirled cityward the speed crept up past seventy miles an hour two motor cycle cops flagged the car down all hells busted loose back there rapped wheeze maybe a dozen people killed were getting this woman and the boy to a hospital the coppers saw five respectablelooking citizens the woman with the bloody face was an argument right assented one of the cops hope you make it in time the motor cycles sped on toward the scene of the explosion the policemen did not know when they passed a furtive figure behind the fence over in a field they did see a paintless roadster upended on its nose the little man known as scraggs crouched close to the yawning gash of the cold light explosion his luminous eyes glowed with hatred his tongue licked his thin lips with seeming satisfaction as he looked toward the place where the house had been chapter shadow of death doc savage used a plane to arrive at the scene of the latest cold light explosion he instructed his companions to be on their guard and await his return to the hangar before going to headquarters havoc wrought by the new blast was such as to have destroyed any further lead to the mysterious var a long islander divulged the information that a woman with a number of servants had occupied the house the woman had been there only a short time the house had been privately built several hours checkup would be necessary to discover its owner doc judged the cold light ray had been projected from an automobile the word of frightened witnesses bore out this theory the bronze man spent no more time here he was convinced that a woman had died returning to the hudson river hangar doc announced well go first to headquarters then have a look at that penthouse west of central park where monk was imprisoned vars men might not use it again but there are some things there i should examine we will take the exneutralizers with us reaching the skyscraper headquarters the four men ascended in the private highspeed elevator in the foggy street behind them a tall shadow moved from a doorway the mans hat was pulled low his eyes burned in the darkness waiting until doc and his companions had vanished the man drew out a cigarette case gently he tapped the smoke on the silver box he was watching the window of a tall building only a block away other windows in the row on that floor were lighted this one was distinguishable by its darkness but in its square back space glowed for an instant a tiny light it was as if a man had just lighted a cigarette the man in the street was computing the time required for one of the regular skyscraper elevators to reach the eightysixth floor unfamiliar with docs own speedy private cage the man had loitered in the building lobby for some time previously he had made a careful check on the elevator indicators he was sure he had the lifts timed to the second a full minute passed then seven seconds more the man flicked on his cigarette lighter he swung it in three small circles past his face then he stepped back into a doorway and applied the flame to his own smoke his next movement was fast with a bound he crossed the pavement and entered a lowslung car the gears screamed protest the driver took the first corner recklessly the car gathered speed a red traffic light loomed ahead the driver disregarded the signal shooting across between a car and a truck he heard a policemans whistle but he only smiled for he had timed everything to make sure he would be at a sufficient distance by the time the angered traffic cop overtook him if he did he was sure the policeman would have something else to take his attention doc and his men were a good three minutes ahead of the furtive mans carefully plotted schedule when they reached the eightysixth floor the outer door leading into the reception room opened doc stepped inside the bronze mans eyes went to the broken window his calculation and reaction was lightning fast doc glided to the inner door leading to the laboratory the door opened doc was carrying one of the exneutralizers his hands moved with incredible speed the electromagnetic ray laid its wall across one side of the big room cover the other side long tom he directed we are about to entertain the cold light ray again before he had finished speaking the cold light had sliced the laboratory the bluesteel ray cut through the thick wall of the building as if it were a fog bank howlin calamities grunted monk that fella var dont seem to know when to quit but the cold light was effectively blocked by the exneutralizer wall spreading its invisible fan from docs hands against this strange electromagnetic force it wavered and dissolved it played with weird effects across the retorts and polished spheres of the chemical and electrical equipment hold it said doc calmly here monk take the box weve had a visitor while we were gone if he had been able to replace that broken window i fear brothers we now would have joined the long list of vars victims while the cold light still played futilely against the invisible wall doc strode across the laboratory his eyes searched among the clutter of tubes and glasses on the laboratory tables not anywhere here he stated keep the exneutralizers at work even after the cold light leaves he might think to surprise us and flash it back docs surmise was correct the cold light vanished it was gone for a minute the bronze man continued his search finally he shook his head weve had a visitor he said slowly but he doesnt seem to have left a calling card the cold light came back for a second visit its play was briefer this time then it was switched off doc directed the exneutralizers be set to protect the laboratory while they armed themselves ham walked over to the laboratory sink immediately he called out to the others quick get out before the water hits these things he was scooping up the four globular poison pills and the two cubelike ones the dampened area from the dropping water was within an inch of touching the first of these ham had no doubt but that a trap of deadly gas had been set for all of them our visitor had it figured too closely said ham in another few minutes the place would have been full of the gas if thats what these things are intended to do we arrived just a little ahead of the killers schedule say scraggs knew where you put the poison pills doc looked at the white pellets lying in hams palm yes said doc vonier and carberry also knew the cold light might have been a diversion to keep our minds elsewhere ill take those pills ham we must find renny docs assured manner informed his men he had arrived at some definite conclusion which he was not yet ready to divulge long tom was bending in front of the leaden safe his nervous long fingers were rubbing across the door used the torch on this to get them out he remarked neat a job as i ever saw doc wrapped the pills in a silk handkerchief and placed them in his pocket doc savages intention to investigate the penthouse where monk had whipped a robot might have been a great relief to renny if he could have known of it for renny was conscious when he was carried up a stairway his eyes and mouth were taped but sound and his sense of direction informed him he was near central park renny had counted floors while on an elevator holy cow he grunted you wouldnt think the boobs would be that dumb its the same place they had monk or im no judge of descriptions this will be the first place doc will make for rennys elation at the apparent dumbness of his captors was only shortlived he was dumped roughly into a room this was so small it seemed to be little more than a narrow closet rennys huge body required considerable room the tape was suddenly and roughly torn from his eyes renny mumbled a bellow of rage through his sealed lips go on and howl big fellow said a hard voice youll be glad in a minute were letting you look everything over the man stepped back renny was amazed to discover he was looking through a doorway where there was no door the sides of the frame were of gleaming copper strips renny had been placed far back in the little room he was perhaps ten feet from this metalsided entrance the man who had spoken was standing with several others on the rug of a curiously painted room the walls were of aquamarine renny stared at the opposite side monks story of the metal man he had ripped apart was proved a glass door had been shattered an armless broken robot stood in the room back of the smashed entrance renny stared at one of the weird oil paintings it was that of the halfcrab halfhuman figure depicted as arising from the coralstrewn bottom of the sea so this was the picture on one of the colored plates in voniers little book renny wondered how doc had come upon that angle of voniers activities renny was sitting now with his back propped against the back wall of the closetlike room he looked sharply at the men outside he judged that var was not among those present one of the men said and right now big fellow youre figuring how you might roll yourself outta that nice little cell well just in case you try it ill give you something to think about the man was at least six or seven feet distant from the copperplated entrance he walked over to the far wall threw an electric switch and returned in his hand he held an ordinary walking stick with a thick rubber tip he reached with the cane and pressed on the rug several feet from the copper doorway instantly there came a wicked crackling an electrical current of high voltage leaped across the space of the entrance it played with vivid flashes youll notice its the works said the man with the cane and if my foot or your foot were where this cane is thered be nothing left but to bring on the lilies now big fellow its about six feet from where you are to the doorway the plate on your side starts only a few inches from where youre sitting renny could see he was hopelessly trapped his mind leaped to another angle of the ingenious death trap had vars monstrous crew thought of that he wasnt left long in doubt and now continued his tormentor we will leave you no doubt your brainy chief will think of this penthouse hell figure we wouldnt be dumb enough to come back here after your apefaced partner escaped but hell want to have a look anyway renny tried his muscles against the multiple cords so doc savage will be along presently the man went on we wont be visible but well be close by naturally hell make a hunt for you probably wont believe youre here until he sees you in this closet that will be pretty there you are you cant talk or move you can only use your eyes well leave a light on so you cant be missed no doubt the smart doc savage will immediately suspect the copper doorway is a trap but he cant know how far the plates reach under the rug so your chief will walk up close enough to inspect the device the man used the cane again like this the walking stick was sheathed with metal the rubber tip had been worn thinner than the man using it had noticed a blue electrical spark suddenly played along the cane it writhed and twisted around the mans hand with an oath frozen on his lips the victim succeeded in heaving himself free he rolled to the floor cursing wildly renny detected the odor of scorched skin and flesh the man got to his feet his body shaking he rubbed his burned hand his face was white chapter death threatens doc renny could only stare at the fiendish trap his tormentor had presented only facts even doc could have no reason to suspect other than that the doorway itself was highly charged renny groaned under the gagging tape he hoped doc and the others would believe it useless to visit the penthouse where monk had been held but at this moment four figures were emerging from the skylight of a roof less than half a block from the penthouse so up heres where you chewed up an armored robot grinned ham maliciously at monk and it didnt seem to make even a dent in that prognathous jaw daggone it squeaked monk ill bet thats an insult doc cautioned silence long tom was following him closely as they kept near the coping walls along the street side of the roofs long tom was carrying one of the exneutralizers and monk was burdened with the other doc expected to find the penthouse deserted he reached the shelter of a chimney where he could see the structure rearing above the apartment house roof to his surprise the windows of the penthouse glowed with mellow light directing the others to keep back in the shelter of the shadows the bronze man glided forward in the vague light his movement could hardly be detected so swiftly he moved from one shadow to another doc flattened himself beside one of the windows he was looking into the room with vivid blue paintings he saw the illustration about which monk had exclaimed in voniers book he saw another painting the same figures had been in voniers book it looked as if the author had caused the room to be created the bronze man considered the relation of this room to the emotionless explorer doc was using one thumb against the window casing with only the pressure of this he was slowly raising the sash the room was in confusion the drawers of a desk had been pulled out a few papers were strewn on the floor there was other evidence that several persons had taken a hasty departure a door which apparently led to a stairway was partly open a mans hat and one glove lay on the floor near this exit a bottle of ink had been spilled on the expensive rug it was logical the var men might have fled hastily after monks escape though a night had passed if no person had visited the penthouse it was not unreasonable to suppose the lights might have burned all day docs instinctive senses put him on guard one bronzed hand gestured his companions to stay back he eased himself into the room docs figure was fully revealed he judged if this were a trap the time had come for it to be sprung nothing happened the bronze man studied the marine paintings intently from an inner pocket he brought out voniers thin book after a brief comparison he nodded from another pocket came another book this second volume was not illustrated it was a leatherbound volume but its text was printed in bright blue ink looking at the picture of the halfcrab halfhuman figure doc started reading the accompanying text when from across the room came a muffled guttural sound as if some one were strangling doc sought its source he saw the closetlike room into which renny had been crowded his keen eyes saw the engineers hunched figure though bound hand and foot his mouth taped renny was going through queer contortions doc strode across the larger room now he could see rennys position more clearly the big mans eyes were blinking rapidly his head shook violently he was trying to warn doc of something the bronze man moved closer he was only about eight feet from the doorway renny moaned under the tape he reared to his heels he lunged forward heaving his big body directly toward the concealed death plates in his loyalty to the bronze man the giant engineer counted his own life a slight sacrifice if he could only strike the hidden peril in such manner as to prevent doc savage being electrocuted renny felt it would be much more than worth the price instinct developed in many situations of extreme danger brought instant understanding to doc as renny hurled himself toward the doorway docs own springy body left the floor the almost simultaneous action of the two men carried their leaping bodies clear of the floor they were for the moment as agile and fast as two great apes of the jungle two bodies cannot remain suspended for more than the fraction of a second renny knowing the truth groaned deeply in midair he had accomplished nothing doc would die along with him the striking of their weight would make the fatal contact monk as ever venturing beyond where he had been instructed to go had reached the window opened by doc he had watched the bronze man as he paused in the face of danger to read a book examine the paintings now he witnessed the inexplicable action of his chief monk could not possibly reach either of the flying figures to his awestruck senses it seemed as if the bronze man and renny were bent upon annihilating each other the purpose of this monk could not fathom his own instinct told him this was his cue to do something it was not within human possibility to reach either of the men monk did the next possible thing he had no conception of what it would accomplish the exneutralizer box was in his hands monk flicked the switch the focusing slot of the invisible wall was pointed directly at the copperlined doorway renny and doc collided in midair big as he was the breath hissed from rennys lungs he strove to make his weight hurl doc backward they dropped together upon the rug between the deadly copper plates there was a lurid blinding flash of highfrequency current like the bursting of a freakish floating ball of lightning the side of the room where the switch was concealed exploded in blue smoke and yellow flame renny and doc rolled over together rennys breath was gone his ankles and his wrists were still tightly bound he had leaped with the propelling force of his corded leg muscles docs quick hand pulled the tape from the engineers mouth holy cow doc renny gasped as darkness enfolded them are we dead im all right replied doc bounding to his feet well remove these cords were due to have visitors monk stood for a moment in petrified silence as yet he hardly realized what he had done then he heard renny and doc speaking and the apelike engineer exhaled a mighty breath of relief howlin calamities he grunted somethin sure busted somethin the something had been the invisible wall of the exneutralizer before either doc or renny had hit the concealed plates intended for the bronze mans electrocution the electromagnetic ray had flashed through the closet doorway the invisible wall had the effect of interposing an insulating nonconducting element in the space across which the highvoltage current would have jumped this intangible yet powerful force had cut the circuit in such a manner as to short circuit the highpowered wires at the hidden switchboard fuses and a part of the board had gone out with these went the house lights the strange room with its aquamarine paintings was instantly a dark cavern even as docs fast hands were slitting the cords off renny men were pouring into the room it didnt get em snarled a voice i heard them speak we cant take chances now let em have it the bronze mans shoulder struck renny and heaved him far to one side they rolled to the far wall on the deep rug half a dozen flashes mingled with the vicious whiplike crackling of silenced pistols leaden slugs were ripping into the coppersheathed door frame the bronze man was holding one of the anaesthetic gas capsules the gas capsule would have rendered any number of men helpless but vars force was strong doc divined that not all were in the room before renny and he could make their way out renny might be hit by the gas the engineer was not capable of holding his breath half as long as doc more bullets were being poured across the room doc felt the searing touch of one across his neck renny grunted a slug was buried in his shoulder the bronze man caught renny and made another gliding change of base there came the sound of crashing blows monk was shouting ill pulverize y for that look out warned one of vars men theres another one here the speech was sliced off with the cracking splintering impact of a blow a box was shattered monk had swung the exneutralizer box as a weapon the man who had spoken and another man crashed down in the darkness the unexpected landing of the apelike chemist into their midst was the beginning of a frenzied battle vars men were striking each other in an effort to put their unseen foe out of business monks long arms reached out and enfolded victim after victim when he drove them together some heads were irreparably damaged others were merely knocked senseless vars men had ceased shooting they were so tangled and scattered by monks steam roller attack as to lose all sense of direction those still on their feet could see only the dim square of light coming from below it marked the secret stairway from the penthouse a few of monks victims were breathing heavily from the floor then renny let out a bellow stop it monk you wanta break my neck renny heaved once he was more than a match for the apelike monk the chemist smashed into one of the oil paintings there was momentary silence the whole battle had taken up less than two minutes docs pencil of light from his generator flash picked out eight men huddled on the floor the bronze man gave several faces a brief study the only way brothers we can help these men is to remove the temptation that drew them into this doc stated theyre men of brains surgical treatment would do them no good remove the power of var and theyll return to their professions the sound of the retreating survivors of the encounter was dying out theres only one thing here we want doc stated using the flashlight he slit one of the oil paintings free from the wall with swift strokes of a knife it was the picture of the halfcrab halfhuman form the oil work was on canvas secured by its edges to the wall of the room then doc said its strange long tom and ham arent here they must have heard the shooting the three men hurried through the open window to the roof doc called out neither ham nor long tom replied the bronze man led the way gliding over a roof coping three bodies were lying near an open skylight it was quickly revealed that none of the three was ham or long tom bending over one of the bodies doc pointed out hams sword got him the unconscious mans cheek had been pierced by the keen point of hams cane sword blade the anaesthetic drug had done its work the same treatment had been parceled out to the other two examination showed the skylight of this roof had been smashed there was a small pool of blood near by excited voices were coming up from the floor below doc led monk and renny in a swift descent panicky residents of the apartment house were pouring into the hallways doc quickly learned a number of men had tramped through the upper corridor they had pushed their way to the roof one man had heard the scuffling noises of a fight then they came tumbling back down this man said they were carrying one man he had a camera box in his hands they had handcuffs on another man he looked like a gentleman funny come to think of it all of them looked like gentlemen the other exneutralizer groaned renny that lays us wide open to the cold light ray doesnt it doc since monk smashed our other exneutralizer in the fight well not worry too much about that said doc quietly weve first got to find ham and long tom come on brothers i have a feeling we shall have visitors very soon at headquarters chapter three visitors the visitors to doc savages headquarters numbered three the explorer vonier was the first doc noted that throughout all of the crowded events of the past fortyeight hours the explorers fixed expression of cold detachment had not varied vonier drew the bronze man quickly to one side just in case something happens we cant control id like you to know one or two facts that might help you he offered this cold light or the destructive force it represents contains one element to be found only at the greatest depths to which man has ever descended in the ocean the explorers smile gave him a derisive cynical look id guessed that doc replied quietly i got the hint of it directly from a book vonier started perceptibly his intense blue eyes became like sword thrusts yes he said from a book youve known then that i knew could hardly avoid that said doc seeing you wrote the book marvelous murmured vonier for the past two days and nights you havent slept youve been threatened by death from many directions yet during that time youve read a book two books to be exact smiled the bronze man they are oddly alike in many parts though others are dissimilar by the way vonier do you count artistic conception among your other varied accomplishments voniers reply was surprisingly direct defiant no he said im not an artist i didnt paint the pictures in the penthouse if thats what you mean now youll be asking well yes interrupted doc where have you been during the day and thus far tonight many places and alone mostly ive been very busy i judged you had said doc so you havent been much comfort to carberry i imagined he would stick by you carberry had several phone calls vonier stated he went away to attend to some important business he was still greatly scared but he said he would meet me here tonight just then the headquarters had a visitor it was the financier carberry carberrys first words were i hear theres been another big explosion im almost afraid to walk in the streets ive called the police commissioner and asked for a special police bodyguard i think hell be sending them up here we will give you all the protection possible doc stated we employ our own methods and call upon the police only when some matter should be brought to their attention indeed well you see savage im terribly sorry stammered carberry ill call the commissioner at once i feel safer with you than i would with a squad of coppers let me have never mind interjected doc ive been in touch with the commissioner he told me of your request ive already instructed him not to send his men the commissioner himself is paying us a visit in a few minutes oh thats all right then mumbled the financier i suppose then youve turned those poison pills over to him no stated doc i shall analyze them myself some one tried releasing the poison gas to trap us so im carrying the pills with me carberry gasped carrying them with you savage his protruding eyes rolled dont you fear well mightnt something happen the immediate entrance of the police commissioner interrupted doc from giving an answer the police commissioner was a stocky redfaced man for good reasons involving countless past services his faith in doc savage was boundless he had met both vonier and carberry while he did not ignore the importance of the financier or the cause of his fear of death the commissioners attitude was abrupt after all though he was a world figure carberry was but one individual the safety of millions had now been in the balance for two days and two nights weve got those men from the penthouse the commissioner announced weve been checking not one has ever been mugged we find they are doctors professors and the like of that only two have any kind of records we believe they have been international spies in europe doc nodded this confirmed his quick analysis in the penthouse none of these men had the kind of brains requiring the usual treatment for the reformation of crooks carberry arose his terror seemed to be returning in force i just remembered he said i think i should go out and put in a call to mrs carberry i want to know she is still safe you could call from here suggested doc wait a minute interrupted the commissioner i think mr carberry should stay with us in fact all of us have something we ought to do at once ive a dozen carloads of men on the way but i came directly because i have to admit im afraid they cant stop this one holy cow muttered renny arent things never goin to quiet down we havent any clue to your two men mr savage the commissioner went on but we have a phoned report that the hudson river warehouse where you keep your planes is to be the next spot visited by the cold light we must proceed to the hangar at once doc stated well have to do what we can to get the employees to safety some of the workers are too loyal to flee from any danger i know said the commissioner we tried warning them by phone get out the extra bulletproof vests doc instructed commissioner you and the others need the protection i believe this is much more involved than a mere threat to destroy the hangar it is a deliberate scheme to have us go out there if you think it is a trap began the commissioner we shall go said doc quietly perhaps vonier and carberry would rather remain here wouldnt miss it for a million vonier said promptly i wouldnt feel safe anywhere but with you doc savage declared carberry doc was holding an extra bulletproof vest in his hands weve all got our vests doc said monk why are you taking that one a thin voice interrupted from the doorway of the outer office your hudson river hangar is the next place var intends to hit doc savage scraggs was standing there his thin face was gray i have been expecting you replied doc this vest is too big for you but you will be wise to put it on scraggss sunken eyes were staring now at carberry much the same as he had looked at vonier a few hours previously with ham and long tom missing there was ample room for the four extra men in docs armored car the bronze man sent the motor at high speed across town all streets in the vicinity of the hangar were deserted the commissioner had caused police lines to be drawn several blocks from the innocentappearing old warehouse this building housed doc savages latest in planes his dirigible and two types of submarines as they passed the final police line doc glanced at vonier carberry and scraggs i would suggest you leave us here i will go ahead with my men and have the watchman and the other men get out id prefer to be in at the finish remarked vonier crisply ive a funny hunch this will be some sort of a showdown i i wouldnt want to stay here alone carberry quavered i mean with the police id like to go along im seeing this through came the positive voice of scraggs doc never wasted words in argument the strangely matched pair the explorer and the financier had made their own choice if they could have seen docs flakygold eyes at the moment they would have guessed the bronze man was not ignoring their safety as much as it seemed for doc savage had arrived at a direct conclusion with regard to the cold light ray and its explosive effect by simple elimination of certain facts he had reached the point of knowing much more than the men accompanying him would have believed doc was convinced there would be an explosion but right now he was equally sure he had discovered the means of controlling the blast and its effect and he had no intention of seeing the hangar destroyed the police lines took in a half circle about a half mile distant from the warehouse hangar more than five hundred coppers all heavily armed and instructed to permit no one to pass formed the guarding ring police patrol launches guarded the river side the coppers looked apprehensively at the dark canyons of nearby deserted streets close to the hangar the roundup had been made but this had not included buildings which seemed vacant in the lower part of another old warehouse were four automobiles each of these cars carried eight or ten men doc swung the car in front of the hangar he regularly employed a crew of a dozen mechanics and others entering the hangar doc ordered all his employees to depart from what he considered the danger zone surrounding the hangar all excepting one mechanic the rest of you wait here doc instructed his companions im sending up a plane its just an idea that came to me you mean youre going up queried carberry rather a big chance to take isnt it savage came from vonier remember what happened to the red arrow ship or would have if it hadnt been for you no i wont be going up said doc just the plane accompanied by the mechanic the bronze man quickly moved one of the amphibian planes the little ship was equipped with a radiocontrolling robot but unlike the plane in which doc had been sent out over the ocean this ship had alternative hand controls the radiorobot could be cut off at any time by a pilot in the ship he then could handle the plane in the usual manner the police commissioner went back with the departing hangar employees to issue further instructions to his police lines renny and monk started an immediate prowl of the building apparently no one remained vonier and carberry were left standing together carberry especially seemed to prefer being where the light was brightest scraggs glanced furtively around then he vanished with the quick movement of a scuttling small animal carberry remarked to vonier savage seems invincible nothing gets by him but im afraid this time he hasnt much of an idea what makes the cold light vonier smiled thinly at the financier he said to put doc savage out of the running youd have to get inside his mind for example right in the middle of this turmoil and threats he stops to read a book carberrys eyes protruded more than ever read a book he queried what book oh the little thing i did on marine energy replied vonier lightly perhaps he thought he had something there from the nearby warehouse men were moving they were keeping in deep shadows doc savage had ordered roof and river landing lights of his hangar on at their brightest carberry and vonier remained near the open street door in a nearer shadow inside the hangar scraggs was moving to concealment he watched intently as doc savage and the mechanic got the small plane into its dockage ready for a takeoff from the broad river scraggs watched until he saw the man of bronze climb into the planes cabin the mechanic wound up the inertia starter apparently it was docs hand on the throttle the bronze man revved the motor with a warming burst he remained in the cabin several minutes then he idled the motor and emerged well leave it idle the bronze man stated ill give it the gun with the radio controls when im ready with the mechanic beside him doc started back across the hangar sudden shouts harsh oaths and the sound of blows broke from the vicinity of the street door of the warehouse doc glided into a run the mechanic was close at his heels half a dozen men swooped into the light where carberry and vonier were standing a blow sent the explorer to his knees two men had seized his arms he was being propelled toward the shadows carberry was putting up a stiff fight though a man of slight weight the financier was surprisingly effective nor now that he was in physical combat did he seem afraid with catlike movements carberry had disposed of two of his attackers before doc and the mechanic could make it halfway across the floor another man seized the financier only to go somersaulting over carberrys head but more men were pouring into the building carberry saw them coming suddenly his nerve seemed to desert him the financier turned and darted across the inside of the warehouse vonier had shaken off his two attackers to docs amazement the explorer also took to his heels he ran after carberry renny and monk came bursting from behind a plane there were now more than a score of men they had started to pursue carberry and vonier rennys sledgehammer fists disposed of four men in quick order monk whooped shrilly and his long arms flailed a disconcerting broadside of knuckles and elbows into the leaders of the rush to grab carberry then a pistol flashed and another let em have it wheezed a high voice look out heres doc savage himself over the arm of the moonfaced man with the rathole in the middle of his countenance for a mouth appeared the snout of a machine gun he turned it directly upon the bronze man any one looking on would have sworn doc merely sidestepped the stream of slugs without great effort the fact was docs reactions under a pointed weapon were a splitsecond ahead of the gunmans trigger finger wheeze mcgovern cursed and sought to bring the machine gun directly upon the slithering figure of the bronze man the mechanic groaned with pain and sank to the ground some of the bullets had got him in the stomach doc became a moving streak hurtling himself straight upon wheeze and his crackling gun with all his massive weight he dived under the tearing streak of death one shoulder struck wheezes stubby legs there was a sharp crack doc rammed his head upward with one leg broken and all the breath gone from his body wheeze dropped his weapon as doc came to his feet he saw that renny and monk were being overwhelmed by numbers renny was handicapped already by having a bullet in one shoulder as the result of the penthouse battle now he had a furrow across one temple and he was staggering groggily monk cracked the heads of two men together his favorite pastime then he sprang to rennys assistance a pistol butt crashed down on the chemists head and sent him to his knees doc savage exploded suddenly in the midst of the attackers his arrival had about the same effect as a cyclone ripping through a field of dry corn docs iron knuckles played at the ends of his corded arms with a speed too fast for the human eye to follow when his knuckles landed one man stayed down though there had been some shooting the invaders of the warehouse were now too closely packed to use their pistols nor did doc or his men attempt the use of weapons in the bright light it was mкlйe for fists and muscles a group of six men remained on their feet seeing their leader wheeze mcgovern was out they started a retreat as they withdrew two men drew their pistols they now had a free play at doc and his two companions they snarled hard laughs as they aimed the guns two figures came lithely from the street outside they were disheveled objects cords still trailed from the legs of one handcuffs held the wrists of both men the mistake of wheeze mcgovern had been that he had not manacled the mens hands behind them long tom was a slight specimen of manhood he looked frail compared to any other of docs men but he could make the average man very sick indeed in a fistic encounter this time long tom had an advantage he swung the heavy handcuffs in sweeping arcs two men were mowed down with bleeding heads ham the lawyer was quick as light his favorite weapon was his trusty sword blade lacking this the steel handcuffs seemed to serve very well the manacles crashed on three heads before the men could get themselves set almost abruptly there were only four or five men left of the gang and these were running toward the street they wont find the cars theyre looking for panted ham long tom tore out their ignition wire doc was starting toward the door of the lighted radio control room keep an eye on all of these men he instructed you neednt trouble about the one with the machine gun he has serious trouble with his legs doc was in the door of the control room a slim figure ran past the edge of the lighted area the running man was scraggs he vanished in the direction carberry and vonier had taken neither the explorer nor the financier had reappeared although all pursuit was definitely ended doc stood before the radio controls he closed a switch in its takeoff dock the motor of his small plane roared on fuller throttle the bronze mans hand moved over to the impulse that would control the takeoff his hand never reached it the little ship suddenly lifted its tail and moved out upon the river gathering speed its nose lifted under an expert hand some one was in the radiocontrolled plane it was being zoomed into the air in the direction of the ocean by a human hand docs eyes held little golden whirlwinds of light he knew the mystery pilot of the zooming plane believed him still to be carrying the poison pills in his pocket chapter the runaway plane the police commissioner was in the doorway of the radio control room he stared at doc savage docs feet were braced wide apart he was looking up at the sky through the observation window youre sending up a plane with the radio robot questioned the commissioner whats the idea mr savage it was my idea to send up a plane with the radio stated doc tersely now its another idea altogether and i dont know but its a good one renny appeared beside the commissioner he was mopping blood from his long solemn face holy cow doc he exclaimed i thought all the time that skullfaced explorer would bear watching hes in that plane i saw him run over that way ham pushed his way in youre wrong renny this time he interposed its that ratty little fellow scraggs i was watching him making for the plane when doc came in here hes making a getaway doc smiled a little time will tell us that and it wont be such a long time either he said has carberry returned not him supplied monk the last i saw of him he was high tailin for the police lines doc was watching the riding lights of the small plane the ship had been sent steadily upward it was nearly two miles high and its lights had faded in the fog only the thin drone of its motor could be heard hope he stays that far up said doc crisply just the same id advise all of you to get back toward the police lines i could switch off the hangar lights but id rather have him come back over the river than try landing some other place why do you think hell come back said the commissioner doubtfully i think whoever it is hes making his getaway hell probably land somewhere up or down the coast ill get to one of the cars and send in a radio warning to be on the lookout for him that will hardly be necessary smiled doc the others obeyed the suggestion they listened they heard nothing only docs keenly tuned auditory nerves had detected the thrumming of the planes motor growing steadily louder in fact doc was the only one among them who had not lost the vibration altogether even at its farthest point away the bronze man had judged the plane to be nearly two miles high and still climbing the enigmatic smile deepened across docs bronze jaws he alone knew that the mysterious pilot of the runaway plane was expecting to hurl destruction upon the warehouse hangar that the man at the controls was var himself var at this instant was sure he had the means of striking one mighty blow a blow that would not only wipe out docs hangar but end the lives of all of docs men and the police commissioner moreover doc was now sure that vars own men had turned upon him he could read only one answer to the attack of wheeze mcgovern mcgovern vars chief aide had made an effort to steal the cold light gun he lacked only this to complete the combination that would make him the master of the shattering annihilator once in possession of the gun wheeze mcgovern had planned to embark on a career of crime with his own selected companions they had seen the chance to extort millions from fearcrazed millionaires doc was sure wheeze mcgovern never would obtain that gun its owner was flying high high in the sky over the man he most feared and hated doc savage and his four valiant companions by a change of wind the others now could hear the increasing beat of the planes propeller making for some inland field said the commissioner hes taking on altitude thinking well have planes after him hes taking on altitude replied doc but not through fear of any other plane he believes hes putting himself far enough up to be beyond the danger of his own deviltry i dont understand the commissioner began his words were lost in a shattering explosion only doc had seen that instantaneous flash of the cold light ray it was no more than the thousandth part of a second for the cold light had no distance to travel to reach its objective a lurid cloud of blue flame spread across the heavens its weird illumination made all faces in the group seem pockmarked and gray indeed the face of the commissioner was a chalky gray the blue cloud was only a momentary flash that lighted the sky from horizon to horizon the blast was like the impact of a battleship broadside the air about the group in the warehouse chilled all of the hangar lights went out as if a master switch had been pulled then the silence was so complete each man thought his eardrums had been hopelessly shattered docs radio plane had totally dissolved as if it had never been from the lack of any tiny bit of falling wreckage it was conceivable that the terrible closeup force of the cold light explosion had disintegrated the ship into all of its component atoms and with the ship the man whose ghostly voice had announced i am var renny was the first to find speech blazes he muttered hoarsely so thats the last of our friend vonier ham found his voice and spoke in the darkness that rat scraggs you mean he rapped out two voices murmured close by footsteps approached slowly who is speaking of us inquired the calm voice of the explorer were here to talk for ourselves the eyes of vonier were like bits of shiny blue glass against the light beside him was the thin shambling figure of the little man scraggs i rather thought you would be around somewhere said doc savage quietly i admit i was quite a bit mixed up for a while but after i discovered carberry had written his book on the cellular origin of the human species from oil paintings he had copied from your book vonier i made some other inquiries howlin calamities squeaked out monk and he was with us most of the time some of the time corrected doc but at no time when he was trying to explode the cold light bombs what do you mean doc cold light bombs questioned ham ive never seen anything but the cold light itself you carried some of them in your pocket for quite a while ham said doc i seem to recall you rescued all of us from being poisoned by gas you thought the intention was to kill all of us in the laboratory by having them dampened good gosh exploded monk and that shyster tries to pulverize all of us with that weak brain of his i wonder mused renny who had just thought of something say monk maybe ham didnt do so bad come to think of it you tried eating one of the bombs in that manhattan tenement you thought it was only a gumdrop long tom broke in listen doc he exclaimed excitedly you had six of the things in your pocket thats what carberry thought said doc calmly in fact i had them when we came here it was my idea to send them up in that plane and dive it into the ocean i had hidden them in the plane and carberry thought it was his chance to destroy his enemies you see some of his own men were doublecrossing him if id had the cold light bombs in my pocket it would have wiped them out as well as us in a way he was driven to it for this wheeze mcgovern had turned on him the little man scraggs was muttering and i discovered who var was just too late he complained i was almost sure and i learned where his wife was hiding i was on my way out there tonight when carberry met wheeze mcgoverns car on the highway i guess carberry suspected wheeze and tried to stop him with the cold light you knew there was something more some element other than the cold light ray that caused the explosions doc suggested yes i knew there was some sort of combination for jackson had told me that admitted scraggs but it was only after i saw in your laboratory those pills you thought were poison that i got a real idea what the bombs might be thats why i started out to find mrs carberry i had a hunch the supply of bombs would be wherever she was hiding mcgovern must have grabbed the bombs from the woman scraggs shook his head sadly that was a terrible thing he went on the cold light missed mcgoverns car mcgovern had the rest of the cold light bombs thousands of them in insulated boxes but the ray would have exploded one of the uninsulated bombs if it came within a tenmile radius thats why carberrys wife never knew what happened i imagine mcgovern had left some of the bombs open with that purpose but interposed the police commissioner how about the explosion at carberrys mansion the voice he heard that every one heard among other things i learned carberry had been an actor a character man before he became wealthy doc stated he married a young actress after the murder of jackson the old chemist they had it all fixed to put on a show a red herring across any trail the police might pick up thats right said scraggs eagerly only they had me fooled jackson had told me there was to be a test in the woods at the carberry place to frighten the millionaire a fluttering figure came running from the street door it was the same lovely girl who had appeared at the smashed red arrow plane looking for scraggs all were amazed when she threw her arms around the disreputableappearing little man scraggs honey she exclaimed are you all right scraggs looked at the others sheepishly but his thin arms went around the girl meet muriel jackson gentlemen he said in a thin proud voice you see it was her father well i had to get his murderer the girls face was bathed in tears she hugged the scraggly head to her bosom well ill be daggoned sputtered monk the homely chemist had a weakness for beautiful women doc turned to vonier you suspected carberry from the first didnt you the bronze man questioned but you werent sure right again as usual savage said the explorer old jackson read my book and came to me to explain his experiments with an element i had mentioned found in the depths of the sea i told him it would be best to let it alone he said he wanted the army and navy to have it i wasnt sure he had gone to carberry but he mentioned having read the mans book and how like my own it seemed to be so i suspected he went to carberry strange what angles a normally intelligent brain will take doc said slowly carberry had a rich mans traditional respect for property rights he owned that manhattan block he blew up he was one of the biggest stockholders in the railroad and he tried to blast the express in trying to cover up his trail he laid the broadest possible one for his own detection he was especially good at laying false trails added vonier he used a special bright blue ink in writing warning notes it happens i had used that same sort of ink i have a bottle of it in my study carberry adopted it that clears that up doc stated i have seen the ink on your desk vonier saw it on my desk yes replied the bronze man when i visited your study to confirm a few deductions arising from your rather remarkable book is there anything on land or sea or in the sky you overlook savage docs quiet bronze smile was his only reply the end
