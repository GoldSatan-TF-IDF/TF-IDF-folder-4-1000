terry pratchett pyramids book i the book of going forth nothing but stars scattered across the blackness as though the creator had smashed the windscreen of his car and hadnt bothered to stop to sweep up the pieces this is the gulf between universes the chill deeps of space that contain nothing but the occasional random molecule a few lost comets and but a circle of blackness shifts slightly the eye reconsiders perspective and what was apparently the awesome distance of interstellar wossname becomes a world under darkness its stars the lights of what will charitably be called civilisation for as the world tumbles lazily it is revealed as the discworld flat circular and carried through space on the back of four elephants who stand on the back of great atuin the only turtle ever to feature on the hertzsprungrussell diagram a turtle ten thousand miles long dusted with the frost of dead comets meteorpocked albedoeyed noone knows the reason for all this but it is probably quantum much that is weird could happen on a world on the back of a turtle like that its happening already the stars below are campfires out in the desert and the lights of remote villages high in the forested mountains towns are smeared nebulae cities are vast constellations the great sprawling city of ankhmorpork for example glows like a couple of colliding galaxies but here away from the great centres of population where the circle sea meets the desert there is a line of cold blue fire flames as chilly as the slopes of hell roar towards the sky ghostly light flickers across the desert the pyramids in the ancient valley of the djel are flaring their power into the night the energy streaming up from their paracosmic peaks may in chapters to come illuminate many mysteries why tortoises hate philosophy why too much religion is bad for goats and what it is that handmaidens actually do it will certainly show what our ancestors would be thinking if they were alive today people have often speculated about this would they approve of modern society they ask would they marvel at presentday achievements and of course this misses a fundamental point what our ancestors would really be thinking if they were alive today is why is it so dark in here in the cool of the river valley dawn the high priest dios opened his eyes he didnt sleep these days he couldnt remember when he last slept sleep was too close to the other thing and anyway he didnt seem to need it just lying down was enough at least just lying down here the fatigue poisons dwindled away like everything else for a while long enough anyway he swung his legs off the slab in the little chamber with barely a conscious prompting from his brain his right hand grasped the snakeentwined staff of office he paused to make another mark on the wall pulled his robe around him and stepped smartly down the sloping passage and out into the sunlight the words of the invocation of the new sun already lining up in his mind the night was forgotten the day was ahead there was much careful advice and guidance to be given and dios existed only to serve dios didnt have the oddest bedroom in the world it was just the oddest bedroom anyone has ever walked out of and the sun toiled across the sky many people have wondered why some people think a giant dung beetle pushes it as explanations go it lacks a certain technical edge and has the added drawback that as certain circumstances may reveal it is possibly correct it reached sundown without anything particularly unpleasant happening to it and its dying rays chanced to shine in through a window in the city of ankhmorpork and gleam off a mirror it was a fulllength mirror all assassins had a fulllength mirror in their rooms because it would be a terrible insult to anyone to kill them when you were badly dressed teppic examined himself critically the outfit had cost him his last penny and was heavy on the black silk it whispered as he moved it was pretty good at least the headache was going it had nearly crippled him all day hed been in dread of having to start the run with purple spots in front of his eyes he sighed and opened the black box and took out his rings and slipped them on another box held a set of knives of klatchian steel their blades darkened with lamp black various cunning and intricate devices were taken from velvet bags and dropped into pockets a couple of longbladed throwing tlingos were slipped into their sheaths inside his boots a thin silk line and folding grapnel were wound around his waist over the chainmail shirt a blowpipe was attached to its leather thong and dropped down his back under his cloak teppic pocketed a slim tin container with an assortment of darts their tips corked and their stems braillecoded for ease of selection in the dark he winced checked the blade of his rapier and slung the baldric over his right shoulder to balance the bag of lead slingshot ammunition as an afterthought he opened his sock drawer and took a pistol crossbow a flask of oil a roll of lockpicks and after some consideration a punch dagger a bag of assorted caltraps and a set of brass knuckles teppic picked up his hat and checked its lining for the coil of cheesewire he placed it on his head at a jaunty angle took a last satisfied look at himself in the mirror turned on his heel and very slowly fell over it was high summer in ankhmorpork in fact it was more than high it was stinking the great river was reduced to a lavalike ooze between ankh the city with the better address and morpork on the opposite bank morpork was not a good address morpork was twinned with a tar pit there was not a lot that could be done to make morpork a worse place a direct hit by a meteorite for example would count as gentrification most of the river bed was a honeycomb crust of cracked mud currently the sun appeared to be a big copper gong nailed to the sky the heat that had dried up the river fried the city by day and baked it by night curling ancient timbers turning the traditional slurry of the streets into a drifting choking ochre dust it wasnt ankhmorporks proper weather it was by inclination a city of mists and drips of slithers and chills it sat panting on the crisping plains like a toad on a firebrick and even now around midnight the heat was stifling wrapping the streets like scorched velvet searing the air and squeezing all the breath out of it high in the north face of the assassins guildhouse there was a click as a window was pushed open teppic who had with considerable reluctance divested himself of some of the heavier of his weapons took a deep draught of the hot dead air this was it this was the night they said you had one chance in two unless you drew old mericet as examiner in which case you might as well cut your throat right at the start teppic had mericet for strategy and poison theory every thursday afternoon and didnt get along with him the dormitories buzzed with rumours about mericet the number of kills the astonishing technique hed broken all the records in his time they said hed even killed the patrician of ankhmorpork not the present one that is one of the dead ones maybe it would be nivor who was fat and jolly and liked his food and did traps and deadfalls on tuesdays teppic was good at traps and got on well with the master or it could be the kompt de yoyo who did modern languages and music teppic was gifted at neither but the kompt was a keen edificeer and liked boys who shared his love of dangling by one hand high above the city streets he stuck one leg over the sill and unhitched his line and grapnel he hooked the gutter two floors up and slipped out of the window no assassin ever used the stairs in order to establish continuity with later events this may be the time to point out that the greatest mathematician in the history of the discworld was lying down and peacefully eating his supper it is interesting to note that owing to this mathematicians particular species what he was eating for his supper was his lunch gongs around the ankhmorpork sprawl were announcing midnight when teppic crept along the ornate parapet four storeys above filigree street his heart pounding there was a figure outlined against the afterglow of the sunset teppic paused alongside a particularly repulsive gargoyle to consider his options fairly solid classroom rumour said that if he inhumed his examiner before the test that was an automatic pass he slipped a number three throwing knife from its thigh sheath and hefted it thoughtfully of course any attempt any overt move which missed would attract immediate failure and loss of privileges the silhouette was absolutely still teppics eyes swivelled to the maze of chimneys gargoyles ventilator shafts bridges and ladders that made up the rooftop scenery of the city right he thought thats some sort of dummy im supposed to attack it and that means hes watching me from somewhere else will i be able to spot him no on the other hand maybe im meant to think its a dummy unless hes thought of that as well he found himself drumming his fingers on the gargoyle and hastily pulled himself together what is the sensible course of action at this point a party of revellers staggered through a pool of light in the street far below teppic sheathed the knife and stood up sir he said i am here a dry voice by his ear said rather indistinctly very well teppic stared straight ahead mericet appeared in front of him wiping grey dust off his bony face he took a length of pipe out of his mouth and tossed it aside then pulled a clipboard out of his coat he was bundled up even in this heat mericet was the kind of person who could freeze in a volcano ah he said his voice broadcasting disapproval mr teppic well well a fine night sir said teppic the examiner gave him a chilly look suggesting that observations about the weather acquired an automatic black mark and made a note on his clipboard well take a few questions first he said as you wish sir what is the maximum permitted length of a throwing knife snapped mericet teppic closed his eyes hed spent the last week reading nothing but the cordat he could see the page now floating tantalisingly just inside his eyelids they never ask you lengths and weights students had said knowingly they expect you to bone up on the weights and lengths and throwing distances but they never naked terror hotwired his brain and kicked his memory into gear the page sprang into focus maximum length of a throwing knife may be ten finger widths or twelve in wet weather he recited throwing distance is name three poisons acknowledged for administration by ear a breeze sprang up but it did nothing to cool the air it just shifted the heat about sir wasp agaric achorion purple and mustick sir said teppic promptly why not spime snapped mericet fast as a snake teppics jaw dropped open he floundered for a while trying to avoid the gimlet gaze a few feet away from him ssir spime isnt a poison sir he managed it is an extremely rare antidote to certain snake venoms and is obtained he settled down a bit more certain of himself all those hours idly looking through the old dictionaries had paid off is obtained from the liver of the inflatable mongoose which what is the meaning of this sign said mericet is found only in the teppics voice trailed off he squinted down at the complex rune on the card in mericets hand and then stared straight past the examiners ear again i havent the faintest idea sir he said out of the corner of his ear he thought he heard the faintest intake of breath the tiniest seed of a satisfied grunt but if it were the other way up sir he went on it would be thiefsign for noisy dogs in this house there was absolute silence for a moment then right by his shoulder the old assassins voice said is the killing rope permitted to all categories sir the rules call for three questions sir teppic protested ah and that is your answer is it sir no sir it was an observation sir sir the answer you are looking for is that all categories may bear the killing rope but only assassins of the third grade may use it as one of the three options sir you are sure of that are you sir you wouldnt like to reconsider you could have used the examiners voice to grease a wagon sir no sir very well teppic relaxed the back of his tunic was sticking to him chilly with sweat now i want you to proceed at your own pace towards the street of bookkeepers said mericet evenly obeying all signs and so forth i will meet you in the room under the gong tower at the junction with audit alley and take this if you please he handed teppic a small envelope teppic handed over a receipt then mericet stepped into the pool of shade beside a chimney pot and disappeared so much for the ceremony teppic took a few deep breaths and tipped the envelopes contents into his hand it was a guild bond for ten thousand ankhmorpork dollars made out to bearer it was an impressive document surmounted with the guild seal of the doublecross and the cloaked dagger well no going back now hed taken the money either hed survive in which case of course hed traditionally donate the money to the guilds widows and orphans fund or it would be retrieved from his dead body the bond looked a bit dogeared but he couldnt see any bloodstains on it he checked his knives adjusted his swordbelt glanced behind him and set off at a gentle trot at least this was a bit of luck the student lore said there were only half a dozen routes used during the test and on summer nights they were alive with students tackling the roofs towers eaves and colls of the city edificing was a keen interhouse sport in its own right it was one of the few things teppic was sure he was good at hed been captain of the team that beat scorpion house in the wallgame finals and this was one of the easier courses he dropped lightly over the edge of the roof landed on a ridge ran easily across the sleeping building jumped a narrow gap on to the tiled roof of the young mens reformedcultistsoftheichorgodbelshamharoth association gym jogged gently over the grey slope swarmed up a twelve foot wall without slowing down and vaulted on to the wide flat roof of the temple of blind io a full orange moon hung on the horizon there was a real breeze up here not much but as refreshing as a cold shower after the stifling heat of the streets he speeded up enjoying the coolness on his face and leapt accurately off the end of the roof on to the narrow plank bridge that led across tinlid alley and which someone in defiance of all probability had removed at times like this ones past life flashes before ones eyes his aunt had wept rather theatrically teppic had thought since the old lady was as tough as a hippos instep his father had looked stern and dignified whenever he could remember to and tried to keep his mind free of beguiling images of cliffs and fish the servants had been lined up along the hall from the foot of the main stairway handmaidens on one side eunuchs and butlers on the other the women bobbed a curtsey as he walked by creating a rather nice sine wave effect which the greatest mathematician on the disc had he not at this moment been occupied by being hit with a stick and shouted at by a small man wearing what appeared to be a nightshirt might well have appreciated but teppics aunt blew her nose its trade after all his father patted her hand nonsense flower of the desert he said it is a profession at the very least what is the difference she sobbed the old man sighed the money i understand it will do him good to go out into the world and make friends and have a few corners knocked off and it will keep him occupied and prevent him from getting into mischief but assassination hes so young and hes never shown the least inclination she dabbed at her eyes its not from our side of the family she added accusingly that brotherinlaw of yours uncle vyrt said his father going all over the world killing people i dont believe they use that word said his father i think they prefer words like conclude or annul or inhume i understand inhume i think its like exhume o flooding of the waters only its before they bury you i think its terrible she sniffed but i heard from lady nooni that only one boy in fifteen actually passes the final exam perhaps wed just better let him get it out of his system king teppicymon xxvii nodded gloomily and went by himself to wave goodbye to his son he was less certain than his sister about the unpleasantness of assassination hed been reluctantly in politics for a long time and felt that while assassination was probably worse than debate it was certainly better than war which some people tended to think of as the same thing only louder and there was no doubt that young vyrt always had plenty of money and used to turn up at the palace with expensive gifts exotic suntans and thrilling tales of the interesting people hed met in foreign parts in most cases quite briefly he wished vyrt was around to advise his majesty had also heard that only one student in fifteen actually became an assassin he wasnt entirely certain what happened to the other fourteen but he was pretty sure that if you were a poor student in a school for assassins they did a bit more than throw the chalk at you and that the school dinners had an extra dimension of uncertainty but everyone agreed that the assassins school offered the best allround education in the world a qualified assassin should be at home in any company and able to play at least one musical instrument anyone inhumed by a graduate of the guild school could go to his rest satisfied that he had been annulled by someone of taste and discretion and after all what was there for him at home a kingdom two miles wide and one hundred and fifty miles long which was almost entirely under water during the flood season and threatened on either side by stronger neighbours who tolerated its existence only because theyd be constantly at war if it wasnt there oh djelibeybi had been great once when upstarts like tsort and ephebe were just a bunch of nomads with their towels on their heads all that remained of those great days was the ruinouslyexpensive palace a few dusty ruins in the desert and the pharaoh sighed the pyramids always the pyramids his ancestors had been keen on pyramids the pharaoh wasnt pyramids had bankrupted the country drained it drier than ever the river did the only curse they could afford to put on a tomb these days was bugger off the only pyramids he felt comfortable about were the very small ones at the bottom of the garden built every time one of the cats died hed promised the boys mother he missed artela thered been a terrible row about taking a wife from outside the kingdom and some of her foreign ways had puzzled and fascinated even him maybe it was from her hed got the strange dislike of pyramids in djelibeybi that was like disliking breathing but hed promised that pteppic could go to school outside the kingdom shed been insistent about that people never learn anything in this place shed said they only remember things if only shed remembered about not swimming in the river he watched two of the servants load teppics trunk on to the back of the coach and for the first time either of them could remember laid a paternal hand on his sons shoulder in fact he was at a loss for something to say weve never really had time to get to know one another he thought theres so much i could have given him a few bloody good hidings wouldnt have come amiss urn he said well my boy yes father this is er the first time youve been away from home by yourself no father i spent last summer with lord fhemptahem you remember oh did you the pharaoh recalled the palace had seemed quieter at the time hed put it down to the new tapestries anyway he said youre a young man nearly thirteen twelve father said teppic patiently are you sure it was my birthday last month father you bought me a warming pan did i how singular did i say why no father teppic looked up at his fathers mild puzzled features it was a very good warming pan he added reassuringly i like it a lot oh good er his majesty patted his sons shoulder again in a vague way like a man drumming his fingers on his desk while trying to think an idea appeared to occur to him the servants had finished strapping the trunk on to the roof of the coach and the driver was patiently holding open the door when a young man sets out in the world said his majesty uncertainly there are well its very important that he remembers the point is that it is a very big world after all with all sorts and of course especially so in the city where there are many additional he paused waving one hand vaguely in the air teppic took it gently its quite all right father he said dios the high priest explained to me about taking regular baths and not going blind his father blinked at him youre not going blind he said apparently not father oh well jolly good said the king jolly jolly good that is good news i think i had better be going father otherwise i shall miss the tide his majesty nodded and patted his pockets there was something he muttered and then tracked it down and slipped a small leather bag into teppics pocket he tried the shoulder routine again a little something he murmured dont tell your aunt oh you cant anyway shes gone for a liedown its all been rather too much for her all that remained then was for teppic to go and sacrifice a chicken at the statue of khuft the founder of djelibeybi so that his ancestors guiding hand would steer his footsteps in the world it was only a small chicken though and when khuft had finished with it the king had it for lunch djelibeybi really was a small selfcentred kingdom even its plagues were halfhearted all selfrespecting river kingdoms have vast supernatural plagues but the best the old kingdom had been able to achieve in the last hundred years was the plague of frog that evening when they were well outside the delta of the djel and heading across the circle sea to ankhmorpork teppic remembered the bag and examined its contents with love but also with his normal approach to things his father had presented him with a cork half a tin of saddlesoap a small bronze coin of uncertain denomination and an extremely elderly sardine it is a wellknown fact that when one is about to die the senses immediately become excruciatingly sharp and it has always been believed that this is to enable their owner to detect any possible exit from his predicament other than the obvious one this is not true the phenomenon is a classical example of displacement activity the senses are desperately concentrating on anything apart from the immediate problem which in teppics case consisted of a broad expanse of cobblestones some eighty feet away and closing in the hope that it will go away the trouble is that it soon will whatever the reason teppic was suddenly acutely aware of things around him the way the moonlight glowed on the rooftops the smell of fresh bread wafting from a nearby bakery the whirring of a cockchafer as it barrelled past his ear upwards the sound of a baby crying in the distance and the bark of a dog the gentle rush of the air with particular reference to its thinness and lack of handholds there had been more than seventy of them enrolling that year the assassins didnt have a very strenuous entrance examination the school was easy to get into easy to get out of the courtyard in the centre of the guild buildings was thronged with boys who all had two things in common overlarge trunks which they were sitting on and clothes that had been selected for them to grow into and which they were more or less sitting in some optimists had brought weapons with them which were confiscated and sent home over the next few weeks teppic watched them carefully there were distinct advantages to being the only child of parents too preoccupied with their own affairs to worry much about him or indeed register his existence for days at a time his mother as far as he could remember had been a pleasant woman and as selfcentred as a gyroscope shed liked cats she didnt just venerate them everyone in the kingdom did that but she actually liked them too teppic knew that it was traditional in river kingdoms to approve of cats but he suspected that usually the animals in question were graceful stately creatures his mothers cats were small spitting flatheaded yelloweyed maniacs his father spent a lot of time worrying about the kingdom and occasionally declaring that he was a seagull although this was probably from general forgetfulness teppic had occasionally speculated about his own conception since his parents were rarely in the same frame of reference let alone the same state of mind but it had apparently happened and he was left to bring himself up on a trial and error basis mildly hindered and occasionally enlivened by a succession of tutors the ones hired by his father were best especially on those days when he was flying as high as he could and for one glorious winter teppic had as his tutor an elderly ibis poacher who had in fact wandered into the royal gardens in search of a stray arrow that had been a time of wild chases with soldiers moonlight rambles in the dead streets of the necropolis and best of all the introduction to the puntbow a fearsomely complicated invention which at considerable risk to its operators could turn a slough full of innocent waterfowl into so much floating pвtй hed also had the run of the library including the locked shelves the poacher had several other skills to ensure gainful employment in inclement weather which had given him many hours of quiet study he was particularly attached to the shuttered palace translated from the khalian by a gentleman with handcoloured plates for the connoisseur in a strictly limited edition it was confusing but instructive and when a rather fey young tutor engaged by the priests tried to introduce him to certain athletic techniques favoured by the classical pseudopolitans teppic considered the suggestion for some time and then floored the youth with a hatstand teppic hadnt been educated education had just settled on him like dandruff it started to rain in the world outside his head another new experience hed heard about it of course how water came down out of the sky in small bits he just hadnt expected there to be so much of it it never rained in djelibeybi masters moved among the boys like damp and slightly scruffy blackbirds but he was eyeing a group of older students lolling near the pillared entrance to the school they also wore black different colours of black that was his first introduction to the tertiary colours the colours on the far side of blackness the colours that you get if you split blackness with an eightsided prism they are also almost impossible to describe in a nonmagical environment but if someone were to try theyd probably start by telling you to smoke something illegal and take a good look at a starlings wing the seniors were critically inspecting the new arrivals teppic stared at them apart from the colours their clothes were cut off the edge of the latest fashion which was currently inclining towards wide hats padded shoulders narrow waists and pointed shoes and gave its followers the appearance of being very welldressed nails im going to be like them he told himself although probably better dressed he added he recalled uncle vyrt sitting out on the steps overlooking the djel on one of his brief mysterious visits satin and leather are no good or jewellery of any kind you cant have anything that will shine or squeak or clink stick to rough silk or velvet the important thing is not how many people you inhume its how many fail to inhume you hed been moving at an unwise pace which might assist now as he arced over the emptiness of the alley he twisted in the air thrust out his arms desperately and felt his fingertips brush a ledge on the building opposite it was enough to pivot him he swung around hit the crumbling brickwork with sufficient force to knock what remained of his breath out of him and slid down the sheer wall boy teppic looked up there was a senior assassin standing beside him with a purple teaching sash over his robes it was the first assassin hed seen apart from vyrt the man was pleasant enough you could imagine him making sausages are you talking to me he said you will stand up when you address a master said the rosy face i will teppic was fascinated he wondered how this could be achieved discipline had not hitherto been a major feature in his life most of his tutors had been sufficiently unnerved by the sight of the king occasionally perched on top of a door that they raced through such lessons as they had and then locked themselves in their rooms i will sir said the teacher he consulted the list in his hand what is your name boy he continued prince pteppic of the old kingdom the kingdom of the sun said teppic easily i appreciate you are ignorant of the etiquette but you should not call me sir and you should touch the ground with your forehead when you address me pateppic is it said the master no pteppic ah teppic said the master and ticked off a name on his list he gave teppic a generous smile well now your majesty he said i am grunworth nivor your housemaster you are in viper house to my certain knowledge there are at least eleven kingdoms of the sun on the disc and before the end of the week you will present me with a short essay detailing their geographical location political complexion capital city or principal seat of government and a suggested route into the bed chamber of the head of state of your choice however in all the world there is only one viper house good morning to you boy he turned away and homed in on another cowering pupil hes not a bad sort said a voice behind teppic anyway all the stuffs in the library ill show you if you like im chidder teppic turned he was being addressed by a boy of about his own age and height whose black suit plain black for first years looked as though it had been nailed on to him in bits the youth was holding out a hand teppic gave it a polite glance yes he said whats your name kiddo teppic drew himself up he was getting fed up with this treatment kiddo ill have you know the blood of pharaohs runs in my veins the other boy looked at him unabashed with his head on one side and a faint smile on his face would you like it to stay there he said the baker was just along the alley and a handful of the staff had stepped out into the comparative cool of the predawn air for a quick smoke and a break from the desert heat of the ovens their chattering spiralled up to teppic high in the shadows gripping a fortuitous window sill while his feet scrabbled for a purchase among the bricks its not that bad he told himself youve tackled worse the hubward face of the patricians palace last winter for example when all the gutters had overflowed and the walls were solid ice this isnt much more than a maybe a you and old chiddy used to go up walls like this rather than stroll down the street its just a matter of perspective perspective he glanced down at seventy feet of infinity splat city man get a grip on yourself on the wall his right foot found a worn section of mortar into which his toes planted themselves with barely a conscious instruction from a brain now feeling too fragile to take more than a distant interest in the proceedings he took a breath tensed and then dropped one hand to his belt seized a dagger and thrust it between the bricks beside him before gravity worked out what was happening he paused panting waiting for gravity to lose interest in him again and then swung his body sideways and tried the same thing a second time down below one of the bakers told a suggestive joke and brushed a speck of mortar from his ear as his colleagues laughed teppic stood up in the moonlight balancing on two slivers of klatchian steel and gently walked his palms up the wall to the window whose sill had been his brief salvation it was wedged shut a good blow would surely open it but only at about the same moment as it sent him reeling back into empty air teppic sighed and moving with the delicacy of a watchmaker drew his diamond compasses from their pouch and dragged a slow gentle circle on the dusty glass you carry it yourself said chidder thats the rule around here teppic looked at the trunk it was an intriguing notion at home weve people who do that he said eunuchs and so on you should of brought one with you they dont travel well said teppic in fact hed adamantly refused all suggestions that a small retinue should accompany him and dios had sulked for days that was not how a member of the royal blood should go forth into the world he said teppic had remained firm he was pretty certain that assassins werent expected to go about their business accompanied by handmaidens and buglers now however the idea seemed to have some merit he gave the trunk an experimental heave and managed to get it across his shoulders your people are pretty rich then said chidder ambling along beside him teppic thought about this no not really he said they mainly grow melons and garlic and that kind of thing and stand in the streets and shout hurrah this is your parents youre talking about said chidder puzzled oh them no my fathers a pharaoh my mother was a concubine i think i thought that was some sort of vegetable i dont think so weve never really discussed it anyway she died when i was young how dreadful said chidder cheerfully she went for a moonlight swim in what turned out to be a crocodile teppic tried politely not to be hurt at the boys reaction my fathers in commerce said chidder as they passed through the archway thats fascinating said teppic dutifully he felt quite broken by all these new experiences and added ive never been to commerce but i understand theyre very fine people over the next hour or two chidder who ambled gently through life as though hed already worked it all out introduced teppic to the various mysteries of the dormitories the classrooms and the plumbing he left the plumbing until last for all sorts of reasons not any he said theres buckets and things said teppic vaguely and lots of servants bit old fashioned this kingdom of yours teppic nodded its the pyramids he said they take all the money expensive things i should imagine not particularly theyre just made of stone teppic sighed weve got lots of stone he said and sand stone and sand were really big on them if you ever need any stone and sand were the people for you its fitting out the insides that is really expensive were still avoiding paying for grandfathers and that wasnt very big just three chambers teppic turned and looked out of the window they were back in the dormitory at this point the whole kingdoms in debt he said quietly i mean even our debts are in debt thats why im here really someone in our house needs to earn some money a royal prince cant hang around looking ornamental any more hes got to get out and do something useful in the community chidder leaned on the window sill couldnt you take some of the stuff out of the pyramids then he said dont be silly sorry teppic gloomily watched the figures below theres a lot of people here he said to change the subject i didnt realise it would be so big he shivered or so cold he added people drop out all the time said chidder cant stand the course the important thing is to know whats what and whos who see that fellow over there teppic followed his pointing finger to a group of older students who were lounging against the pillars by the entrance the big one face like the end of your boot thats fliemoe watch out for him if he invites you for toast in his study dont go and whos the little kid with the curls said teppic he pointed to a small lad receiving the attentions of a washedout looking lady she was licking her handkerchief and dabbing apparent smudges off his face when she stopped that she straightened his tie chidder craned to see oh just some new kid he said arthur someone still hanging on to his mummy i see he wont last long oh i dont know said teppic we do too and weve lasted for thousands of years a disc of glass dropped into the silent building and tinkled on the floor there was no other sound for several minutes then there was the faint clonkclonk of an oil can a shadow that had been lying naturally on the window sill a morgue for bluebottles turned out to be an arm which was moving with vegetable slowness towards the windows catch there was a scrape of metal and then the whole window swung out in tribological silence teppic dropped over the sill and vanished into the shadow below it for a minute or two the dusty space was filled with the intense absence of noise caused by someone moving with extreme care once again there was the squirting of oil and then a metallic whisper as the bolt of a trapdoor leading on to the roof moved gently aside teppic waited for his breath to catch up with him and in that moment heard the sound it was down among the white noise at the edge of hearing but there was no doubt about it someone was waiting just above the trapdoor and theyd just put their hand on a piece of paper to stop it rattling in the breeze his own hand dropped from the bolt he eased his way with exquisite care back across the greasy floor and felt his way along a rough wooden wall until he came to the door this time he took no chances but uncorked his oil can and let a silent drop fall on to the hinges a moment later he was through a rat idly patrolling the draughty passage beyond had to stop itself from swallowing its own tongue as he floated past there was another doorway at the end and a maze of musty storerooms until he found a stairway he judged himself to be about thirty yards from the trapdoor there hadnt been any flues that he could see there ought to be a clear shot across the roof he hunkered down and pulled out his knife roll its velvet blackness making a darker oblong in the shadows he selected a number five not everyones throwing knife but worthwhile if you had the trick of it shortly afterwards his head rose very carefully over the edge of the roof one arm bent behind it but ready to uncurl in a complex interplay of forces that would combine to send a few ounces of steel gliding across the night mericet was sitting by the trapdoor looking at his clipboard teppics eyes swivelled to the oblong of the plank bridge stored meticulously against the parapet a few feet away he was certain he had made no noise hed have to swear that the examiner heard the sound of his gaze falling on him the old man raised his bald head thank you mr teppic he said you may proceed teppic felt the sweat of his body grow cold he stared at the plank and then at the examiner and then at his knife ys sir he said this didnt seem like enough in the circumstances he added thank you sir hed always remember the first night in the dormitory it was long enough to accommodate all eighteen boys in viper house and draughty enough to accommodate the great outdoors its designer may have had comfort in mind but only so that he could avoid it wherever possible he had contrived a room that could actually be colder than the weather outside i thought we got rooms to ourselves said teppic chidder who had laid claim to the least exposed bed in the whole refrigerator nodded at him later on he said he lay back and winced do they sharpen these springs do you reckon teppic said nothing the bed was in fact rather more comfortable than the one hed slept in at home his parents being high born naturally tolerated conditions for their children which would have been rejected out of hand by destitute sandflies he stretched out on the thin mattress and analysed the days events hed been enrolled as an assassin all right a student assassin for more than seven hours and they hadnt even let him lay a hand on a knife yet of course tomorrow was another day chidder leaned over wheres arthur he said teppic looked at the bed opposite him there was a pathetically small sack of clothing positioned neatly in its centre but no sign of its intended occupant do you think hes run away he said staring around at the shadows could be said chidder it happens a lot you know mummys boys away from home for the first time the door at the end of the room swung open slowly and arthur entered backwards tugging a large and very reluctant billy goat it fought him every step of the way down the aisle between the bedsteads the boys watched in silence for several minutes as he tethered the animal to the end of his bed upended the sack on the blankets and took out several black candles a sprig of herbs a rope of skulls and a piece of chalk taking the chalk and adopting the shiny pinkfaced expression of someone who is going to do what they know to be right no matter what arthur drew a double circle around his bed and then getting down on his chubby knees filled the space between them with as unpleasant a collection of occult symbols as teppic had ever seen when they were completed to his satisfaction he placed the candles at strategic points and lit them they spluttered and gave off a smell that suggested that you really wouldnt want to know what they were made of he drew a short redhandled knife from the jumble on the bed and advanced towards the goat a pillow hit him on the back of the head garn pious little bastard arthur dropped the knife and burst into tears chidder sat up in bed that was you cheesewright he said i saw you cheesewright a skinny young man with red hair and a face that was one large freckle glared at him well its too much he said a fellow cant sleep with all this religion going on i mean only little kids say their prayers at bedtime these days were supposed to be learning to be assassins you can jolly well shut up cheesewright shouted chidder itd be a better world if more people said their prayers you know i know i dont say mine as often as i should a pillow cut him off in midsentence he bounded out of bed and vaulted at the redhaired boy fists flailing as the rest of the dormitory gathered around the scuffling pair teppic slid out of bed and padded over to arthur who was sitting on the edge of his bed and sobbing he patted him uncertainly on the shoulder on the basis that this sort of thing was supposed to reassure people i shouldnt cry about it youngster he said gruffly but but all the runes have been scuffed said arthur its all too late now and that means the great om will come in the night and wind out my entrails on a stick does it and suck out my eyes my mother said gosh said teppic fascinated really he was quite glad his bed was opposite arthurs and would offer an unrivalled view what religion would this be were strict authorised ormits said arthur he blew his nose i noticed you dont pray he said dont you have a god oh yes said teppic hesitantly no doubt about that you dont seem to want to talk to him teppic shook his head i cant he said not here he wouldnt be able to hear you see my god can hear me anywhere said arthur fervently well mine has difficulty if youre on the other side of the room said teppic it can be very embarrassing youre not an offlian are you said arthur offler was a crocodile god and lacked ears no what god do you worship then not exactly worship said teppic discomforted i wouldnt say worship i mean hes all right hes my father if you must know arthurs pinkrimmed eyes widened youre the son of a god he whispered its all part of being a king where i come from said teppic hurriedly he doesnt have to do very much that is the priests do the actual running of the country he just makes sure that the river floods every year dyou see and services the great cow of the arch of the sky well used to the great my mother explained teppic its all very embarrassing does he smite people i dont think so hes never said arthur reached down to the end of the bed the goat in the confusion had chewed through its rope and trotted out of the door vowing to give up religion in future im going to get into awful trouble he said i suppose you couldnt ask your father to explain things to the great om he might be able to said teppic doubtfully i was going to write home tomorrow anyway the great orm is normally to be found in one of the nether hells said arthur where he watches everything we do everything i do anyway theres only me and mother left now and she doesnt do much that needs watching ill be sure and tell him do you think the great orm will come tonight i shouldnt think so ill ask my father to be sure and tell him not to at the other end of the dormitory chidder was kneeling on cheesewrights back and knocking his head repeatedly against the wall say it again he commanded come on theres nothing wrong theres nothing wrong with a chap being man enough curse you chidder you beastly i cant hear you cheesewright said chidder man enough to say his prayers in front of other chaps you rotter right and dont you forget it after lights out teppic lay in bed and thought about religion it was certainly a very complicated subject the valley of the djel had its own private gods gods which had nothing to do with the world outside it had always been very proud of the fact the gods were wise and just and regulated the lives of men with skill and foresight there was no question about that but there were some puzzles for example he knew his father made the sun come up and the river flood and so on that was basic it was what the pharaohs had done ever since the time of khuft you couldnt go around questioning things like that the point was though did he just make the sun come up in the valley or everywhere in the world making the sun come up in the valley seemed a more reasonable proposition after all his father wasnt getting any younger but it was rather difficult to imagine the sun coming up everywhere else and not the valley which led to the distressing thought that the sun would come up even if his father forgot about it which was a very likely state of affairs hed never seen his father do anything much about making the sun rise he had to admit youd expect at least a grunt of effort round about the dawn his father never got up until after breakfast the sun came up just the same he took some time to get to sleep the bed whatever chidder said was too soft the air was too cold and worst of all the sky outside the high windows was too dark at home it would have been full of flarelight from the necropolis its silent flames eerie but somehow familiar and comforting as though the ancestors were watching over their valley he didnt like the darkness the following night in the dormitory one of the boys from further along the coast shyly tried to put the boy in the next bed inside a wickerwork cage he made in craft and set fire to him and the night after that snoxall who had the bed by the door and came from a little country out in the forests somewhere painted himself green and asked for volunteers to have their intestines wound around a tree on thursday a small war broke out between those who worshipped the mother goddess in her aspect of the moon and those who worshipped her in her aspect of a huge fat woman with enormous buttocks after that the masters intervened and explained that religion while a fine thing could be taken too far teppic had a suspicion that unpunctuality was unforgivable but surely mericet would have to be at the tower ahead of him and he was going by the direct route the old man couldnt possibly get there before him mind you he couldnt possibly have got to the bridge in the alley first he must have taken the bridge away before he met me and then he climbed up on the roof while i was climbing up the wall teppic told himself without believing a word of it he ran along a roof ridge senses alert for dislodged tiles or tripwires his imagination equipped every shadow with watching figures the gong tower loomed ahead of him he paused and looked at it he had seen it a thousand times before and scaled it many times although it barely rated a notwithstanding that the brass dome on top was an interesting climb it was just a familiar landmark that made it worse now it bulked in front of him a stubby menacing shape against the greyness of the sky he advanced more slowly now approaching the tower obliquely across the sloping roof it came to him that his initials were there on the dome along with chiddys and those of hundreds of other young assassins and that theyd carry on being up there even if he died tonight it was sort of comforting only not very he unslung his rope and made an easy throw on to the wide parapet that ran around the tower just under the dome he tested it and heard the gentle clink as it caught then he tugged it as hard as possible bracing himself with one foot on a chimney stack abruptly and with no sound a section of parapet slid outwards and dropped there was a crash as it hit the roof below and then slid down the tiles another pause was punctuated by a distant thump as it hit the silent street a dog barked stillness ruled the rooftops where teppic had been the breeze stirred the burning air after several minutes he emerged from the deeper shadow of a chimney stack smiling a strange and terrible smile nothing the examiner could do could possibly be unfair an assassins clients were invariably rich enough to pay for extremely ingenious protection up to and including hiring assassins of his own mericet wasnt trying to kill him he was merely trying to make him kill himself he sidled up to the base of the tower and found a drainpipe it hadnt been coated with slipall rather to his surprise but his gently questing fingers did find the poisoned needles painted black and glued to the inner face of the pipe he removed one with his tweezers and sniffed it distilled bloat pretty expensive stuff with an astonishing effect he took a small glass phial from his belt and collected as many needles as he could find and then put on his armoured gloves and with the speed of a sloth started to climb now it may well be that as you travel across the city on your lawful occasions you will find yourselves in opposition to fellow members even one of the gentlemen with whom you are currently sharing a bench and this is quite right and what are you doing mr chidder no don t tell me im sure i wouldnt want to know see me afterwards proper it is open to everyone to defend themselves as best they may there are however other enemies who will dog your steps and against whom you are all illprepared who are they mr cheesewright mericet spun round from his blackboard like a vulture who has just heard a deathrattle and pointed the chalk at cheesewright who gulped thieves guild sir he managed step out here boy there were whispered rumours in the dormitories about what mericet had done to slovenly pupils in the past which were always vague but horrifying the class relaxed mericet usually concentrated on one victim at a time so all they had to do now was look keen and enjoy the show crimson to his ears cheesewright got to his feet and trooped down the aisle between the desks the master inspected him thoughtfully well now he said and here we have cheesewright g skulking across the quaking rooftops see the determined ears see the firm set of those knees the class tittered dutifully cheesewright gave them an idiotic grin and rolled his eyes but what are these sinister figures that march in step with him hey since you find this so funny mr teppic perhaps you would be so good as to tell mr cheesewright teppic froze in midlaugh mericets gaze bored into him hes just like dios the high priest teppic thought even fathers frightened of dios he knew what he ought to do and he was damned if he was going to do it he ought to be scared illpreparedness he said carelessness lack of concentration poor maintenance of tools oh and overconfidence sir mericet held his gaze for some time but teppic had practised on the palace cats finally the teacher gave a brief smile that had absolutely nothing to do with humour tossed the chalk in the air caught it again and said mr teppic is exactly right especially about the overconfidence there was a ledge leading to an invitingly open window there was oil on the ledge and teppic invested several minutes in screwing small crampons into cracks in the stonework before advancing he hung easily by the window and proceeded to take a number of small metal rods from his belt they were threaded at the ends and after a few seconds brisk work he had a rod about three feet long on the end of which he affixed a small mirror that revealed nothing in the gloom beyond the opening he pulled it back and tried again this time attaching his hood into which hed stuffed his gloves to give the impression of a head cautiously revealing itself against the light he was confident that it would pick up a bolt or a dart but it remained resolutely unattacked he was chilly now despite the heat of the night black velvet looked good but that was about all you could say for it the excitement and the exertion meant he was now wearing several pints of clammy water he advanced there was a thin black wire on the window sill and a serrated blade screwed to the sash window above it it was the work of a moment to wedge the sash with more rods and then cut the wire the window dropped a fraction of an inch he grinned in the darkness a sweep with a long rod inside the room revealed that there was a floor apparently free of obstructions there was also a wire at about chest height he drew the rod back affixed a small hook on the end sent it back caught the wire and tugged there came the dull smack of a crossbow bolt hitting old plaster a lump of clay on the end of the same rod pushed gently across the floor revealed several caltraps teppic hauled them back and inspected them with interest they were copper if hed tried the magnet technique which was the usual method he wouldnt have found them he thought for a while he had slipon priests in his pouch they were devilish things to prowl around a room in but he shuffled into them anyway mericet was a poisons man after all bloat if he tipped them with that teppic would plate himself all over the walls they wouldnt need to bury him theyd just redecorate over the top the rules mericet would have to obey the rules he couldnt simply kill him with no warning hed have to let him by carelessness or overconfidence kill himself he dropped lightly on to the floor inside the room and let his eyes adjust to the darkness a few exploratory swings with the rods detected no more wires there was a faint crunch underfoot as a priest crushed a caltrap in your own time mr teppic mericet was standing in a corner teppic heard the faint scratching of his pencil as he made a note he tried to put the man out of his mind he tried to think there was a figure lying on a bed it was entirely covered by a blanket this was the last bit this was the room where everything was decided this was the bit the successful students never told you about the unsuccessful ones werent around to ask teppics mind filled up with options at a time like this he thought some divine guidance would be necessary where are you dad he envied his fellow students who believed in gods that were intangible and lived a long way away on top of some mountain a fellow could really believe in gods like that but it was extremely hard to believe in a god when you saw him at breakfast every day he unslung his crossbow and screwed its greased sections together it wasnt a proper weapon but hed run out of knives and his lips were too dry for the blowpipe there was a clicking from the corner mericet was idly tapping his teeth with his pencil it could be a dummy under there how would he know no it had to be a real person you heard tales perhaps he could try the rods he shook his head raised the crossbow and took careful aim whenever you like mr teppic this was it this was where they found out if you could kill this was what he had been trying to put out of his mind he knew he couldnt octeday afternoons was political expediency with lady tmalia one of the few women to achieve high office in the guild in the lands around the circle sea it was generally agreed that one way to achieve a long life was not to have a meal with her ladyship the jewellery of one hand alone carried enough poison to inhume a small town she was stunningly beautiful but with the kind of calculated beauty that is achieved by a team of skilled artists manicurists plasterers corsetiers and dressmakers and three hours solid work every morning when she walked there was a faint squeak of whalebone under incredible stress the boys were learning as she talked they didnt watch her figure they watched her fingers and thus she said let us consider the position before the founding of the guild in this city and indeed in many places elsewhere civilisation is nurtured and progresses by the dynamic interplay of interests among many large and powerful advantage cartels in the days before the founding of the guild the seeking of advancement among these consortia invariably resulted in regrettable disagreements which were terminated with extreme prejudice these were extremely deleterious to the common interest of the city please understand that where disharmony rules commerce flags and yet and yet she clasped her hands to her bosom there was a creak like a galleon beating against a gale clearly there was a need for an extreme yet responsible means of settling irreconcilable differences she went on and thus was laid the groundwork for the guild what bliss the sudden peak in her voice guiltily jerked several dozen young men out of their private reveries it must have been to have been present in those early days when men of stout moral purpose set out to forge the ultimate political tool short of warfare how fortunate you are now in training for a guild which demands so much in terms of manners deportment bearing and esoteric skills and yet offers a power once the preserve only of the gods truly the world is the mollusc of your choice chidder translated much of this behind the stables during the dinner break i know what terminate with extreme prejudice means said cheesewright loftily it means to inhume with an axe it bloody well doesnt said chidder how do you know then my family have been in commerce for years said chidder huh said cheesewright commerce chidder never went into details about what kind of commerce it was it had something to do with moving items around and supplying needs but exactly what items and which needs was never made clear after hitting cheesewright he explained carefully that terminate with extreme prejudice did not simply require that the victim was inhumed preferably in an extremely thorough way but that his associates and employees were also intimately involved along with the business premises the building and a large part of the surrounding neighbourhood so that everyone involved would know that the man had been unwise enough to make the kind of enemies who could get very angry and indiscriminate gosh said arthur oh thats nothing said chidder one hogswatchnight my grandad and his accounts department went and had a highlevel business conference with the hubside people and fifteen bodies were never found very bad that sort of thing upsets the business community all the business community or just that part of it floating face down in the river said teppic thats the point better it should be like this said chidder shaking his head you know clean thats why my father said i should join the guild i mean youve got to get on with the business these days you cant spend your whole time on public relations the end of the crossbow trembled he liked everything else about the school the climbing the music studies the broad education it was the fact that you ended up killing people that had been preying on his mind hed never killed anyone thats the whole point he told himself this is where everyone finds out if you can including you if i get it wrong now im dead in his corner mericet began to hum a discouraging little tune there was a price the guild paid for its licence it saw to it that there were no careless halfhearted or in a manner of speaking murderously inefficient assassins you never met anyone whod failed the test people did fail you just never met them maybe there was one under there maybe it was chidder even or snoxall or any one of the lads they were all doing the run this evening maybe if he failed hed be bundled under there teppic tried to sight on the recumbent figure ahem coughed the examiner his throat was dry panic rose like a drunkards supper his teeth wanted to chatter his spine was freezing his clothes a collection of damp rags the world slowed down no he wasnt going to the sudden decision hit him like a brick in a dark alley and was nearly as surprising it wasnt that he hated the guild or even particularly disliked mericet but this wasnt the way to test anyone it was just wrong he decided to fail exactly what could the old man do about it here and hed fail with flair he turned to face mericet looked peacefully into the examiners eyes extended his crossbow hand in some vague direction to his right and pulled the trigger there was a metallic twang there was a click as the bolt ricocheted off a nail in the window sill mericet ducked as it whirred over his head it hit a torch bracket on the wall and went past teppics white face purring like a maddened cat there was a thud as it hit the blanket and then silence thank you mr teppic if you could bear with me just one moment the old assassin pored over his clipboard his lips moving he took the pencil which dangled from it by a bit of frayed string and made a few marks on a piece of pink paper i will not ask you to take it from my hands he said what with one thing and another i shall leave it on the table by the door it wasnt a particularly pleasant smile it was thin and driedup a smile with all the warmth long ago boiled out of it people normally smiled like that when they had been dead for about two years under the broiling desert sun but at least you felt he was making the effort teppic hadnt moved ive passed he said that would appear to be the case but i am sure you know that we are not allowed to discuss the test with pupils however i can tell you that i personally do not approve of these modern flashy techniques good morning to you and mericet stalked out teppic tottered over to the dusty table by the door and looked down horrified at the paper sheer habit made him extract a pair of tweezers from his pouch in order to pick it up it was genuine enough there was the seal of the guild on it and the crabbed squiggle that was undoubtedly mericets signature hed seen it often enough generally at the bottom of test papers alongside comments like see me he padded over to the figure on the bed and pulled back the blanket it was nearly one in the morning ankhmorpork was just beginning to make a night of it it had been dark up above the rooftops in the aerial world of thieves and assassins but down below the life of the city flowed through the streets like a tide teppic walked through the throng in a daze anyone else who tried that in the city was asking for a guided tour of the bottom of the river but he was wearing assassins black and the crowd just automatically opened in front of him and closed behind even the pickpockets kept away you never knew what you might find he wandered aimlessly through the gates of the guild house and sat down on a black marble seat with his chin on his knuckles the fact was that his life had come to an end he hadnt thought about what was going to happen next he hadnt dared to think that there was going to be a next someone tapped him on the shoulder as he turned chidder sat down beside him and wordlessly produced a slip of pink paper snap he said you passed too said teppic chidder grinned no problem he said it was nivor no problem he gave me a bit of trouble on the emergency drop though how about you hmm oh no teppic tried to get a grip on himself no trouble he said heard from any of the others no chidder leaned back cheesewright will make it he said loftily and young arthur i dont think some of the others will we could give them twenty minutes what do you say teppic turned an agonised face towards him chiddy i what when it came to it i what about it teppic looked at the cobbles nothing he said youre lucky you just had a good airy run over the rooftops i had the sewers and then up the garderobe in the haberdashers tower i had to go in and change when i got here you had a dummy did you said teppic good grief didnt you but they let us think it was going to be real teppic wailed it felt real didnt it yes well then and you passed so no problem but didnt you wonder who might be under the blanket who it was and why i was worried that i might not do it properly chidder admitted but then i thought well its not up to me but i teppic stopped what could he do go and explain somehow that didnt seem a terribly good idea his friend slapped him on the back dont worry about it he said weve done it and chidder held up his thumb pressed against the first two fingers of his right hand in the ancient salute of the assassins a thumb pressed against two fingers and the lean figure of dr cruces head tutor looming over the startled boys we do not murder he said it was a soft voice the doctor never raised his voice but he had a way of giving it the pitch and spin that could make it be heard through a hurricane we do not execute we do not massacre we never you may be very certain we never torture we have no truck with crimes of passion or hatred or pointless gain we do not do it for a delight in inhumation or to feed some secret inner need or for petty advantage or for some cause or belief i tell you gentlemen that all these reasons are in the highest degree suspect look into the face of a man who will kill you for a belief and your nostrils will snuff up the scent of abomination hear a speech declaring a holy war and i assure you your ears should catch the click of evils scales and the dragging of its monstrous tail over the purity of the language no we do it for the money and because we above all must know the value of a human life we do it for the a great deal of money there can be few cleaner motives so shorn of all pretence nil mortifi sine lucre remember no killing without payment he paused for a moment and always give a reciept he added so its all okay said chidder teppic nodded gloomily that was what was so likeable about chidder he had this enviable ability to avoid thinking seriously about anything he did a figure approached cautiously through the open gates the light from the torch in the porters lodge glinted off blond curly hair you two made it then said arthur nonchalantly flourishing the slip arthur had changed quite a lot in seven years the continuing failure of the great orm to wreak organic revenge for lack of piety had cured him of his tendency to run everywhere with his coat over his head his small size gave him a natural advantage in those areas of the craft involving narrow spaces his innate aptitude for channelled violence had been revealed on the day when fliemoe and some cronies had decided it would be fun to toss the new boys in a blanket and picked arthur first ten seconds later it had taken the combined efforts of every boy in the dormitory to hold arthur back and prise the remains of the chair from his fingers it had transpired that he was the son of the late johan ludorum one of the greatest assasins in the history of the guild sons of dead assasins always got a free scholarship yes it could be a caring profession at times there hadnt been any doubt about arthur passing hed been given extra tuition and was allowed to use really complicated poisons he was probably going to stay on for postgraduate work they waited until the gongs of the city struck two clock work was not a precise technology in ankhmorpork and many of the citys variuos communities had their own ideas of what constituted an hour in any case so the chimes went on bouncing around the rooftops for five minutes when it was obvious that the citys consensus was in favour of it being well past two the three of them stopped looking silently at their shoes well thats it said chidder poor old cheesewright said arthur its tragic when you think about it yes he owed me fourpence agreed chidder come on ive arranged something for us king teppicymon xxvii got out of bed and clapped his hands over his ears to shut out the roar of the sea it was strong tonight it was always louder when he was feeling out of sorts he needed something to distract himself he could send for ptraci his favourite handmaiden she was special her singing always cheered him up life seemed so much brighter when she stopped or there was the sunrise that was always comforting it was pleasant to sit wrapped in a blanket on the topmost roof of the palace watching the mists lift from the river as the golden flood poured over the land you got that warm contented feeling of another job well done even if you didnt actually know how youd done it he got up shuffled on his slippers and padded out of his bedroom and down the wide corridor that led to the huge spiral stairs and the roof a few rushlights illuminated the statues of the other local gods painting the walls with shifting shadow pictures of things dogheaded fishbodied spiderarmed hed known them since childhood his juvenile nightmares would have been quite formless without them the sea hed only seen it once when he was a boy he couldnt recall a lot about it except the size and the noise and the seagulls theyd preyed on his mind they seemed to have it far better worked out seagulls he wished he could come back as one one day but of course that wasnt an option if you were a pharaoh you never came back you didnt exactly go away in fact well what is it said teppic try it said chidder just try it youll never have the chance again seems a shame to spoil it said arthur gallantly looking down at the delicate pattern on his plate what are all the little red things theyre just radishes said chidder dismissively theyre not the important part go on teppic reached over with the little wooden fork and skewered a paperthin sliver of white fish the squishi chef was scrutinising him with the air of one watching a toddler on his first birthday so he realised was the rest of the restaurant he chewed it carefully it was salty and faintly rubbery with a hint of sewage outfall nice said chidder anxiously several nearby diners started to clap different teppic conceded chewing what is it deep sea blowfish said chidder its all right he said hastily as teppic laid down his fork meaningfully its perfectly safe provided every bit of stomach liver and digestive tract is removed thats why it cost so much theres no such thing as a secondbest blowfish chef its the most expensive food in the world people write poems about it could be a taste explosion muttered teppic getting a grip on himself still it must have been done properly otherwise the place would now be wearing him as wallpaper he poked carefully at the sliced roots which occupied the rest of the plate what do these do to you he said well unless theyre prepared in exactly the right way over a sixweek period they react catastrophically with your stomach acids said chidder sorry i thought we should celebrate with the most expensive meal we could afford i see fish and chips for men said teppic do they have any vinegar in this place said arthur his mouth full and some mushy peas would go down a treat but the wine was good not incredibly good though not one of the great vintages but it did explain why teppic had gone through the whole of the day with a headache it had been the hangunder his friend had bought four bottles of otherwise quite ordinary white wine the reason it was so expensive was that the grapes it was made from hadnt actually been planted yet counterwise wine is made from grapes belonging to that class of flora reannuals that grow only in excessively high magic fields normal plants grow after the seeds have been planted with reannuals its the other way round although reannual wine causes inebriation in the normal way the action of the digestive system on its molecules causes an unusual reaction whose net effect is to thrust the ensuing hangover backwards in time to a point some hours before the wine is drunk hence the saying have a hair of the dog thats going to bite you light moves slowly lazily on the disc its in no hurry to get anywhere why bother at lightspeed everywhere is the same place king teppicymon xxvii watched the golden disc float over the edge of the world a flight of cranes took off from the mistcovered river hed been conscientious he told himself noone had ever explained to him how one made the sun come up and the river flood and the corn grow how could they he was the god after all he should know but he didnt so hed just gone through life hoping like hell that it would all work properly and that seemed to have done the trick the trouble was though that if it didnt work he wouldnt know why not a recurrent nightmare was of dios the high priest shaking him awake one morning only it wouldnt be a morning of course and of every light in the palace burning and an angry crowd muttering in the starlit darkness outside and everyone looking expectantly at him and all hed be able to say was sorry it terrified him how easy to imagine the ice forming on the river the eternal frost riming the palm trees and snapping off the leaves and the birds dropping lifeless from the sky shadow swept over him he looked up through eyes misted with tears at a grey and empty horizon his mouth dropping open in horror he stood up flinging aside the blanket and raised both hands in supplication but the sun had gone he was the god this was his job it was the only thing he was here to do and he had failed the people now he could hear in his minds ear the anger of the crowd a booming roar that began to fill his ears until the rhythm became insistent and familiar until it reached the point where it pressed in no longer but drew him out into that salty blue desert where the sun always shone and sleek shapes wheeled across the sky the pharaoh raised himself on his toes threw back his head spread his wings and leapt as he soared into the sky he was surprised to hear a thump behind him and the sun came out from behind the clouds later on the pharaoh felt awfully embarrassed about it the three new assassins staggered slowly along the street constantly on the point of falling over but never quite reaching it trying to sing a wizards staff has a knob on the end in harmony or at least in the same key tis big an iss round an weighs three to the sang chidder blast whatve i stepped in anyone know where we are said arthur we we were headed for the guildhouse said teppic only must of took the wrong way thats the river up ahead can smell it caution penetrated arthurs armour of alcohol could be dangerous pep plep people around this time o night he hazarded yep said chidder with satisfaction us got ticket to prove it got test and everything like to see anyone try anything with us right agreed teppic leaning against him for support of a sort well slit them from wossname to thingy right they lurched uncertainly out on to the brass bridge in fact there were dangerous people around in the predawn shadows and currently these were some twenty paces behind them the complex system of criminal guilds had not actually made ankhmorpork a safer place it just rationalised its dangers and put them on a regular and reliable footing the major guilds policed the city with more thoroughness and certainly more success than the old watch had ever managed and it was true that any freelance and unlicensed thief caught by the thieves guild would soon find himself remanded in custody by social inquiry reports plus having his knees nailed together however there were always a few spirits who would venture a precarious living outside the lawless and the five men of this description were closing cautiously on the trio to introduce them to this weeks special offer a cut throat plus theft and burial in the river mud of your choice people normally keep out of the way of assassins because of an instinctive feeling that killing people for very large sums of money is disapproved of by the gods and could result in hubris which is the judgement of the gods the gods are great believers in justice at least as far as it extends to humans and have been known to dispense it so enthusiastically that people miles away are turned into cruet however assassins black doesnt frighten everyone and in certain sections of society there is a distinct cachet in killing an assassin its rather like smashing a sixer in conkers broadly therefore the three even now lurching across the deserted planks of the brass bridge were dead drunk assassins and the men behind them were bent on inserting the significant comma chidder wandered into one of the heraldic wooden hippopotami eight heraldic hippos line the bridge facing out to sea it is said that if danger ever threatens the city they will run away that lined the seaward edge of the bridge bounced off and flopped over the parapet feel sick he announced feel free said arthur thats what the rivers for teppic sighed he was attached to rivers which he felt were designed to have water lilies on top and crocodiles underneath and the ankh always depressed him because if you put a water lily in it it would dissolve it drained the huge silty plains all the way to the ramtop mountains and by the time it had passed through ankhmorpork pop one million it could only be called a liquid because it moved faster than the land around it actually being sick in it would probably make it on average marginally cleaner he stared down at the thin trickle that oozed between the central pillars and then raised his gaze to the grey horizon suns coming up he announced dont remember eating that muttered chidder teppic stepped back and a knife ripped past his nose and buried itself in the buttocks of the hippo next to him five figures stepped out of the mists the three assassins instinctively drew together you come near me youll really regret it moaned chidder clutching his stomach the cleaning bill will be horrible well now what have we here said the leading thief this is the sort of thing that gets said in these circumstances thieves guild are you said arthur no said the leader were the small and unrepresentative minority that gets the rest a bad name give us your valuables and weapons please this wont make any difference to the outcome you understand its just that corpse robbing is unpleasant and degrading we could rush them said teppic uncertainly dont look at me said arthur i couldnt find my arse with an atlas youll really be sorry when im sick said chidder teppic was aware of the throwing knives stuffed up either sleeve and that the chances of him being able to get hold of one in time still to be alive to throw it were likely to be very small at times like this religious solace is very important he turned and looked towards the sun just as it withdrew from the cloudbanks of the dawn there was a tiny dot in the centre of it the late king teppicymon xxvii opened his eyes i was flying he whispered i remember the feeling of wings what am i doing here he tried to stand up there was a temporary feeling of heaviness which suddenly dropped away so that he rose to his feet almost without any effort he looked down to see what had caused it oh dear he said the culture of the river kingdom had a lot to say about death and what happened afterwards in fact it had very little to say about life regarding it as a sort of inconvenient prelude to the main event and something to be hurried through as politely as possible and therefore the pharaoh reached the conclusion that he was dead very quickly the sight of his mangled body on the sand below him played a major part in this there was a greyness about everything the landscape had a ghostly look as though he could walk straight through it of course he thought i probably can he rubbed the analogue of his hands well this is it this is where it gets interesting this is where i start to really live behind him a voice said good morning the king turned hallo he said youd be death said death the king looked surprised i understood that death came as a threeheaded giant scarab beetle he said death shrugged well now you know whats that thing in your hand this its a scythe strangelooking object isnt it said the pharaoh i thought death carried the flail of mercy and the reaping hook of justice death appeared to think about this what in he said pardon are we still talking about a giant beetle ah in his mandibles i suppose but i think hes got arms in one of the frescoes in the palace the king hesitated seems a bit silly really now i come to tell someone i mean a giant beetle with arms and the head of an ibis i seem to recall death sighed he was not a creature of time and therefore past and future were all one to him but there had been a period when hed made an effort to appear in whatever form the client expected this foundered because it was usually impossible to know what the client was expecting until after they were dead and then hed decided that since noone ever really expected to die anyway he might as well please himself and hed henceforth stuck to the familiar blackcowled robe which was neat and very familiar and acceptable everywhere like the best credit cards anyway said the pharaoh i expect wed better be going where to dont you know i am here only to see that you die at the appointed time what happens next is up to you well the king automatically scratched his chin i suppose i have to wait until theyve done all the preparations and so forth mummified me and built a bloody pyramid um do i have to hang around here to wait for all that i assume so death clicked his fingers and a magnificent white horse ceased its grazing on some of the garden greenery and trotted towards him oh well i think i shall look away they take all the squishy inside bits out first you know a look of faint worry crossed his face things that had seemed perfectly sensible when he was alive seemed a little suspect now that he was dead its to preserve the body so that it may begin life anew in the netherworld he added in a slightly perplexed voice and then they wrap you in bandages at least that seems logical he rubbed his nose but then they put all this food and drink in the pyramid with you bit weird really where are ones internal organs at this point thats the funny thing isnt it theyre in a jar in the next room said the king his voice edged with doubt we even put a damn great model cart in dads pyramid his frown deepened solid wood it was he said half to himself with gold leaf all over it and four wooden bullocks to pull it then we whacked a damn great stone over the door he tried to think and found that it was surprisingly easy new ideas were pouring into his mind in a cold clear stream they had to do with the play of light on the rocks the deep blue of the sky the manifold possibilities of the world that stretched away on every side of him now that he didnt have a body to importune him with its insistent demands the world seemed full of astonishments but unfortunately among the first of them was the fact that much of what you thought was true now seemed as solid and reliable as marsh gas and also that just as he was fully equipped to enjoy the world he was going to be buried inside a pyramid when you die the first thing you lose is your life the next thing is your illusions i can see you have got a lot to think about said death mounting up and now if youll excuse me hang on a moment yes when i fell i could have sworn that i was flying that part of you that was divine did fly naturally you are now fully mortal mortal take it from me i know about these things oh look theres quite a few questions id like to ask there always are im sorry death clapped his heels to his horses flanks and vanished the king stood there as several servants came hurrying along the palace wall slowed down as they approached his corpse and advanced with caution are you all right o jewelled master of the sun one of them ventured no im not snapped the king who was having some of his basic assumptions about the universe severely raffled and that never puts anyone in a good mood im by way of being dead just at the moment amazing isnt it he added bitterly can you hear us o divine bringer of the morning inquired the other servant tiptoeing closer ive just fallen off a hundred foot wall on to my head what do you think shouted the king i dont think he can hear us jahmet said the other servant listen said the king whose urgency was equalled only by the servants total inability to hear anything he was saying you must find my son and tell him to forget about the pyramid business at least until ive thought about it a bit there are one or two points which seem a little selfcontradictory about the whole afterlife arrangements and shall i shout said jahmet i dont think you can shout loud enough i think hes dead jahmet looked down at the stiffening corpse bloody hell he said eventually well thats tomorrow up the spout for a start the sun unaware that it was making its farewell performance continued to drift smoothly above the rim of the world and out of it moving faster than any bird should be able to fly a seagull bore down on ankhmorpork on the brass bridge and eight still figures on one staring face seagulls were common enough in ankh but as this one flew over the group it uttered one long guttural scream that caused three of the thieves to drop their knives nothing with feathers ought to have been able to make a noise like that it had claws in it the bird wheeled in a tight circle and fluttered to a perch on a convenient wooden hippo where it glared at the group with mad red eyes the leading thief tore his fascinated gaze away from it just as he heard arthur say quite pleasantly this is a number two throwing knife i got ninetysix per cent for throwing knives which eyeball dont you need the leader stared at him as far as the other young assassins were concerned he noticed one was still staring fixedly at the seagull while the other was busy being noisily sick over the parapet theres only one of you he said theres five of us but soon there will only be four of you said arthur moving slowly like someone in a daze teppic reached out his hand to the seagull with any normal seagull this would have resulted in the loss of a thumb but the creature hopped on to it with the smug air of the master returning to the old plantation it seemed to make the thieves increasingly uneasy arthurs smile wasnt helping either thats a nice bird said the leader in the inanely cheerful tones of the extremely worried teppic was dreamily stroking its bullet head i think it would be a good idea if you went away said arthur as the bird shuffled sideways on to teppics wrist gripping with webbed feet thrusting out its wings to maintain its balance it should have looked clownish but instead looked full of hidden power as though it was an eagles secret identity when it opened its mouth revealing a ridiculous purple bird tongue there was a suggestion that this seagull could do a lot more than menace a seaside tomato sandwich is it magic said one of the thieves and was quickly hushed well be going then said the leader sorry about the misunderstanding teppic gave him a warm unseeing smile then they all heard the insistent little noise six pairs of eyes swivelled around and down chidders were already in position below them pouring darkly across the dehydrated mud the ankh was rising dios first minister and high priest among high priests wasnt a naturally religious man it wasnt a desirable quality in a high priest it affected your judgement made you unsound start believing in things and the whole business became a farce not that he had anything against belief people needed to believe in gods if only because it was so hard to believe in people the gods were necessary he just required that they stayed out of the way and let him get on with things mind you it was a blessing that he had the looks for it if your genes saw fit to give you a tall frame a bald head and a nose you could plough rocks with they probably had a definite aim in mind he instinctively distrusted people to whom religion came easily the naturally religious he felt were unstable and given to wandering in the desert and having revelations as if the gods would lower themselves to that sort of thing and they never got anything done they started thinking that rituals werent important they started thinking that you could talk to the gods direct dios knew with the kind of rigid and unbending certainty you could pivot the world on that the gods of djelibeybi liked ritual as much as anyone else after all a god who was against ritual would be like a fish who was against water he sat on the steps of the throne with his staff across his knees and passed on the kings orders the fact that they were not currently being issued by any king was not a problem dios had been high priest now for well more years than he cared to remember he knew quite clearly what orders a sensible king would be giving and he gave them anyway the face of the sun was on the throne and that was what mattered it was a solid gold headenveloping mask to be worn by the current ruler on all public occasions its expression to the sacrilegious was one of goodnatured constipation for thousands of years it had symbolised kingship in djelibeybi it had also made it very difficult to tell kings apart this was extremely symbolic as well although noone could remember what of there was a lot of that sort of thing in the old kingdom the staff across his knees for example with its very symbolic snakes entwined symbolically around an allegorical camel prod the people believed this gave the high priests power over the gods and the dead but this was probably a metaphor ie a lie dios shifted position has the king been ushered to the room of going forth he said the circle of lesser high priests nodded dil the embalmer is attending upon him at this instant o dios very well and the builder of pyramids has been instructed hoot koomi high priest of khefin the twofaced god of gateways stepped forward i took the liberty of attending to that myself o dios he purred dios tapped his fingers on his staff yes he said i have no doubt that you did it was widely expected by the priesthood that koomi would be the one to succeed dios in the event of dios ever actually dying although hanging around waiting for dios to die had never seemed to be a rewarding occupation the only dissenting opinion was that of dios himself who if he had any friends would probably have confided in them certain conditions that would need to apply first viz blue moons aerial pigs and he dios being seen in hell he would probably have added that the only difference between koomi and a sacred crocodile was the crocodiles basic honesty of purpose very well he said if i may remind your lordship said koomi the faces of the other priests went a nice safe blank as dios glared yes koomi the prince o dios has he been summoned no said dios then how will he know said koomi he will know said dios firmly how will this be he will know and now you are all dismissed go away see to your gods they scurried out leaving dios alone on the steps it had been his accustomed position for so long that hed polished a groove in the stonework into which he fitted exactly of course the prince would know it was part of the neatness of things but in the grooves of his mind ground deep by the years of ritual and due observance dios detected a certain uneasiness it was not at home in there uneasiness was something that happened to other people he hadnt got where he was today by allowing room for doubt yet there was a tiny thought back there a tiny certainty that there was going to be trouble with this new king well the boy would soon learn they all learned he shifted position and winced the aches and pains were back and he couldnt allow that they got in the way of his duty and his duty was a sacred trust hed have to visit the necropolis again tonight hes not himself you can see that who is he then said chidder they splashed unsteadily down the street not drunkenly this time but with the awkward gait of two people trying to do the steering for three teppic was walking but not in a way that gave them any confidence that his mind was having any part of it around them doors were being thrown open curses were being cursed there was the sound of furniture being dragged up to firstfloor rooms must have been a hell of a storm up in the mountains said arthur it doesnt usually flood like this even in the spring maybe we should burn some feathers under his nose suggested chidder that bloody seagull would be favourite arthur growled what seagull you saw it well what about it you did see it didnt you uncertainty flickered its dark flame in arthurs eyes the seagull had disappeared in all the excitement my attention was a bit occupied said chidder diffidently it must have been those mint wafers they served with the coffee i thought they were a bit off definitely a touch eldritch that bird said arthur look lets put him down somewhere while i empty the water out of my boots can we there was a bakery nearby its doors thrown open so that the trays of new loaves could cool in the early morning they propped teppic against the wall he looks as though someone hit him on the head said chidder noone did did they arthur shook his head teppics face was locked in a gentle grin whatever his eyes were focused on wasnt occupying the usual set of dimensions we ought to get him back to the guild and into the san he stopped there was a peculiar rustling sound behind him the loaves of bread were bouncing gently on their trays one or two of them vibrated on to the floor where they spun around like overturned beetles then their crusts cracking open like eggshells they sprouted hundreds of green shoots within a few seconds the trays were waving stands of young corn their heads already beginning to fill out and bend over through them marched chidder and arthur pokerfaced doing the metre nonchalant walk with teppic held rigidly between them is it him doing all this ive got a feeling that arthur looked behind them just in case any angry bakers had come out and spotted such aggressively wholemeal produce and stopped so suddenly that the other two swung around him like a rudder they looked thoughtfully at the street not something you see every day that said chidder at last you mean the way theres grass and stuff growing up everywhere he puts his feet yes their eyes met as one they looked down at teppics shoes he was already ankledeep in greenery which was cracking the centuriesold cobbles in its urgency without speaking a word they gripped his elbows and lifted him into the air the san said arthur the san agreed chidder but they both knew even then that this was going to involve more than a hot poultice the doctor sat back fairly straightforward he said thinking quickly a case of mortis portalis tackulatum with complications whats that mean said chidder in laymans terms the doctor sniffed hes as dead as a doornail what are the complications the doctor looked shifty hes still breathing he said look his pulse is nearly humming and hes got a temperature you could fry eggs on he hesitated aware that this was probably too straightforward and easily understood medicine was a new art on the disc and wasnt going to get anywhere if people could understand it pyrocerebrum ouerf culinaire he said after working it out in his head well what can you do about it said arthur nothing hes dead all the medical tests prove it so er bury him keep him nice and cool and tell him to come and see me next week in daylight for preference but hes still breathing these are just reflex actions that might easily confuse the layman said the doctor airily chidder sighed he suspected that the guild who after all had an unrivalled experience of sharp knives and complex organic compounds was much better at elementary diagnostics than were the doctors the guild might kill people but at least it didnt expect them to be grateful for it teppic opened his eyes i must go home he said dead is he said chidder the doctor was a credit to his profession its not unusual for a corpse to make distressing noises after death he said valiantly which can upset relatives and teppic sat bolt upright also muscular spasms in the stiffening body can in certain circumstances the doctor began but his heart wasnt in it any more then an idea occurred to him its a rare and mysterious ailment he said which is going around a lot at the moment its caused by a a by some thing so small it cant be detected in any way whatsoever he finished with a selfcongratulatory smile on his face it was a good one he had to admit hed have to remember it thank you very much said chidder opening the door and ushering him through next time were feeling really well well definitely call you in its probably a walrus said the doctor as he was gently but firmly propelled out of the room hes caught a walrus theres a lot of it going the door slammed shut teppic swung his legs off the bed and clutched at his head ive got to go home he repeated why said arthur dont know the kingdom wants me you seemed to be taken pretty bad there arthur began teppic waved his hands dismissively look he said please i dont want anyone sensibly pointing out things i dont want anyone telling me i should rest none of it matters i will be back in the kingdom as soon as possible its not a case of must you understand i will and you can help me chiddy how your father has an extremely fast vessel he uses for smuggling said teppic flatly he will lend it to me in exchange for favourable consideration of future trading opportunities if we leave inside the hour it will do the journey in plenty of time my father is an honest trader on the contrary seventy per cent of his income last year was from undeclared trading in the following commodities teppics eyes stared into nothingness from illegal transport of gullanes and leuchars nine per cent from nightrunning of untaxed well thirty per cent honest chidder admitted which is a lot more honest than most youd better tell me how you know extremely quickly i dont know said teppic when i was asleep it seemed i knew everything everything about everything i think my father is dead oh said chidder gosh im sorry oh no its not like that its what he would have wanted i think he was rather looking forward to it in our family death is when you really start to you know enjoy life i expect hes rather enjoying it in fact the pharaoh was sitting on a spare slab in the ceremonial preparation room watching his own soft bits being carefully removed from his body and put into the special canopic jars this is not a sight often seen by people at least not by people in a position to take a thoughtful interest he was rather upset although he was no longer officially inhabiting his body he was still attached to it by some sort of occult bond and it is hard to be very happy at seeing two artisans up to the elbows in bits of you the jokes arent funny either not when you are as it were the butt look master dil said gern a plump redfaced young man who the king had learned was the new apprentice uk hght watch this watch this hgk your name in lights get it your name in lights see just put them in the jar boy said dil wearily and while were on the subject i didnt think much of the gottle of geer routine either sorry master and pass me over a number three brain hook while youre up that end will you coming right up master said gern and dont jog me this is a fiddly bit sure thing the king craned nearer gern rummaged around at his end of the job and then gave a long low whistle will you look at the colour of this he said you wouldnt think so would you is it something they eat master dil sighed just put it in the pot gern right you are master master yes lad which bits got the god in it master dil squinted up the kings nostril trying to concentrate that gets sorted out before he comes down here he said patiently i wondered said gern because theres not a jar for it see no there wouldnt be itd have to be a rather strange jar gern gern looked a bit disappointed oh he said so hes just ordinary then is he in a strictly organic sense said dil his voice slightly muffled our mum said he was all right as a king said gern what do you think dil paused with a jar in his hand and seemed to give the conversation some thought for the first time never think about it until they come down here he said i suppose he was better than most nice pair of lungs clean kidneys good big sinuses which is what i always look for in a king he looked down and delivered his professional judgement pleasure to work with really our mum said his heart was in the right place said gern the king hovering dismally in the corner gave a gloomy nod yes he thought jar three top shelf dil wiped his hands on a rag and sighed possibly thirtyfive years in the funeral business which had given him a steady hand a philosophic manner and a keen interest in vegetarianism had also granted him powers of hearing beyond the ordinary because he was almost persuaded that right beside his ear someone else sighed too the king wandered sadly over to the other side of the room and stared at the dull liquid of the preparation vat funny that when he was alive it had all seemed so sensible so obvious now he was dead it looked a huge waste of effort it was beginning to annoy him he watched dil and his apprentice tidy up burn some ceremonial resins lift him it up carry it respectfully across the room and slide it gently into the oily embrace of the preservative teppicymon xxvii gazed into the murky depths at his own body lying sadly on the bottom like the last pickled gherkin in the jar he raised his eyes to the sacks in the corner they were full of straw he didnt need telling what was going to be done with it the boat didnt glide it insinuated itself through the water dancing across the waves on the tips of the twelve oars spreading like an oil slick gliding like a bird it was man black and shaped like a shark there was no drummer to beat the rhythm the boat didnt want the weight anyway hed have needed the full kit including snares teppic sat between the lines of silent rowers in the narrow gully that was the cargo hold better not to speculate what cargoes the boat looked designed to move very small quantities of things very quickly and without anyone noticing and he doubted whether even the smugglers guild was aware of its existence commerce was more interesting than he thought they found the delta with suspicious ease how many times had this whispering shadow slipped up the river he wondered and above the exotic smells from the mysterious former cargo he could detect the scents of home crocodile dung reed pollen waterlily blossoms lack of plumbing the rank of lions and reek of hippos the leading oarsman tapped him gently on the shoulder and motioned him up steadied him as he stepped overboard into a few feet of water by the time hed waded ashore the boat had turned and was a mere suspicion of a shadow downstream because he was naturally curious teppic wondered where it would lie up during the day since it had the look about it of a boat designed to travel only under cover of darkness and decided that itd probably lurk somewhere in the high reed marshes on the delta and because he was now a king he made a mental note to have the marshes patrolled periodically from now on a king should know things he stopped ankle deep in river ooze he had known everything arthur had rambled on vaguely about seagulls and rivers and loaves of bread sprouting which suggested hed drunk too much all teppic could remember was waking up with a terrible sense of loss as his memory failed to hold and leaked away its new treasures it was like the tremendous insights that come in dreams and vanish on waking hed known everything but as soon as he tried to remember what it was it poured out of his head as from a leaky bucket but it had left him with a new sensation before his life had been ambling along bent by circumstance now it was clicking along on bright rails perhaps he hadnt got it in him to be an assassin but he knew he could be a king his feet found solid ground the boat had dropped him off a little way downstream of the palace and blue in the moonlight the pyramid flares on the far bank were filling the night with their familiar glow the abodes of the happy dead came in all sizes although not of course in all shapes they clustered thickly nearer the city as though the dead like company and even the oldest ones were all complete noone had borrowed any of the stones to build houses or make roads teppic felt obscurely proud of that noone had unsealed the doors and wandered around inside to see if the dead had any old treasures they werent using any more and every day without fail food was left in the little antechambers the commissaries of the dead occupied a large part of the palace sometimes the food went sometimes it didnt the priests however were very clear on this point regardless of whether the food was consumed or not it had been eaten by the dead presumably they enjoyed it they never complained or came back for seconds look after the dead said the priests and the dead would look after you after all they were in the majority teppic pushed aside the reeds he straightened his clothing brushed some mud off his sleeve and set off for the palace ahead of him dark against the flarelight stood the great statue of khuft seven thousand years ago khuft had led his people out of teppic couldnt remember but somewhere where they hadnt liked being probably and for thoroughly good reasons it was at times like this he wished he knew more history and had prayed in the desert and the gods of the place had shown him the old kingdom and he had entered yea and taken possession thereof that it should ever be the dwelling place of his seed something like that anyway there were probably more yeas and a few verilys with added milk and honey but the sight of that great patriarchal face that outstretched arm that chin you could crack stones on bold in the flarelight told him what he already knew he was home and he was never going to leave again the sun began to rise the greatest mathematician alive on the disc and in fact the last one in the old kingdom stretched out in his stall and counted the pieces of straw in his bedding then he estimated the number of nails in the wall then he spent a few minutes proving that an automorphic resonance field has a semiinfinite number of irresolute prime ideals after that in order to pass the time he ate his breakfast again book ii the book of the dead two weeks went past ritual and ceremony in their due times kept the world under the sky and the stars in their courses it was astonishing what ritual and ceremony could do the new king examined himself in the mirror and frowned whats it made of he said its rather foggy bronze sire polished bronze said dios handing him the flail of mercy in ankhmorpork we had glass mirrors with silver on the back they were very good yes sire here we have bronze sire do i really have to wear this gold mask the face of the sun sire handed down through all the ages yes sire on all public occasions sire teppic peered out through the eye slots it was certainly a handsome face it smiled faintly he remembered his father visiting the nursery one day and forgetting to take it off teppic had screamed the place down its rather heavy it is weighted with the centuries said dios and passed over the obsidian reaping hook of justice have you been a priest long dios many years sire man and eunuch now father said you were high priest even in grandads time you must be very old wellpreserved sire the gods have been kind to me said dios in the face of the evidence and now sire if we could just hold this as well what is it the honeycomb of increase sire very important teppic juggled it into position i expect youve seen a lot of changes he said politely a look of pain passed over the old priests face but quickly as if it was in a hurry to get away no sire he said smoothly i have been very fortunate oh whats this the sheaf of plenty sire extremely significant very symbolic if you could just tuck it under my arm then have you ever heard of plumbing dios the priest snapped his fingers at one of the attendants no sire he said and leaned forward this is the asp of wisdom ill just tuck it in here shall i its like buckets but not as um smelly sounds dreadful sire the smell keeps bad influences away i have always understood this sire is the gourd of the waters of the heavens if we could just raise our chin this is all necessary is it said teppic indistinctly it is traditional sire if we could just rearrange things a little sire here is the threepronged spear of the waters of the earth i think we will be able to get this finger around it we shall have to see about our marriage sire im not sure we would be compatible dios the high priest smiled with his mouth sire is pleased to jest sire he said urbanely however it is essential that you marry i am afraid all the girls i know are in ankhmorpork said teppic airily knowing in his heart that this broad statement referred to mrs collar who had been his bedder in the sixth form and one of the serving wenches whod taken a shine to him and always gave him extra gravy but and his blood pounded at the memory there had been the annual assassins ball and because the young assassins were trained to move freely in society and were expected to dance well and because wellcut black silk and long legs attracted a certain type of older woman theyd whirled the night away through baubons galliards and slowstepping pavonines until the air thickened with musk and hunger chidder whose simple open face and easygoing manner were a winner every time came back to bed very late for days afterwards and tended to fall asleep during lessons quite unsuitable sire we would require a consort wellversed in the observances of course our aunt is available sire there was a clatter dios sighed and motioned the attendants to pick things up if we could just begin again sire this is the cabbage of vegetative increase sorry said teppic i didnt hear you say i should marry my aunt did i you did sire interfamilial marriage is a proud tradition of our lineage said dios but my aunt is my aunt dios rolled his eyes hed advised the late king repeatedly about the education of his son but the man was stubborn stubborn now hed have to do it on the fly the gods were testing him he decided it took decades to make a monarch and he had weeks to do it in yes sire he said patiently of course and she is also your uncle your cousin and your father hold on my father the priest raised his hand soothingly a technicality he said your greatgreatgrandmother once declared she is king as a matter of political expediency and i dont believe the edict is ever rescinded but she was a woman though dios looked shocked oh no sire she is a man she herself declared this but look a chaps aunt quite so sire i quite understand well thank you said teppic it is a great shame that we have no sisters sisters it does not do to water the divine blood sire the sun might not like it now this sire is the scapula of hygiene where would you like it put king teppicymon xxvii was watching himself being stuffed it was just as well he didnt feel hunger these days certainly he would never want to eat chicken again very nice stitching there master just keep your finger still gern my mother does stitching like that shes got a pinny with stitching like that has our mum said gern conversationally keep it still i said its got all ducks and hens on it gern supplied helpfully dil concentrated on the job in hand it was good workmanship he was prepared to admit the guild of embalmers and allied trades had awarded him medals for it it must make you feel really proud said gern what well our mam says the king goes on living sort of thing after all this stuffing and stitching sort of in the netherworld with your stitching in him and several sacks of straw and a couple of buckets of pitch thought the shade of the king sadly and the wrapping off gerns lunch although he didnt blame the lad whod just forgotten where hed put it all eternity with someones lunch wrapping as part of your vital organs there had been half a sausage left too hed become quite attached to dil and even to gern he seemed still to be attached to his body too at least he felt uncomfortable if he wandered more than a few hundred yards away from it and so in the course of the last couple of days hed learned quite a lot about them funny really hed spent the whole of his life in the kingdom talking to a few priests and so forth he knew objectively there had been other people around servants and gardeners and so forth but they figured in his life as blobs he was at the top and then his family and then the priests and the nobles of course and then there were the blobs damn fine blobs of course some of the finest blobs in the world as loyal a collection of blobs as a king might hope to rule but blobs none the less but now he was absolutely engrossed in the daily details of dils shy hopes for advancement within the guild and the unfolding story of gerns clumsy overtures to glwenda the garlic farmers daughter who lived nearby he listened in fascinated astonishment to the elaboration of a world as full of subtle distinctions of grade and station as the one he had so recently left it was terrible to think that he might never know if gern overcame her fathers objections and won his intended or if dils work on this job on him would allow him to aspire to the rank of exalted grand ninetydegree variance of the matron lodge of the guild of embalmers and allied trades it was as if death was some astonishing optical device which turned even a drop of water into a complex hive of life he found an overpowering urge to counsel dil on elementary politics or apprise gern of the benefits of washing and looking respectable he tried it several times they could sense him there was no doubt about that but they just put it down to draughts now he watched dil pad over to the big table of bandages and come back with a thick swatch which he held reflectively against what even the king was now prepared to think of as his corpse i think the linen he said at last its definitely his colour gern put his head on one side hed look good in the hessian he said or maybe the calico not the calico definitely not the calico on him its too big he could moulder into it with wear you know dil snorted wear wear you shouldnt talk to me about calico and wear what happens if someone robs the tomb in a thousand years time and him in calico id like to know hed lurch halfway down the corridor maybe throttle one of them ill grant you but then hes coming undone right the elbowsll be out in no time ill never live it down but youll be dead master dead whats that got to do with it dil riffled through the samples no itll be the hessian got plenty of give in it hessian good traction too hell really be able to lurch up speed in the passages if he ever needs to the king sighed hed have preferred something lightweight in taffeta and go and shut the door dil added its getting breezy in here and now its time said the high priest for us to see our late father he allowed himself a quiet smile i am sure he is looking forward to it he added teppic considered this it wasnt something he was looking forward to but at least it would get everyones mind off him marrying relatives he reached down in what he hoped was a kingly fashion to stroke one of the palace cats this also was not a good move the creature sniffed it went crosseyed with the effort of thought and then bit his fingers cats are sacred said dios shocked at the words teppic uttered longlegged cats with silver fur and disdainful expressions are maybe said teppic nursing his hand i dont know about this sort im sure sacred cats dont leave dead ibises under the bed and im certain that sacred cats that live surrounded by endless sand dont come indoors and do it in the kings sandals dios all cats are cats said dios vaguely and added if we would be so gracious as to follow us he motioned teppic towards a distant arch teppic followed slowly hed been back home for what seemed like ages and it still didnt feel right the air was too dry the clothes felt wrong it was too hot even the buildings seemed wrong the pillars for one thing back home back at the guild pillars were gracefull fluted things with little bunches of stone grapes and things around the top here they were massive pearshaped lumps where all the stone had run to the bottom half a dozen servants trailed behind him carrying the various items of regalia he tried to imitate dioss walk and found the movements coming back to him you turned your torso this way then you turned your head this way and extended your arms at fortyfive degrees to your body with the palms down and then you attempted to move the high priests staff raised echoes as it touched the flagstones a blind man could have walked barefoot through the palace by tracing the timeworn dimples it had created over the years i am afraid that we will find that our father has changed somewhat since we last saw him said dios conversationally as they undulated by the fresco of queen khaphut accepting tribute from the kingdoms of the world well yes said teppic bewildered by the tone hes dead isnt he theres that too said dios and teppic realised that he hadnt been referring to something as trivial as the kings current physical condition he was lost in a horrified admiration it wasnt that dios was particularly cruel or uncaring it was simply that death was a mere irritating transition in the eternal business of existence the fact that people died was just an inconvenience like them being out when you called its a strange world he thought its all busy shadows and it never changes and im part of it whos he he said pointing to a particularly big fresco showing a tall man with a hat like a chimney and a beard like a rope riding a chariot over a lot of other much smaller people his name is in the cartouche below said dios primly what the small oval sire said dios teppic peered closely at the dense hieroglyphics thin eagle eye wiggly line man with a stick bird sitting down wiggly line he read dios winced i believe we must apply ourselves more to the study of modem languages he said recovering a bit his name is ptakaba he is king when the djel empire extends from the circle sea to the rim ocean when almost half the continent pays tribute to us teppic realised what it was about the mans speech that was strange dios would bend any sentence to breaking point if it meant avoiding a past tense he pointed to another fresco and her he said she is queen khatleonrapta said dios she wins the kingdom of howandaland by stealth this is the time of the second empire but she is dead said teppic i understand so said the high priest after the slightest of pauses yes the past tense definitely bothered dios i have learned seven languages said teppic secure in the knowledge that the actual marks he had achieved in three of them would remain concealed in the ledgers of the guild indeed sire oh yes morporkian vanglemesht ephebe laotation and several others said teppic ah dios nodded smiled and continued to proceed down the corridor limping slightly but still measuring his pace like the ticking of centuries the barbarian lands teppic looked at his father the embalmers had done a good job they were waiting for him to tell them so part of him which still lived in ankhmorpork said this is a dead body wrapped up in bandages surely they cant think that this will help him get better in ankh you die and they bury you or burn you or throw you to the ravens here it just means you slow down a bit and get given all the best food its ridiculous how can you run a kingdom like this they seem to think that being dead is like being deaf you just have to speak up a bit but a second older voice said weve run a kingdom like this for seven thousand years the humblest melon farmer has a lineage that makes kings elsewhere look like mayflies we used to own the continent before we sold it again to pay for pyramids we dont even think about other countries less than three thousand years old it all seems to work hallo father he said the shade of teppicymon xxvii which had been watching him closely hurried across the room youre looking well he said good to see you look this is urgent please pay attention its about death he says he is pleased to see you said dios you can hear him said teppic i didnt hear anything the dead naturally speak through the priests said the priest that is the custom sire but he can hear me can he of course ive been thinking about this whole pyramid business and look im not certain about it teppic leaned closer auntie sends her love he said loudly he thought about this thats my aunt not yours i hope he added i say i say can you hear me he bids you greetings from the world beyond the veil said dios well yes i suppose i do but look i dont want you to go to a lot of trouble and build were going to build you a marvellous pyramid father youll really like it there therell be people to look after you and everything teppic glanced at dios for reassurance hell like that wont he i dont want one screamed the king theres a whole interesting eternity i havent seen yet i forbid you to put me in a pyramid he says that is very proper and you are a dutiful son said dios can you see me how many fingers am i holding up think its fun do you spending the rest of your death under a million tons of rock watching yourself crumble to bits is that your idea of a good epoch its rather draughty in here sire said dios perhaps we should get on anyway you cant possibly afford it and well put your favourite frescoes and statues in with you youll like that wont you said teppic desperately all your bits and pieces around you he will like it wont be he asked dios as they walked back to the throne room only i dont know i somehow got a feeling he isnt too happy about it i assure you sire said dios he can have no other desire back in the embalming room king teppicymon xxvii tried to tap gern on the shoulder which had no effect he gave up and sat down beside himself dont do it lad he said bitterly never have descendants and then there was the great pyramid itself teppics footsteps echoed on the marble tiles as he walked around the model he wasnt sure what one was supposed to do here but kings he suspected were often put in that position there was always the good old fallback which was known as taking an interest well well he said how long have you been designing pyramids ptaclusp architect and jobbing pyramid builder to the nobility bowed deeply all my life o light of noonday it must be fascinating said teppic ptaclusp looked sidelong at the high priest who nodded it has its points o fount of waters he ventured he wasnt used to kings talking to him as though he was a human being he felt obscurely that it wasnt right teppic waved a hand at the model on its podium yes he said uncertainly well good four walls and a pointy tip jolly good first class says it all really there still seemed to be too much silence around he plunged on good show he said i mean theres no doubt about it this is a pyramid and what a pyramid it is indeed this still didnt seem enough he sought for something else people will look at it in centuries to come and theyll say theyll say that is a pyramid um he coughed the walls slope nicely he croaked but he said two pairs of eyes swivelled towards his um he said dios raised an eyebrow sire i seem to remember once my father said that you know when he died hed quite like to sort of thing be buried at sea there wasnt the choke of outrage he had expected he meant the delta its very soft ground by the delta said ptaclusp itd take months to get decent footings in then theres your risk of sinking and the damp not good damp inside a pyramid no said teppic sweating under dioss gaze i think what he meant was you know in the sea ptaclusps brow furrowed tricky that he said thoughtfully interesting idea i suppose one could build a small one a million tonner and float it out on pontoons or something no said teppic trying not to laugh i think what he meant was buried without teppicymon xxvii means that he would want to be buried without delay said dios his voice like greased silk and there is no doubt that he would require to honour the very best you can build architect no im sure youve got it wrong said teppic dioss face froze ptaclusps slid into the waxen expression of someone with whom it is suddenly nothing to do he started to stare at the floor as if his very survival depended on his memorising it in extreme detail wrong said dios no offence im sure you mean well said teppic its just that well he seemed very clear about it at the time and i mean well said dios tasting each word as though it was a sour grape ptaclusp coughed he had finished with the floor now he started on the ceiling dios took a deep breath sire he said we have always been pyramid builders all our kings are buried in pyramids it is how we do things sire it is how things are done yes but it does not admit of dispute said dios who could wish for anything else sealed with all artifice against the desecrations of time now the oiled silk of his voice became armour hard as steel scornful as spears shielded for all time against the insults of change teppic glanced down at the high priests knuckles they were white the bone pressing through the flesh as though in a rage to escape his gaze slid up the greyclad arm to dioss face ye gods he thought its really true he does look like they got tired of waiting for him to die and pickled him anyway then his eyes met those of the priest more or less with a clang he felt as though his flesh was being very slowly blown off his bones he felt that he was no more significant than a mayfly a necessary mayfly certainly a mayfly that would be accorded all due respect but still an insect with all the rights thereof and as much free will in the fury of that gaze as a scrap of papyrus in a hurricane the kings will is that he be interred in a pyramid said dios in the tone of voice the creator must have used to sketch out the moon and stars er said teppic the finest of pyramids for the king said dios teppic gave up oh he said good fine yes the very best of course ptaclusp beamed with relief produced his wax tablet with a flourish and took a stylus from the recesses of his wig the important thing he knew was to clinch the deal as soon as possible let things slip in a situation like this and a man could find himself with tons of bespoke limestone on his hands then that will be the standard model shall we say o water in the desert teppic looked at dios who was standing and glaring at nothing now staring the bulldogs of entropy into submission by willpower alone i think something larger he ventured hopelessly thats the executive said ptaclusp very exclusive o base of the eternal column last you a perpetuality also our special offer this aeon is various measurements of paracosmic significance built into the very fabric at no extra cost he gave teppic an expectant look yes yes that will be fine said teppic dios took a deep breath the king requires far more than that be said i do said teppic doubtfully indeed sire it is your express wish that the greatest of monuments is erected for your father said dios smoothly this was a contest teppic knew and he didnt know the rules or how to play and he was going to lose it is oh yes yes i suppose it is really yes a pyramid unequalled along the djel said dios that is the command of the king it is only right and proper yes yes something like that er twice the normal size said teppic desperately and had the brief satisfaction of seeing dios look momentarily disconcerted sire he said it is only right and proper said teppic dios opened his mouth to protest saw teppics expression and shut it again ptaclusp scribbled busily his adams apple bobbing something like this only happened once in a business career can do you a very nice black marble facing on the outside he said without looking up we may have just enough in the quarry o king of the celestial orbs he added hurriedly very good said teppic ptaclusp picked up a fresh tablet shall we say the capstone picked out in electrum its cheaper to have built in right from the start you dont want to use just silver and then say later i wish id had a electrum yes and the usual offices what the burial chamber that is and the outer chamber id recommend the memphis very select that comes with a matching extra large treasure room so handy for all those little things one cannot bear to leave behind ptaclusp turned the tablet over and started on the other side and of course a similar suite for the queen i take it o king who shall live forever eh oh yes yes i suppose so said teppic glancing at dios everything you know then theres mazes said ptaclusp trying to keep his voice steady very popular this era very important your maze its no good deciding you ought to have put a maze in after the robbers have been maybe im oldfashioned but id go for the labrys every time like we say they may get in all right but theyll never get out it costs that little bit extra but whats money at a time like this o master of the waters something we dont have said a warning voice in the back of teppics head he ignored it he was in the grip of destiny yes he said straightening up the labrys two of them ptaclusps stylus went through his tablet his n hers o stone of stones he croaked very handy very convenient with selection of traps from stock we can offer deadfalls pitfalls sliders rolling balls dropping spears arrows yes yes said teppic well have them well have them all all of them the architect took a deep breath and of course youll require all the usual steles avenues ceremonial sphinxes he began lots said teppic we leave it entirely up to you ptaclusp mopped his brow fine he said marvellous he blew his nose your father if i may make so bold o sower of the seed is extremely fortunate in having such a dutiful son i may add you may go said dios and we will expect work to start imminently without delay i assure you said ptaclusp er he seemed to be wrestling with some huge philosophical problem yes said dios coldly its uh theres the matter of uh which is not to say uh of course oldest client valued customer but the fact is that uh absolutely no doubt about credit worthiness uh would not wish to suggest in any way whatsoever that uh dios gave him a stare that would have caused a sphinx to blink and look away you wish to say something he said his majestys time is extremely limited ptaclusp worked his jaw silently but the result was a foregone conclusion even gods had been reduced to sheepish mumbling in the face of dioss face and the carved snakes on his staff seemed to be watching him too uh no no sorry i was just uh thinking aloud ill depart then shall i such a lot of work to be done uh he bowed low he was halfway to the archway before dios added completion in three months in time for inundation what you are talking to the th monarch said dios icily ptaclusp swallowed im sorry he whispered i mean what o great king i mean block haulage alone will take uh the architects lips trembled as he tried out various comments and in his imagination ran them full tilt into dioss stare tsort wasnt built in a day he mumbled we do not believe we laid the specifications for that job said dios he gave ptaclusp a smile in some ways it was worse than everything else we will of course he said pay extra but you never pa ptaclusp began and then sagged the penalties for not completing on time will of course be terrible said dios the usual clause ptaclusp hadnt the nerve left to argue of course he said utterly defeated it is an honour will your eminences excuse me there are still some hours of daylight left teppic nodded thank you said the architect may your loins be truly fruitful saving your presence lord dios they heard him running down the steps outside it will be magnificent too big but magnificent said dios he looked out between the pillars at the necropolic panorama on the far bank of the djel magnificent he repeated he winced once more at the stab of pain in his leg ah hed have to cross the river again tonight no doubt of it hed been foolish putting it off for days but it would be unthinkable not to be in a position to serve the kingdom properly something wrong dios said teppic sire you looked a bit pale i thought a look of panic flickered over dioss wrinkled features he pulled himself upright i assure you sire i am in the best of health the best of health sire you dont think youve been overdoing it do you this time there was no mistaking the expression of terror overdoing what sire youre always bustling dios first one up last one to bed you should take it easy i exist only to serve sire said dios firmly i exist only to serve teppic joined him on the balcony the early evening sun glowed on a manmade mountain range this was only the central massif the pyramids stretched from the delta all the way up to the second cataract where the djel disappeared into the mountains and the pyramids occupied the best land near the river even the farmers would have considered it sacrilegious to suggest anything different some of the pyramids were small and made of roughhewn blocks that contrived to look far older than the mountains that fenced the valley from the high desert after all mountains had always been there words like young and old didnt apply to them but those first pyramids had been built by human beings little bags of thinking water held up briefly by fragile accumulations of calcium who had cut rocks into pieces and then painfully put them back together again in a better shape they were old over the millennia the fashions had fluctuated later pyramids were smooth and sharp or flattened and tiled with mica even the steepest of them teppic mused wouldnt rate more than o on any edificeers scale although some of the stelae and temples which flocked around the base of the pyramids like tugboats around the dreadnoughts of eternity could be worthy of attention dreadnoughts of eternity he thought sailing ponderously through the mists of time with every passenger travelling first class a few stars had been let out early teppic looked up at them perhaps he thought there is life somewhere else on the stars maybe if its true that there are billions of universes stacked alongside one another the thickness of a thought apart then there must be people elsewhere but wherever they are no matter how mightily they try no matter how magnificent the effort they surely cant manage to be as godawfully stupid as us i mean we work at it we were given a spark of it to start with but over hundreds of thousands of years weve really improved on it he turned to dios feeling that he ought to repair a little bit of the damage you can feel the age radiating off them cant you he said conversationally pardon sire the pyramids dios theyre so old dios glanced vaguely across the river are they he said yes i suppose they are will you get one said teppic a pyramid said dios sire i have one already it pleased one of your forebears to make provision for me that must have been a great honour said teppic dios nodded graciously the staterooms of forever were usually reserved for royalty it is of course very small very plain but it will suffice for my simple needs will it said teppic yawning thats nice and now if you dont mind i think ill turn in its been a long day dios bowed as though he was hinged in the middle teppic had noticed that dios had at least fifty finelytuned ways of bowing each one conveying subtle shades of meaning this one looked like no i am your humble servant and a very good day it was too if i may say so sire teppic was lost for words you thought so he said the cloud effects at dawn were particularly effective they were oh do i have to do anything about the sunset your majesty is pleased to joke said dios sunsets happen by themselves sire haha haha echoed teppic dios cracked his knuckles the trick is in the sunrise he said the crumbling scrolls of knot said that the great orange sun was eaten every evening by the sky goddess what who saved one pip in time to grow a fresh sun for next morning and dios knew that this was so the book of staying in the pit said that the sun was the eye of yay toiling across the sky each day in his endless search for his toenails and dios knew that this was so the secret rituals of the smoking mirror held that the sun was in fact a round hole in the spinning blue soap bubble of the goddess nesh opening into the fiery real world beyond and the stars were the holes that the rain comes through and dios knew that this also was so folk myth said the sun was a ball of fire which circled the world every day and that the world itself was carried through the everlasting void on the back of an enormous turtle and dios also knew that this was so although it gave him a bit of trouble and dios knew that net was the supreme god and that fon was the supreme god and so were hast set bin sot ic dhek and ptooie that herpetine triskeles alone ruled the world of the dead and so did syncope and silur the catfishheaded god and orexisnupt dios was maximum high priest to a national religion that had fermented and accreted and bubbled for more than seven thousand years and never threw a god away in case it turned out to be useful he knew that a great many mutuallycontradictory things were all true if they were not then ritual and belief were as nothing and if they were nothing then the world did not exist as a result of this sort of thinking the priests of the djel could give mind room to a collection of ideas that would make even a quantum mechanic give in and hand back his toolbox dioss staff knocked echoes from the stones as he limped along in the darkness down littlefrequented passages until he emerged on a small jetty untying the boat there the high priest climbed in with difficulty unshipped the oars and pushed himself out into the turbid waters of the dark djel his hands and feet felt too cold foolish foolish he should have done this before the boat jerked slowly into midstream as full night rolled over the valley on the far bank in response to the ancient laws the pyramids started to light the sky lights also burned late in the house of ptaclusp associates necropolitan builders to the dynasties the father and his twin sons were hunched over the huge wax designing tray arguing its not as if they ever pay said ptaclusp iia i mean its not just a case of not being able to they dont seem to have grasped the idea at least dynasties like tsort pay up within a hundred years or so why didnt you weve built pyramids along the djel for the last three thousand years said his father stiffly and we havent lost by it have we no we havent because the other kingdoms look to the djel they say theres a family that really knows its pyramids connysewers they say well have what theyre having if you please with knobs on anyway theyre real royalty he added not like some of the ones you get these days here today gone next millennium theyre half gods too you dont expect real royalty to pay its way thats one of the signs of real royalty not having any money you dont get more royal than them then youd need a new word said iia were nearly royal in that case you dont understand business my son you think its all bookkeeping well it isnt its a question of mass and the power to weight ratio they both glared at ptaclusp iib who was sitting staring at the sketches he was turning his stylus over and over in his hands which were trembling with barelysuppressed excitement well have to use granite for the lower slopes he said talking to himself the limestone wouldnt take it not with all the power flows which will be whooeee theyll be big i mean were not talking razor blades here this thing could put an edge on a rolling pin ptaclusp rolled his eyes he was only one generation into a dynasty and already it was trouble one son a born accountant the other in love with this newfangled cosmic engineering there hadnt been any such thing when he was a lad there was just architecture you drew the plans and then got in ten thousand lads on timeandahalf and double bubble at weekends they just had to pile the stuff up you didnt have to be cosmic about it descendants the gods had seen fit to give him one son who charged you for the amount of breath expended in saying good morning and another one who worshipped geometry and stayed up all night designing aqueducts you scrimped and saved to send them to the best schools and then they went and paid you back by getting educated what are you talking about he snapped the discharge alone he pulled his abacus towards him and rattled the pottery beads along the wires lets say were talking twice the height of the executive model which gives us a mass of plus additional coded dimensions of occult significance as per spec we couldnt do this sort of thing even a hundred years ago you realise not with the primitive techniques we had then his finger became a blur iia gave a snort and grabbed his own abacus limestone at two talents the ton he said wear and tear on tools masonry charges demurrage breakages oh dear oh dear oncost black marble at replacement prices ptaclusp sighed two abaci rattling in tandem the whole day long one changing the shape of the world and the other one deploring the cost whatever happened to the two bits of wood and a plumbline the last beads clicked against the stops itd be a whole quantum leap in pyramidology said iib sitting back with a messianic grin on his face itd be a whole kwa iia began quantum said iib savouring the word itd be a whole quantum leap in bankruptcy said iia theyd have to invent a new word for that too itd be worth it as a loss leader said iib sure enough when it comes to making a loss well be in the lead said iia sourly itd practically glow in millennia to come people will look at it and say that ptaclusp he knew his pyramids all right theyll call it ptaclusps folly you mean by now the brothers were both standing up their noses a few inches apart the trouble with you sibling is that you know the cost of everything and the value of nothing the trouble with you is is is that you dont mankind must strive ever upwards yes on a sound financial footing by khuft the search for knowledge the search for probity ptaclusp left them to it and stood staring out at the yard where under the glow of torches the staff were doing a feverish stocktaking itd been a small business when father passed it on to him just a yard full of blocks and various sphinxes needles steles and other stock items and a thick stack of unpaid bills most of them addressed to the palace and respectfully pointing out that our esteemed account presented nine hundred years ago appeared to have been overlooked and prompt settlement would oblige but it had been fun in those days there was just him five thousand labourers and mrs ptaclusp doing the books you had to do pyramids dad said all the profit was in mastabas small family tombs memorial needles and general jobbing necropoli but if you didnt do pyramids you didnt do anything the meanest garlic farmer looking for something neat and long lasting with maybe some green marble chippings but within a budget wouldnt go to a man without a pyramid to his name so hed done pyramids and theyd been good ones not like some you saw these days with the wrong number of sides and walls you could put your foot through and yes somehow theyd gone from strength to strength to build the biggest pyramid ever in three months with terrible penalties if it wasnt done on time dios hadnt specified how terrible but ptaclusp knew his man and they probably involved crocodiles theyd be pretty terrible all right he stared at the flickering light on the long avenues of statues including the one of bloody hat the vultureheaded god of unexpected guests bought on the offchance years ago and turned down by the client owing to not being up to snuff in the beak department and unshiftable ever since even at a discount the biggest pyramid ever and after youd knocked your pipes out seeing to it that the nobility had their tickets to eternity were you allowed to turn your expertise homeward ie a bijou pyramidette for self and mrs ptaclusp to ensure safe delivery into the netherworld of course not even dad had only been allowed to have a mastaba although it was one of the best on the river he had to admit that redveined marble had been ordered all the way from howonderland a lot of people had asked for the same it had been good for business thats how dad would have liked it the biggest pyramid ever and theyd never remember who was under it it didnt matter if they called it ptaclusps folly or ptaclusps glory theyd call it ptaclusps he surfaced from this pool of thought to hear his sons still arguing if this was his posterity hed take his chances with ton limestone blocks at least they were quiet shut up the pair of you he said they stopped and sat down grumbling ive made up my mind he said iib doodled fitfully with his stylus iia strummed his abacus were going to do it said ptaclusp and strode out of the room and any son who doesnt like it will be cast into the outer darkness where there is a wailing and a crashing of teeth he called over his shoulder the two brothers left to themselves glowered at each other at last iia said what does quantum mean anyway iib shrugged it means add another nought he said oh said iia is that all all along the river valley of the djel the pyramids were flaring silently into the night discharging the accumulated power of the day great soundless flames erupted from their capstones and danced upwards jagged as lightning cold as ice for hundreds of miles the desert glittered with the constellations of the dead the aurora of antiquity but along the valley of the djel the lights ran together in one solid ribbon of fire it was on the floor and it had a pillow at one end it had to be a bed teppic found he was doubting it as he tossed and turned trying to find some part of the mattress that was prepared to meet him halfway this is stupid he thought i grew up on beds like this and pillows carved out of rock i was born in this palace this is my heritage i must be prepared to accept it i must order a proper bed and a feather pillow from ankh first thing in the morning i the king have said this shall be done he turned over his head hitting the pillow with a thud and plumbing what a great idea that was it was amazing what you could do with a hole in the ground yes plumbing and bloody doors teppic definitely wasnt used to having several attendants waiting on his will all the time so performing his ablutions before bed had been extremely embarrassing and the people too he was definitely going to get to know the people it was wrong all this skulking in palaces and how was a fellow supposed to sleep with the sky over the river glowing like a firework eventually sheer exhaustion wrestled his body into some zone between sleeping and waking and mad images stalked across his eyeballs there was the shame of his ancestors when future archaeologists translated the asyet unpainted frescoes of his reign squiggle constipated eagle wiggly line hippos bottom squiggle and in the year of the cycle of cephnet the sun god teppic had plumbing installed and scorned the pillows of his forebears he dreamed of khuft huge bearded speaking in thunder and lightning calling down the wrath of the heavens on this descendant who was betraying the noble past dios floated past his vision explaining that as a result of an edict passed several thousand years ago it was essential that he marry a cat variousheaded gods vied for his attention explaining details of godhood while in the background a distant voice tried to attract his attention and screamed something about not wanting to be buried under a load of stone but he had no time to concentrate on this because he saw seven fat cows and seven thin cows one of them playing a trombone but that was an old dream he dreamt that one nearly every night and then there was a man firing arrows at a tortoise and then he was walking over the desert and found a tiny pyramid only a few inches high a wind sprang up and blew away the sand only now it wasnt a wind it was the pyramid rising sand tumbling down its gleaming sides and it grew bigger and bigger bigger than the world so that at last the pyramid was so big that the whole world was a speck in the centre and in the centre of the pyramid something very strange happened and the pyramid grew smaller taking the world with it and vanished of course when youre a pharaoh you get a very high class of obscure dream another day dawned courtesy of the king who was curled up on the bed and using his rolledup clothes as a pillow around the stone maze of the palace the servants of the kingdom began to wake up dioss boat slid gently through the water and bumped into the jetty dios climbed out and hurried into the palace bounding up the steps three at a time and rubbing his hands together at the thought of a fresh day laid out before him every hour and ritual ticking neatly into place so much to organise so much to be needed for the chief sculptor and maker of mummy cases folded up his measure you done a good job there master dil he said dil nodded there was no false modesty between craftsmen the sculptor gave him a nudge what a team eh he said you pickle em i crate em dil nodded but rather more slowly the sculptor looked down at the wax oval in his hands cant say i think much of the death mask mind he said gern who was working hard on the corner slab on one of the queens late cats which he had been allowed to do all by himself looked up in horror i done it very careful he said sulkily thats the whole point said the sculptor i know said dil sadly its the nose isnt it it was more the chin and the chin yes yes they looked in gloomy silence at the waxen visage of the pharaoh so did the pharaoh nothing wrong with my chin you could put a beard on it said dil eventually itd cover a lot of it would a beard theres still the nose you could take half an inch off that and do something with the cheekbones yes yes gern was horrified thats the face of our late king youre talking about he said you cant do that sort of thing anyway people would notice he hesitated wouldnt they the two craftsmen eyed one another gern said dil patiently certainly theyll notice but they wont say anything they expect us to er improve matters after all said the chief sculptor cheerfully you dont think theyre going to step up and say its all wrong he really had a face like a shortsighted chicken do you thank you very much thank you very much indeed i must say the pharaoh went and sat by the cat it seemed that people only had respect for the dead when they thought the dead were listening i suppose said the apprentice with some uncertainty he did look a bit ugly compared to the frescoes thats the point isnt it said dil meaningfully gerns big honest spotty face changed slowly like a cratered landscape with clouds passing across it it was dawning on him that this came under the heading of initiation into ancient craft secrets you mean even the painters change the he began dil frowned at him we dont talk about it he said gern tried to force his features into an expression of worthy seriousness oh he said yes i see master the sculptor clapped him on the back youre a bright lad gern he said you catch on after all its bad enough being ugly when youre alive think how terrible it would be to be ugly in the netherworld king teppicymon xxvii shook his head we all have to look alike when were alive he thought and now they make sure were identical when were dead what a kingdom he looked down and saw the soul of the late cat which was washing itself when he was alive hed hated the things but just now it seemed positively companionable he patted it gingerly on its flat head it purred for a moment and then attempted to strip the flesh from his hand it was on a definite hiding to nothing there he was aware with growing horror that the trio was now discussing a pyramid his pyramid it was going to be the biggest one ever it was going to go on a highly fertile piece of sloping ground on a prime site in the necropolis it was going to make even the biggest existing pyramid look like something a child might construct in a sand tray it was going to be surrounded by marble gardens and granite obelisks it was going to be the greatest memorial ever built by a son for his father the king groaned ptaclusp groaned it had been better in his fathers day you just needed a bloody great heap of log rollers and twenty years which was useful because it kept everyone out of trouble during inundation when all the fields were flooded now you just needed a bright lad with a piece of chalk and the right incantations mind you it was impressive if you liked that kind of thing ptaclusp iib walked around the great stone block tidying an equation here highlighting a hermetic inscription there he glanced up and gave his father a brief nod ptaclusp hurried back to the king who was standing with his retinue on the cliff overlooking the quarry the sun gleaming off the mask a royal visit on top of everything else were ready if it please you o arc of the sky he said breaking into a sweat hoping against hope that oh gods the king was going to put him at his ease again he looked imploringly at the high priest who with the merest twitch of his features indicated that there was nothing he proposed to do about it this was too much he wasnt the only one to object to this dil the master embalmer had been subjected to half an hour of having to talk about his family only yesterday it was wrong people expected the king to stay in the palace it was too the king ambled towards him in a nonchalant way designed to make the master builder feel he was among friends oh no ptaclusp thought hes going to remember my name i must say youve done a tremendous amount in nine weeks its a very good start er its ptaclusp isnt it said the king ptaclusp swallowed there was no help for it now yes o hand upon the waters he said o fount of i think your majesty or sire will do said teppic ptaclusp panicked and glanced fearfully at dios who winced but nodded again the king wishes you to address him a look of pain crossed his face informally in the fashion of the barba of foreign lands you must consider yourself a very fortunate man to have such talented and hardworking sons said teppic staring down at the busy panorama of the quarry i will o sire mumbled ptaclusp interpreting this as an order why couldnt kings order people around like in the old days you knew where you were then they didnt go round being charming and treating you as some sort of equal as if you could make the sun rise too it must be a fascinating trade teppic went on as your sire wishes sire said ptaclusp if your majesty would just give the word and how exactly does all this work your sire said ptaclusp horrified you make the blocks fly do you yes o sire that is very interesting how do you do it ptaclusp nearly bit through his lip betray craft secrets he was horrified against all expectation dios came to his aid by means of certain secret signs and sigils sire he said into the origin of which it is not wise to inquire it is the wisdom of he paused the modems so much quicker than all that heaving stuff around i expect said teppic it had a certain glory sire said dios now if i may suggest oh yes press on by all means ptaclusp wiped his forehead and ran to the edge of the quarry he waved a cloth all things are defined by names change the name and you change the thing of course there is a lot more to it than that but paracosmically that is what it boils down to ptaclusp iib tapped the stone lightly with his staff the air above it wavered in the heat and then shedding a little dust the block rose gently until it bobbed a few feet off the ground held in check by mooring ropes that was all there was to it teppic had expected some thunder or at least a gout of flame but already the workers were clustering around another block and a couple of men were towing the first block down towards the site very impressive he said sadly indeed sire said dios and now we must go back to the palace it will soon be time for the ceremony of the third hour yes yes all right snapped teppic very well done ptaclusp keep up the good work ptaclusp bowed like a seesaw in flustered excitement and confusion very good your sire he said and decided to go for the big one may i show your sire the latest plans the king has approved the plans already said dios and excuse me if i am mistaken but it seems that the pyramid is well under construction yes yes but said ptaclusp it occurred to us this avenue here you see overlooking the entrance what a place we thought for a statue of for instance hat the vultureheaded god of unexpected guests at practically cost dios glanced at the sketches are those supposed to be wings he said not even cost not even cost tell you what ill do said ptaclusp desperately is that a nose said dios more a beak more a beak said ptaclusp look o priest how about i think not said dios no i really think not he scanned the quarry for teppic groaned thrust the sketches into the builders hands and started to run teppic had strolled down the path to the waiting chariots looking wistfully at the bustle around him and paused to watch a group of workers who were dressing a corner piece they froze when they felt his gaze on them and stood sheepishly watching him well well said teppic inspecting the stone although all he knew about stonemasonry could have been chiselled on a sand grain what a splendid piece of rock he turned to the nearest man whose mouth fell open youre a stonemason are you he said that must be a very interesting job the mans eyes bulged he dropped his chisel erk he said a hundred yards away dioss robes flapped around his legs as he pounded down the path he grasped the hem and galloped along sandals flapping whats your name said teppic aaaargle said the man terrified well jolly good said teppic and took his unresisting hand and shook it sire dios bellowed no and the mason spun away holding his right hand by the wrist fighting it screaming teppic gripped the arms of the throne and glared at the high priest but its a gesture of fellowship nothing more where i come from where you come from sire is here thundered dios but good grief cutting it off its too cruel dios stepped forward now his voice was back to its normal oilsmooth tones cruel sire but it will be done with precision and care with drugs to take away the pain he will certainly live but why i did explain sire he cannot use the hand again without defiling it he is a devout man and knows this very well you see sire you are a god sire but you can touch me so can the servants i am a priest sire said dios gently and the servants have special dispensation teppic bit his lip this is barbaric he said dioss features did not move it will not be done teppic said i am the king i forbid it to be done do you understand dios bowed teppic recognised no horrified disdain your wish will certainly be done o fountain of all wisdom although of course the man himself may take matters into if you will excuse me his own hands what do you mean snapped teppic sire if his colleagues had not stopped him he would have done it himself with a chisel i understand teppic stared at him and thought i am a stranger in a familiar land i see he said eventually he thought a little further then the operation is to be done with all care and the man is to be given a pension afterwards dyou see as you wish sire a proper one too indeed sire a golden handshake sire said dios impassively and perhaps we can find him some light job around the palace as a onehanded stonemason sire dioss left eyebrow arched a fraction as whatever dios certainly sire as you wish i will undertake to see if we are currently shorthanded in any department teppic glared at him i am the king you know he said sharply the fact attends me with every waking hour sire dios said teppic as the high priest was leaving sire i ordered a feather bed from ankhmorpork some weeks ago i suppose you would not know what became of it dios waved his hands in an expressive gesture i gather sire that there is considerable pirate activity off the khalian coast he said doubtless the pirates are also responsible for the nonappearance of the expert from the guild of plumbers and dunnikindivers teppic said sourly yes sire or possibly bandits sire or perhaps a giant twoheaded bird swooped down and carried him off said teppic all things are possible sire said the high priest his face radiating politeness you may go dios sire may i remind you sire that the emissaries from tsort and ephebe will be attending you at the fifth hour yes you may go teppic was left alone or at least as alone as he ever was which meant that he was all by himself except for two fan wavers a butler two enormous howonder guards by the door and a couple of handmaidens oh yes handmaidens he hadnt quite come to terms with the handmaidens yet presumably dios chose them as he seemed to oversee everything in the palace and he had shown surprisingly good taste in the matter of for example olive skins bosoms and legs the clothing these two wore would between them have covered a small saucer and this was odd because the net effect was to turn them into two attractive and mobile pieces of furniture as sexless as pillars teppic sighed with the recollection of women in ankhmorpork who could be clothed from neck to ankle in brocade and still cause a classroom full of boys to blush to the roots of their hair he reached down for the fruit bowl one of the girls immediately grasped his hand moved it gently aside and took a grape please dont peel it said teppic the peels the best part full of nourishing vitamins and minerals only i dont suppose youve heard about them have you theyve only been invented recently he added mainly to himself i mean within the last seven thousand years he finished sourly so much for time flowing past he thought glumly it might do that everywhere else but not here here it just piles up like snow its as though the pyramids slow us down like those things they used on the boat whatdyoucallem sea anchors tomorrow here is just like yesterday warmed over she peeled the grape anyway while the snowflake seconds drifted down at the site of the great pyramid the huge blocks of stone floated into place like an explosion in reverse they were flowing between the quarry and the site drifting silently across the landscape above deep rectangular shadows ive got to hand it to you said ptaclusp to his son as they stood side by side in the observation tower its astonishing one day people will wonder how we did it all that business with the log rollers and the whips is old hat said iib youcan throw them away the young architect smiled but there was a manic hint to the rictus it was astonishing it was more astonishing than it ought to be he kept getting the feeling that the pyramid was he shook himself mentally he should be ashamed of that sort of thinking you could get superstitious if you werent careful in this job it was natural for things to form a pyramid well a cone anyway hed experimented this morning grain salt not water though thatd been a mistake but a pyramid was only a neat cone wasnt it a cone which had decided to be a bit tidier perhaps hed overdone it just a gnat on the paracosmic measurements his father slapped him on the back very well done he repeated you know it almost looks as though its building itself iib yelped and bit his wrist a childish trait that he always resorted to when he was nervous ptaclusp didnt notice because at that moment one of the foremen was running to the foot of the tower waving his ceremonial measuring rod ptaclusp leaned over what he demanded i said please to come at once o master on the pyramid itself on the working surface about halfway up where some of the detailed work on the inner chambers was in progress the word impressive was no longer appropriate the word terrifying seemed to fit the bill blocks were stacking up in the sky overhead in a giant slow dance passing and repassing their mahouts yelling at one another and at the luckless controllers down on the pyramid top who were trying to shout instructions above the noise ptaclusp waded into the cluster of workers around the centre here at least there was silence dead silence all right all right he said whats going oh ptaclusp iib peered over his fathers shoulder and stuck his wrist in his mouth the thing was wrinkled it was ancient it clearly had once been a living thing it lay on the slab like a very obscene prune it was my lunch said the chief plasterer it was my bloody lunch i was really looking forward to that apple but it cant start yet whispered iib it cant form temporal nodes yet i mean how does it know its going to be a pyramid i put my hand down for it and it felt just like it felt pretty unpleasant the plasterer complained and its a negative node too added iib we shouldnt be getting them at all is it still there said ptaclusp and added tell me yes if more blocks have been set into position it wont be said his son looking around wildly as the centre of mass changes you see the nodes will be pulled around ptaclusp pulled the young man to one side what are you telling me now he demanded in a camel whisper we ought to put a cap on it mumbled iib flare off the trapped time wouldnt be any problems then how can we cap it it isnt damn well finished said ptaclusp what have you been and gone and done pyramids dont start accumulating until theyre finished until theyre pyramids see pyramid energy see named after pyramids thats why its called pyramid energy it must be something to do with the mass or something the architect hazarded and the speed of construction the time is getting trapped in the fabric i mean in theory you could get small nodes during construction but theyd be so weak you wouldnt notice if you went and stood in one maybe youd become a few hours older or younger or he began to gabble i recall when we did kheneth xivs tomb the fresco painter said it took him two hours to do the painting in the queens room and we said it was three days and fined him said ptaclusp slowly there was a lot of guild fuss i remember you just said that said iib said what about the fresco painter just a moment ago no i didnt you couldnt have been listening said placlusp could have sworn you did anyway this is worse than that business said his son and its probably going to happen again we can expect more like it yes said iib we shouldnt get negative nodes but it looks as though we will we can expect fast flows and reverse flows and probably even short loops im afraid we can expect all kinds of temporal anomalies wed better get the men off i suppose you couldnt work out a way we could get them to work in fast time and pay them for slow time said ptaclusp its just a thought your brothers bound to suggest it no keep everyone off well get the blocks in and cap it first all right all right i was just thinking out loud as if we didnt have enough problems ptaclusp waded into the cluster of workers around the centre here at least there was silence dead silence all right all right he said whats going oh ptaclusp iib peered over his fathers shoulder and stuck his wrist in his mouth the thing was wrinkled it was ancient it clearly had once been a living thing it lay on the slab like a very obscene prune it was my lunch said the chief plasterer it was my bloody lunch i was really looking forward to that apple ptaclusp hesitated this all seemed very familiar hed had this feeling before an overwhelming sensation of reja vu he met the horrified gaze of his son together dreading what they might see they turned around slowly they saw themselves standing behind themselves bickering over something iib was swearing that he had already heard he has too ptaclusp realised in dread thats me over there i look a lot different from the outside and its me over here too as well also its a loop just like in the river a tiny whirlpool only its in the flow of time and ive just gone round it twice the other ptaclusp looked up at him there was a long agonising moment of temporal strain a noise like a mouse blowing bubblegum and the loop broke and the figure faded i know whats causing it muttered iib indistinctly because of his wrist i know the pyramid isnt complete but it will be so the effects are sort of echoing backwards dad we ought to stop right now its too big i was wrong shut up can you work out where the nodes will form said ptaclusp and come away over here all the lads are staring pull yourself together son iib instinctively put his hand to his belt abacus well yes probably he said its just a function of mass distribution and right said the builder firmly start doing it and then get all the foremen to come and see me there was a glint like mica in ptaclusps eye his jaw was squared like a block of granite maybe its the pyramid thats got me thinking like this he said im thinking fast i know it and get your brother up here too he added it is the pyramid effect im remembering an idea im going to have best not to think too hard about that be practical he stared around at the halfcompleted site the gods knew we couldnt do it in time he said now we dont have to we can take as long as we like are you all right said iib dad are you all right was that one of your time loops said ptaclusp dreamily what an idea noone would ever beat them on a contract ever again theyd win bonuses for completion and it didnt matter how long it took no dad we ought but youre sure you can work out where these loops will occur are you yes i expect so but good ptaclusp was trembling with excitement maybe theyd have to pay the men more but it would be worth it and iia would be bound to think up some sort of scheme finance was nearly as good as magic the lads would have to accept it after all theyd complained about working with free men theyd complained about working with howondanians theyd complained about working with everyone except proper paidup guild members so they could hardly complain about working with themselves iib stepped back and gripped the abacus for reassurance dad he said cautiously what are you thinking about ptaclusp beamed at him doppelgangs he said politics was more interesting teppic felt that here at least he could make a contribution djelibeybi was old it was respected but it was also small and in the swordedged sense which was what seemed to matter these days had no power it wasnt always thus as dios told it once it had ruled the world by sheer force of nobility hardly needing the standing army of twentyfive thousand men it had in those high days now it wielded a more subtle power as a narrow state between the huge and thrusting empires of tsort and ephebe each one both a threat and a shield for more than a thousand years the kings along the djel had with extreme diplomacy exquisite manners and the footwork of a centipede on adrenaline kept the peace along the whole widdershins side of the continent merely having existed for seven thousand years can be a formidable weapon if you use it properly you mean were neutral ground said teppic tsort is a desert culture like us said dios steepling his hands we have helped to shape it over the years as for ephebe he sniffed they have some very strange beliefs how do you mean they believe the world is run by geometry sire all lines and angles and numbers that sort of thing sire dios frowned can lead to some very unsound ideas ah said teppic resolving to learn more about unsound ideas as soon as possible so were secretly on the side of tsort yes no it is important that ephebe remains strong but weve more in common with tsort so we allow them to believe sire but they are a desert culture dios smiled i am afraid they dont take pyramids seriously sire teppic considered all this so whose side are we really on our own sire there is always a way always remember sire that your family was on its third dynasty before our neighbours had worked out sire how babies are made the tsort delegation did indeed appear to have studied djeli culture assiduously almost frantically it was also clear that they hadnt begun to understand it theyd merely borrowed as many bits as seemed useful and then put them together in subtly wrong ways for example to a man they employed the threeturningwalk as portrayed on friezes and only used by the djeli court on certain occasions occasional grimaces crossed their faces as their vertebrae protested they were also wearing the khruspids of morning and the bangles of going forth as well as the kilt of yet with and no wonder even the maidens on fan duty were hiding their smiles matching greaves a bowler hat a claymore a civil war breastplate saxon trousers and a jacobean haircut hed create pretty much the same impression even teppic had to cough hurriedly but then he thought they dont know any better theyre like children and this thought was followed by another one which added these children could wipe us off the map in one hour hot on the synapses of the other two came a third thought which said its only clothes for goodness sake youre beginning to take it all seriously the group from ephebe were more sensibly dressed in white togas they had a certain sameness about them as if somewhere in the country there was a little press that stamped out small bald men with curly white beards the two parties halted before the throne and bowed halo said teppic his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii lord of the heavens charioteer of the wagon of the sun steersman of the barque of the sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king bids you welcome and commands you to take wine with him said dios

sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king commands you to be seated said dios teppic racked his brains for a suitable speech hed heard plenty in ankhmorpork they were probably the same the whole world over im sure we shall get on his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii lord of the heavens charioteer of the wagon of the sun steersman of the barque of the sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king bids you harken dios

the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king the echoes died away could i have a word with you a moment dios the high priest leaned down is all this necessary hissed teppic dioss aquiline features took on the wooden expression of one who is wrestling with an unfamiliar concept of course sire it is traditional he said at last i thought i was supposed to talk to these people you know about boundaries and trade and so on ive been doing a lot of thinking about it and ive got several ideas i mean its going to be a little difficult if youre going to keep shouting dios gave him a polite smile oh no sire that has all been sorted out sire i met with them this morning what am i supposed to do then dios made a slight circling motion with his hand just as you wish sire it is normal to smile a little and put them at their ease is that all sire could ask them whether they enjoy being diplomats sire said dios he met teppics glare with eyes as expressionless as mirrors i am the king teppic hissed certainly sire it would not do to sully the office with mere matters of leaden state sire tomorrow sire you will be holding supreme court a very fit office for a monarch sire ah yes it was quite complicated teppic listened carefully to the case which was alleged cattle theft compounded by djelis onionlayered land laws this is what it should be all about he thought noone else can work out who owns the bloody ox this is the sort of thing kings have to do now lets see five years ago he sold the ox to him but as it turned out he looked from the face of one worried farmer to the other they were both clutching their ragged straw hats close to their chests and both of them wore the paralysed wooden expressions of simple men who in pursuit of their parochial disagreement now found themselves on a marble floor in a great room with their god enthroned before their very eyes teppic didnt doubt that either one would cheerfully give up all rights to the wretched creature in exchange for being ten miles away its a fairly mature ox he thought time it was slaughtered even if its his its been fattening on his neighbours land all these years half each would be about right theyre really going to remember this judgement he raised the sickle of justice his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii lord of the heavens charioteer of the wagon of the sun steersman of the barque of the sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king will give judgement cower to the justice of his greatness the king tep teppic cut dios off in midintone having listened to both sides of the case he said firmly the mask giving it a slight boom and being impressed by the argument and counterargument it seems to us only just that the beast in question should be slaughtered without delay and shared with all fairness between both plaintiff and defendant he sat back theyll call me teppic the wise he thought the common people go for this sort of thing the farmers gave him a long blank stare then as if they were both mounted on turntables they turned and looked to where dios was sitting in his place on the steps in a group of lesser priests dios stood up smoothed his plain robe and extended the staff harken to the interpreted wisdom of his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii lord of the heavens charioteer of the wagon of the sun steersman of the barque of the sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king he said it is our divine judgement that the beast in dispute is the property of rhumusphut it is our divine judgement that the beast be sacrificed upon the altar of the concourse of gods in thanks for the attention of our divine self it is our further judgement that both rhumusphut and ktoffle work a further three days in the fields of the king in payment for this judgement dios raised his head until he was looking along his fearsome nose right into teppics mask he raised both hands mighty is the wisdom of his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii lord of the heavens charioteer of the wagon of the sun steersman of the barque of the sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king the farmers bobbed in terrified gratitude and backed out of the presence framed between the guards dios said teppic levelly sire just attend upon me a moment please sire repeated dios materialising by the throne i could not help noticing dios excuse me if i am wrong a certain flourish in the translation there the priest looked surprised indeed no sire i was most precise in relaying your decision saving only to refine the detail in accordance with precedent and tradition how was that the damn creature really belonged to both of them but rhumusphut is known to be punctilious in his devotions sire seeking every opportunity to laud and magnify the gods whereas ktoffle has been known to harbour foolish thoughts whats that got to do with justice everything sire said dios smoothly but now neither of them has the ox quite so sire but ktoffle does not have it because he does not deserve it while rhumusphut by his sacrifice has ensured himself greater stature in the netherworld and youll eat beef tonight i suppose said teppic it was like a blow teppic might as well have picked up the throne and hit the priest with it dios took a step backward aghast his eyes two brief pools of pain when he spoke there was a raw edge to his voice i do not eat meat sire he said it dilutes and tarnishes the soul may i summon the next case sire teppic nodded very well the next case was a dispute over the rent of a hundred square yards of riverside land teppic listened carefully good growing land was at a premium in djeli since the pyramids took up so much of it it was a serious matter it was especially serious because the lands tenant was by all accounts hardworking and conscientious while its actual owner was clearly rich and objectionable unfortunately however one chose to stack the facts he was also in the right teppic thought deeply and then squinted at dios the priest nodded at him it seems to me said teppic as fast as possible but not fast enough harken to the judgement of his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii lord of the heavens charioteer of the wagon of the sun steersman of the barque of the sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king it seems to me to us teppic repeated that taking all matters in consideration beyond those of mere mortal artifice the true and just outcome in this matter he paused this he thought isnt how a good king speaks the landlord has been weighed in the balance and found wanting he boomed through the masks mouth slit we find for the tenant as one man the court turned to dios who held a whispered consultation with the other priests and then stood up hear now the interpreted word of his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii lord of the heavens charioteer of the wagon of the sun steersman of the barque of the sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king ptorne the farmer will at once pay toons in back rent to prince imtebos prince imbetos will at once pay toons into the temple offerings of the gods of the river long live the king bring on the next case teppic beckoned to dios again is there any point in me being here he demanded in an overheated whisper please be calm sire if you were not here how would the people know that justice had been done but you twist everything i say no sire sire you give the judgement of the man i interpret the judgement of the king i see said teppic grimly well from now on there was a commotion outside the hall clearly there was a prisoner outside who was less than confident in the kings justice and the king didnt blame him he wasnt at all happy about it either it turned out to be a darkhaired girl struggling in the arms of two guards and giving them the kind of blows with fist and heel that a man would blush to give she wasnt wearing the right kind of costume for the job either it would be barely adequate for lying around peeling grapes in she saw teppic and to his secret delight flashed him a glance of pure hatred after an afternoon of being treated like a mentallydeficient statue it was a pleasure to find someone prepared to take an interest in him he didnt know what she had done but judging by the thumps she was landing on the guards it was a pretty good bet that she had done it to the very limits of her ability dios bent down to the level of the masks ear holes her name is ptraci he said a handmaiden of your father she has refused to take the potion what potion said teppic it is customary for a dead king to take servants with him into the netherworld sire teppic nodded gloomily it was a jealouslyguarded privilege the only way a penniless servant could ensure immortality he remembered grandfathers funeral and the discreet clamour of the old mans personal servants it had made father depressed for days yes but its not compulsory he said yes sire it is not compulsory father had plenty of servants i gather she was his favourite sire what exactly has she done wrong then dios sighed as one might if one were explaining things to an extremely backward child she has refused to take the potion sire sorry i thought you said it wasnt compulsory dios yes sire it is not sire it is entirely voluntary it is an act of free will and she has refused it sire ah one of those situations said teppic djelibeybi was built on those sort of situations trying to understand them could drive you mad if one of his ancestors had decreed that night was day people would go around groping in the light he leaned forward step forward young lady he said she looked at dios his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii do we have to go all through that every time yes sire lord of the heavens charioteer of the wagon of the sun steersman of the barque of the sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king bids you declare your guilt the girl shook herself out of the guards grip and faced teppic trembling with terror he told me he didnt want to be buried in a pyramid she said he said the idea of those millions of tons of rock on top of him gave him nightmares i dont want to die yet you refuse to gladly take the poison said dios yes but child said dios then the king will have you put to death anyway surely it is better to go honourably to a worthy life in the netherworld i dont want to be a servant in the netherworld there was a groan of horror from the assembled priests dios nodded then the eater of souls will take you he said sire we look to your judgement teppic realised he was staring at the girl there was something hauntingly familiar about her which he couldnt quite put his finger on let her go he said his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii lord of the heavens charioteer of the wagon of the sun steersman of the barque of the sun guardian of the secret knowledge lord of the horizon keeper of the way the flail of mercy the highborn one the neverdying king has spoken tomorrow at dawn you will be cast to the crocodiles of the river great is the wisdom of the king ptraci turned and glared at teppic he said nothing he did not dare for fear of what it might become she went away quietly which was worse than sobbing or shouting that is the last case sire said dios i will retire to my quarters said teppic coldly i have much to think about therefore i will have dinner sent in said the priest it will be roast chicken i hate chicken dios smiled no sire on wednesdays the king always enjoys chicken sire the pyramids flared the light they cast on the landscape was curiously subdued grainy almost grey but over the capstone of each tomb a zigzag flame crackled towards the sky a faint click of metal and stone sprang ptraci from a fitful doze into extreme wakefulness she stood up very carefully and crept towards the window unlike proper cell windows which should be large and airy and requiring only the removal of a few inconvenient iron bars to ensure the escape of any captives this window was a slit six inches wide seven thousand years had taught the kings along the djel that cells should be designed to keep prisoners in the only way they could get out through this slit was in bits but there was a shadow against the pyramid light and a voice said psst she flattened herself against the wall and tried to reach up to the slit who are you im here to help you oh damn do they call this a window look im lowering a rope a thick silken cord knotted at intervals dropped past her shoulder she stared at it for a second or two and then kicked off her curlytoed shoes and climbed up it the face on the other side of the slit was halfconcealed by a black hood but she could just make out a worried expression dont despair it said i wasnt despairing i was trying to get some sleep oh pardon me im sure ill just go away and leave you shall i but in the morning i shall wake up and then ill despair what are you standing on demon do you know what a crampon is no well its two of them they stared at each other in silence okay said the face at last ill have to go around and come in through the door dont go away and with that it vanished upwards ptraci let herself slide back down to the chilly stones of the floor come in through the door she wondered how it could manage that humans would need to open it first she crouched in the furthest corner of the cell staring at the small rectangle of wood long minutes went past at one point she thought she heard a tiny noise like a gasp a little later there was subtle clink of metal so slight as to be almost beyond the range of hearing more time wound on to the spool of eternity and then the silence beyond the cell which had been the silence caused by absence of sound very slowly became the silence caused by someone making no noise she thought its right outside the door there was a pause in which teppic oiled all the bolts and hinges so that when he made the final assault the door swished open in heartgripping noiselessness i say said a voice in the darkness ptraci pressed herself still further into the corner look ive come to rescue you now she could make out a blacker shadow in the flarelight it stepped forward with rather more uncertainty than she would have expected from a demon are you coming or not it said ive only knocked out the guards its not their fault but we havent got a lot of time im to be thrown to the crocodiles in the morning whispered ptraci the king himself decreed it he probably made a mistake ptracis eyes widened in horrified disbelief the soul eater will take me she said do you want it to ptraci hesitated well then said the figure and took her unresisting hand he led her out of the cell where she nearly tripped over the prone body of a guard who is in the other cells he said pointing to the line of doors along the passage i dont know said ptraci lets find out shall we the figure touched a can to the bolts and hinges of the next door and pushed it open the flare from the narrow window illuminated a middleaged man seated crosslegged on the floor im here to rescue you said the demon the man peered up at him rescue he said yes why are you here the man hung his head i spoke blasphemy against the king how did you do that i dropped a rock on my foot now my tongue is to be torn out the dark figure nodded sympathetically a priest heard you did he he said no i told a priest such words should not go unpunished said the man virtuously were really good at it teppic thought mere animals couldnt possibly manage to act like this you need to be a human being to be really stupid i think we ought to talk about this outside he said why not come with me the man pulled back and glared at him you want me to run away he said seems a good idea wouldnt you say the man stared into his eyes his lips moving silently then he appeared to reach a decision guards he screamed the shout echoed through the sleeping palace his wouldbe rescuer stared at him in disbelief mad teppic said youre all mad he stepped out of the room grabbed ptracis hand and hurried along the shadowy passages behind them the prisoner made the most of his tongue while he still had it and used it to scream a stream of imprecations where are you taking me said ptraci as they marched smartly around a corner and into a pillarbarred courtyard teppic hesitated he hadnt thought much beyond this point why do they bother to bolt the doors he demanded eyeing the pillars thats what i want to know im surprised you didnt wander back to your cell while i was in there i i dont want to die she said quietly dont blame you you mustnt say that its wrong not to want to die teppic glanced up at the roof around the courtyard and unslung his grapnel i think i ought to go back to my cell said ptraci without actually making any move in that direction its wrong even to think of disobeying the king oh what happens to you then something bad she said vaguely you mean worse than being thrown to the crocodiles or having your soul taken by the soul eater said teppic and caught the grapnel firmly on some hidden ledge on the flat roof thats an interesting point said ptraci winning the teppic award for clear thinking worth considering isnt it teppic tested his weight on the cord what youre saying is if the worst is going to happen to you anyway you might as well not bother any more said ptraci if the soul eater is going to get you whatever you do you might as well avoid the crocodiles is that it you go up first said teppic i think someones coming who are you teppic fished in his pouch hed come back to djeli an aeon ago with just the clothes he stood up in but they were the clothes hed stood up in throughout his exam he balanced a number two throwing knife in his hand the steel glinting in the flarelight it was possibly the only steel in the country it wasnt that djelibeybi hadnt heard about iron it was just that if copper was good enough for your greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather it was good enough for you no the guards didnt deserve knives they hadnt done anything wrong his hand closed over the little mesh bag of caltraps these were a small model a mere one inch per spike caltraps didnt kill anyone they just slowed them down a bit one or two of them in the sole of the foot induced extreme slowness and caution in all except the terminally enthusiastic he scattered a few across the mouth of the passage and ran back to the rope hauling himself up in a few quick swings he reached the roof just as the leading guards ran under the lintel he waited until he heard the first curse and then coiled up the rope and hurried after the girl theyll catch us she said i dont think so and then the king will have us thrown to the crocodiles oh no i dont think teppic paused it was an intriguing idea he might he ventured its very hard to be sure about anything so what shall we do now teppic stared across the river where the pyramids were ablaze the great pyramid was still under construction by flarelight a swarm of blocks dwarfed by distance hovered near its tip the amount of labour ptaclusp was putting on the job was amazing what a flare that will give he thought itll be seen all the way to ankh horrible things arent they said ptraci behind him do you think so theyre creepy the old king hated them you know he said they nailed the kingdom to the past did he say why no he just hated them he was a nice old boy very kind not like this new one she blew her nose and replaced her handkerchief in its scarcely adequate space in her sequinned bra er what exactly did you have to do as a handmaiden i mean said teppic scanning the rooftop panorama to hide his embarrassment she giggled youre not from around here are you no not really talk to him mainly or just listen he could really talk but he always said noone ever really listened to what he said yes said teppic with feeling and that was all was it she stared at him and then giggled again oh that no he was very kind i wouldnt of minded you understand i had all the proper training bit of a disappointment really the women of my family have served under the kings for centuries you know oh yes he managed i dont know whether youve ever seen a book its called the shuttered palace said teppic automatically i thought a gentleman like youd know about it said ptraci nudging him its a sort of textbook well my greatgreatgrandmother posed for a lot of the pictures not recently she added in case he hadnt fully understood i mean that would be a bit offputting shes been dead for twentyfive years when she was younger i look a lot like her everyone says urk agreed teppic she was famous she could put her feet behind her head you know so can i ive got my grade three urk the old king told me once that the gods gave people a sense of humour to make up for giving them sex i think he was a bit upset at the time urk only the whites of teppics eyes were showing you dont say much do you the breeze of the night was blowing her perfume towards him ptraci used scent like a battering ram weve got to find somewhere to hide you he said concentrating on each word havent you got any parents or anything he tried to ignore the fact that in the shadowless flarelight she appeared to glow and didnt have much success well my mother still works in the palace somewhere said ptraci but i dont think shed be very sympathetic weve got to get you away from here said teppic fervently if you can hide somewhere today i can steal some horses or a boat or something then you could go to tsort or ephebe or somewhere foreign you mean i dont think id like that said ptraci compared to the netherworld well put like that of course she took his arm why did you rescue me er because being alive is better than being dead i think ive read up to number congress of the five auspicious ants said ptraci if youve got some yoghurt we could no i mean no not here not now there must be people looking for us its nearly dawn theres no need to yelp like that i was just trying to be kind yes good thank you teppic broke away and peered desperately over a parapet into one of the palaces numerous light wells this leads to the embalmers workshops he said there must be plenty of places to hide down here he unwound the cord again various rooms led off the well teppic found one lined with benches and floored with wood shavings a doorway led through to another room stacked with mummy cases each one surmounted by the same golden dolly face hed come to know and loathe he tapped on a few and raised the lid of the nearest noone at home he said you can have a nice rest in here i can leave the lid open a bit so you can get some air you cant think id risk that supposing you didnt come back ill be back tonight said teppic and and ill see if i can drop some food and water in some time today she stood on tiptoe her ankle bangles jingling all the way down teppics libido he glanced down involuntarily and saw that every toenail was painted he remembered cheesewright telling them behind the stables one lunchhour that girls who painted their toenails were well he couldnt quite remember now but it had seemed pretty unbelievable at the time it looks very hard she said what if ive got to lie in it itll need some cushions ill put some wood shavings in look said teppic but hurry up please all right but you will be back wont you promise yes yes i promise he wedged a splinter of wood on the case to allow an airhole heaved the lid back on and ran for it the ghost of the king watched him go the sun rose as the golden light spilled down the fertile valley of the djel the pyramid flares paled and became ghost dancers against the lightening sky they were now accompanied by a noise it had been there all the time far too highpitched for mortal ears a sound now dropping down from the far ultrasonic kkkkkkkkkhhheeee it screamed out of the sky a thin rind of sound like a violin bow dragged across the raw surface of the brain kkkkheeeeeee or a wet fingernail dragged over an exposed nerve some said you could set your watch by it they would have said if anyone knew what one was keeee it went deeper and deeper as the sunlight washed over the stones passing through cat scream to dog growl ee ee ee the flares collapsed ops a fine morning sire i trust you slept well teppic waved a hand at dios but said nothing the barber was working through the ceremony of going forth shaven the barber was trembling until recently he had been a onehanded unemployed stonemason then the terrible high priest had summoned him and ordered him to be the kings barber but it meant you had to touch the king but it was all right because it was all sorted out by the priests and nothing more had to be chopped off on the whole it was better than he had thought and a great honour to be singlehandedly responsible for the kings beard such as it was you were not disturbed in any way said the high priest his eyes scanned the room on a raster of suspicion it was surprising that little lines of molten rock didnt drip off the walls verrr if you would but hold still o neverdying one said the barber in the pleading tone of voice employed by one who is assured of a guided tour of a crocodiles alimentary tract if he nicks an ear you heard no strange noises sire said dios he stepped back suddenly so that he could see behind the gilded peacock screen at the other end of the room norr your majesty looks a little peaky this morning sire said dios he sat down on the bench with the carved cheetahs on either end sitting down in the presence of the king except on ceremonial occasions was not something that was allowed it did however mean that he could squint under teppics low bed dios was rattled despite the aches and the lack of sleep teppic felt oddly elated he wiped his chin its the bed he said i think i have mentioned it mattresses you know they have feathers in them if the concept is unfamiliar ask the pirates of khali half of them must be sleeping on goosefeather mattresses by now his majesty is pleased to joke said dios teppic knew he shouldnt push it any further but he did so anyway something wrong dios he said a miscreant broke into the palace last night the girl ptraci is missing that is very disturbing yes sire probably a suitor or a swain or something dioss face was like stone possibly sire the sacred crocodiles will be going hungry then but not for long teppic thought walk to the end of any of the little jetties down by the bank let your shadow fall on the river and the mudyellow water would become by magic mudyellow bodies they looked like large sodden logs the main difference being that logs dont open at one end and bite your legs off the sacred crocodiles of the djel were the kingdoms garbage disposal river patrol and occasional morgue they couldnt simply be called big if one of the huge bulls ever drifted sideways on to the current hed dam the river the barber tiptoed out a couple of body servants tiptoed in i anticipated your majestys natural reaction sire dios continued like the drip of water in deep limestone caverns jolly good said teppic inspecting the clothes for the day what was it exactly a detailed search of the palace room by room absolutely carry on dios my face is perfectly open he told himself i havent twitched a muscle out of place i know i havent he can read me like a stele i can outstare him thank you sire i imagine theyll be miles away by now said teppic whoever they were she was only a handmaiden wasnt she it is unthinkable that anyone could disobey your judgements there is noone in the kingdom that would dare to their souls would be forfeit they will be hunted down sire hunted down and destroyed the servants cowered behind teppic this wasnt mere anger this was wrath real oldtime vintage wrath and waxing it waxed like a hatful of moons are you feeling all right dios dios had turned to look out across the river the great pyramid was almost complete the sight of it seemed to calm him down or at least stabilise him on some new mental plateau yes sire he said thank you he breathed deeply tomorrow sire you are pleased to witness the capping of the pyramid a momentous occasion of course it will be some time before the interior chambers are completed fine fine and this morning i think i should like to visit my father i am sure the late king will be pleased to see you sire it is your wish that i should accompany you oh its a fact as immutable as the third law of sod that there is no such thing as a good grand vizier a predilection to cackle and plot is apparently part of the job spec high priests tend to get put in the same category they have to face the implied assumption that no sooner do they get the funny hat than theyre issuing strange orders eg princesses tied to rocks for itinerant sea monsters and throwing little babies in the sea this is a gross slander throughout the history of the disc most high priests have been serious pious and conscientious men who have done their best to interpret the wishes of the gods sometimes disembowelling or flaying alive hundreds of people in a day in order to make sure theyre getting it absolutely right king teppicymon xxviis casket lay in state crafted it was of foryphy smaradgine skelsa and delphinet inlaid it was with pink jade and shode perfumed and fumed it was with many rare resins and perfumes it looked very impressive but the king considered it wasnt worth dying for he gave up and wandered across the courtyard a new player had entered the drama of his death grinjer the maker of models hed always wondered about the models even a humble farmer expected to be buried with a selection of crafted livestock which would somehow become real in the netherworld many a man made do with one cow like a toast rack in this world in order to afford a pedigree herd in the next nobles and kings got the complete set including model carts houses boats and anything else too big or inconvenient to fit in the tomb once on the other side theyd somehow become the genuine article the king frowned when he was alive hed known that it was true not doubted it for a moment grinjer stuck his tongue out of the corner of his mouth as with great care he tweezered a tiny oar to a perfect th scale river trireme every flat surface in his corner of the workshop was stacked with midget animals and artifacts some of his more impressive ones hung from wires on the ceiling the king had already ascertained from overheard conversation that grinjer was twentysix couldnt find anything to stop the inexorable advance of his acne and lived at home with his mother where in the evenings he made models deep in the duffel coat of his mind he hoped one day to find a nice girl who would understand the absolute importance of getting every detail right on a ceremonial sixwheeled ox cart and who would hold his gluepot and always be ready with a willing thumb whenever anything needed firm pressure until the paste dried he was aware of trumpets and general excitement behind him he ignored it there always seemed to be a lot of fuss these days in his experience it was always about trivial things people just didnt have their priorities right hed been waiting two months for a few ounces of gum varneti and it didnt seem to bother anyone he screwed his eyeglass into a more comfortable position and slotted a minute steering oar into place someone was standing next to him well they could make themselves useful could you just put your finger here he said without glancing around just for a minute until the glue sets there seemed to be a sudden drop in temperature he looked up into a smiling golden mask over its shoulder dioss face was shading in grinjers expert opinion from no to no oh he said its very good said teppic what is it grinjer blinked at him then he blinked at the boat its an eightyfoot khalifashion river trireme with fishtail spear deck and ramming prow he said automatically he got the impression that more was expected of him he cast around for something suitable its got more than five hundred bits he added every plank on the deck is individually cut look fascinating said teppic well i wont hold you up carry on the good work the sail really unfurls said grinjer see if you pull this thread the the mask had moved dios was there instead he gave grinjer a short glare which indicated that more would be heard about this later on and hurried after the king so did the ghost of teppicymon xxvii teppics eyes swivelled behind the mask there was the open doorway into the room of caskets he could just make out the one containing ptraci the wedge of wood was still under the lid our father however is over here sire said dios he could move as silently as a ghost oh yes teppic hesitated and then crossed to the big case on its trestles he stared down at it for some time the gilded face on the lid looked like every other mask a very good likeness sire prompted dios yeess said teppic i suppose so he definitely looks happier i suppose hallo my boy said the king he knew that noone could hear him but he felt happier talking to them all the same it was better than talking to himself he was going to have more than enough time for that i think it brings out the best in him o commander of the heavens said the head sculptor makes me look like a constipated wax dolly teppic cocked his head on one side yes he said uncertainly yes er well done he halfturned to look through the doorway again dios nodded to the guards on either side of the passageway if you will excuse me sire he said urbanely hmm the guards will continue their search right oh dios bore down on ptracis casket flanked by guards he gripped the lid thrust it backwards and said behold what do we find dil and gern joined him they looked inside wood shavings said dil gern sniffed they smell nice though he said dioss fingers drummed on the lid teppic had never seen him at a loss before the man actually started tapping the sides of the case apparently seeking any hidden panels he closed the lid carefully and looked blankly at teppic who for the first time was very glad that the mask didnt reveal his expression shes not in there said the old king she got out for a call of nature when the men went to have their breakfast she must have climbed out teppic told himself so where is she now dios scanned the room carefully and then after swinging slowly backwards and forwards like a compass needle his eyes fixed on the kings mummy case it was big it was roomy there was a certain inevitability about it he crossed the room in a couple of strides and heaved it open dont bother to knock the king grumbled its not as if im going anywhere teppic risked a look the mummy of the king was quite alone are you sure youre feeling all right dios he said yes sire we cannot be too careful sire clearly they are not here sire you look as if you could do with a breath of fresh air said teppic upbraiding himself for doing this but doing it nevertheless dios at a loss was an aweinspiring sight and slightly disconcerting it made one instinctively fear for the stability of things yes sire thank you sire have a sit down and someone will bring you a glass of water and then we will go and inspect the pyramid dios sat down there was a terrible little splintering noise hes sat on the boat said the king first humorous thing ive ever seen him do the pyramid gave a new meaning to the word massive it bent the landscape around it it seemed to teppic that its very weight was deforming the shape of things stretching the kingdom like a lead ball on a rubber sheet he knew that was a ridiculous idea big though the pyramid was it was tiny compared to say a mountain but big very big compared to anything else anyway mountains were meant to be big the fabric of the universe was used to the idea the pyramid was a made thing and much bigger than a made thing ought to be it was also very cold the black marble of its sides was shining white with frost in the roasting afternoon sun he was foolish enough to touch it and left a layer of skin on the surface its freezing its storing already o breath of the river said ptaclusp who was sweating its the wossname the boundary effect i note that you have ceased work on the burial chambers said dios the men the temperature boundary effects a bit too much to risk muttered ptaclusp er teppic looked from one to the other whats the matter he said are there problems er said ptaclusp youre way ahead of schedule marvellous work said teppic youve put a tremendous amount of labour on the job er yes only there was silence except for the distant sounds of men at work and the faint noise of the air sizzling where it touched the pyramid its bound to be all right when we get the capstone on the pyramid builder managed eventually once its flaring properly no problem er he indicated the electrum capstone it was surprisingly small only a foot or so across and rested on a couple of trestles we should be able to put it on tomorrow said ptaclusp would your sire still be honouring us with the cappingout ceremony in his nervousness he gripped the hem of his robe and began to twist it theres drinks he stuttered and a silver trowel that you can take away with you everyone shouts hurrah and throws their hats in the air certainly said dios it will be an honour and for us too your sire said ptaclusp loyally i meant for you said the high priest he turned to the wide courtyard between the base of the pyramid and the river which was lined with statues and stelae commemorating king teppicymons mighty deeds and pointed and you can get rid of that he added ptaclusp gave him a look of unhappy innocence that statue said dios is what i am referring to oh ah well we thought once you saw it in place you see in the right light and what with hat the vultureheaded god being very it goes said dios right you are your reverence said ptaclusp miserably it was right now the least of his problems but on top of everything else he was beginning to think that the statue was following him around dios leaned closer you havent seen a young woman anywhere on the site have you he demanded no women on the site my lord said ptaclusp very bad luck this one was provocatively dressed the high priest said no no women the palace is not far you see there must be many places to hide over here dios continued insistently ptaclusp swallowed he knew that all right whatever had possessed him i assure you your reverence he said dios gave him a scowl and then turned to where teppic as it turned out had been please ask him not to shake hands with anybody said the builder as dios hurried after the distant glint of sunlight on gold the king still didnt seem to be able to get alongside the idea that the last thing the people wanted was a man of the people those workers who couldnt get out of the way in time were thrusting their hands behind their back alone now ptaclusp fanned himself and staggered into the shade of his tent where waiting to see him were ptaclusp iia ptaclusp iia ptaclusp iia and ptaclusp iia ptaclusp always felt uneasy in the presence of accountants and four of them together was very bad especially when they were all the same person three ptaclusp iibs were there as well the other two unless it was three by now were out on the site he waved his hands in a conciliatory way all right all right he said what are todays problems one of the iias pulled a stack of wax tablets towards him have you any idea father he began employing that thin razoredged voice that accountants use to preface something unexpected and very expensive what calculus is you tell me said ptaclusp sagging on to a stool its what ive had to invent to deal with the wages bill father said another iia i thought that was algebra said ptaclusp we passed algebra last week said a third iia its calculus now ive had to loop myself another four times to work on it and theres three of me working on he glanced at his brothers quantum accountancy whats that for said his father wearily next week the leading accountant glared at the top slab for example he said you know rthur the fresco painter what about him he that is they have put in a bill for two years work oh they said they did it on tuesday on account of how time is fractal in nature they said they said that said ptaclusp its amazing what they pick up said one of the accountants glaring at the paracosmic architects ptaclusp hesitated how many of them are there how should we know we know there were fiftythree then he went critical weve certainly seen him around a lot two of the iias sat back and steepled their fingers always a bad sign in anyone having anything to do with money the problem is one of them continued that after the initial enthusiasm a lot of the workers looped themselves unofficially so that they could stay at home and send themselves out to work but thats ridiculous ptaclusp protested weakly theyre not different people theyre just doing it to themselves thats never stopped anyone father said iia how many men have stopped drinking themselves stupid at the age of twenty to save a stranger dying of liver failure at forty there was silence while they tried to work this one out a stranger said ptaclusp uncertainly i mean himself when older snapped iia that was philosophy he added one of the masons beat himself up yesterday said one of the iibs gloomily he was fighting with himself over his wife now hes going mad because he doesnt know whether its an earlier version of him or someone he hasnt been yet hes afraid hes going to creep up on him theres worse than that too dad were paying forty thousand people and were only employing two thousand its going to bankrupt us thats what youre going to say said ptaclusp i know its all my fault i just wanted something to hand on to you you know i didnt expect all this it seemed too easy to start with one of the iias cleared his throat its uh not quite as bad as all that he said quietly what do you mean the accountant laid a dozen copper coins on the table well er he said you see eh it occurred to me since theres all this movement in time that its not just people who can be looped and er look you see these coins one coin vanished theyre all the same coin arent they said one of his brothers well yes said the iia very embarrassed because interfering with the divine flow of money was alien to his personal religion the same coin at five minute intervals and youre using this trick to pay the men said ptaclusp dully its not a trick i give them the money said iia primly what happens to it afterwards isnt my responsibility is it i dont like any of this said his father dont worry it all evens out in the end said one of the iias everyone gets whats coming to them yes thats what im afraid of said ptaclusp its just a way of letting your money work for you said another son its probably quantum oh good said ptaclusp weakly well get the block on tonight dont worry said one of the iibs after its flared the power off we can all settle down i told the king wed do it tomorrow the ptaclusp iibs went pale in unison despite the heat it suddenly seemed a lot colder in the tent tonight father said one of them surely you mean tonight tomorrow said ptaclusp firmly ive arranged an awning and people throwing lotus blossom theres going to be a band tocsins and trumpets and tinkling cymbals and speeches and a meat tea afterwards thats the way weve always done it attracts new customers they like to have a look round father youve seen the way it soaks up youve seen the frost let it soak we ptaclusps dont go around capping off pyramids as though we were finishing off a garden wall we dont knock off like a wossname in the night people expect a ceremony but im not listening ive listened to too much of this newfangled stuff tomorrow ive had the bronze plaque made and the velvet curtains and everything one of the iias shrugged its no good arguing with him he said im from three hours ahead i remember this meeting we couldnt change his mind im from two hours ahead said one of his clones i remember you saying that too beyond the walls of the tent the pyramid sizzled with accumulated time there is nothing mystical about the power of pyramids pyramids are dams in the stream of time correctly shaped and orientated with the proper paracosmic measurements correctly plumbed in the temporal potential of the great mass of stone can be diverted to accelerate or reverse time over a very small area in the same way that a hydraulic ram can be induced to pump water against the flow the original builders who were of course ancients and therefore wise knew this very well and the whole point of a correctlybuilt pyramid was to achieve absolute null time in the central chamber so that a dying king tucked up there would indeed live forever or at least never actually die the time that should have passed in the chamber was stored in the bulk of the pyramid and allowed to flare off once every twentyfour hours after a few aeons people forgot this and thought you could achieve the same effect by a ritual b pickling people and c storing their soft inner bits in jars this seldom works and so the art of pyramid tuning was lost and all the knowledge became a handful of misunderstood rules and hazy recollections the ancients were far too wise to build very big pyramids they could cause very strange things things that would make mere fluctuations in time look tiny by comparison by the way contrary to popular opinion pyramids dont sharpen razor blades they just take them back to when they werent blunt its probably because of quantum teppic lay on the strata of his bed listening intently there were two guards outside the door and another two on the balcony outside and he was impressed at dioss forethought one on the roof he could hear them trying to make no noise hed hardly been able to protest if blackclad miscreants were getting into the palace then the person of the king had to be protected it was undeniable he slipped off the solid mattress and glided through the twilight to the statue of bast the catheaded god in the corner twisted off the head and pulled out his assassins costume he dressed quickly cursing the lack of mirrors and then padded across and lurked behind a pillar the only problem as far as he could see was not laughing being a soldier in djelibeybi was not a high risk job there was never a hint of internal rebellion and since either neighbour could crush the kingdom instantly by force of arms there was no real point in selecting keen and belligerent warriors in fact the last thing the priesthood wanted was enthusiastic soldiers enthusiastic soldiers with no fighting to do soon get bored and start thinking dangerous thoughts like how much better they could run the country instead the job attracted big solid men the kind of men who could stand stock still for hours at a time without getting bored men with the build of an ox and the mental processes to match excellent bladder control was also desirable he stepped out on to the balcony teppic had learned how not to move stealthily millions of years of being eaten by creatures that know how to move stealthily has made humanity very good at spotting stealthy movement nor was it enough to make no noise because little moving patches of silence always aroused suspicion the trick was to glide through the night with a quiet reassurance just like the air did there was a guard standing just outside the room teppic drifted past him and climbed carefully up the wall it had been decorated with a complex bas relief of the triumphs of past monarchs so teppic used his family to give him a leg up the breeze was blowing off the desert as he swung his legs over the parapet and walked silently across the roof which was still hot underfoot the air had a recentlycooked smell tinted with spice it was a strange feeling to be creeping across the roof of your own palace trying to avoid your own guards engaged on a mission in direct contravention of your own decree and knowing that if you were caught you would have yourself thrown to the sacred crocodiles after all hed apparently already instructed that he was to be shown no mercy if he was captured somehow it added an extra thrill there was freedom of a sort up here on the rooftops the only kind of freedom available to a king of the valley it occurred to teppic that the landless peasants down on the delta had more freedom than he did although the seditious and nonkingly side of him said yes freedom to catch any diseases of their choice starve as much as they wanted and die of whatever dreadful ague took their fancy but freedom of a sort a faint noise in the huge silence of the night drew him to the riverward edge of the roof the djel sprawled in the moonlight broad and oily there was a boat in midstream heading back from the far bank and the necropolis there was no mistaking the figure at the oars the flarelight gleamed off his bald head one day teppic thought ill follow him ill find out what it is he does over there if he goes over in daylight of course in daylight the necropolis was merely gloomy as though the whole universe had shut down for earlyclosing hed even explored it wandering through streets and alleys that contrived to be still and dusty no matter what the weather was on the other the living side of the water there was always a breathless feel about it which was probably not to be wondered at assassins liked the night on general principles but the night of the necropolis was something else or rather it was the same thing but a lot more of it besides it was the only city anywhere on the disc where an assassin couldnt find employment he reached the light well that opened on the embalmers courtyard and peered down a moment later he landed lightly on the floor and slipped into the room of cases hallo lad teppic opened the lid of the case it was still empty shes in one of the ones at the back said the king never had much of a sense of direction it was a great big palace teppic could barely find his way around it by daylight he considered his chances of carrying out a search in pitch darkness its a family trait you know your grandad had to have left and right painted on his sandals it was that bad its lucky for you that you take after your mother in that respect it was strange she didnt talk she chattered she didnt seem to be able to hold a simple thought in her head for more than about ten seconds her brain appeared to be wired directly to her mouth so that as soon as a thought entered her head she spoke it out loud compared to the ladies he had met at soirees in ankh who delighted in entertaining young assassins and fed them expensive delicacies and talked to them of high and delicate matters while their eyes sparkled like carborundum drills and their lips began to glisten compared to them she was as empty as a as a well as an empty thing nevertheless he found he desperately wanted to find her the sheer undemandingness of her was like a drug the memory of her bosom was quite beside the point im glad youve come back for her said the king vaguely shes your sister you know half sister that is sometimes i wish id married her mother but you see she wasnt royal very bright woman her mother teppic listened hard there it was again a faint breathing noise only heard at all because of the deep silence of the night he worked his way to the back of the room listened again and lifted the lid of a case ptraci was curled up on the bottom fast asleep with her head on her arm he leaned the lid carefully against the wall and touched her hair she muttered something in her sleep and settled into a more comfortable position er i think youd better wake up he whispered she changed position again and muttered something like wstflgl teppic hesitated neither his tutors nor dios had prepared him for this he knew at least seventy different ways of killing a sleeping person but none to wake them up first he prodded her in what looked like the least embarrassing area of her skin she opened her eyes oh she said its you and she yawned ive come to take you away said teppic youve been asleep all day i heard someone talking she said stretching in a fashion that made teppic look away hurriedly it was that priest the one with the face like a bald eagle hes really horrible he is isnt he agreed teppic intensely relieved to hear it said so i just kept quiet and there was the king the new king oh he was down here was he said teppic weakly the bitterness in her voice was like a number four stabbing knife in his heart all the girls say hes really weird she added as he helped her out of the case you can touch me you know im not made of china he steadied her arm feeling in sore need of a cold bath and a quick run around the rooftops youre an assassin arent you she went on i remembered that after youd gone an assassin from foreign parts all that black have you come to kill the king i wish i could said teppic hes really beginning to get on my nerves look could you take your bangles off why they make such a noise when you walk even ptracis earrings appeared to chime the hours when she moved her head i dont want to she said id feel naked without them youre nearly naked with them hissed teppic please she can play the dulcimer said the ghost of teppicymon xxvii apropos of nothing much not very well mind you shes up to page five of little pieces for tiny fingers teppic crept to the passage leading out of the embalming room and listened hard silence ruled in the palace broken only by heavy breathing and the occasional clink behind him as ptraci stripped herself of her jewellery he crept back please hurry up he said we havent got a lot of ptraci was crying er said teppic er some of these were presents from my granny sniffed ptraci the old king gave me some too these earrings have been in my family for ever such a long time how would you like it if you had to do it you see jewellery isnt just something she wears said the ghost of teppicymon xxvii its part of who she is my word he added to himself thats probably an insight why is it so much easier to think when youre dead i dont wear any said teppic youve got all those daggers and things well i need them to do my job well then look you dont have to leave them here you can put them in my pouch he said but we must be going please goodbye said the ghost sadly watching them sneak out to the courtyard he floated back to his corpse who wasnt the best of company the breeze was stronger when they reached the roof it was hotter too and dry across the river one or two of the older pyramids were already sending up their flares but they were weak and looked wrong i feel itchy said ptraci whats wrong it feels like were in for a thunderstorm said teppic staring across the river at the great pyramid its blackness had intensified so that it was a triangle of deeper darkness in the night figures were running around its base like lunatics watching their asylum burn whats a thunderstorm very hard to describe he said in a preoccupied voice can you see what theyre doing over there ptraci squinted across the river theyre very busy she said looks more like panic to me a few more pyramids flared but instead of roaring straight up the flames flickered and lashed backwards and forwards driven by intangible winds teppic shook himself come on he said lets get you away from here i said we should have capped it this evening shouted ptaclusp iib above the screaming of the pyramid i cant float it up now the turbulence up there must be terrific the ice of day was boiling off the black marble which was already warm to the touch he stared distractedly at the capstone on its cradle and then at his brother who was still in his nightshirt wheres father he said i sent one of us to go and wake him up said iia who one of you actually oh iib stared again at the capstone its not that heavy he said two of us could manhandle it up there he gave his brother an enquiring look you must be mad send some of the men to do it theyve all run away down river another pyramid tried to flare spluttered and then ejected a screaming ragged flame that arched across the sky and grounded near the top of the great pyramid itself its interfering with the others now shouted iib come on weve got to flare it off its the only way about a third of the way up the pyramids flanks a crackling blue zigzag arced out and struck itself on a stone sphinx the air above it boiled the two brothers slung the stone between them and staggered to the scaffolding while the dust around them whirled into strange shapes can you hear something said iib as they stumbled on to the first platform what you mean the fabric of time and space being put through the wringer said iia the architect gave his brother a look of faint admiration it was an unusual remark for an accountant then his face returned to its previous look of faint terror no not that he said well the sound of the very air itself being subjected to horrible tortures not that either said iib vaguely annoyed i mean the creaking noise three more pyramids struck their discharges which fizzled through the roiling clouds overhead and poured into the black marble above them cant hear anything like that said iia i think its coming from the pyramid well you can put your ear against it if you like but im not going to the scaffolding swayed in the storm as they eased their way up another ladder the heavy capstone rocking between them i said we shouldnt do it muttered the accountant as the stone slid gently on to his toes we shouldnt have built this just shut up and lift your end will you and so one rocking ladder after another the brothers ptaclusp eased their bickering way up the flanks of the great pyramid while the lesser tombs along the djel fired one after another and the sky streamed with lines of sizzling time it was around about this point that the greatest mathematician in the world lying in cosy flatulence in his stall below the palace stopped chewing the cud and realised that something very wrong was happening to numbers all the numbers the camel looked along its nose at teppic its expression made it clear that of all the riders in all the world it would least like to ride it he was right at the top of the list however camels look like that at everyone camels have a very democratic approach to the human race they hate every member of it without making any distinctions for rank or creed this one appeared to be chewing soap teppic looked distractedly down the shadowy length of the royal stables which had once contained a hundred camels hed have given the world for a horse and a moderatelysized continent for a pony but the stables now held only a handful of rotting war chariots relics of past glories an elderly elephant whose presence was a bit of a mystery and this camel it looked an extremely inefficient animal it was going threadbare at the knees well this is it he said to ptraci i dont dare try the river during the night i could try and get you over the border is that saddle on right said ptraci it looks awfully funny its on an awfully odd creature said teppic how do we climb on to it ive seen the camel drivers at work she replied i think they just hit them very hard with a big stick the camel knelt down and gave her a smug look teppic shrugged pulled open the doors to the outside world and stared into the faces of five guards he backed away they advanced three of them were holding the heavy djel bows which could propel an arrow through a door or turn a charging hippo into three tons of mobile kebab the guards had never had to fire them at a fellow human but looked as though they were prepared to entertain the idea the guard captain tapped one of the men on the shoulder and said go and inform the high priest he glared at teppic throw down all your weapons he said what all of them yes all of them it might take some time said teppic cautiously and keep your hands where i can see them the captain added we could be up against a real impasse here teppic ventured he looked from one guard to another he knew a variety of methods of unarmed combat but they all rather relied on the opponent not being about to fire an arrow straight through you as soon as you moved but he could probably dive sideways and once he had the cover of the camel stalls he could bide his time and that would leave ptraci exposed besides he could hardly go around fighting his own guards that wasnt acceptable behaviour even for a king there was a movement behind the guards and dios drifted into view as silent and inevitable as an eclipse of the moon he was holding a lighted torch which reflected wild highlights on his bald head ah he said the miscreants are captured well done he nodded to the captain throw them to the crocodiles dios said teppic as two of the guards lowered their bows and bore down on him did you speak you know who i am man dont be silly the high priest raised the torch you have the advantage of me boy he said metaphorically speaking this is not funny said teppic i order you to tell them who i am as you wish this assassin said dios and the voice had the cut and sear of a thermic lance has killed the king i am the king damn it said teppic how could i kill myself we are not stupid said dios these men know the king does not skulk the palace at night or consort with condemned criminals all that remains for us to find out is how you disposed of the body his eyes fixed on teppics face and teppic realised that the high priest was indeed truly mad it was the rare kind of madness caused by being yourself for so long that habits of sanity have etched themselves into the brain i wonder how old he really is he thought these assassins are cunning creatures said dios have a care of him there was a crash beside the priest ptraci had tried to throw a camel prod and missed when everyone looked back teppic had vanished the guards beside him were busy collapsing slowly to the floor groaning dios smiled take the woman he snapped and the captain darted forward and grabbed ptraci who hadnt made any attempt to run away dios bent down and picked up the prod there are more guards outside he said im sure you will realise that it will be in your interests to step forward why said teppic from the shadows he fumbled in his boot for his blowpipe you will then be thrown to the sacred crocodiles by order of the king said dios something to look forward to eh said teppic feverishly screwing bits together it would certainly be preferable to many alternatives said dios in the darkness teppic ran his fingers over the little coded knobs on the darts most of the really spectacular poisons would have evaporated or dissolved into harmlessness by now but there were a number of lesser potions designed to give their clients nothing more than a good nights sleep an assassin might have to work his way to an inhume past a number of alert bodyguards it was considered impolite to inhume them as well you could let us go said teppic i suspect thats what you want isnt it for me to go away and never come back that suits me fine dios hesitated youre supposed to say and let the girl go he said oh yes and that too said teppic no i would be failing in my duty to the king said dios for goodness sake dios you know i am the king no i have a very clear picture of the king you are not the king said the priest teppic peered over the edge of the camel stall the camel peered over his shoulder and then the world went mad all right madder all the pyramids were blazing now filling the sky with their sooty light as the brothers ptaclusp struggled to the main working platform iia collapsed on the planking wheezing like an elderly bellows a few feet away the sloping side was hot to the touch and there was no doubt in his mind now that the pyramid was creaking like a sailing ship in a gale he had never paid much attention to the actual mechanics as opposed to the cost of pyramid construction but he was pretty certain that the noise was as wrong as ii and ii making v his brother reached out to touch the stone but drew his hand back as small sparks flashed around his fingers you can feel the warmth he said its astonishing why heating up a mass like this i mean the sheer tonnage i dont like it twobee iia quavered lets just leave the stone here shall we im sure itll be all right and in the morning we can send a gang up here theyll know exactly what his words were drowned out as another flare crackled across the sky and hit the column of dancing air fifty feet above them he grabbed part of the scaffolding sod take this he said im off hang on a minute said iib i mean what is creaking stone cant creak the whole bloody scaffolding is moving dont be daft he stared goggleeyed at his brother tell me its the scaffolding he pleaded no im certain this time its coming from inside they stared at one another and then at the rickety ladder leading up to the tip or to where the tip should be come on said iib it cant flare off its trying to find ways of discharging there was a sound as loud as the groaning of continents teppic felt it he felt that his skin was several sizes too small he felt that someone was holding his ears and trying to twist his head off he saw the guard captain sag to his knees fighting to get his helmet off and he leapt the stall tried to leap the stall everything was wrong and he landed heavily on a floor that seemed undecided about becoming a wall he managed to get to his feet and was pulled sideways dancing awkwardly across the stable to keep his balance the stables stretched and shrank like a picture in a distorting mirror hed gone to see some once in ankh the three of them hazarding a halfcoin each to visit the transient marvels of dr mooners travelling take your breath away emporium but you knew then that it was only twisted glass that was giving you a head like a sausage and legs like footballs teppic wished he could be so certain that what was happening around him would allow of such a harmless explanation youd probably need a wobbly glass mirror to make it look normal he ran on taffy legs towards ptraci and the high priest as the world was expanded and squeezed around him and was momentarily gratified to see the girl squirm in dioss grip and fetch him a tidy thump on the ear he moved as though in a dream with the distances changing as though reality was an elastic thing another step sent him cannoning into the pair of them he grabbed ptracis arm and staggered back to the camel stall where the creature was still cudding and watching the scene with the nearest thing a camel will ever get to mild interest and snatched its halter noone seemed to be interested in stopping them as they helped each other through the doorway and out into the mad night it helps if you shut your eyes said ptraci teppic tried it it worked a stretch of courtyard that his eyes told him was a quivering rectangle whose sides twanged like bowstrings became well just a courtyard under his feet gosh that was clever he said how did you think of that i always shut my eyes when im frightened said ptraci good plan whats happening i dont know i dont want to find out i think going away from here could be an amazingly sensible idea how do you make a camel kneel did you say ive got any amount of sharp things the camel who had a very adequate grasp of human language as it applied to threats knelt down graciously they scrambled aboard and the landscape lurched again as the beast jacked itself back on to its feet the camel knew perfectly well what was happening three stomachs and a digestive system like an industrial distillation plant gave you a lot of time for sitting and thinking its not for nothing that advanced mathematics tends to be invented in hot countries its because of the morphic resonance of all the camels who have that disdainful expression and famous curled lip as a natural result of an ability to do quadratic equations its not generally realised that camels have a natural aptitude for advanced mathematics particularly where they involve ballistics this evolved as a survival trait in the same way as a humans hand and eye coordination a chameleons camouflage and a dolphins renowned ability to save drowning swimmers if theres any chance that biting them in half might be observed and commented upon adversely by other humans the fact is that camels are far more intelligent than dolphins they are so much brighter that they soon realised that the most prudent thing any intelligent animal can do if it would prefer its descendants not to spend a lot of time on a slab with electrodes clamped to their brains or sticking mines on the bottom of ships or being patronised rigid by zoologists is to make bloody certain humans dont find out about it so they long ago plumped for a lifestyle that in return for a certain amount of porterage and being prodded with sticks allowed them adequate food and grooming and the chance to spit in a humans eye and get away with it and this particular camel the result of millions of years of selective evolution to produce a creature that could count the grains of sand it was walking over and close its nostrils at will and survive under the broiling sun for many days without water was called you bastard and he was in fact the greatest mathematician in the world you bastard was thinking there seems to be some growing dimensional instability here swinging from zero to nearly fortyfive degrees by the look of it how interesting i wonder whats causing it let v equal let tau equal chi cudcudcud let kappay be an evilsmellingbugger differential tensor domain with four imaginary spin coefficients ptraci hit him across the head with her sandal come on get a move on she yelled you bastard thought therefore h to the enabling power equals vs cudcudcud thus in hypersyllogic notation teppic looked behind him the strange distortions in the landscape seemed to be settling down and dios was dios was striding out of the palace and had actually managed to find several guards whose fear of disobedience overcame the terror of the mysteriously distorted world you bastard stood stoically chewing cudcudcud which gives us an interesting shortening oscillation what would be the period of this let period x cudcudcud let t time let initial period ptraci bounced up and down on his neck and kicked hard with her heels an action which would have caused any anthropoid male to howl and bang his head against the wall it wont move cant you hit it teppic brought his hand down as hard as he could on you bastards hide raising a cloud of dust and deadening every nerve in his fingers it was like hitting a large sack full of coathangers come on he muttered dios raised a hand halt in the name of the king he shouted an arrow thudded into you bastards hump equals recurring reduce that gives us ouch seconds you bastard turned his long neck around his great hairy eyebrows made accusing curves as his yellow eyes narrowed and took a fix on the high priest and he put aside the interesting problem for a moment and dredged up the familiar ancient maths that his race had perfected long ago let range equal fortyone feet let windspeed equal vector oneeight cud let glutinosity equal teppic drew a throwing knife dios took a deep breath hes going to order them to fire on us teppic thought in my own name in my own kingdom im going to be shot angle twofive cud fire it was a magnificent volley the gob of cud had commendable lift and spin and hit with a sound like a sound like half a pound of semidigested grass hitting someone in the face there was nothing else it could sound like the silence that followed was by way of being a standing ovation the landscape began to distort again this was clearly not a place to linger you bastard looked down at his front legs let legs equal four he lumbered into a run camels apparently have more knees than any other creature and you bastard ran like a steam engine with lots of extraneous movement at right angles to the direction of motion accompanied by a thunderous barrage of digestive noises bloody stupid animal muttered ptraci as they jolted away from the palace but it looks like it finally got the idea gaugeinvariant repetition rate of z whats she talking about bloody stupid lives over in tsort though they swung through the air as though jointed with bad elastic you bastards legs covered a lot of ground and already they were bouncing through the sleeping packedearth streets of the city its starting again isnt it said ptraci im going to shut my eyes teppic nodded the firebrickhot houses around them were doing their slow motion mirror dance again and the road was rising and falling in a way that solid land had no right to adopt its like the sea he said i cant see anything said ptraci firmly i mean the sea the ocean you know waves ive heard about it is anyone chasing us teppic turned in the saddle not that i can make out he said it looks as from here he could see past the long low bulk of the palace and across the river to the great pyramid itself it was almost hidden in dark clouds but what he could see of it was definitely wrong he knew it had four sides and he could see all eight of them it seemed to be moving in and out of focus which he felt instinctively was a dangerous thing for several million tons of rock to do he felt a pressing urge to be a long way away from it even a dumb creature like the camel seemed to have the same idea you bastard was thinking delta squared thus dimensional pressure k will result in a ninetydegree transformation in chi t for a kbundle of any three invariables or four minutes plus or minus ten seconds the camel looked down at the great pads of his feet let speed equal gallop how did you make it do that said teppic i didnt its doing it by itself hang on this wasnt easy teppic had saddled the camel but neglected the harness ptraci had handfuls of camel hair to hang on to all he had was handfuls of ptraci no matter where he tried to put his hands they encountered warm yielding flesh nothing in his long education had prepared him for this whereas everything in ptracis obviously had her long hair whipped his face and smelled beguilingly of rare perfume are you all right he shouted above the wind im hanging on with my knees that must be very hard you get special training camels gallop by throwing their feet as far away from them as possible and then running to keep up knee joints clicking like chilly castanets you bastard thrashed up the sloping road out of the valley and windmilled along the narrow gorge that led under towering limestone cliffs to the high desert beyond and behind them tormented beyond measure by the inexorable tide of geometry unable to discharge its burden of time the great pyramid screamed lifted itself off its base and its bulk swishing through the air as unstoppably as something completely unstoppable ground around precisely ninety degrees and did something perverted to the fabric of time and space you bastard sped along the gorge his neck stretched out to its full extent his mighty nostrils flaring like jet intakes its terrified ptraci yelled animals always know about this sort of thing what sort of thing forest fires and things we havent got any trees well floods and and things theyve got some strange natural instinct phi lateral ev equals a tranche of seven to twelve the sound hit them it was as silent as a dandelion clock striking midnight but it had pressure it rolled over them suffocating as velvet nauseating as a battered saveloy and was gone you bastard slowed to a walk a complicated procedure that involved precise instructions to each leg in turn there was a feeling of release a sense of stress withdrawn you bastard stopped in the predawn glow hed spotted a clump of thorned syphacia bushes growing in the rocks by the track angle left x equals y equals z equals bite peace descended there was no sound except for the eructations of the camels digestive tract and the distant warbling of a desert owl ptraci slid off her perch and landed awkwardly my bottom she announced to the desert in general is one huge blister teppic jumped down and halfran halfstaggered up the scree by the roadside then jogged across the cracked limestone plateau until he could get a good look at the valley it wasnt there any more it was still dark when dil the master embalmer woke up his body twanging with the sensation that something was wrong he slipped out of bed dressed hurriedly and pulled aside the curtain that did duty as a door the night was soft and velvety behind the chirrup of the insects there was another sound a frying noise a faint sizzling on the edge of hearing perhaps that was what had woken him up the air was warm and damp curls of mist rose from the river and the pyramids werent flaring hed grown up in this house it had been in the family of the master embalmers for thousands of years and hed seen the pyramids flare so often that he didnt notice them any more than he noticed his own breathing but now they were dark and silent and the silence cried out and the darkness glared but that wasnt the worst part as his horrified eyes stared up at the empty sky over the necropolis they saw the stars and what the stars were stuck to dil was terrified and then when he had time to think about it he was ashamed of himself after all he thought its what ive always been told is there it stands to reason im just seeing it properly for the first time there does that make me feel any better no he turned and ran down the street sandals flapping until he reached the house that held gern and his numerous family he dragged the protesting apprentice from the communal sleeping mat and pulled him into the street turned his face to the sky and hissed tell me what you can see gern squinted i can see the stars master he said what are they on boy gern relaxed slightly thats easy master everyone knows the stars are on the body of the goddess nept who arches herself from oh bloody hell you can see her too oh mummy whispered gern and slid to his knees dil nodded he was a religious man it was a great comfort knowing that the gods were there it was knowing they were here that was the terrible part because the body of a woman arched over the heavens faintly blue faintly shadowy in the light of the watery stars she was enormous her statistics interstellar the shadow between her galactic breasts was a dark nebula the curve of her stomach a vast wash of glowing gas her navel the seething dark incandescence in which new stars were being born she wasnt supporting the sky she was the sky her huge sad face upside down on the turnwise horizon stared directly at dil and dil was realising that there are few things that so shake belief as seeing clearly and precisely the object of that belief seeing contrary to popular wisdom isnt believing its where belief stops because it isnt needed any more oh sod moaned gern dil struck him across the arm stop that he said and come with me oh master whatever shall we do dil looked around at the sleeping city he hadnt the faintest idea well go to the palace he said firmly its probably a trick of the of the of the dark anyway the sun will be up presently he strode off wishing he could change places with gern and show just a hint of gibbering terror the apprentice followed him at a sort of galloping creep i can see shadows against the stars master can you see them master around the edge of the world master just mists boy said dil resolutely keeping his eyes fixed in front of him and maintaining a dignified posture as appropriate to the keeper of the left hand door of the matron lodge and holder of several medals for needlework there he said see gern the sun is coming up they stood and watched it then gern whimpered very quietly rising up the sky very slowly was a great flaming ball and it was being pushed by a dung beetle bigger than worlds book iii the book of the new son the sun rose and because this wasnt the old kingdom out here it was a mere ball of flaming gas the purple night of the high desert evaporated under its blowlamp glare lizards scuffled into cracks in the rocks you bastard settled himself down in the sparse shadow of what was left of the syphacia bushes peered haughtily at the landscape and began to chew cud and calculate square roots in base seven teppic and ptraci eventually found the shade of a limestone overhang and sat glumly staring out at the waves of heat wobbling off the rocks i dont understand said ptraci have you looked everywhere its a country it cant just bloody well fall through a hole in the ground where is it then said ptraci evenly teppic growled the heat struck like a hammer but he strode out over the rocks as though three hundred square miles could perhaps have been hiding under a pebble or behind a bush the fact was that the track dipped between the cliffs but almost immediately rose again and continued across the dunes into what was quite clearly tsort hed recognised a winderoded sphinx that had been set up as a boundary marker legend said it prowled the borders in times of dire national need although legend wasnt sure why he knew they had galloped into ephebe he should be looking across the fertile pyramidspeckled valley of the djel that lay between the two countries hed spent an hour looking for it it was inexplicable it was uncanny it was also extremely embarrassing he shaded his eyes and stared around for the thousandth time at the silent baking landscape and moved his head and saw djelibeybi it flashed across his vision in an instant he jerked his eyes back and saw it again a brief flash of misty colour that vanished as soon as he concentrated on it some minutes later ptraci peered out of the shade and saw him get down on his hands and knees when he started turning over rocks she decided it was time he should come back in out of the sun he shook her hand off his shoulder and gestured impatiently ive found it he pulled a knife from his boot and started poking at the stones where here she laid a ringed hand on his forehead oh yes she said i see yes good now i think youd better come into the shade no i mean it here look she hunkered down and stared at the rock to humour him theres a crack she said doubtfully look at it will you you have to turn your head and sort of look out of the corner of your eye teppics dagger smacked into the crack which was no more than a faint line on the rock well it goes on a long way said ptraci staring along the burning pavement all the way from the second cataract to the delta said teppic covering your eye with one hand helps please give it a try please she put one hesitant hand over her eye and squinted obediently at the rock eventually she said its no good i cant seeee she stayed motionless for a moment and then flung herself sideways on to the rocks teppic stopped trying to hammer the knife into the crack and crawled over to her i was right on the edge she wailed you saw it he said hopefully she nodded and with great care got to her feet and backed away did your eyes feel as though they were being turned inside out said teppic yes said ptraci coldly can i have my bangles please what my bangles you put them in your pocket i want them please teppic shrugged and fished in his pouch the bangles were mostly copper with a few bits of chipped enamel here and there the craftsman had tried without much success to do something interesting with twisted bits of wire and lumps of coloured glass she took them and slipped them on do they have some occult significance he said whats occult mean she said vaguely oh what do you need them for then i told you i dont feel properly dressed without them on teppic shrugged and went back to rocking his knife in the crack why are you doing that she said he stopped and thought about it i dont know he said but you did see the valley didnt you yes well then well what teppic rolled his eyes didnt you think it was a bit well odd a whole country just more or less vanishing its something you dont bloody well see every day for gods sake how should i know ive never been out of the valley before i dont know what its supposed to look like from outside and dont swear teppic shook his head i think i will go and lie down in the shade he said whats left of it he added for the brass light of the sun was burning away the shadows he staggered over to the rocks and stared at her the whole valley has just closed up he managed at last all those people i saw cooking fires said ptraci slumping down beside him its something to do with the pyramid he said it looked very strange just before we left its magic or geometry or one of those things how do you think we can get back i dont want to go back why should i want to go back its the crocodiles for me im not going back not just for crocodiles um perhaps i could pardon you or something said teppic oh yes said ptraci looking at her nails you said you were the king didnt you i am the king thats my kingdom over teppic hesitated not knowing in which direction to point his finger somewhere im king of it you dont look like the king said ptraci why not he had a golden mask on that was me so you ordered me thrown to the crocodiles yes i mean no teppic hesitated i mean the king did i didnt in a way anyway i was the one who rescued you he added gallantly there you are then anyway if you were the king youd be a god too you arent acting very godlike at the moment yes well er teppic hesitated again ptracis literal mindedness meant that innocent sentences had to be carefully examined before being sent out into the world im basically good at making the sun rise he said i dont know how though and rivers you want any rivers flooding im your man god i mean he lapsed into silence as a thought struck him i wonder whats happening in there without me he said ptraci stood up and set off down to the gorge where are you going she turned well mr king or god or assassin or whatever can you make water what here i mean to drink there may be a river hidden in that crack or there may not but we cant get at it can we so we have to go somewhere where we can its so simple i should think even kings could understand it he hurried after her down the scree to where you bastard was lying with his head and neck flat on the ground flicking his ears in the heat and idly applying you vicious brutes theory of transient integrals to a succession of promising cissoid numbers ptraci kicked him irritably do you know where there is water then said teppic e eleven miles ptraci glared at him from kohlringed eyes you mean you dont know you were going to take me into the desert and you dont know where the water is well i rather expected i was going to be able to take some with me you didnt even think about it listen you cant talk to me like that im a king teppic stopped youre absolutely right he said i never thought about it where i come from it rains nearly every day im sorry ptracis brows furrowed who reigns nearly every day she said no i mean rain you know very thin water coming out of the sky what a silly idea where do you come from teppic looked miserable where i come from is ankhmorpork where i started from is here he stared down the track from here if you knew what you were looking for you could just see a faint crack running across the rocks it climbed the cliffs on either side a new vertical fault the thickness of a line that just happened to contain a complete river kingdom and years of history hed hated every minute of his time there and now it had shut him out and now because he couldnt he wanted to go back he wandered down to it and put his hand over one eye if you jerked your head just right it flashed past his vision briefly and was gone he tried a few times more and couldnt see it again if i hacked the rocks away no he thought thats silly its a line you cant get into a line a line has no thickness well known fact of geometry he heard ptraci come up behind him and the next moment her hands were on his neck for a second he wondered how she knew the catharti death grip and then her fingers were gently massaging his muscles stresses melting under their expert caress like fat under a hot knife he shivered as the tension relaxed thats nice he said were trained for it your tendons are knotted up like pingpong balls on a string said ptraci teppic gratefully subsided on to one of the boulders that littered the base of the cliff and let the rhythm of her fingers unwind the problems of the night i dont know what to do he murmured that feels good its not all peeling grapes being a handmaiden said ptraci the first lesson we learn is when the master has had a long hard day it is not the best time to suggest the congress of the fox and the persimmon who says you have to do anything i feel responsible teppic shifted position like a cat if you know where there is a dulcimer i could play you something soothing said ptraci ive got as far as goblins picnic in book i i mean a king shouldnt let his kingdom just vanish like that all the other girls can do chords and everything said ptraci wistfully massaging his shoulders but the old king always said hed rather hear me he said it used to cheer him up i mean itll be called the lost kingdom said teppic drowsily how will i feel then i ask you he said he liked my singing too everyone else said it sounded like a flock of vultures whove just found a dead donkey i mean king of a lost kingdom itd be dreadful ive got to get it back you bastard slowly turned his massive head to follow the flight of an errant blowfly deep in his brain little columns of red numbers flickered detailing vectors and speed and elevation the conversation of human beings seldom interested him but it crossed his mind that the males and females always got along best when neither actually listened fully to what the other one was saying it was much simpler with camels teppic stared at the line in the rock geometry that was it well go to ephebe he said they know all about geometry and they have some very unsound ideas unsound ideas are what i could do with right now why do you carry all these knives and things i mean really hmm sorry all these knives why teppic thought about it i suppose i dont feel properly dressed without them he said oh ptraci dutifully cast around for a new topic of conversation introducing topics of amusing discourse was also part of a handmaidens duties shed never been particularly good at it the other girls had come up with an astonishing assortment everything from the mating habits of crocodiles to speculation about life in the netherworld shed found it heavy going after talking about the weather so she said youve killed a lot of people i expect mm as an assassin i mean you get paid to kill people have you killed lots do you know you tense your back muscles a lot i dont think i ought to talk about it he said i ought to know if weve got to cross the desert together and everything more than a hundred good heavens no well less than fifty teppic rolled over look even the most famous assassins never killed more than thirty people in all their lives he said less than twenty then yes less than ten i think said teppic it would be best to say a number between zero and ten just so long as i know these things are important they strolled back to you bastard but now it was teppic who seemed to have something on his mind all this senate he said congress corrected ptraci you er more than fifty people theres a different name for that sort of woman said ptraci but without much rancour sorry less than ten lets say said ptraci a number between zero and ten you bastard spat twenty feet away the blowfly was picked cleanly out of the air and glued to the rock behind it amazing how they do it isnt it said teppic animal instinct i suppose you bastard gave him a haughty glare from under his sweepthedesert eyelashes and thought let zei cudcudcud then dzie dizd or ddziz ptaclusp still in his nightshirt wandered aimlessly among the wreckage at the foot of the pyramid it was humming like a turbine ptaclusp didnt know why knew nothing about the vast expenditure of power that had twisted the dimensions by ninety degrees and was holding them there against terrible pressures but at least the disturbing temporal changes seemed to have stopped there were fewer sons around than there used to be in truth he could have done with finding one or two first he found the capstone which had shattered its electrum sheathing peeling away in its descent from the pyramid it had hit the statue of hat the vultureheaded god bending it double and giving it an expression of mild surprise a faint groan sent him tugging at the wreckage of a tent he tore at the heavy canvas and unearthed iib who blinked at him in the grey light it didnt work dad he moaned wed almost got it up there and then the whole thing just sort of twisted the builder lifted a spar off his sons legs anything broken he said quietly just bruised i think the young architect sat up wincing and craned to see around wheres twoay he said he was higher up than me nearly on the top ive found him said ptaclusp architects are not known for their attention to subtle shades of meaning but iib heard the lead in his fathers voice hes not dead is he he whispered i dont think so im not sure hes alive but hes moving hes moving well you better come and see i think something quantum has happened to him you bastard plodded onwards at about metres per second working out complex conjugate coordinates to stave off boredom while his huge platelike feet crunched on the sand lack of fingers was another big spur to the development of camel intellect human mathematical development had always been held back by everyones instinctive tendency when faced with something really complex in the way of triform polynomials or parametric differentials to count fingers camels started from the word go by counting numbers deserts were a great help too there arent many distractions as far as camels were concerned the way to mighty intellectual development was to have nothing much to do and nothing to do it with he reached the crest of the dune gazed with approval over the rolling sands ahead of him and began to think in logarithms whats ephebe like said ptraci ive never been there apparently its ruled by a tyrant i hope we dont meet him then teppic shook his head its not like that he said they have a new tyrant every five years and theydo something to him first he hesitated i think they eelect him is that something like they do to tomcats and bulls and things er you know to make them stop fighting and be more peaceful teppic winced to be honest im not sure he said but i dont think so theyve got something they do it with i think its called a mocracy and it means everyone in the whole country can say who the new tyrant is one man one he paused the political history lesson seemed a very long while ago and had introduced concepts never heard of in djelibeybi or in ankhmorpork for that matter he had a stab at it anyway one man one vet thats for the eelecting then he shrugged it might be for all he knew the point is though that everyone can do it theyre very proud of it everyone has he hesitated again certain now that things were amiss the vet except for women of course and children and criminals and slaves and stupid people and people of foreign extraction and people disapproved of for er various reasons and lots of other people but everyone apart from them its a very enlightened civilisation ptraci gave this some consideration and thats a mocracy is it they invented it in ephebe you know said teppic feeling obscurely that he ought to defend it i bet they had trouble exporting it said ptraci firmly the sun wasnt just a ball of flaming dung pushed across the sky by a giant beetle it was also a boat it depended on how you looked at it the light was wrong it had a flat quality like water left in a glass for weeks there was no joy to it it illuminated but without life like bright moonlight rather than the light of day but ptaclusp was more worried about his son do you know whats wrong with him he said his other son bit his stylus miserably his hand was hurting hed tried to touch his brother and the crackling shock had taken the skin off his fingers i might he ventured can you cure it i dont think so what is it then well dad when we were up on the pyramid well when it couldnt flare you see im sure it twisted around time you see is just another dimension um ptaclusp rolled his eyes none of that architects talk boy he said whats wrong with him i think hes dimensionally maladjusted dad time and space has got a bit mixed up for him thats why hes moving sideways all the time ptaclusp iib gave his father a brave little smile he always used to move sideways said ptaclusp his son sighed yes dad he said but that was just normal all accountants move like that now hes moving sideways because thats like well its like time to him ptaclusp frowned drifting gently sideways wasnt iias only problem he was also flat not flat like a card with a front back and edge but flat from any direction puts me exactly in mind of them people in the frescoes he said wheres his depth or whatever you call it i think thats in time said iib helplessly ours not his ptaclusp walked around his son noting how the flatness followed him he scratched his chin so he can walk in time can he he said slowly that may be possible yes do you think we could persuade him to stroll back a few months and tell us not to build that bloody pyramid he cant communicate dad not much change there then ptaclusp sat down on the rubble his head in his hands it had come to this one son normal and stupid one flat as a shadow and what sort of life could the poor flat kid have hed go through life being used to open locks clean the ice off windscreens and sleeping cheaply in trouserpresses in hotel bedrooms being able to get under doors and read books without opening them would not be much of a compensation iia drifted sideways a flat cutout on the landscape cant we do anything he said roll him up neatly or something iib shrugged we could put something in the way that might be a good idea it would stop anything worse happening to him because it er wouldnt have time to happen in i think they pushed the bent statue of hat the vultureheaded god into the flat ones path after a minute or two his gentle sideways drift brought him up against it there was a fat blue spark that melted part of the statue but the movement stopped why the sparks said ptaclusp its a bit like flarelight i think ptaclusp hadnt got where he was today no hed have to correct himself hadnt got to where he had been last night without eventually seeing the advantages in the unlikeliest situations hell save on clothing he said slowly i mean he can just paint it on i dont think youve quite got the idea dad said iib wearily he sat down beside his father and stared across the river to the palace something going on over there said ptaclusp do you think theyve noticed the pyramid i shouldnt be surprised its moved around ninety degrees after all ptaclusp looked over his shoulder and nodded slowly funny that he said bit of structural instability there dad its a pyramid we should have flared it i told you the forces involved well its just too a shadow fell across them they looked around they looked up they looked up a bit more oh my said ptaclusp its hat the vultureheaded god ephebe lay beyond them a classical poem of white marble lazing around its rock on a bay of brilliant blue whats that said ptraci after studying it critically for some time its the sea said teppic i told you remember waves and things you said it was all green and rough sometimes it is hmm the tone of voice suggested that she disapproved of the sea but before she could explain why they heard the sound of voices raised in anger they were coming from behind a nearby sand dune there was a notice on the dune it said in several languages axiom testing station below it in slightly smaller writing it added caution unresolved postulates as they read it or at least as teppic read it and ptraci didnt there was a twang from behind the dune followed by a click followed by an arrow zipping overhead you bastard glanced up at it briefly and then turned his head and stared fixedly at a very small area of sand a second later the arrow thudded into it then he tested the weight on his feet and did a small calculation which revealed that two people had been subtracted from his back further summation indicated that they had been added to the dune what did you do that for said ptraci spitting out sand someone fired at us i shouldnt think so i mean they didnt know we were here did they you neednt have pulled me off like that teppic conceded this rather reluctantly and eased himself cautiously up the sliding surface of the dune the voices were arguing again give in we simply havent got all the parameters right i know what we havent got all right what is that pray we havent got any more bloody tortoises thats what we havent got teppic carefully poked his head over the top of the dune he saw a large cleared area surrounded by complicated ranks of markers and flags there were one or two buildings in it mostly consisting of cages and several other intricate constructions he could not recognise in the middle of it all were two men one small fat and florid the other tall and willowy and with an indefinable air of authority they were wearing sheets clustered around them and not wearing very much at all was a group of slaves one of them was holding a bow several of them were holding tortoises on sticks they looked a bit pathetic like tortoise lollies anyway its cruel said the tall man poor little things they look so sad with their little legs waggling its logically impossible for the arrow to hit them the fat man threw up his hands it shouldnt do it you must be giving me the wrong type of tortoise he added accusingly we ough to try again with faster tortoises or slower arrows possibly possibly teppic was aware of a faint scuffling by his chin there was a small tortoise scurrying past him it had several ricochet marks on its shell well have one last try said the fat man he turned to the slaves you lot go and find that tortoise the little reptile gave teppic a look of mingled pleading and hope he stared at it and then lifted it up carefully and tucked it behind a rock he slid back down the dune to ptraci theres something really weird going on over there he said theyre shooting tortoises why search me they seem to think the tortoise ought to be able to run away what from an arrow like i said really weird you stay here ill whistle if its safe to follow me what will you do if it isnt safe scream he climbed the dune again and after brushing as much sand as possible off his clothing stood up and waved his cap at the little crowd an arrow took it out of his hands oops said the fat man sorry he scurried across the trampled sand to where teppic was standing and staring at his stinging fingers just had it in my hand he panted many apologies didnt realise it was loaded whatever will you think of me teppic took a deep breath xenos the name gasped the fat man before he could speak are you hurt we did put up warning signs im sure did you come in over the desert you must be thirsty would you like a drink who are you you havent seen a tortoise up there have you damned fast things go like greased thunderbolts theres no stopping the little buggers teppic deflated again tortoises he said are we talking about those you know stones on legs thats right thats right said xeno take your eyes off them for a second and vazoom vazoom said teppic he knew about tortoises there were tortoises in the old kingdom they could be called a lot of things vegetarians patient thoughtful even extremely diligent and persistent sexmaniacs but never up until now fast fast was a word particularly associated with tortoises because they were not it are you sure he said fastest animal on the face of the disc your common tortoise said xeno but he had the grace to look shifty logically that is he added on the disc is the extremely neurotic ambiguous puzuma which moves so fast that it can actually achieve near lightspeed in the discs magical field this means that if you can see a puzuma it isnt there most male puzumas die young of acute ankle failure caused by running very fast after females which arent there and of course achieving suicidal mass in accordance with relativistic theory the rest of them die of heisenbergs uncertainty principle since it is impossible for them to know who they are and where they are at the same time and the seesawing loss of concentration this engenders means that the puzuma only achieves a sense of identity when it is at rest usually about fifty feet into the rubble of what remains of the mountain it just ran into at near lightspeed the puzuma is rumoured to be about the size of a leopard with a rather unique black and white check coat although those specimens discovered by the discs sages and philosophers have inclined them to declare that in its natural state the puzuma is flat very thin and dead the tall man gave teppic a nod take no notice of him boy he said hes just covering himself because of the accident last week the tortoise did beat the hare said xeno sulkily the hare was dead xeno said the tall man patiently because you shot it i was aiming at the tortoise you know trying to combine two experiments cut down on expensive research time make full use of available xeno gestured with the bow which now had another arrow in it excuse me said teppic could you put it down a minute me and my friend have come a long way and it would be nice not to be shot at again these two seem harmless he thought and almost believed it he whistled on cue ptraci came around the dune leading you bastard teppic doubted the capability of her costume to hold any pockets whatsoever but she seemed to have been able to repair her makeup rekohl her eyes and put up her hair she undulated towards the group like a snake in a skid determined to hit the strangers with the full force of her personality she was also holding something in her other hand shes found the tortoise said xeno well done the reptile shot back into its shell ptraci glared she didnt have much in the world except herself and didnt like to be hailed as a mere holder of testudinoids the tall man sighed you know xeno he said i cant help thinking youve got the wrong end of the stick with this whole tortoiseandarrow business the little man glared at him the trouble with you ibid he said is that you think youre the biggest bloody authority on everything the gods of the old kingdom were awakening belief is a force its a weak force by comparison with gravity when it comes to moving mountains gravity wins every time but it still exists and now that the old kingdom was enclosed upon itself floating free of the rest of the universe drifting away from the general consensus that is dignified by the name of reality the power of belief was making itself felt for seven thousand years the people of djelibeybi had believed in their gods now their gods existed they had as it were the complete set and the people of the old kingdom were learning that for example vut the dogheaded god of the evening looks a lot better painted on a pot than he does when all seventy feet of him growling and stinking is lurching down the street outside dios sat in the throne room the gold mask of the king on his knees staring out across the sombre air the cluster of lesser priests around the door finally plucked up the courage to approach him in the same general frame of mind as you would approach a growling lion noone is more worried by the actual physical manifestation of a god than his priests its like having the auditors in unexpectedly only koomi stood a little aside from the others he was thinking hard strange and original thoughts were crowding along rarelytrodden neural pathways heading in unthinkable directions he wanted to see where they led o dios murmured the high priest of ket the thisheaded god of justice what is the kings command the gods are striding the land and they are fighting and breaking houses o dios where is the king what would he have us do yea said the high priest of scrab the pusher of the ball of the sun he felt something more was expected of him and verily he added your lordship will have noticed that the sun is wobbling because all the gods of the sun are fighting for it and he shuffled his feet the blessed scrab made a strategic withdrawal and has er made an unscheduled landing on the town of hort a number of buildings broke his fall and rightly so said the high priest of thrrp the charioteer of the sun for as all know my master is the true god of the his words tailed off dios was trembling his body rocking slowly back and forth his eyes stared at nothing his hands gripped the mask almost hard enough to leave fingerprints in the gold and his lips soundlessly shaped the words of the ritual of the second hour which had been said at this time for thousands of years i think its the shock said one of the priests you know hes always been so set in his ways the others hastened to show that there was at least something they could advise on fetch him a glass of water put a paper bag over his head sacrifice a chicken under his nose there was a highpitched whistling noise the distant crump of an explosion and a long hissing a few tendrils of steam curled into the room the priests rushed to the balcony leaving dios in his unnerving pool of trauma and found that the crowds around the palace were staring at the sky it would appear said the high priest of cephut god of cutlery who felt that he could take a more relaxed view of the immediate situation that thrrp has fumbled it and has fallen to a surprise tackle from jeht boatman of the solar orb there was a distant buzzing as of several billion bluebottles taking off in a panic and a huge dark shape passed over the palace but said the high priest of cephut here comes scrab again yes hes gaining height jeht hasnt seen him yet hes progressing confidently towards the meridian and here comes sessifet goddess of the afternoon this is a surprise what a surprise this is a young goddess yet to make her mark but my word what a lot of promise there this is an astonishing bid eunuchs and gentlemen and yes scrab has fumbled it hes fumbled it the shadows danced and spun on the stones of the balcony and whats this the elder gods are theres no other word for it theyre cooperating against these brash newcomers but plucky young sessifet is hanging in there shes exploiting the weakness shes in and pulling away now pulling away gil and scrab appear to be fighting shes got a clear sky and yes yes yes its noon its noon its noon silence the priest was aware that everyone was staring at him then someone said why are you shouting into that bulrush sorry dont know what came over me there the priestess of sarduk goddess of caves snorted at him suppose one of them had dropped it she snapped but but he swallowed its not possible is it not really we all must have eaten something or been out in the sun too long or something because i mean everyone knows that the gods arent i mean the sun is a big flaming ball of gas isnt it that goes around the whole world every day and and and the gods well you know theres a very real need in people to believe dont get me wrong here koomi even with his head buzzing with thoughts of perfidy was quicker on the uptake than his colleagues get him lads he shouted four priests grabbed the luckless cutlery worshipper by his arms and legs and gave him a highspeed run across the stones to the edge of the balcony over the parapet and into the mudcoloured waters of the djel he surfaced spluttering what did you go and do that for he demanded you all know im right none of you really the waters of the djel opened a lazy jaw and he vanished just as the huge winged shape of scrab buzzed threateningly over the palace and whirred off towards the mountains koomi mopped his forehead bit of a close shave there he said his colleagues nodded staring at the fading ripples suddenly djeibeybi was no place for honest doubt honest doubt could get you seriously picked up and your arms and legs torn off er said one of them cephuts going to be a bit upset though isnt he all hail cephut they chorused just in case dont see why grumbled an elderly priest at the back of the crowd bloody knife and fork artist they grabbed him still protesting and hurled him into the river all hail they paused who was he high priest of anyway bunu the goatheaded god of goats wasnt he all hail bunu probably they chorused as the sacred crocodiles homed in like submarines koomi raised his hands imploring it is said that the hour brings forth the man he was the kind of man that is brought forth by devious and unpleasant hours and underneath his bald head certain conclusions were beginning to unfold like things imprisoned for years inside stones he wasnt yet sure what they were but they were broadly on the subject of gods the new age the need for a firm hand on the helm and possibly the inserting of dios into the nearest crocodile the mere thought filled him with forbidden delight brethren he cried excuse me said the priestess of sarduk and sistren thank you let us rejoice the assembled priests stood in total silence this was a radical approach which had not hitherto occurred to them and koomi looked at their upturned faces and felt a thrill the like of which he had never experienced before they were frightened out of their wits and they were expecting him him to tell them what to do yea he said and indeed verily the hour of the gods and goddesses yes and goddesses is at hand er what next what when you got right down to it was he going to tell them to do and then he thought it doesnt matter provided i sound confident enough old dios always drove them he never tried to lead them without him theyre wandering around like sheep and brethren and sistren of course we must ask ourselves we must ask ourselves we er yes his voice waxed again with new confidence yes we must ask ourselves why the gods are at hand and without doubt it is because we have not been assiduous enough in our worship we have er we have lusted after graven idols the priests exchanged glances had they how did you do it actually and yes and what about sacrifices time was when a sacrifice was a sacrifice not some messing around with a chicken and flowers this caused some coughing in the audience are we talking maidens here said one of the priests uncertainly ahem and inexperienced young men too certainly he said quickly sarduk was one of the older goddesses whose female worshippers got up to no good in sacred groves the thought of her wandering around the landscape somewhere bloody to the elbows made the eyes water koomis heart thumped well why not he said things were better then werent they but er i thought we stopped all that sort of thing population decline and so forth there was a monstrous splash out in the river tzut the snakeheaded god of the upper djel surfaced and regarded the assembled priesthood solemnly then fhez the crocodileheaded god of the lower djel erupted beside him and made a spirited attempt at biting his head off the two submerged in a column of spray and a minor tidal wave which slopped over the balcony ah but maybe the population declined because we stopped sacrificing virgins of both sexes of course said koomi hurriedly have you ever thought of it like that they thought of it then they thought of it again i dont think the king would approve said one of the priests cautiously the king shouted koomi where is the king show me the king ask dios where the king is there was a thud by his feet he looked down in horror as the gold mask bounced and rolled towards the priests they scattered hurriedly like skittles dios strode out into the light of the disputed sun his face grey with fury the king is dead he said koomi swayed under the sheer pressure of anger but rallied magnificently then his successor he began there is no successor said dios he stared up at the sky few people can look directly at the sun but under the venom of dioss gaze the sun itself might have flinched and looked away dioss eyes sighted down that fearsome nose like twin range finders to the air in general he said coming here as if they own the place how dare they koomis mouth dropped open he started to protest and a kilowatt stare silenced him koomi sought support from the crowd of priests who were busily inspecting their nails or staring intently into the middle distance the message was clear he was on his own although if by some chance he won the battle of wills hed be surrounded by people assuring him that they had been behind him all along anyway they do own the place he mumbled what they er they do own the place dios koomi repeated his temper gave out theyre the sodding gods dios theyre our gods dios hissed were not their people theyre my gods and they will learn to do as they are instructed koomi gave up the frontal assault you couldnt outstare that sapphire stare you couldnt stand the waraxe nose and most of all no man could be expected to dent the surface of dioss terrifying righteousness but he managed dios waved him into silence with a trembling hand theyve no right he said i did not give any orders they have no right then what are you going to do said koomi dioss hands opened and closed fitfully he felt like a royalist might feel a good royalist a royalist who cut out pictures of all the royals and stuck them in a scrapbook a royalist who wouldnt hear a word said about them they did such a good job and they cant answer back if suddenly all the royals turned up in his living room and started rearranging the furniture he longed for the necropolis and the cool silence among his old friends and a quick sleep after which hed be able to think so much more clearly koomis heart leapt dioss discomfort was a crack which with due care and attention could take a wedge but you couldnt use a hammer head on dios could outfight the world the old man was shaking again i do not presume to tell them how to run affairs in the hereunder he said they shall not presume to instruct me in how to run my kingdom koomi salted this treasonable statement away for further study and patted him gently on the back youre right of course he said dioss eyes swivelled i am he said suspiciously im sure that as the kings minister you will find a way you have our full support o dios koomi waved an uplifted hand at the priests who chorused wholehearted agreement if you couldnt depend on kings and gods you could always rely on old dios there wasnt one of them that wouldnt prefer the uncertain wrath of the gods to a rebuke from dios dios terrified them in a very positive human way that no supernatural entity ever could dios would sort it out and we take no heed to these mad rumours about the kings disappearance they are undoubtedly wild exaggerations with no foundation said koomi the priests nodded while in each mind a tiny rumour uncurled the length of its tail what rumours said dios out of the corner of his mouth so enlighten us master as to the path we must now take said koomi dios wavered he did not know what to do for him this was a new experience this was change all he could think of all that was pressing forward in his mind were the words of the ritual of the third hour which he had said at this time for how long too long too long and he should have gone to his rest long before but the time had never been right there was never anyone capable they would have been lost without him the kingdom would founder he would be letting everyone down and so hed crossed the river he swore every time that it was the last but it never was not when the chill fetched his limbs and the decades had become longer and now when his kingdom needed him the words of a ritual had scored themselves into the pathways of his brain and bewildered all attempts at thought er he said you bastard chewed happily teppic had tethered him too near an olive tree which was getting a terminal pruning sometimes the camel would stop gaze up briefly at the seagulls that circled everywhere above ephebe city and subject them to a short deadly burst of olive stones he was turning over in his mind an interesting new concept in thaudimensional physics which unified time space magnetism gravity and for some reason broccoli periodically he would make noises like distant quarry blasting but which merely indicated that all stomachs were functioning perfectly ptraci sat under the tree feeding the tortoise on vine leaves heat crackled off the white walls of the tavern but teppic thought how different it was from the old kingdom there even the heat was old the air was musty and lifeless it pressed like a vice you felt it was made of boiled centuries here it was leavened by the breeze from the sea it was edged with salt crystals it carried exciting hints of wine more than a hint in fact because xeno was already on his second amphora this was the kind of place where things rolled up their sleeves and started but i still dont understand about the tortoise he said with some difficulty hed just taken his first mouthful of ephebian wine and it had apparently varnished the back of his throat s quite simple said xeno look lets say this olive stone is the arrow and this and this he cast around aimlessly and this stunned seagull is the tortoise right now when you fire the arrow it goes from here to the seag the tortoise am i right i suppose so but but by this time the seagu the tortoise has moved on a bit hasnt he am i right i suppose so said teppic helplessly xeno gave him a look of triumph so the arrow has to go a bit further doesnt it to where the tortoise is now meanwhile the tortoise has flow moved on not much ill grant you but it doesnt have to be much am i right so the arrow has a bit further to go but the point is that by the time it gets to where the tortoise is now the tortoise isnt there so if the tortoise keeps moving the arrow will never hit it itll keep getting closer and closer but never hit it qed are you right said teppic automatically no said ibid coldly theres a dozen tortoise kebabs to prove him wrong the trouble with my friend here is that he doesnt know the difference between a postulate and a metaphor of human existence or a hole in the ground it didnt hit it yesterday snapped xeno yes i was watching you hardly pulled the string back i saw you said ibid they started to argue again teppic stared into his wine mug these men are philosophers he thought they had told him so so their brains must be so big that they have room for ideas that noone else would consider for five seconds on the way to the tavern xeno had explained to him for example why it was logically impossible to fall out of a tree teppic had described the vanishing of the kingdom but he hadnt revealed his position in it he hadnt a lot of experience of these matters but he had a very clear feeling that kings who hadnt got a kingdom any more were not likely to be very popular in neighbouring countries there had been one or two like that in ankhmorpork deposed royalty who had fled their suddenlydangerous kingdoms for ankhs hospitable bosom carrying nothing but the clothes they stood up in and a few wagonloads of jewels the city of course welcomed anyone regardless of race colour class or creed who had spending money in incredible amounts but nevertheless the inhumation of surplus monarchs was a regular source of work for the assassins guild there was always someone back home who wanted to be certain that deposed monarchs stayed that way it was usually a case of heir today gone tomorrow i think it got caught up in geometry he said hopefully i heard you were very good at geometry here he added and perhaps you could tell me how to get back geometry is not my forte said ibid as you probably know sorry havent you read my principles of ideal government im afraid not or my discourse on historical inevitability no ibid looked crestfallen oh he said ibid is a wellknown authority on everything said xeno except for geometry and interior decorating and elementary logic ibid glared at him what about you then said teppic xeno drained his mug im more into the destruct testing of axioms he said the chap you need is pthagonal a very acute man with an angle he was interrupted by the clatter of hooves several horsemen galloped with reckless speed past the tavern and on up the winding cobbled streets of the city they seemed very excited about something ibid picked a stunned seagull out of his wine cup and laid it on the table he was looking thoughtful if the old kingdom has really disappeared he said it has said teppic firmly its not something you can be mistaken about really then that means our border is concurrent with that of tsort said ibid ponderously pardon said teppic theres nothing between us explained the philosopher oh dear that means we shall be forced to make war why ibid opened his mouth stopped and turned to xeno why does it mean well be forced to make war he said historical imperative said xeno ah yes i knew it was something like that i am afraid it is inevitable its a shame but there you are there was another clatter as another party of horsemen rounded the corner heading downhill this time they wore the high plumed helmets of ephebian soldiery and were shouting enthusiastically ibid settled himself more comfortably on the bench and folded his bands thatll be the tyrants men he said as the troop galloped through the city gates and out on to the desert hes sending them to check you may depend upon it teppic knew about the enmity between ephebe and tsort of course the old kingdom had profited mightily by it by seeing that the merchants of both sides had somewhere discreet in which to trade with one another he drummed his fingers on the table you havent fought each other for thousands of years he said you were tiny countries in those days it was just a scrap now youre huge people could get hurt doesnt that worry you its a matter of pride said ibid but his voice was tinged with uncertainty i dont think theres much choice it was that bloody wooden cow or whatever said xeno theyve never forgiven us for it if we dont attack them theyll attack us first said ibid sright said xeno so wed better retaliate before they have a chance to strike the two philosophers stared uncomfortably at one another on the other hand said thid war makes it very difficult to think straight there is that xeno agreed especially for dead people there was an embarrassed silence broken only by ptracis voice singing to the tortoise and the occasional squeak of stricken seagulls what day is it said ibid tuesday said teppic i think said thid that it might be a good idea if you came to the symposium we have one every tuesday he added all the greatest minds in ephebe will be there all this needs thinking about he glanced at ptraci however he said your young woman cannot attend naturally females are absolutely forbidden their brains overheat king teppicymon xxvii opened his eyes its bloody dark in here he thought and he realised that he could hear his own heart beating but muffled and some way off and then he remembered he was alive he was alive again and this time he was in bits somehow hed assumed that you got assembled again once you got to the netherworld like one of grinjers kits get a grip on yourself man he thought its up to you to pull yourself together right he thought there were at least six jars so my eyes are in one of them getting the lid off would be favourite so we can see what were at thats going to involve arms and legs and fingers this is going to be really tricky he reached out tentatively with stiff joints and located something heavy it felt as though it might give so he moved his other arm into position with a great deal of awkwardness and pushed there was a distant thump and a definite feeling of openness above him he sat up creaking all the way the sides of the ceremonial casket still hemmed him in but to his surprise he found that one slow arm movement brushed them out of the way like paper must be all the pickle and stuffing he thought gives you a bit of weight he felt his way to the edge of the slab lowered his heavy legs to the ground and after a pause out of habit to wheeze a bit took the first tottering lurch of the newly undead it is astonishingly difficult to walk with legs full of straw when the brain doing the directing is in a pot ten feet away but he made it as far as the wall and felt his way along it until a crash indicated that hed reached the shelf of jars he fumbled the lids of the first one and dipped his hand gently inside it must be brains he thought maniacally because semolina doesnt squidge like that ive collected my own thoughts haha he tried one or two more jars until an explosion of daylight told him hed found the one with his eyes in he watched his own bandaged hand reach down growing gigantic and scoop them up carefully that seems to be the important bits he thought the rest can wait until later maybe when i need to eat something and so forth he turned around and realised that he was not alone dil and gern were watching him to squeeze any further into the far corner of the room they would have needed triangular backbones ah ho there good people said the king aware that his voice was a little hollow i know so much about you id like to shake you by the hand he looked down only theyre rather full at the moment he added gkkk said gern you couldnt do a bit of reassembly could you said the king turning to dil your stitches seem to be holding up nicely by the way well done that man professional pride broke through the barrier of dils terror youre alive he said that was the general idea wasnt it said the king dil nodded certainly it was hed always believed it to be true hed just never expected it ever actually to happen but it had and the first words well nearly the first words that had been said were in praise of his needlework his chest swelled noone else in the guild had ever been congratulated on their work by a recipient there he said to gern whose shoulderblades were making a spirited attempt to dig their way through the wall hear what has been said to your master the king paused it was beginning to dawn on him that things werent quite right here of course the netherworld was like this world only better and no doubt there were plenty of servants and so forth but it seemed altogether far too much like this world he was pretty sure that dil and gern shouldnt be in it yet anyway hed always understood that the common people had their own netherworld where they would be more at ease and could mingle with their own kind and wouldnt feel awkward and socially out of place i say he said i may have missed a bit here youre not dead are you dil didnt answer immediately some of the things hed seen so far today had made him a bit uncertain on the subject in the end though he was forced to admit that he probably was alive then whats happening said the king we dont know o king said dil really we dont its all come true o fount of waters what has everything everything the sun o lord and the gods oh the gods theyre everywhere o master of heaven we come in through the back way said gern who had dropped to his knees forgive us o lord of justice who has come back to deliver his mighty wisdom and that i am sorry about me and glwenda it was a moment of wossname mad passion we couldnt control ourselves also it was me dil waved him into a devout silence excuse me he said to the kings mummy but could we have a word away from the lad man to corpse said the king trying to make it easy for him certainly they wandered over to the other side of the room the fact is o gracious king of dil began in a conspiratorial whisper i think we can dispense with all that said the king briskly the dead dont stand on ceremony king will be quite sufficient the fact is then king said dil experiencing a slight thrill at this equitable treatment young gern thinks its all his fault ive told him over and over again that the gods wouldnt go to all this trouble just because of one growing lad with urges if you catch my drift he paused and added carefully they wouldnt would they shouldnt think so for one minute said the king briskly wed never see the back of them otherwise thats what i told him said dil immensely relieved hes a good boy sir its just that his mum is a bit funny about religion wed never see the back of them those were my very words id be very grateful if you could have a word with him sir you know set his mind at rest be happy to said the king graciously dil sidled closer the fact is sir these gods sir they arent right weve been watching sir at least i have i climbed on the roof gern didnt he hid under the bench theyre not right sir whats wrong with them well theyre here sir thats not right is it i mean not to be really here and theyre just striding around and fighting amongst themselves and shouting at people he looked both ways before continuing between you and me sir he said they dont seem too bright the king nodded what are the priests doing about this he said i saw them throwing one another in the river sir the king nodded again that sounds about right he said theyve come to their senses at last you know what i think sir said dil earnestly everything we believe is coming true and i heard something else sir this morning if it was this morning you understand because the suns all over the place sir and its not the right sort of sun but this morning some of the soldiers tried to get out along the ephebe road sir and do you know what they found what did they find the road out sir leads in dil took a step backwards the better to illustrate the seriousness of the revelations they got up into the rocks and then suddenly they were walking down the tsort road it all sort of curves back on itself were shut in sir shut in with our gods and im shut in my body thought the king everything we believe is true and what we believe isnt what we think we believe i mean we think we believe that the gods are wise and just and powerful but what we really believe is that they are like our father after a long day and we think we believe the netherworld is a sort of paradise but we really believe its right here and you go to it in your body and im in it and im never going to get away never ever whats my son got to say about all this he said dil coughed it was the ominous cough the spanish use an upsidedown question mark to tell you what youre about to hear is a question this was the kind of cough that tells you what youre about to hear is a dirge dont know how to tell you this sir he said out with it man sir they say hes dead sir they say he killed himself and ran away killed himself sorry sir and ran away afterwards on a camel they say we lead an active afterlife in our family dont we observed the king dryly beg pardon sir i mean the two statements could be held to be mutually exclusive dils face became a wellmeaning blank that is to say they cant both be true supplied the king helpfully ahem said dil yes but im a special case said the king testily in this kingdom we believe you live after death only if youve been mumm he stopped it was too horrible to think about he thought about it nevertheless for some time then he said we must do something about it dil said your son sir never mind about my son hes not dead id know about it snapped the king he can look after himself hes my son its my ancestors im worried about but theyre dead dil began it has already been remarked that dil had a very poor imagination in a job like his a poor imagination was essential but his minds eye opened on a panorama of pyramids stretching along the river and his minds ear swooped and curved through solid doors that no thief could penetrate and it heard the scrabbling and it heard the hammering and it heard the muffled shouting the king put a bandaged arm over his trembling shoulders i know youre a good man with a needle dil he said tell me how are you with a sledgehammer copolymer the greatest storyteller in the history of the world sat back and beamed at the greatest minds in the world assembled at the dining table teppic had added another iota to his store of new knowledge symposium meant a knifeandfork tea well said copolymer and launched into the story of the tsortean wars you see what happened was hed taken her back home and her father this wasnt the old king this was the one before the one with the wossname he married some girl from over elharib way she had a squint what was her name now began with a p or an l one of them letters anyway her father owned an island out on the bay there papylos i think it was no i tell a lie it was crinix anyway the king the other king he raised an army and they elenor that was her name she had a squint you know but quite attractive they say when i say married i trust i do not have to spell it out for you i mean it was a bit unofficial er anyway there was this wooden horse and after theyd got in did i tell you about this horse it was a horse im pretty sure it was a horse or maybe it was a chicken forget my own name next it was wossnames idea the one with the limp yes the limp in his leg i mean did i mention him thered been this fight no that was the other one i think yes anyway this wooden pig damn clever idea they made it out of thing tip of my tongue wood but that was later you know the fight nearly forgot the fight yes damn good fight everyone banging on their shields and yelling wossnames armour shone like shining armour fight and a half that fight between thingy not the one with the limp the other one wossname had red hair you know tall fellow talked with a lisp hold on just remembered he was from some other island not him the other one with the limp didnt want to go he said he was mad of course he was bloody mad definitely i mean a wooden cow like wossname said the king no not that king the other one he saw the goat he said i fear the ephebians especially when theyre mad enough to leave bloody great wooden livestock on the doorstep talk about nerve they must think we was born yesterday set fire to it and of course wossname had nipped in round the back and put everyone to the sword talk about laugh did i say she had a squint they said she was pretty but it takes all sorts yes anyway thats how it happened now of course wossname i think he was called melycanus had a limp he wanted to go home well you would theyd been there for years he wasnt getting any younger thats why he dreamt up the thing about the wooden wossname yes i tell a lie lavaelous was the one with the knee pretty good fight that fight take it from me he lapsed into selfsatisfied silence pretty good fight he mumbled and smiling faintly dropped off to sleep teppic was aware that his own mouth was hanging open he shut it along the table several of the diners were wiping their eyes magic said xeno sheer magic every word a tassel on the canopy of time its the way he remembers every tiny detail pinsharp murmured ibid teppic looked down the length of the table and then nudged xeno beside him who is everyone he said well ibid you already know and copolymer over there thats iesope the greatest teller of fables in the world and thats antiphon the greatest writer of comic plays in the world where is pthagonal said teppic xeno pointed to the far end of the table where a glumlooking heavydrinking man was trying to determine the angle between two bread rolls ill introduce you to him afterwards he said teppic looked around at the bald heads and long white beards which seemed to be a badge of office if you had a bald head and a long white beard they seemed to indicate whatever lay between them must be bursting with wisdom the only exception was antiphon who looked as though he was built of pork they are great minds he told himself these are men who are trying to work out how the world fits together not by magic not by religion but just by inserting their brains in whatever crack they can find and trying to lever it apart ibid rapped on the table for silence the tyrant has called for war on tsort he said now let us consider the place of war in the ideal republic he said we would require excuse me could you just pass me the celery said iesope thank you the ideal republic as i was saying based on the fundamental laws that govern and the salt its just by your elbow the fundamental laws that is which govern all men now it is without doubt true that war could you stop that please its celery said iesope crunching cheerfully you cant help it with celery xeno peered suspiciously at what was on his fork here this is squid he said i didnt ask for squid who ordered squid without doubt repeated thid raising his voice without doubt i put it to you i think this is the lamb couscous said antiphon was yours the squid i asked for marida and dolmades i ordered the lamb just pass it along will you i dont remember anyone asking for all this garlic bread said xeno look some of us are trying to float a philosophical concept here said ibid sarcastically dont let us interrupt you will you someone threw a breadstick at him teppic looked at what was on his fork seafood was unknown in the kingdom and what was on his fork had too many valves and suckers to be reassuring he lifted a boiled vine leaf with extreme care and was sure he saw something scuttle behind an olive ah something else to remember then the ephebians made wine out of anything they could put in a bucket and ate anything that couldnt climb out of one he pushed the food around on his plate some of it pushed back and philosophers didnt listen to one another and they dont stick to the point this probably is mocracy at work a bread roll bounced past him oh and they get overexcited he noticed a skinny little man sitting opposite him chewing primly on some anonymous tentacle apart from pthagonal the geometrician who was now gloomily calculating the radius of his plate he was the only person not speaking his mind at the top of his voice sometimes hed make little notes on a piece of parchment and slip it into his toga teppic leaned across further down the table iesope encouraged by occasional olive stones and bread rolls started a long fable about a fox a turkey a goose and a wolf who had a wager to see who could stay longest underwater with heavy weights tied to their feet excuse me said teppic raising his voice above the din who are you the little man gave him a shy look he had extremely large ears in a certain light he could have been mistaken for a very thin jug im endos he said why arent you philosophising endos sliced a strange mollusc im not a philosopher actually he said or a humorous playwright or something said teppic im afraid not im a listener endos the listener im known as thats fascinating said teppic automatically what does that involve listening just listening thats what they pay me for said endos sometimes i nod or smile or nod and smile at the same time encouragingly you know they like that teppic felt he was called upon to comment at this point gosh he said endos gave him an encouraging nod and a smile that suggested that of all the things endos could be doing in the world right at this minute there was nothing so basically riveting as listening to teppic it was something about his ears they appeared to be a vast aural black hole begging to be filled up with words teppic felt an overpowering urge to tell him all about his life and hopes and dreams i bet he said that they pay you an awful lot of money endos gave him a heartening smile have you listened to copolymer tell his story lots of times endos nodded and smiled although there was a faint trace of pain right behind his eyes i expect said teppic that your ears develop protective rough surfaces after a while endos nodded do go on he urged teppic glanced across at pthagonal who was moodily drawing right angles in his taramasalata id love to stay and listen to you listening to me all day he said but theres a man over there id like to see thats amazing said endos making a short note and turning his attention to a conversation further along the table a philosopher had averred that although truth was beauty beauty was not necessarily truth and a fight was breaking out endos listened carefully teppic wandered along the table to where pthagonal was sitting in unrelieved misery and currently peering suspiciously over the crust of a pie teppic looked over his shoulder i think i saw something moving in there he said ah said the geometrician taking the cork out of an amphora with his teeth the mysterious young man in black from the lost kingdom i was hoping you could help me find it again said teppic i heard that you have some very unusual ideas in ephebe it had to happen said pthagonal he pulled a pair of dividers from the folds of his robe and measured the pie thoughtfully is it a constant do you think its a depressing concept sorry said teppic the diameter divides into the circumference you know it ought to be three times youd think so wouldnt you but does it no three point one four one and lots of other figures theres no end to the buggers do you know how pissed off that makes me i expect it makes you extremely pissed off said teppic politely right it tells me that the creator used the wrong kind of circles its not even a proper number i mean three point five you could respect or three point three thatd look right he stared morosely at the pie excuse me you said something about it had to happen what said pthagonal from the depths of his gloom pie he added what had to happen teppic prompted you cant mess with geometry friend pyramids dangerous things asking for trouble i mean pthagonal reached unsteadily for his wine cup how long did they think they could go on building bigger and bigger pyramids for i mean where did they think power comes from i mean he hiccuped youve been in that place havent you ever noticed how slow it all seems to be oh yes said teppic flatly thats because the time is sucked up see pyramids so they have to flare it off flarelight they call it they think it looks pretty its their time theyre burning off all i know is the air feels as though its been boiled in a sock said teppic and nothing actually changes even if it doesnt stay the same right said pthagonal the reason being its past time they use up past time over and over again the pyramids take all the new time and if you dont let the pyramids flare the power build upll he paused i suppose he went on that itd escape along a wossname a fracture in space i was there before the kingdom er went said teppic i thought i saw the big pyramid move there you are then its probably moved the dimensions around by ninety degrees said pthagonal with the assurance of the truly drunk you mean so length is height and height is width pthagonal shook an unsteady finger nonono he said so that length is height and height is breadth and breadth is width and width is a he burped a time snother dimessnon see four of the bastards times one of them ninety thingys to the other three degrees is what i mean only only it cant exist in this world like that so the place had to sort of pop outside for a bit see otherwise youd have people getting older by walking sideways he looked sadly into the depths of his cup and every birthday youd age another mile he added teppic looked at him aghast thats time and space for you pthagonal went on you can twist them all over the place if youre not careful three point one four one what sort of a number dyou call that it sounds horrible said teppic damn right somewhere pthagonal was beginning to sway on his bench somewhere someone built a universe with a decent respectable value of of he peered blankly at the table of pie not some damn number that never comes to an end what kind of a i meant people getting older just by walking along i dunno though you could have a stroll back to where you were eighteen or wander up and see what you are going to look like when youre seventy travelling in width though thatd be the real trick pthagonal smiled vacantly and then very slowly keeled over into his dinner some of which moved out of the way teppic became aware that the philosophic din around him had subsided a bit he stared along the line until he spotted ibid it wont work said ibid the tyrant wont listen to us nor will the people anyway he glanced at antiphon were not all of one mind on the subject damn tsorteans need teaching a lesson said antiphon sternly not room for two major powers on this continent damn bad sports anyway just because we stole their queen youthful high spirits love will have its way copolymer woke up youve got it wrong he said mildly the great war that was because they stole our queen what was her name now face that launched a thousand camels began with an a or a t or did they shouted antiphon the bastards im reasonably certain said copolymer teppic sagged and turned to endos the listener he was still eating his dinner with the air of one who is determined to preserve his digestion endos the listener laid his knife and fork carefully on either side of his plate yes theyre really all mad arent they said teppic wearily thats extremely interesting said endos do go on he reached shyly into his toga and brought forth a scrap of parchment which he pushed gently towards teppic whats this my bill said endos five minutes attentive listening most of my gentlemen have monthly accounts but i understand youll be leaving in the morning teppic gave up he wandered away from the table and into the cold garden surrounding the citadel of ephebe white marble statues of ancient ephebians doing heroic things with no clothes on protruded through the greenery and here and there there were statues of ephebian gods it was hard to tell the difference teppic knew that dios had hard words to say about the ephebians for having gods that looked just like people if the gods looked just like everyone else he used to say how would people know how to treat them teppic had rather liked the idea according to legend the ephebians gods were just like humans except that they used their godhood to get up to things humans didnt have the nerve to do a favourite trick of ephebian gods he recalled was turning into some animal in order to gain the favours of highlyplaced ephebian women and one of them had reputedly turned himself into a golden shower in pursuit of his intended all this raised interesting questions about everyday night life in sophisticated ephebe he found ptraci sitting on the grass under a poplar tree feeding the tortoise he gave it a suspicious look in case it was a god trying it on it did not look like a god if it was a god it was putting on an incredibly good act she was feeding it a lettuce leaf dear little ptortoise she said and then looked up oh its you she said flatly you didnt miss much said teppic sagging on to the grass theyre a bunch of maniacs when i left they were smashing the plates thats ptraditional at the end of an ephebian meal said ptraci teppic thought about this why not before he said and then they probably dance to the sound of the bourzuki ptraci added i think its a sort of dog teppic sat with his head in his hands i must say you speak ephebian well he said pthank you just a trace of an accent though languages is part of the ptraining she said and my grandmother told me that a ptrace of foreign accent is more fascinating we learned the same thing said teppic an assassin should always be slightly foreign no matter where he is im good at that part he added bitterly she began to massage his neck i went down to the harbour she said theres those things like big rafts you know camels of the sea ships said teppic and they go everywhere we could go anywhere we want the world is our pthing with pearls in it if we like teppic told her about pthagonals theory she didnt seem surprised like an old pond where no new water comes in she observed so everyone goes round and round in the same old puddle all the ptime you live has been lived already it must be like other peoples bathwater im going to go back her fingers stopped their skilled kneading of his muscles we could go anywhere she repeated weve got ptrades we could sell that camel you could show me that ankhmorpork place it sounds interesting teppic wondered what effect ankhmorpork would have on the girl then he wondered what effect she would have on the city she was definitely flowering back in the old kingdom shed never apparently had any original thoughts beyond the choice of the next grape to peel but since she was outside she seemed to have changed her jaw hadnt changed it was still quite small and he had to admit very pretty but somehow it was more noticeable she used to look at the ground when she spoke to him she still didnt always look at him when she spoke to him but now it was because she was thinking about something else he found he kept wanting to say politely without stressing it in any way just as a very gentle reminder that he was king but he had a feeling that shed say she hadnt heard and would he please repeat it and if she looked at him hed never be able to say it twice you could go he said youd get on well i could give you a few names and addresses and what would you do i dread to think whats going on back home said teppic i ought to do something you cant why ptry even if you didnt want to be an assassin theres lots of pthings you could do and you said the man said its not a place people could get into any more i hate pyramids surely theres people there you care about ptraci shrugged if theyre dead theres nothing i can do about it she said and if theyre alive theres nothing i can do about it so i shant teppic stared at her in a species of horrified admiration it was a beautiful summary of things as they were he just couldnt bring himself to think that way his body had been away for seven years but his blood had been in the kingdom for a thousand times longer certainly hed wanted to leave it behind but that was the whole point it would have been there even if hed avoided it for the rest of his life it would have still been a sort of anchor i feel so wretched about it he repeated im sorry thats all there is to it even to go back for five minutes just to say well that im not coming back thatd be enough its probably all my fault but there isnt a way back youll just hang around sadly like those deposed kings you ptold me about you know with pthreadbare cloaks and always begging for their food in a highclass way theres nothing more useless than a king without a kingdom you said just think about it they wandered through the sunset streets of the city and towards the harbour all streets in the city led towards the harbour someone was just putting a torch to the lighthouse which was one of the more than seven wonders of the world and had been built to a design by pthagonal using the golden rule and the five aesthetic principles unfortunately it had then been built in the wrong place because putting it in the right place would have spoiled the look of the harbour but it was generally agreed by mariners to be a very beautiful lighthouse and something to look at while they were waiting to be towed off the rocks the harbour below it was thronged with ships teppic and ptraci picked their way past crates and bundles until they reached the long curved guard wall harbour calm on one side choppy with waves on the other above them the lighthouse flared and sparked those boats would be going to places hed only ever heard of he knew the ephebians were great traders he could go back to ankh and get his diploma and then the world would indeed be the mollusc of his choice and he had any amount of knives to open it with ptraci put her hand in his and thered be none of this marrying relatives business the months in djelibeybi already seemed like a dream one of those circular dreams that you never quite seem able to shake off and which make insomnia an attractive prospect whereas here was a future unrolling in front of him like a carpet what a chap needed at a time like this was a sign some sort of book of instructions the trouble with life was that you didnt get a chance to practise before doing it for real you only good grief its teppic isnt it the voice was addressing him from ankle height a head appeared over the stone of the jetty quickly followed by its body an extremely richly dressed body one on which no expense had been spared in the way of gems furs silks and laces provided that all of them every single one was black it was chidder whats it doing now said ptaclusp his son poked his head cautiously over the ruins of a pillar and watched hat the vultureheaded god its sniffing around he said i think it likes the statue honestly dad why did you have to go and buy a thing like that it was in a job lot said ptaclusp anyway i thought it would be a popular line with who well he likes it ptaclusp iib risked another squint at the angular monstrosity that was still hopping around the ruins tell him he can have it if he goes away he suggested tell him he can have it at cost ptaclusp winced at a discount he said a special cut rate for our supernatural customers he stared up at the sky from their hiding place in the ruins of the construction camp with the great pyramid still humming like a powerhouse behind them theyd had an excellent view of the arrival of the gods at first hed viewed them with a certain amount of equanimity gods would be good customers they always wanted temples and statues he could deal directly cut out the middle man and then it had occurred to him that a god when he was unhappy about the product as it might be maybe the plasterwork wasnt exactly as per spec or perhaps a corner of the temple was a bit low on account of unexpected quicksand a god didnt just come around demanding in a loud voice to see the manager no a god knew exactly where you were and got to the point also gods were notoriously bad payers so were humans of course but they didnt actually expect you to die before they settled the account his gaze turned to his other son a painted silhouette against the statue his mouth a frozen o of astonishment and ptaclusp reached a decision ive just about had it with pyramids he said remind me lad if we ever get out of here no more pyramids weve got set in our ways time to branch out i reckon thats what ive been telling you for ages dad said iib ive told you a couple of decent aqueducts will make a tremendous yes yes i remember said ptaclusp yes aqueducts all those arches and things fine only i cant remember where you said you have to put the coffin in dad dont mind me lad i think im going mad i couldnt have seen a mummy and two men over there carrying sledgehammers it was indeed chidder and chidder had a boat teppic knew that further along the coast the seriph of alkhali lived in the fabulous palace of the rhoxie which was said to have been built in one night by a genie and was famed in myth and legend for its splendour the unnamed was the rhoxie afloat but more so its designer had a gilt complex and had tried every trick with gold paint curly pillars and expensive drapes to make it look less like a ship and more like a boudoir that had collided with a highly suspicious type of theatre in fact you needed an assassins eyes for hidden detail to notice how innocently the gaudiness concealed the sleekness of the hull and the fact even when you added the cabin space and the holds together that there still seemed to be a lot of capacity unaccounted for the water around what ptraci called the pointed end was strangely rippled but it would be totally ridiculous to suspect such an obvious merchantman of having a concealed ramming spike underwater or that a mere five minutes work with an axe would turn this wallowing alcdzar into something that could run away from nearly everything else afloat and make the few that could catch up seriously regret it very impressive said teppic its all show really said chidder yes i can see that i mean were poor traders teppic nodded the usual phrase is poor but honest traders he said chidder smiled a merchants smile oh i think well stick on poor at the moment how the hell are you anyway last we heard you were going off to be king of some place noones ever heard of and who is this lovely young lady her name teppic began ptraci said ptraci shes a hand teppic began she must surely be a royal princess said chidder smoothly and it would give me the greatest pleasure if she if indeed both of you would dine with me tonight humble sailors fare im afraid but we muddle along we muddle along not ephebian is it said teppic ships biscuit salt beef that sort of thing said chidder without taking his eyes off ptraci they hadnt left her since she came on board then he laughed it was the old familiar chidder laugh not exactly without humour but clearly well under the control of its owners higher brain centres what an astonishing coincidence he said and us due to sail at dawn too can i offer you a change of clothing you both look somewhat er travelstained rough sailor clothing i expect said teppic as befits a humble merchant correct me if im wrong in fact teppic was shown to a small cabin as exquisitely and carefully furnished as a jewelled egg where there was laid upon the bed as fine an assortment of clothing as could be found anywhere on the circle sea true it all appeared secondhand but carefully laundered and expertly stitched so that the sword cuts hardly showed at all he gazed thoughtfully at the hooks on the wall and the faint patching on the wood which hinted that various things had once been hung there and hastily removed he stepped out into the narrow corridor and met ptraci shed chosen a red court dress such as had been the fashion in ankhmorpork ten years previously with puffed sleeves and vast concealed underpinnings and ruffs the size of millstones teppic learned something new which was that attractive women dressed in a few strips of gauze and a few yards of silk can actually look far more desirable when fully clad from neck to ankle she gave an experimental twirl there are any amount of things like this in there she said is this how women dress in ankhmorpork its like wearing a house it doesnt half make you sweaty look about chidder said teppic urgently i mean hes a good fellow and everything but hes very kind isnt he she agreed well yes he is teppic admitted hopelessly hes an old friend thats nice one of the crew materialised at the end of the corridor and bowed them into the state cabin his air of old retainership marred only by the crisscross pattern of scars on his head and some tattoos that made the pictures in the shuttered palace look like illustrations in a diy shelving manual the things he could make them do by flexing his biceps could keep entire dockside taverns fascinated for hours and he was not aware that the worst moment of his entire life was only a few minutes away this is all very pleasant said chidder pouring some wine he nodded at the tattooed man you may serve the soup alfonz he added look chiddy youre not a pirate are you said teppic desperately is that whats been worrying you chidder grinned his lazy grin it wasnt everything that teppic had been worrying about but it had been jockeying for top position he nodded no were not we just prefer to er avoid paperwork wherever possible you know we dont like people to have all the worry of having to know everything we do only theres all the clothes ah we get attacked by pirates a fair amount thats why father had the unnamed built it always surprises them and the whole thing is morally sound we get their ship their booty and any prisoners they may have get rescued and given a ride home at competitive rates what do you do with the pirates chidder glanced at alfonz that depends on future employment prospects he said father always says that a man down on his luck should be offered a helping hand on terms that is hows the king business teppic told him chidder listened intently swilling the wine around in his glass so thats it he said at last we heard there was going to be a war thats why were sailing tonight i dont blame you said teppic no i mean to get the trade organised with both sides naturally because were strictly impartial the weapons produced on this continent are really quite shocking downright dangerous you should come with us too youre a very valuable person never felt more valueless than right now said teppic despondently chidder looked at him in amazement but youre a king he said well yes but of a country which technically still exists but isnt actually reachable by mortal man sadly so and you can pass laws about well currency and taxation yes i suppose so but and you dont think youre valuable good grief tep our accountants can probably think up fifty different ways to well my hands go damp just to think about it father will probably ask to move our head office there for a start chidder i explained you know it noone can get in said teppic that doesnt matter doesnt matter no because well just make ankh our main branch office and pay our taxes in wherever the place is all we need is an official address in i dont know the avenue of the pyramids or something take my tip and dont give in on anything until father gives you a seat on the board youre royal anyway thats always impressive chidder chattered on teppic felt his clothes growing hotter so this was it you lost your kingdom and then it was worth more because it was a tax haven and you took a seat on the board whatever that was and that made it all right ptraci defused the situation by grabbing alfonzs arm as he was serving the pheasant the congress of the friendly dog and the two small biscuits she exclaimed examining the intricate tattoo you hardly ever see that these days isnt it well done you can even make out the yoghurt alfonz froze and then blushed watching the glow spread across the great scarred head was like watching sunrise over a mountain range whats the one on your other arm alfonz who looked as though his past jobs had included being a battering ram murmured something and very shyly showed her his forearm snot really suitable for ladies he whispered ptraci brushed aside the wiry hair like a keen explorer while chidder stared at her with his mouth hanging open oh i know that one she said dismissively thats out of days of pseudopolis its physically impossible she let go of the arm and turned back to her meal after a moment she looked up at teppic and chidder dont mind me she said brightly do go on alfonz please go and put a proper shirt on said chidder hoarsely alfonz backed away staring at his arm er what was i er saying said chidder sorry lost the thread er have some more wine tep ptraci didnt just derail the train of thought she ripped up the rails burned the stations and melted the bridges for scrap and so the dinner trailed off into beef pie fresh peaches crystallised sea urchins and desultory small talk about the good old days at the guild they had been three months ago it seemed like a lifetime three months in the old kingdom was a lifetime after some time ptraci yawned and went to her cabin leaving the two of them alone with a fresh bottle of wine chidder watched her go in awed silence are there many like her back at your place he said i dont know teppic admitted there could be usually they lie around the place peeling grapes or waving fans shes amazing shell take them by storm in ankh you know with a figure like that and a mind like he hesitated is she i mean are you two no said teppic shes very attractive yes said teppic a sort of cross between a temple dancer and a bandsaw they took their glasses and went up on deck where a few lights from the city paled against the brilliance of the stars the water was flat calm almost oily teppics head was beginning to spin slowly the desert the sun two gloss coats of ephebian retsina on his stomach lining and a bottle of wine were getting together to beat up his synapses i mus say he managed leaning on the rail youre doing all right for yourself its okay said chidder commerce is quite interesting building up markets you know the cut and thrust of competition in the privateering sector you ought to come in with us boy its where the future lies my father says not with wizards and kings but with enterprising people who can afford to hire them no offence intended you understand were all thats left said teppic to his wine glass out of the whole kingdom me her and a camel that smells like an old carpet an ancient kingdom lost good job it wasnt a new one said chidder at least people got some wear out of it you dont know what its like said teppic its like a whole great pyramid but upside down you understand all that history all those ancestors all the people all funnelling down to me right at the bottom he slumped on to a coil of rope as chidder passed the bottle back and said it makes you think doesnt it theres all these lost cities and kingdoms around like ee in the great nef whole countries just gone just out there somewhere maybe people started mucking about with geometry what do you say teppic snored after some moments chidder swayed forward dropped the empty bottle over the side it went plunk and for a few seconds a stream of bubbles disturbed the flat calm and staggered off to bed teppic dreamed and in his dream he was standing on a high place but unsteadily because he was balancing on the shoulders of his father and mother and below them he could make out his grandparents and below them his ancestors stretching away and out in a vast all right a vast pyramid of humanity whose base was lost in clouds he could hear the murmur of shouted orders and instructions floating up to him if you do nothing we shall never have been this is just a dream he said and stepped out of it into a palace where a small dark man in a loincloth was sitting on a stone bench eating figs of course its a dream he said the world is the dream of the creator its all dreams different kinds of dreams theyre supposed to tell you things like dont eat lobster last thing at night stuff like that have you had the one about the seven cows yes said teppic looking around hed dreamed quite good architecture one of them was playing a trombone it was smoking a cigar in my day wellknown ancestral dream that dream what does it mean the little man picked a seed from between his teeth search me he said id give my right arm to find out i dont think weve met by the way im khuft i founded this kingdom you dream a good fig im dreaming you too damn right i had a vocabulary of eight hundred words do you think id really be talking like this if youre expecting a bit of helpful ancestral advice forget it this is a dream i cant tell you anything you dont know yourself youre the founder thats me i thought youd be different said teppic how dyou mean well on the statue khuft waved a hand impatiently thats just public relations he said i mean look at me do i look patriarchal teppic gave him a critical appraisal not in that loincloth he admitted its a bit well ragged its got years of wear left in it said khuft still i expect its all you could grab when you were fleeing from persecution said teppic anxious to show an understanding nature khuft took another fig and give him a lopsided look hows that again you were being persecuted said teppic thats why you fled into the desert oh yes youre right damn right i was being persecuted for my beliefs thats terrible said teppic khuft spat damn right i believed people wouldnt notice id sold them camels with plaster teeth until i was well out of town it took a little while for this to sink in but it managed it with all the aplomb of a concrete block in a quicksand youre a criminal said teppic well criminals a dirty word know what i mean said the little ancestor id prefer entrepreneur i was ahead of my time thats my trouble and you were running away said teppic weakly it wouldnt said khuft have been a good idea to hang about and khuft the camel herder became lost in the desert and there opened before him as a gift from the gods a valley flowing with milk and honey quoted teppic in a hollow voice he added i used to think it must have been awfully sticky there i was dying of thirst all the camels kicking up a din yelling for water next minute whoosh a bloody great river valley reed beds hippos the whole thing out of nowhere i nearly got knocked down in the stampede no said teppic it wasnt like that the gods of the valley took pity on you and showed you the way in didnt they he shut up surprised at the tones of pleading in his own voice khuft sneered oh yes and i just happened to stumble across a hundred miles of river in the middle of the desert that everyone else had missed easy thing to miss a hundred miles of river valley in the middle of a desert isnt it not that i was going to look a gift camel in the mouth you understand i went and brought my family and the rest of the lads in soon enough never looked back one minute it wasnt there the next minute it was said teppic right enough hard to believe isnt it no said teppic no not really khuft poked him with a wrinkled finger i always reckoned it was the camels that did it he said i always thought they sort of called it into place like it was sort of potentially there but not quite and it needed just that little bit of effort to make it real funny things camels i know odder than gods something the matter sorry said teppic its just that this is all a bit of a shock i mean i thought we were really royal i mean were more royal than anyone khuft picked a fig seed from between two blackened stumps which because they were in his mouth probably had to be called his teeth then he spat thats up to you he said and vanished teppic walked through the necropolis the pyramids a sawedged skyline against the night the sky was the arched body of a woman and the gods stood around the horizon they didnt look like the gods that had been painted on the walls for thousands of years they looked worse they looked older than time after all the gods hardly ever meddled in the affairs of men but other things were proverbial for it what can i do im only human he said aloud someone said not all of you teppic awoke to the screaming of seagulls alfonz who was wearing a longsleeved shirt and the expression of one who never means to take it off again ever was helping several other men unfurl one of unnameds sails he looked down at teppic in his bed of rope and gave him a nod they were moving teppic sat up and saw the dockside of ephebe slipping silently away in the grey morning light he stood up unsteadily groaned clutched at his head took a run and dived over the rail heme krona owner of the camelsrus livery stable walked slowly around you bastard humming he examined the camels knees he gave one of its feet an experimental kick in a swift movement that took you bastard completely by surprise he jerked open the beasts mouth and examined his great yellow teeth and then jumped away he took a plank of wood from a heap in the corner dipped a brush in a pot of black paint and after a moments thought carefully wrote one owner after some further consideration he added lo mileage he was just brushing in good runer when teppic staggered in and leaned panting against the doorframe pools of water formed around his feet ive come for my camel he said krona sighed last night you said youd be back in an hour he said im going to have to charge you for a whole days livery right plus i gave him a rub down and did his feet the full service thatll be five cercs okay emir ah teppic patted his pocket look he said i left home in a bit of a hurry you see i dont seem to have any cash on me fair enough emir krona turned back to his board how do you spell years warenty i will definitely have the money sent to you said teppic krona gave him the withering smile of one who has seen it all asses with bodywork rehaired elephants with plaster tusks camels with false humps glued on and knows the festering depths of the human soul when it gets down to business pull the other one rajah he said it has got bells on teppic fumbled in his tunic i could give you this valuable knife he said krona gave it a passing glance and sniffed sorry emir no can do no pay no camel i could give it to you point first said teppic desperately knowing that the mere threat would get him expelled from the guild he was also aware that as a threat it wasnt very good threats werent on the syllabus at the guild school whereas krona had sitting on straw bales at the back of the stables a couple of large men who were just beginning to take an interest in the proceedings they looked like alfonzs older brothers every vehicle depot of any description anywhere in the multiverse has them theyre never exactly grooms or mechanics or customers or staff their function is always unclear they chew straws or smoke cigarettes in a surreptitious fashion if there are such things as newspapers around they read them or at least look at the pictures they started to watch teppic closely one of them picked up a couple of bricks and began to toss them up and down youre a young lad i can see that said krona kindly youre just starting out in life emir you dont want trouble he stepped forward you bastards huge shaggy head turned to look at him in the depths of his brain columns of little numbers whirred upwards again look im sorry but ive got to have my camel back said teppic its life and death krona waved a hand at the two extraneous men you bastard kicked him you bastard had very concise ideas about people putting their hands in his mouth besides hed seen the bricks and every camel knew what two bricks added up to it was a good kick toes well spread powerful and deceptively slow it picked krona up and delivered him neatly into a steaming heap of augean stable sweepings teppic ran kicked away from the wall grabbed you bastards dusty coat and landed heavily on his neck im very sorry he said to such of krona as was visible i really will have some money sent to you you bastard at this point was waltzing round and round in a circle kronas companions stayed well back as feet like plates whirred through the air teppic leaned forward and hissed into one madlywaving ear were going home he said they had chosen the first pyramid at random the king peered at the cartouche on the door blessed is queen farreptah read dil dutifully ruler of the skies lord of the djel master of grandma pooney said the king shell do he looked at their startled faces thats what i used to call her when i was a little boy i couldnt pronounce farreptah you see well go on then stop gawking break the door down gern hefted the hammer uncertainly its a pyramid master he said appealing to dil youre not supposed to open them what do you suggest lad we stick a tableknife in the slot and wiggle it about said the king do it gern said dil it will be all right gern shrugged spat on his hands which were in fact quite damp enough with the sweat of terror and swung again said the king the great slab boomed as the hammer hit it but it was granite and held a few flakes of mortar floated down and then the echoes came back shunting back and forth along the dead avenues of the necropolis again gerns biceps moved like turtles in grease this time there was an answering boom such as might be caused by a heavy lid crashing to the ground far away they stood in silence listening to a slow shuffling noise from inside the pyramid shall i hit it again sire said gern they both waved him into silence the shuffling grew closer then the stone moved it stuck once or twice but never the less it moved slowly pivoting on one side so that a crack of dark shadow appeared dil could just make out a darker shape in the blackness yes it said its me grandma said the king the shadow stood motionless what young pootle it said suspiciously the king avoided dils face thats right grandma weve come to let you out whore these men said the shadow petulantly ive got nothing young man she said to gern i dont keep any money in the pyramid and you can put that weapon away it doesnt frighten me theyre servants grandma said the king have they got any identification muttered the old lady im identifying them grandma weve come to let you out i was hammering hours said the late queen emerging into the sunlight she looked exactly like the king except that the mummy wrappings were greyer and dusty i had to go and have a lie down come the finish noone cares about you when youre dead wherere we going to let the others out said the king damn good idea the old queen lurched into step behind him so this is the netherworld is it she said not much of an improvement she elbowed gern sharply you dead too young man no maam said gern in the shaky brave tones of someone on a tightrope over the chasms of madness its not worth it be told yes maam the king shuffled across the ancient pavings to the next pyramid i know this one said the queen it was here in my day king ashkurmentep third empire whats the hammer for young man please maam i have to hammer on the door maam said gern you dont have to knock hes always in my assistant means to smash the seals maam said dil anxious to please whore you the queen demanded my name is dil o queen master embalmer oh you are are you ive got some stitching wants seeing to it will be an honour and a privilege o queen said dil yes it will she said and turned creakily to gern hammer away young man she said spurred by this gern brought the hammer round in a long fast arc it passed in front of dils nose making a noise like a partridge and smashed the seal into pieces what emerged when the dust had settled was not dressed in the height of fashion the bandages were brown and mouldering and dil noticed with professional concern already beginning to go at the elbows when it spoke it was like the opening of ancient caskets i woket up it said and theyre was noe light is thys the netherworld it would appear not said the queen thys is all hardly worth the trouble of dying was it said the queen the ancient king nodded but gently as though he was afraid his head would fall off somethyng he said must be done he turned to look at the great pyramid and pointed with what had once been an arm who slepes there he said its mine actually said teppicymon lurching forward i dont think weve met i havent been interred as yet my son built it for me it was against my better judgement believe me it ys a dretful thyng said the ancient king i felt its building even in the sleep of deathe i felt it it is big enough to interr the worlde i wanted to be buried at sea said teppicymon i hate pyramids you do not said ashkurmentep excuse me but i do said the king politely but you do not what you feel nowe is myld dislike when you have lain in one for a thousand yeares said the ancient one then you will begin to know the meaning of hate teppicymon shuddered the sea he said thats the place you just dissolve away they set off towards the next pyramid gern led the way his face a picture possibly one painted late at night by an artist who got his inspiration on prescription dil followed he held his chest high hed always hoped to make his way in the world and here he was now walking with kings well lurching with kings it was another nice day in the high desert it was always a nice day if by nice you meant an air temperature like an oven and sand you could roast chestnuts on you bastard ran fast mainly to keep his feet off the ground for as long as possible for a moment as they staggered up the hills outside the olivetreed fieldpatchworked oasis around ephebe teppic thought he saw the unnamed as a tiny speck on the azure sea but it might have been just a gleam on a wave then he was over the crest into a world of yellow and umber for a while scrubby trees held on against the sand but the sand won and marched triumphantly onwards dune after dune the desert was not only hot it was quiet there were no birds none of the susurration of organic creatures busily being alive at night there might have been the whine of insects but they were deep under the sand against the scorch of day and the yellow sky and yellow sand became an anechoic chamber in which you bastards breath sounded like a steamengine teppic had learned many things since he first went forth from the old kingdom and he was about to learn one more all authorities agree that when crossing the scorching desert it is a good idea to wear a hat you bastard settled into the shambling trot that a prime racing camel can keep up for hours after a couple of miles teppic saw a column of dust behind the next dune eventually they came up behind the main body of the ephebian army swinging along around halfadozen battle elephants their helmet plumes waving in the oven breeze they cheered on general principles as teppic went past battle elephants teppic groaned tsort went in for battle elephants too battle elephants were the fashion lately they werent much good for anything except trampling on their own troops when they inevitably panicked so the military minds on both sides had responded by breeding bigger elephants elephants were impressive for some reason many of these elephants were towing great carts full of timber he jogged onwards as the sun wound higher and and this was unusual blue and purple dots began to pinwheel gently across the horizon another strange thing was happening the camel seemed to be trotting across the sky perhaps this had something to do with the ringing noise in his ears should he stop but then the camel might fall off it was long past noon when you bastard staggered into the baking shade of the limestone outcrop which had once marked the edge of the valley and collapsed very slowly into the sand teppic rolled off a detachment of ephebians were staring across the narrow space towards a very similar number of tsorteans on the other side occasionally for the look of the thing one of them waved a spear when teppic opened his eyes it was to see the fearsome bronze masks of several ephebian soldiers peering down at him their metal mouths were locked in sneers of terrible disdain their shining eyebrows were twisted in mortal anger one of them said hes coming round sarge a metal face like the anger of the elements came closer filling teppics vision weve been out without our hat havent we sonny boy it said in a cheery voice that echoed oddly inside the metal in a hurry to get to grips with the enemy were we the sky wheeled around teppic but a thought bobbed into the frying pan of his mind seized control of his vocal chords and croaked the camel you ought to be put away treating it like that said the sergeant waggling a finger at him never seen one in such a state dont let it have a drink teppic sat bolt upright great gongs clanging and hot heavy fireworks going off inside his skull the helmeted heads turned towards one another gods he must have something really terrible against camels said one of them teppic staggered upright and lurched across the sand to you bastard who was trying to work out the complex equation which would allow him to get to his feet his tongue was hanging out and he was not feeling well a camel in distress isnt a shy creature it doesnt hang around in bars nursing a solitary drink it doesnt phone up old friends and sob at them it doesnt mope or write long soulful poems about life and how dreadful it is when seen from a bedsitter it doesnt know what angst is all a camel has got is a pair of industrialstrength lungs and a voice like a herd of donkeys being chainsawed teppic advanced through the blaring you bastard reared his head and turned it this way and that triangulating his eyes rolled madly as he did the camel trick of apparently looking at teppic with his nostrils he spat he tried to spit teppic grabbed his halter and pulled on it come on you bastard he said theres water you can smell it all you have to do is work out how to get there he turned to the assembled soldiers they were staring at him with expressions of amazement apart from those who hadnt removed their helmets and who were staring at him with expressions of metallic ferocity teppic snatched a water skin from one of them pulled out the stopper and tipped it on to the ground in front of the camels twitching nose theres a river here he hissed you know where it is all youve got to do is go there the soldiers looked around nervously so did several tsorteans who had wandered up to see what was going on you bastard got to his feet knees trembling and started to spin around in a circle teppic clung on let d equal thought you bastard desperately let ad equal let notd equal i need a stick shouted teppic as he was whirled past the sergeant they never understand anything unless you hit them with a stick its like punctuation to a camel is a sword any good no the sergeant hesitated and then passed teppic his spear he grabbed it pointend first fought for balance and then brought it smartly across the camels flank raising a cloud of dust and hair you bastard stopped his ears turned like radar aerials he stared at the rock wall rolling his eyes then as teppic grabbed a handful of hair and pulled himself up the camel started to trot think fractals ere youre going to run straight the sergeant began there was silence it went on for a long time the sergeant shifted uneasily then he looked across the rocks to the tsorteans and caught the eye of their leader with the unspoken understanding that is shared by centurions and sergeantmajors everywhere they walked towards one another along the length of the rocks and stopped by the barely visible crack in the cliff the tsortean sergeant ran his hand over it youd think thered be some you know camel hairs or something he said or blood said the ephebian i reckon its one of them unexplainable phenomena oh thats all right then the two men stared at the stone for a while like a mirage said the tsortean helpfully one of them things yes i thought i heard a seagull too daft isnt it you dont get them out here the tsortean coughed politely and stared back at his men then he leaned closer the rest of your people will be along directly i expect he said the ephebian stepped a bit closer and when he spoke it was out of the corner of his mouth while his eyes apparently remained fully occupied by looking at the rocks thats right he said and yours too may i ask yes i expect well have to massacre you if ours get here first likewise i shouldnt wonder still cant be helped one of those things really agreed the tsortean the other man nodded funny old world when you come to think about it youve put your finger on it all right the sergeant loosened his breastplate a bit glad to be out of the sun rations okay on your side he said oh you know mustnt grumble like us really cos if you do grumble they get even worse just like ours here you havent got any figs on your side have you i could just do with a fig sorry just thought id ask got plenty of dates if theyre any good to you were okay on dates thanks sorry the two men stood awhile lost in their own thoughts then the ephebian put on his helmet again and the tsortean adjusted his belt right then right then they squared their shoulders stuck out their chins and marched away a moment later they turned about smartly and exchanging the merest flicker of an embarrassed grin headed back to their own sides book iv the book of things a boy can do teppic had expected what possibly the splat of flesh hitting rock possibly although this was on the very edge of expectation the sight of the old kingdom spread out below him he hadnt expected chilly damp mists it is now known to science that there are many more dimensions than the classical four scientists say that these dont normally impinge on the world because the extra dimensions are very small and curve in on themselves and that since reality is fractal most of it is tucked inside itself this means either that the universe is more full of wonders than we can hope to understand or more probably that scientists make things up as they go along but the multiverse is full of little dimensionettes playstreets of creation where creatures of the imagination can romp without being knocked down by serious actuality sometimes as they drift through the holes in reality they impinge back on this universe when they give rise to myths legends and charges of being drunk and disorderly and it was into one of these that you bastard by a trivial miscalculation had trotted legend had got it nearly right the sphinx did lurk on the borders of the kingdom the legend just hadnt been precise about what kind of borders it was talking about the sphinx is an unreal creature it exists solely because it has been imagined it is wellknown that in an infinite universe everything that can be imagined must exist somewhere and since many of them are not things that ought to exist in a wellordered spacetime frame they get shoved into a side dimension this may go some way to explaining the sphinxs chronic bad temper although any creature created with the body of a lion bosom of a woman and wings of an eagle has a serious identity crisis and doesnt need much to make it angry so it had devised the riddle across various dimensions it had provided the sphinx with considerable entertainment and innumerable meals this was not known to teppic as he led you bastard through the swirling mists but the bones he crunched underfoot gave him enough essential detail a lot of people had died here and it was reasonable to assume that the more recent ones had seen the remains of the earlier ones and would therefore have proceeded stealthily and that hadnt worked no sense in creeping along then besides some of the rocks that loomed out of the mists had a very distressing shape this one here for example looked exactly like halt said the sphinx there was no sound but the drip of the mist and the occasional sucking noise of you bastard trying to extract moisture from the air youre a sphinx said teppic the sphinx corrected the sphinx gosh weve got any amount of statues to you at home teppic looked up and then further up i thought youd be smaller he added cower mortal said the sphinx for thou art in the presence of the wise and the terrible it blinked any good these statues they dont do you justice said teppic truthfully do you really think so people often get the nose wrong said the sphinx my right profile is best im told and it dawned on the sphinx that it was sidetracking itself it coughed sternly before you can pass me o mortal it said you must answer my riddle why said teppic what the sphinx blinked at him it hadnt been designed for this sort of thing why why because er because hang on yes because i will bite your head off if you dont yes i think thats it right said teppic lets hear it then the sphinx cleared its throat with a noise like an empty lorry reversing in a quarry what goes on four legs in the morning two legs at noon and three legs in the evening said the sphinx smugly teppic considered this thats a tough one he said eventually the toughest said the sphinx um youll never get it ah said teppic could you take your clothes off while youre thinking the threads play merry hell with my teeth there isnt some kind of animal that regrows legs that have been entirely the wrong track said the sphinx stretching its claws oh you havent got the faintest idea have you im still thinking said teppic youll never get it youre right teppic stared at the claws this isnt really a fighting animal he told himself reassuringly its definitely overendowed besides its bosom will get in the way even if its brain doesnt the answer is a man said the sphinx now dont put up a fight please it releases unpleasant chemicals into the bloodstream teppic backed away from a slashing paw hold on hold on he said what do you mean a man its easy said the sphinx a baby crawls in the morning stands on both legs at noon and at evening an old man walks with a stick good isnt it teppic bit his lip were talking about one day here he said doubtfully there was a long embarrassing silence its a wossname a figure of speech said the sphinx irritably making another lunge no no look wait a minute said teppic id like us to be very clear about this right i mean its only fair right nothing wrong with the riddle said the sphinx damn good riddle had that riddle for fifty years sphinx and cub it thought about this chick it corrected its a good riddle teppic said soothingly very deep very moving the whole human condition in a nutshell but youve got to admit this doesnt all happen to one individual in one day does it well no the sphinx admitted but that is selfevident from the context an element of dramatic analogy is present in all riddles it added with the air of one who had heard the phrase a long time ago and rather liked it although not to the extent of failing to eat the originator yes but said teppic crouching down and brushing a clear space on the damp sand is there internal consistency within the metaphor lets say for example that the average life expectancy is seventy years okay okay said the sphinx in the uncertain tones of someone who has let the salesman in and is now regretfully contemplating a future in which they are undoubtedly going to buy life insurance right good so noon would be age am i right now considering that most children can toddle at a year or so the four legs reference is really unsuitable wouldnt you agree i mean most of the morning is spent on two legs according to your analogy he paused and did a few calculations with a convenient thighbone only about twenty minutes immediately after hours half an hour tops is spent on four legs am i right be fair well said the sphinx by the same token you wouldnt be using a stick by six pm because youd be only er said teppic scribbling furiously in fact you wouldnt really be looking at any kind of walking aid until at least half past nine i think thats on the assumption that the entire lifespan takes place over one day which is i believe i have already pointed out ridiculous im sorry its basically okay but it doesnt work well said the sphinx but irritably this time i dont see what i can do about it i havent got any more its the only one ive ever needed you just need to alter it a bit thats all how do you mean just make it a bit more realistic hmm the sphinx scratched its mane with a claw okay it said doubtfully i suppose i could ask what is it that walks on four legs metaphorically speaking said teppic four legs metaphorically speaking the sphinx agreed for about twenty minutes i think we agreed okay fine twenty minutes in the morning on two legs but i think calling it in the morning is stretching it a bit said teppic its just after midnight i mean technically its the morning but in a very real sense its still last night what do you think a look of glazed panic crossed the sphinxs face what do you think it managed lets just see where weve got to shall we what metaphorically speaking walks on four legs just after midnight on two legs for most of the day barring accidents said the sphinx pathetically eager to show that it was making a contribution fine on two legs barring accidents until at least suppertime when it walks with three legs ive known people use two walking sticks said the sphinx helpfully okay how about when it continues to walk on two legs or with any prosthetic aids of its choice the sphinx gave this some consideration yeess it said gravely that seems to fit all eventualities well said teppic well what said the sphinx well whats the answer the sphinx gave him a stony look and then showed its fangs oh no it said you dont catch me out like that you think im stupid youve got to tell me the answer oh blow said teppic thought you had me there didnt you said the sphinx sorry you thought you could get me all confused did you the sphinx grinned it was worth a try said teppic cant blame you so whats the answer then teppic scratched his nose havent a clue he said unless and this is a shot in the dark you understand its a man the sphinx glared at him youve been here before havent you it said accusingly no then someones been talking right who could have talked has anyone ever guessed the riddle said teppic no well then they couldnt have talked could they the sphinxs claws scrabbled irritably on its rock i suppose youd better move along then it grumbled thank you said teppic id be grateful if you didnt tell anyone please added the sphinx coldly i wouldnt like to spoil it for other people teppic scrambled up a rock and on to you bastard dont you worry about that he said spurring the camel onwards he couldnt help noticing the way the sphinx was moving its lips silently as though trying to work something out you bastard had gone only twenty yards or so before an enraged bellow erupted behind him for once he forgot the etiquette that says a camel must be hit with a stick before it does anything all four feet hit the sand and pushed this time he got it right the priests were going irrational it wasnt that the gods were disobeying them the gods were ignoring them the gods always had it took great skill to persuade a djelibeybi god to obey you and the priests had to be fast on their toes for example if you pushed a rock off a cliff then a quick request to the gods that it should fall down was certain to be answered in the same way the gods ensured that the sun set and the stars came out any petition to the gods to see to it that palm trees grew with their roots in the ground and their leaves on top was certain to be graciously accepted on the whole any priest who cared about such things could ensure a high rate of success however it was one thing for the gods to ignore you when they were far off and invisible and quite another when they were strolling across the landscape it made you feel such a fool why dont they listen said the high priest of teg the horseheaded god of agriculture he was in tears teg had last been seen sitting in a field pulling up corn and giggling the other high priests were faring no better rituals hallowed by time had filled the air in the palace with sweet blue smoke and cooked enough assorted livestock to feed a famine but the gods were settling in the old kingdom as if they owned it and the people therein were no more than insects and the crowds were still outside religion had ruled in the old kingdom for the best part of seven thousand years behind the eyes of every priest present was a graphic image of what would happen if the people ever thought for one moment that it ruled no more and so dios said koomi we turn to you what would you have us do now dios sat on the steps of the throne and stared gloomily at the floor the gods didnt listen he knew that he knew that of all people but it had never mattered before you just went through the motions and came up with an answer it was the ritual that was important not the gods the gods were there to do the duties of a megaphone because who else would people listen to while he fought to think clearly his hands went through the motions of the ritual of the seventh hour guided by neural instructions as rigid and unchangeable as crystals you have tried everything he said everything that you advised o dios said koomi he waited until most of the priests were watching them and then in a rather louder voice continued if the king was here he would intercede for us he caught the eye of the priestess of sarduk he hadnt discussed things with her indeed what was there to discuss but he had an inkling that there was some fellow sorry feeling there she didnt like dios very much but was less in awe of him than were the others i told you that the king is dead said dios yes we heard you yet there seems to be no body o dios nevertheless we believe what you tell us for it is the great dios that speaks and we pay no heed to malicious gossip the priests were silent malicious gossip too and somebody had already mentioned rumours hadnt they definitely something amiss here it happened many times in the past said the priestess on cue when a kingdom was threatened or the river did not rise the king went to intercede with the gods was sent to intercede with the gods the edge of satisfaction in her voice made it clear that it was a oneway trip koomi shivered with delight and horror oh yes those were the days some countries had experimented with the idea of the sacrificial king long ago a few years of feasting and ruling then chop and make way for a new administration in a time of crisis possibly any highborn minister of state would suffice she went on dios looked up his face mirroring the agony of his tendons i see he said and who would be high priest then the gods would choose said koomi i daresay they would said dios sourly i am in some doubt as to the wisdom of their choice the dead can speak to the gods in the netherworld said the priestess but the gods are all here said dios fighting against the throbbing in his legs which were insisting that at this time they should be walking along the central corridor en route to supervise the rite of the under sky his body cried out for the solace over the river and once over the river never to return but hed always said that in the absence of the king the high priest performs his duties isnt that right dios said koomi it was it was written you couldnt rewrite it once it was written hed written it long ago dios hung his head this was worse than plumbing this was worse than anything and yet and yet to go across the river very well then he said i have one final request yes koomis voice had timbre now it was already a high priests voice i wish to be interred in the dios began and was cut off by a murmur from those priests who could look out across the river all eyes turned to the distant inky shore the legions of the kings of djelibeybi were on the march they lurched but they covered the ground quickly there were platoons battalions of them they didnt need gerns hammer any more its the pickle said the king as they watched halfadozen ancestors mummyhandle a seal out of its socket it toughens you up some of the more ancient were getting over enthusiastic and attacking the pyramids themselves actually managing to shift blocks higher than they were the king didnt blame them how terrible to be dead and know you were dead and locked away in the darkness theyre never going to get me in one of those things he vowed at last they came like a tide to yet another pyramid it was small low dark halfconcealed in drifted sands and the blocks were hardly even masonry they were no more than roughly squared boulders it had clearly been built long before the kingdom got the hang of pyramids it was barely more than a pile hacked into the doorseal angular and deep were the hieroglyphs of the kingdom khuft had me made the first several ancestors clustered around it oh dear said the king this might be going too far the first whispered dil the first into the kingdom noone here before but hippos and crocodiles from inside that pyramid seventy centuries look out at us older than anything yes yes all right said teppicymon no need to get carried away he was a man just like all of us andkhuftthecamelherderlookeduponthevalley dil began after seven thousand yeares he wyll be wantyng to look upon yt again said ashkurmentep bluntly even so said the king it does seem a bit the dead are equal said ashkurmentep you younge manne calle hym forth who me said gern but he was the fir yes weve been through all that said teppicymon do it everyones getting impatient so is he i expect gern rolled his eyes and hefted the hammer just as it was about to hiss down on the seal dil darted forward causing gern to dance wildly across the ground in a groinstraining effort to avoid interring the hammer in his masters head its open said dil look the seal just swings aside youe meane he iss oute teppicymon tottered forward and grabbed the door of the pyramid it moved quite easily then he examined the stone beneath it derelict and halfcovered though it was someone had taken care to keep a pathway clear to the pyramid and the stone was quite worn away as by the passage of many feet this was not by the nature of things the normal state of affairs for a pyramid the whole point was that once you were in you were in the mummies examined the worn entrance and creaked at one another in surprise one of the very ancient ones who was barely holding himself together made a noise like deathwatch beetle finally conquering a rotten tree whatd he say said teppicymon the mummy of ashkurmentep translated he saide yt ys spooky he croaked the late king nodded im going in to have a look you two live ones you come with me dils face fell oh come on man snapped teppicymon forcing the door back look im not frightened show a bit of backbone everyone else is but well need some light protested dil the nearest mummies lurched back sharply as gern timidly took a tinderbox out of his pocket well need something to burn said dil the mummies shuffled further back muttering theres torches in here said teppicymon his voice slightly muffled and you can keep them away from me lad it was a small pyramid mazeless without traps just a stone passage leading upwards tremulously expecting at any moment to see unnamed terrors leap out at them the embalmers followed the king into a small square chamber that smelled of sand the roof was black with soot there was no sarcophagus within no mummy case no terror named or nameless the centre of the floor was occupied by a raised block with a blanket and a pillow on it neither of them looked particularly old it was almost disappointing gern craned to look around quite nice really he said comfy no said dil hey master king look here said gern trotting over to one of the walls look someones been scratching things look all little lines all over the wall and this wall said the king and the floor someones been counting every ten have been crossed through you see someones been counting things lots of things he stood back what things said dil looking behind him very strange said the king he leaned forward you can barely make out the inscriptions underneath can you read it king said gern showing what dil considered to be unnecessary enthusiasm no its one of the really ancient dialects cant make out a blessed hieroglyph said teppicymon i shouldnt think theres a single person alive today who can read it thats a shame said gern true enough said the king and sighed they stood in gloomy silence so perhaps we could ask one of the dead ones said gern er gern said dil backing away the king slapped the apprentice on the back pitching him forward damn clever idea he said well just go and get one of the real early ancestors oh he sagged thats no good noone will be able to understand them gern said dil his eyes growing wider no its all right king said gern enjoying the newfound freedom of thought because the reason being everyone understands someone all we have to do is sort them out bright lad bright lad said the king gern they both looked at him in astonishment you all right master said gern youve gone all white the t stuttered dil rigid with terror the what master the t look at the t he ought to have a lie down said the king i know his sort the artistic type highly strung dil took a deep breath look at the sodding torch gern he shouted they looked without any fuss turning its black ashes into dry straw the torch was burning backwards the old kingdom lay stretched out before teppic and it was unreal he looked at you bastard who had stuck his muzzle in a wayside spring and was making a noise like the last drop in the milkshake glass you bastard looked real enough theres nothing like a camel for looking really solid but the landscape had an uncertain quality as if it hadnt quite made up its mind to be there or not except for the great pyramid it squatted in the middle distance as real as the pin that nails a butterfly to a board it was contriving to look extremely solid as though it was sucking all the solidity out of the landscape into itself well he was here wherever here was how did you kill a pyramid and what would happen if you did he was working on the hypothesis that everything would snap back into place into the old kingdoms pool of recirculated time he watched the gods for a while wondering what the hell they were and how it didnt seem to matter they looked no more real than the land over which they strode about incomprehensible errands of their own the world was no more than a dream teppic felt incapable of surprise if seven fat cows had wandered by he wouldnt have given them a second glance he remounted you bastard and rode him sloshing gently down the road the fields on either side had a devastated look the sun was finally sinking the gods of night and evening were prevailing over the daylight gods but it had been a long struggle and when you thought about all the things that would happen to it now eaten by goddesses carried on boats under the world and so on it was an oddson chance that it wouldnt be seen again noone was visible as he rode into the stable yard you bastard padded sedately to his stall and pulled delicately at a wisp of hay hed thought of something interesting about bivariant distributions teppic patted him on the flank raising another cloud and walked up the wide steps that led to the palace proper still there were no guards no servants no living soul he slipped into his own palace like a thief in the day and found his way to dils workshop it was empty and looked as though a robber with very peculiar tastes had recently been at work in there the throne room smelled like a kitchen and by the looks of it the cooks had fled in a hurry the gold mask of the kings of djelibeybi slightly buckled out of shape had rolled into a corner he picked it up and on a suspicion scratched it with one of his knives the gold peeled away exposing a silvergrey gleam hed suspected that there simply wasnt that much gold around the mask felt as heavy as lead because well it was lead he wondered if it had ever been all gold and which ancestor had done it and how many pyramids it had paid for it was probably very symbolic of something or other perhaps not even symbolic of anything just symbolic all by itself one of the sacred cats was hiding under the throne it flattened its ears and spat at teppic as he reached down to pat it that much hadnt changed at least still no people he padded across to the balcony and there the people were a great silent mass staring across the river in the fading leaden light as teppic watched a flotilla of boats and ferries set out from the near bank we ought to have been building bridges he thought but we said that would be shackling the river he dropped lightly over the balustrade on to the packed earth and walked down to the crowd and the full force of its belief scythed into him the people of djelibeybi might have had conflicting ideas about their gods but their belief in their kings had been unswerving for thousands of years to teppic it was like walking into a vat of alcohol he felt it pouring into him until his fingertips crackled rising up through his body until it gushed into his brain bringing not omnipotence but the feeling of omnipotence the very strong sensation that while he didnt actually know everything he would do soon and had done once it had been like this back in ankh when the divinity had hooked him but that had been just a flicker now it had the solid power of real belief behind it he looked down at a rustling below him and saw green shoots springing out of the dry sand around his feet bloody hell he thought i really am a god this could be very embarrassing he shouldered his way through the press of people until he reached the riverbank and stood there in a thickening clump of corn as the crowd caught on those nearest fell to their knees and a circle of reverentially collapsing people spread out from teppic like ripples but i never wanted this i just wanted to help people live more happily with plumbing i wanted something done about rundown innercity areas i just wanted to put them at their ease and ask them how they enjoyed their lives i thought schools might be a good idea so they wouldnt fall down and worship someone just because hes got green feet and i wanted to do something about the architecture as the light drained from the sky like steel going cold the pyramid was somehow even bigger than before if you had to design something to give the very distinct impression of mass the pyramid was it there was a crowd of figures around it unidentifiable in the grey light teppic looked around the prostrate crowd until he saw someone in the uniform of the palace guard you man on your feet he commanded the man gave him a look of dread but did stagger sheepishly upright whats going on here o king who is the lord of i dont think we have time said teppic i know who i am i want to know whats happening o king we saw the dead walking the priests have gone to talk to them the dead walking yes o king were talking about notalive people here are we yes o king oh well thank you that was very succinct not informative but succinct are there any boats around the priests took them all o king teppic could see that this was true the jetties near the palace were usually thronged with boats and now they were all empty as he stared at the water it grew two eyes and a long snout to remind him that swimming the djel was as feasible as nailing fog to the wall he stared at the crowd every person was watching him expectantly convinced that he would know what to do next he turned back to the river extended his hands in front of him pressed them together and then opened them gently there was a damp sucking noise and the waters of the djel parted in front of him there was a sigh from the crowd but their astonishment was nothing to the surprise of a dozen or so crocodiles who were left trying to swim in ten feet of air teppic ran down the bank and over the heavy mud dodging to avoid the tails that slashed wildly at him as the reptiles dropped heavily on to the riverbed the djel loomed up as two khaki walls so that he was running along a damp and shadowy alley here and there were fragments of bones old shields bits of spear the ribs of boats he leapt and jinked around the debris of centuries ahead of him a big bull crocodile propelled itself dreamily out of the wall of water flailed madly in midair and flopped into the ooze teppic trod heavily on its snout and plunged on behind him a few of the quicker citizens seeing the dazed creatures below them began to look for stones the crocodiles had been undisputed masters of the river since primordial times but if it was possible to do a little catchingup in the space of a few minutes it was certainly worth a try the sound of the monsters of the river beginning the long journey to handbaghood broke out behind teppic as he sloshed up the far bank a line of ancestors stretched across the chamber down the dark passageway and out into the sand it was filled with whispers going in both directions a dry sound like the wind blowing through old paper dil lay on the sand with gern flapping a cloth in his face wha they doing he murmured reading the inscription said gern you ought to see it master the one doing the reading hes practically a yes yes all right said dil struggling up hes more than six thousand years old and his grandsons listening to him and telling his grandson and hes telling his gra yes yes all and khufttoosaiduntothefirst whatmaywegiveuntoyou whohastaughtustherightways said teppicymon who was at the end of the line andthefirstspake andthishespake buildformeapyramid thatimayrest andbuilditofthesedimensions thatitbeproper andthusitwasdone andthenameofthefirstwas but there was no name it was just a babble of raised voices arguments ancient cursewords spreading along the line of desiccated ancestors like a spark along a powder trail until it reached teppicymon who exploded the ephebian sergeant quietly perspiring in the shade saw what he had been half expecting and wholly dreading there was a column of dust on the opposite horizon the tsorteans main force was getting there first he stood up nodded professionally to his counterpart across the way and looked at the double handful of men under his command i need a messenger to take er a message back to the city he said a forest of hands shot up the sergeant sighed and selected young autocue who he knew was missing his mum run like the wind he said although i expect you wont need telling will you and then and then he stood with his lips moving silently while the sun scoured the rocks of the hot narrow pass and a few insects buzzed in the scrub bushes his education hadnt included a course in famous last words he raised his eyes in the direction of home go tell the ephebians he began the soldiers waited what said autocue after a while go and tell them what the sergeant relaxed like air being let out of a balloon go and tell them what kept you he said on the near horizon another column of dust was advancing this was more like it if there was going to be a massacre then it ought to be shared by both sides the city of the dead lay before teppic after ankhmorpork which was almost its direct opposite it was probably the biggest city on the disc its streets were the finest its architecture the most majestic and aweinspiring in population terms the necropolis outstripped the other cities of the old kingdom but its people didnt get out much and there was nothing to do on saturday nights until now now it thronged teppic watched from the top of a windetched obelisk as the grey and brown and here and there somewhat greenish armies of the departed passed beneath him the kings had been democratic after the pyramids had been emptied gangs of them had turned their attention to the lesser tombs and now the necropolis really did have its tradesmen its nobles and even its artisans not that there was by and large any way of telling the difference they were to a corpse heading for the great pyramid it loomed like a carbuncle over the lesser older buildings and they all seemed very angry about something teppic dropped lightly on to the wide flat roof of a mastaba jogged to its far end cleared the gap on to an ornamental sphinx not without a moments worry but this one seemed inert enough and from there it was but the throw of a grapnel to one of the lower storeys of a step pyramid the long light of the contentious sun lanced across the spent landscape as he leapt from monument to monument zigzagging high above the shuffling army behind him shoots appeared briefly in the ancient stone cracking it a little and then withered and died this said his blood as it tingled around his body is what you trained for even mericet couldnt mark you down for this speeding in the shadows above a silent city running like a cat finding handholds that would have perplexed a gecko and at the destination a victim true it was a billion tons of pyramid and hitherto the largest client of an inhumation had been patricio the stone despot of quirm a monumental needle recording in basrelief the achievements of a king four thousand years ago and which would have been more pertinent if the winddriven sand hadnt long ago eroded his name provided a handy ladder which needed only an expertly thrown grapnel from its top lodging in the outstretched fingers of a forgotten monarch to allow him a long gentle arc on to the roof of a tomb running climbing and swinging hastily hammering crampons in the memorials of the dead teppic went forth pinpoints of firelight among the limestone pricked out the lines of the opposing armies deep and stylised though the enmity was between the two empires they both abided by the ancient tradition that warfare wasnt undertaken at night during harvest or when wet it was important enough to save up for special occasions going at it hammer and tongs just reduced the whole thing to a farce in the twilight on both sides of the line came the busy sound of advanced woodwork in progress its said that generals are always ready to fight the last war over again it had been thousands of years since the last war between tsort and ephebe but generals have long memories and this time they were ready for it on both sides of the line wooden horses were taking shape its gone said ptaclusp iib slithering back down the pile of rubble about time too said his father help me fold up your brother youre sure it wont hurt him well if we do it carefully he cant move in time that is width to us so if no time can pass for him nothing can hurt him ptaclusp thought of the old days when pyramid building had simply consisted of piling one block on another and all you needed to remember was that you put less on top as you went up and now it meant trying to put a crease in one of your sons right he said doubtfully lets be off then he inched his way up the debris and poked his head over the top just as the vanguard of the dead came round the corner of the nearest minor pyramid his first thought was this is it theyre coming to complain hed done his best it wasnt always easy to build to a budget maybe not every lintel was exactly as per drawings perhaps the quality of the internal plasterwork wasnt always up to snuff but they cant all be complaining not this many of them ptaclusp iib climbed up alongside him his mouth dropped open where are they all coming from he said youre the expert you tell me are they dead ptaclusp scrutinised some of the approaching marchers if theyre not some of them are awfully ill he said lets make a run for it where to up the pyramid the great pyramid loomed up behind them its throbbing filling the air ptaclusp stared at it whats going to happen tonight he said what well is it going to do whatever it did again iib stared at him dunno can you find out only by waiting im not even sure what its done now are we going to like it i shouldnt think so dad oh dear whats up now look over there heading towards the marching dead trailing behind koomi like a tail behind a comet were the priests it was hot and dark inside the horse it was also very crowded they waited sweating young autocue stuttered whatll happen now sergeant the sergeant moved a foot tentatively the atmosphere would have induced claustrophobia in a sardine well lad theyll find us see and be so impressed theyll drag us all the way back to their city and then when its dark well leap out and put them to the sword or put the sword to them one or the other and then well sack the city bum the walls and sow the ground with salt you remember lad i showed you on friday oh moisture dripped from a score of brows several of the men were trying to compose a letter home dragging styli across wax that was close to melting and then what will happen sergeant why lad then well go home heroes oh the older soldiers sat stolidly looking at the wooden walls autocue shifted uneasily still worried about something my mum said to come back with my shield or on it sergeant he said jolly good lad thats the spirit we will be all right though wont we sergeant the sergeant stared into the fetid darkness after a while someone started to play the harmonica ptaclusp halfturned his head from the scene and a voice by his ear said youre the pyramid builder arent you another figure had joined them in their bolthole one who was blackclad and moved in a way that made a cats tread sound like a oneman band ptaclusp nodded unable to speak he had had enough shocks for one day well switch it off switch it off now iib leaned over whore you he said my name is teppic what like the king yes just like the king now turn it off its a pyramid you cant turn off pyramids said iib well then make it flare we tried that last night iib pointed to the shattered capstone unroll twoay dad teppic regarded the flat brother its some sort of wall poster is it he said eventually iib looked down teppic saw the movement and looked down also he was ankledeep in green sprouts sorry he said i cant seem to shake it off it can be dreadful said iib frantically i know how it is i had this verruca once nothing would shift it teppic hunkered down by the cracked stone this thing he said whats the significance i mean its coated with metal why theres got to be a sharp point for the flare said iib is that all this is gold isnt it its electrum gold and silver alloy the capstone has got to be made of electrum teppic peeled back the foil this isnt all metal he said mildly yes well said ptaclusp we found er that foil works just as well couldnt you use something cheaper like steel ptaclusp sneered it hadnt been a good day sanity was a distant memory but there were certain facts he knew for a fact wouldnt last for more than a year or two he said what with the dew and so forth youd lose the point wouldnt last more than two or three hundred times teppic leaned his head against the pyramid it was cold and it hummed he thought he could hear under the throbbing a faint rising tone the pyramid towered over him iib could have told him that this was because the walls sloped in at precisely degrees and an effect known as battering made the pyramid loom even higher than it really was he probably would have used words like perspective and virtual height as well the black marble was glassy smooth the masons had done well the cracks between each silky panel were hardly wide enough to insert a knife but wide enough all the same how about once he said koomi chewed his fingernails distractedly fire he said thatd stop them theyre very inflammable or water theyd probably dissolve some of them were destroying pyramids said the high priest of juf the cobraheaded god of papyrus people always come back from the dead in such a bad temper said another priest koomi watched the approaching army in mounting bewilderment wheres dios he said the old high priest was pushed to the front of the crowd what shall i say to them koomi demanded it would be wrong to say that dios smiled it wasnt an action he often felt called upon to perform but his mouth creased at the edges and his eyes went halfhooded you could tell them he said that new times demand new men you could tell them that it is time to make way for younger people with fresh ideas you could tell them that they are outmoded you could tell them all that theyll kill me would they be that anxious for your eternal company i wonder youre still high priest why dont you talk to them said dios dont forget to tell them that they are to be dragged kicking and screaming into the century of the cobra he handed koomi the staff or whatever this century is called he added koomi felt the eyes of the assembled brethren and sistren upon him he cleared his throat adjusted his robe and turned to face the mummies they were chanting something one word over and over again he couldnt quite make it out but it seemed to have worked them up into a rage he raised the staff and the carved wooden snakes looked unusually alive in the flat light the gods of the disc and here is meant the great consensus gods who really do exist in dunmanifestin their semidetached valhalla on the worlds impossibly high central mountain where they pass the time observing the petty antics of mortal men and organising petitions about how the influx of the ice giants has lowered property values in the celestial regions the gods of disc have always been fascinated by humanitys incredible ability to say exactly the wrong thing at the wrong time theyre not talking here of such easy errors as its perfectly safe or the ones that growl a lot dont bite but of simple little sentences which are injected into difficult situations with the same general effect as a steel bar dropped into the bearings of a rpm megawatt steam turbine and connoisseurs of mankinds tendency to put his pedal extremity where his tongue should be are agreed that when the judges envelopes are opened then hoot koomis fine performance in begone from this place foul shades will be a contender for alltime bloody stupid greeting the front row of ancestors halted and were pushed forward a little by the press of those behind king teppicymon xxvii who by common consent among the other twentysix teppicymons was spokesman lurched on alone and picked up the trembling koomi by his arms what did you say he said koomis eyes rolled his mouth opened and shut but his voice wisely decided not to come out teppicymon pushed his bandaged face close to the priests pointed nose i remember you he growled ive seen you oiling around the place a bad hat if ever i saw one i remember thinking that he glared around at the others youre all priests arent you come to say sorry have you wheres dios the ancestors pressed forward muttering when youve been dead for hundreds of years youre not inclined to feel generous to those people who assured you that you were going to have a lovely time there was a scuffle in the middle of the crowd as king psamnutkha who had spent five thousand years with nothing to look at but the inside of a lid was restrained by younger colleagues teppicymon switched his attention back to koomi who hadnt gone anywhere foul shades was it he said er said koomi put him down dios gently took the staff from koomis unresisting fingers and said i am dios the high priest why are you here it was a perfectly calm and reasonable voice with overtones of concerned but indubitable authority it was a tone of voice the pharaohs of djelibeybi had heard for thousands of years a voice which had regulated the days prescribed the rituals cut the time into carefullyturned segments interpreted the ways of gods to men it was the sound of authority which stirred antique memories among the ancestors and caused them to look embarrassed and shuffle their feet one of the younger pharaohs lurched forward you bastard he croaked you laid us out and shut us away one by one and you went on people thought the name was passed on but it was always you how old are you dios there was no sound noone moved a breeze stirred the dust a little dios sighed i did not mean to he said there was so much to do there were never enough hours in the day truly i did not realise what was happening i thought it was refreshing nothing more i suspected nothing i noted the passing of the rituals not the years come from a longlived family do you said teppicymon sarcastically dios stared at him his lips moving family he said at last his voice softened from its normal bark family yes i must have had a family mustnt i but you know i cant remember memory is the first thing that goes the pyramids dont seem to preserve it strangely this is dios the footnotekeeper of history said teppicymon ah the high priest smiled memory goes from the head but it is all around me every scroll and book thats the history of the kingdom man yes my memory the king relaxed a little sheer horrified fascination was unravelling the knot of fury how old are you he said i think seven thousand years but sometimes it seems much longer really seven thousand years yes said dios how could any man stand it said the king dios shrugged seven thousand years is just one day at a time he said slowly with the occasional wince he got down on one knee and held up his staff in shaking hands o kings he said i have always existed only to serve there was a long extremely embarrassed pause we will destroy the pyramids said farreptah pushing forward you will destroy the kingdom said dios i cannot allow it you cannot allow it yes what will we be without the pyramids said dios speaking for the dead said farreptah we will be free but the kingdom will be just another small country said dios and to their horror the ancestors saw tears in his eyes all that we hold dear you will cast adrift in time uncertain without guidance changeable then it can take its chances said teppicymon stand aside dios dios held up his staff the snake around it uncoiled and hissed at the king be still said dios dark lightning crackled between the ancestors dios stared at the staff in astonishment it had never done this before but seven thousand years of his priests had believed in their hearts that the staff of dios could rule this world and the next in the sudden silence there was the faint chink high up of a knife being wedged between two black marble slabs the pyramid pulsed under teppic and the marble was as slippery as ice the inward slope wasnt the help he had expected the thing he told himself is not to look up or down but straight ahead into the marble parcelling the impossible height into manageable sections just like time thats how we survive infinity we kill it by breaking it up into small bits he was aware of shouts below him and glanced briefly over his shoulder he was barely a third of the way up but he could see the crowds across the river a grey mass speckled with the pale blobs of upturned faces closer to the pale army of the dead facing the small grey group of priests with dios in front of them there was some sort of argument going on the sun was on the horizon he reached up located the next crack found a handhold dios spotted ptaclusps head peering over the debris and sent a couple of priests to bring him back iib followed his carefully folded brother under his arm what is the boy doing dios demanded o dios he said he was going to flare off the pyramid said ptaclusp how can he do that o lord he says he is going to cap it off before the sun sets is it possible dios demanded turning to the architect iib hesitated it may be he said and what will happen will we return to the world outside well it depends on whether the dimensional effect ratchets as it were and is stable in each state or if on the contrary the pyramid is acting as a piece of rubber under tension his voice stuttered to a halt under the intensity of dioss stare i dont know he admitted back to the world outside said dios not our world our world is the valley ours is a world of order men need order he raised his staff thats my son shouted teppicymon dont you dare try anything thats the king the ranks of ancestors swayed but couldnt break the spell er dios said koomi dios turned his eyebrows raised you spoke he said er if it is the king er i that is we think perhaps you should let him get on with it er dont you think that would be a really good idea dioss staff kicked and the priests felt the cold bands of restraint freeze their limbs i gave my life for the kingdom said the high priest i gave it over and over again everything it is i created i cannot fail it now and then he saw the gods teppic eased himself up another couple of feet and then gently reached down to pull a knife out of the marble it wasnt going to work though knife climbing was for those short and awkward passages and frowned on anyway because it suggested youd chosen a wrong route it wasnt for this sort of thing unless you had unlimited knives he glanced over his shoulder again as strange barred shadows flickered across the face of the pyramid from out of the sunset where they had been engaged in their eternal squabbling the gods were returning they staggered and lurched across the fields and reed beds heading for the pyramid nearbrainless though they were they understood what it was perhaps they even understood what teppic was trying to do their assorted animal faces made it hard to be certain but it looked as though they were very angry are you going to control them dios said the king are you going to tell them that the world should be changeless dios stared up at the creatures jostling one another as they waded the river there were too many teeth too many lolling tongues the bits of them that were human were sloughing away a lionheaded god of justice put dios recalled the name was using its scales as a flail to beat one of the river gods chefet the dogheaded god of metalwork was growling and attacking his fellows at random with his hammer this was chefet dios thought the god that he had created to be an example to men in the art of wire and filigree and small beauty yet it had worked hed taken a desert rabble and shown them all he could remember of the arts of civilisation and the secrets of the pyramids hed needed gods then the trouble with gods is that after enough people start believing in them they begin to exist and what begins to exist isnt what was originally intended chefet chefet thought dios maker of rings weaver of metal now hes out of our heads and see how his nails grow into claws this is not how i imagined him stop he instructed i order you to stop you will obey me i made you they also lack gratitude king teppicymon felt the power around him weaken as dios turned all his attention to ecclesiastical matters he saw the tiny shape halfway up the wall of the pyramid saw it falter the rest of the ancestors saw it too and as one corpse they knew what to do dios could wait this was family teppic heard the snap of the handle under his foot slid a little and hung by one hand hed got another knife in above him but no no good he hadnt got the reach for practical purposes his arms felt like short lengths of wet rope now if he spreadeagled himself as he slid he might be able to slow enough he looked down and saw the climbers coming towards him in a tide that was tumbling upwards the ancestors rose up the face of the pyramid silently like creepers each new row settling into position on the shoulders of the generation beneath while the younger ones climbed on over them bony hands grabbed teppic as the wave of edificeers broke around him and he was halfpushed halfpulled up the sloping wall voices like the creak of sarcophagi filled his ears moaning encouragement well done boy groaned a crumbling mummy hauling him bodily on to its shoulder you remind me of me when i was alive to you son got him said the corpse above lifting teppic easily on one outstretched arm thats a fine family spirit lad best wishes from your greatgreatgreatgreat uncle although i dont suppose you remember me coming up other ancestors were climbing on past teppic as he rose from hand to hand ancient fingers with a grip like steel clutched at him hoisting him onwards the pyramid grew narrower down below ptaclusp watched thoughtfully what a workforce he said i mean the ones at the bottom are supporting the whole weight dad said iib i think wed better run those gods are getting closer do you think we could employ them said ptaclusp ignoring him theyre dead they probably wont want high wages and dad sort of selfbuild you said no more pyramids dad never again you said now come on teppic scrambled to the top of the pyramid supported by the last two ancestors one of them was his father i dont think youve met your greatgrandma he said indicating the shorter bandaged figure who nodded gently at teppic he opened his mouth theres no time she said youre doing fine he glanced at the sun which old professional that it was chose that moment to drop below the horizon the gods had crossed the river their progress slowed only by their tendency to push and shove among themselves and were lurching through the buildings of the necropolis several were clustered around the spot where dios had been the ancestors dropped away sliding back down the pyramid as fast as they had climbed it leaving teppic alone on a few square feet of rock a couple of stars came out he saw white shapes below as the ancestors hurried away on some private errand of their own lurching at a surprising speed towards the broad band of the river the gods abandoned their interest in dios this strange little human with the stick and the cracked voice the nearest god a crocodileheaded thing jerked on to the plaza before the pyramid squinted up at teppic and reached out towards him teppic fumbled for a knife wondering what sort was appropriate for gods and along the djel the pyramids began to flare their meagre store of hoarded time priests and ancestors fled as the ground began to shake even the gods looked bewildered iib snatched his fathers arm and dragged him away come on he yelled into his ear we cant be around here when it goes off otherwise youll be put to bed on a coathanger around them several other pyramids struck their flares thin and reedy affairs that were barely visible in the afterglow dad i said weve got to go ptaclusp was dragged backwards across the flagstones still staring at the hulking outline of the great pyramid theres someone still there look he said and pointed to a figure alone on the plaza iib peered into the gloom its only dios the high priest he said i expect hes got some plan in mind best not to meddle in the affairs of priests now will you come on the crocodileheaded god turned its snout back and forth trying to focus on teppic without the advantage of binocular vision this close its body was slightly transparent as though someone had sketched in all the lines and got bored before it was time to do the shading it trod on a small tomb crushing it to powder a hand like a cluster of canoes with claws on hovered over teppic the pyramid trembled and the stone under his feet felt warm but it resolutely forbore from any signs of wanting to flare the hand descended teppic sank on one knee and out of desperation raised the knife over his head in both hands the light glinted for a moment off the tip of the blade and then the great pyramid flared it did it in absolute silence to begin with sending up a spire of eyetorturing flame that turned the whole kingdom into a crisscross of black shadow and white light a flame that might have turned any watchers not just into a pillar of salt but into a complete condiment set of their choice it exploded like an unwound dandelion silent as starlight searing as a supernova only after it had been bathing the necropolis in its impossible brilliance for several seconds did the sound come and it was sound that winds itself up through the bones creeps into every cell of the body and tries with some success to turn them inside out it was too loud to be called noise there is sound so loud that it prevents itself from being heard and this was that kind of sound eventually it condescended to drop out of the cosmic scale and became simply the loudest noise anyone hearing it had ever experienced the noise stopped filling the air with the dark metallic clang of sudden silence the light went out lancing the night with blue and purple afterimages it was not the silence and darkness of conclusion but of pause like the moment of equilibrium when a thrown ball runs out of acceleration but has yet to have gravity drawn to its attention and for a brief moment thinks that the worst is over this time it was heralded by a shrill whistling out of the clear sky and a swirl in the air that became a glow became a flame became a flare that sizzled downwards into the pyramid punching into the mass of black marble fingers of lightning crackled out and grounded on the lesser tombs around it so that serpents of white fire burned their way from pyramid to pyramid across the necropolis and the air filled with the stink of burning stone in the middle of the firestorm the great pyramid appeared to lift up a few inches on a beam of incandescence and turn through ninety degrees this was almost certainly the special type of optical illusion which can take place even though noone is actually looking at it and then with deceptive slowness and considerable dignity it exploded it was almost too crass a word what it did was this it came apart ponderously into buildingsized chunks which drifted gently away from one another flying serenely out and over the necropolis several of them struck other pyramids badly damaging them in a lazy unselfconscious way and then bounded on in silence until they ploughed to a halt behind a small mountain of rubble only then did the boom come it went on for quite along time grey dust rolled over the kingdom ptaclusp dragged himself upright and groped ahead gingerly until he walked into someone he shuddered when he thought about the kind of people hed seen walking around lately but thought didnt come easily because something appeared to have hit him on the head recently is that you lad he ventured is that you dad yes said ptaclusp its me dad im glad its you son can you see anything no its all mist and fog thank the gods for that i thought it was me it is you isnt it you said yes dad is your brother all right ive got him safe in my pocket dad good so long as nothings happened to him they inched forward clambering over lumps of masonry they could barely see something exploded dad said iib slowly i think it was the pyramid ptaclusp rubbed the top of his head where two tons of flying rock had come within a sixteenth of an inch of fitting him for one of his own pyramids it was that dodgy cement we bought from merco the ephebian i expect i think this was a bit worse than a moody lintel dad said iib in fact i think it was a lot worse it looked a bit wossname a bit on the sandy side i think you should find somewhere to sit down dad said iib as kindly as possible heres twoay hang on to him he crept on alone climbing over a slab of what felt very suspiciously like black marble what he wanted he decided was a priest they had to be useful for something and this seemed the sort of time one might need one for solace or possibly he felt obscurely to beat their head in with a rock what he found instead was someone on their hands and knees coughing iib helped him it was definitely a him hed been briefly afraid it might be an it and sat him on another lump of yes almost certainly marble are you a priest he said fumbling in the rubble im dil chief embalmer the figure muttered ptaclusp iib paracosmic archi iib began and then suspecting that architects were not going to be too popular around here for a while quickly corrected himself im an engineer he said are you all right dont know what happened i think the pyramid exploded iib volunteered are we dead i shouldnt think so youre walking and talking after all dil shivered thats no guideline take it from me whats an engineer oh a builder of aqueducts said iib quickly theyre the coming thing you know dil stood up a little shakily i he said need a drink lets find the river they found teppic first he was clinging to a small truncated pyramid section that had made a moderatesized crater when it landed i know him said iib hes the lad who was on top of the pyramid thats ridiculous how could he survive that whys there all corn sprouting out of it too wondered dil i mean perhaps theres some kind of effect if youre right in the centre of the flare or something said iib thinking aloud a sort of calm area or something like in the middle of a whirlpool he reached instinctively for his wax tablet and then stopped himself man was never intended to understand things he meddled with is he dead he said dont look at me said dil stepping back hed been running through his mind the alternative occupations now open to him upholstery sounded attractive at least chairs didnt get up and walk after youd stuffed them iib bent over the body look what hes got in his hand he said gently bending back the fingers its a piece of melted metal whats he got that for teppic dreamed he saw seven fat cows and seven thin cows and one of them was riding a bicycle he saw some camels singing and the song straightened out the wrinkles in reality he saw a finger write on the wall of a pyramid going forth is easy going back requires he walked around the pyramid where the finger continued an effort of will because it is much harder thank you teppic considered this and it occurred to him that there was one thing left to do which he had not done hed never known how to before but now he could see that it was just numbers arranged in a special way everything that was magical was just a way of describing the world in words it couldnt ignore he gave a grunt of effort there was a brief moment of speed dil and iib looked around as long shafts of light sparkled through the mists and dust turning the landscape into old gold and the sun came up the sergeant cautiously opened the hatch in the horses belly when the expected flurry of spears did not materialise he ordered autocue to let out the rope ladder climbed down it and looked across the chill morning desert the new recruit followed him down and stood hopping from one sandal to another on sand that was nearly freezing now and would be frying by lunchtime there said the sergeant pointing see the tsortean lines lad looks like a row of wooden horses to me sergeant said autocue the one on the ends on rockers thatll be the officers huh those tsorteans must think were simple the sergeant stamped some life into his legs took a few breaths of fresh air and walked back to the ladder come on lad he said whyve we got to go back up there the sergeant paused his foot on a rope rung use some common laddie theyre not going to come and take our horses if they see us hanging around outside are they stands to reason you sure theyre going to come then said autocue the sergeant frowned at him look soldier he said anyone bloody stupid enough to think were going to drag a lot of horses full of soldiers back to our city is certainly daft enough to drag ours all the way back to theirs qed qed sarge it means get back up the bloody ladder lad autocue saluted permission to be excused first sarge excused what excused sarge said autocue a shade desperately i mean its a bit cramped in the horse sarge if you know what i mean youre going to have to learn a bit of will power if you want to stay in the horse soldiers boy you know that yes sarge said autocue miserably youve got one minute thanks sarge when the hatch closed above him autocue sidled over to one of the horses massive legs and put it to a use for which it wasnt originally intended and it was while he was staring vaguely ahead lost in that zenlike contemplation which occurs at moments like this that there was a faint pop in the air and an entire river valley opened up in front of him its not the sort of thing that ought to happen to a thoughtful lad especially one who has to wash his own uniform a breeze from the sea blew into the kingdom hinting at no positively roaring suggestions of salt shellfish and sunsoaked tidelines a few rather puzzled seabirds wheeled over the necropolis where the wind scurried among the fallen masonry and covered with sand the memorials to ancient kings and the birds said more with a simple bowel movement than ozymandias ever managed to say the wind had a cool not unpleasant edge to it the people out repairing the damage caused by the gods felt an urge to turn their faces towards it as fish in a pond turn towards an influx of clear fresh water noone worked in the necropolis most of the pyramids had blown their upper levels clean off and stood smoking gently like recentlyextinct volcanoes here and there slabs of black marble littered the landscape one of them had nearly decapitated a fine statue of hat the vultureheaded god the ancestors had vanished noone was volunteering to go and look for them around midday a ship came up the djel under full sail it was a deceptive ship it seemed to wallow like a fat and unprotected hippo and it was only after watching it for some time that anyone would realise that it was also making remarkably fast progress it dropped anchor outside the palace after a while it let down a dinghy teppic sat on the throne and watched the life of the kingdom reassemble itself like a smashed mirror that is put together again and reflects the same old light in new and unexpected ways noone was quite sure on what basis he was on the throne but noone else was at all keen on occupying it and it was a relief to hear instructions issued in a clear confident voice it is amazing what people will obey if a clear and confident voice is used and the kingdom was well used to a clear confident voice besides giving orders stopped him thinking about things like for example what would happen next but at least the gods had gone back to not existing again which made it a whole lot easier to believe in them and the grass didnt seem to be growing under his feet any more maybe i can put the kingdom together again he thought but then what can i do with it if only we could find dios he always knew what to do that was the main thing about him a guard pushed his way through the milling throng of priests and nobles excuse me your sire he said theres a merchant to see you he says its urgent not now man theres representatives of the tsortean and ephebian armies coming to see me in an hour and theres a great deal thats got to be done first i cant go around seeing any salesmen who happen to be passing whats he selling anyway carpets your sire carpets it was chidder grinning like half a watermelon followed by several of the crew he walked up the hall staring around at the frescoes and hangings because it was chidder he was probably costing them out by the time he reached the throne he was drawing a double line under the total nice place he said wrapping up thousands of years of architectural accumulation in a mere two syllables youll never guess what happened we just happened to be sailing along the coast and suddenly there was this river one minute cliffs next minute river theres a funny thing i thought i bet old teppics up there somewhere wheres ptraci i knew you were complaining about the lack of the old home comforts so we brought you this carpet i said wheres ptraci the crew moved aside leaving a grinning alfonz to cut the strings around the carpet and shake it out it uncurled swiftly across the floor in a flurry of dust balls and moths and eventually ptraci who continued rolling until her head hit teppics boot he helped her to her feet and tried to pick bits of fluff out of her hair as she swayed backwards and forwards she ignored him and turned to chidder red with breathlessness and fury i could have died in there she shouted lots of other things have by the smell and the heat you said it worked for queen wossname ramjamhurrah or whoever said chidder dont blame me at home a necklace or something is usually the thing i bet she had a decent carpet snapped ptraci not something stuck in a bloody hold for six months youre lucky we had one at all said chidder mildly it was your idea huh said ptraci she turned to teppic hallo she said this was meant to be a startling original surprise it worked said teppic fervently it really worked chidder lay on a daybed on the palaces veranda while three handmaidens took turns to peel grapes for him a pitcher of beer stood cooling in the shade he was grinning amiably on a blanket nearby alfonz lay on his stomach feeling extremely awkward the mistress of the women had found out that in addition to the tattoos on his forearms his back was a veritable illustrated history of exotic practices and had brought the girls out to be educated he winced occasionally as her pointer stabbed at items of particular interest and stuffed his fingers firmly in his great scarred ears to shut out the giggles at the far end of the veranda given privacy by unspoken agreement teppic sat with ptraci things were not going well everything changed he said im not going to be king you are the king she said you cant change things i can i can abdicate its very simple if im not really the king then i can go whenever i please if i am the king then the kings word is final and i can abdicate if we can change sex by decree we can certainly change station they can find a relative to do the job i must have dozens the job anyway you said there was only your auntie teppic frowned aunt clephptahre was not on reflection the kind of monarch a kingdom needed if it was going to make a fresh start she had a number of stoutlyheld views on a variety of subjects but most of them involved the flaying alive of people she disapproved of this meant most people under the age of thirtyfive to start with well someone else then he said it shouldnt be difficult weve always seemed to have more nobles than really necessary well just have to find one who has the dream about the cows oh the one where theres fat cows and thin cows said ptraci yes its sort of ancestral its a nuisance i know that much one of thems always grinning and playing a wimblehorn it looks like a trombone to me said teppic its a ceremonial wimblehorn if you look closely she said well i expect everyone sees it a bit differently i dont think it matters he sighed and watched the unnamed unloading it seemed to have more than the expected number of feather mattresses and several of the people wandering bemusedly down the gangplank were holding toolboxes and lengths of pipe i think youre going to find it difficult said ptraci you cant say all those who dream about cows please step forward itd give the game away i cant just hang around until someone happens to mention it can i be reasonable he snapped how many people are likely to say hey i had this funny dream about cows last night apart from you i mean they stared at one another and shes my sister said teppic the priests nodded it was left to koomi to put it into words hed just spent ten minutes going through the files with the mistress of the women her mother was er your late fathers favourite he said he took a great deal of interest in her upbringing as you know and er it would appear that yes she may be your aunt of course the concubines are never very good at paperwork but most likely your sister she looked at him with tearfilled eyes that doesnt make any difference does it she whispered teppic stared at his feet yes he said i think it does really he looked up at her but you can be queen he added he glared at the priests cant she he stated firmly the high priests looked at one another then they looked at ptraci who stood alone her shoulders shaking small palace trained used to taking orders they looked at koomi she would be ideal he said there was a murmur of suddenlyconfident agreement there you are then said teppic consolingly she glared at him he backed away so ill be off he said i dont need to pack anything its all right just like that she said is that all isnt there anything youre going to say he hesitated halfway to the door you could stay he told himself it wouldnt work though itd end up a terrible mess youd probably end up splitting the kingdom between you just because fate throws you together doesnt mean fates got it right anyway youve been forth camels are more important than pyramids he said slowly its something we should always remember he ran for it while she was looking for something to throw the sun reached the peak of noon without beetles and koomi hovered by the throne like hat the vultureheaded god it will please your majesty to confirm my succession as high priest he said what ptraci was sitting with her chin cupped in one hand she waved the other hand at him oh yes all right fine no trace has alas been found of dios we believe he was very close to the great pyramid when it flared ptraci stared into space you carry on she said koomi preened the formal coronation will take some time to arrange he said taking the golden mask however your graciousness will be pleased to wear the mask of authority now for there is much formal business to be concluded she looked at the mask im not wearing that she said flatly koomi smiled your majesty will be pleased to wear the mask of authority he said no said ptraci koomis smile crazed a little around the edges as he attempted to get to grips with this new concept he was sure dios had never had this trouble he got over the problem by sidling round it sidling had stood him in good stead all his life he wasnt going to desert it now he put the mask down very carefully on a stool it is the first hour he said your majesty will wish to conduct the ritual of the ibis and then graciously grant an audience to the military commanders of the tsortean and ephebian armies both are seeking permission to cross the kingdom your majesty will forbid this at the second hour there will ptraci sat drumming her fingers on the arms of the throne then she took a deep breath im going to have a bath she said koomi rocked back and forth a bit it is the first hour he repeated unable to think of anything else your majesty will wish to conduct koomi yes o noble queen shut up the ritual of the ibis koomi moaned im sure youre capable of doing it yourself you look like a man who does things himself if ever i saw one she added sourly the commanders of the tsortean tell them ptraci began and then paused tell them she repeated that they may both cross not one or the other you understand both but koomi s understanding managed at last to catch up with his ears that means theyll end up on opposite sides good and after that you can order some camels theres a merchant in ephebe with a good stock check their teeth first oh and then you can ask the captain of the unnamed to come and see me he was explaining to me what a free port is in your bath o queen said koomi weakly he couldnt help noticing now how her voice was changing with each sentence as the veneer of upbringing burned away under the blowlamp of heredity nothing wrong with that she snapped and see about plumbing apparently pipes are the thing for the asses milk said koomi who was now totally lost in the desert shut up koomi yes o queen said koomi miserably hed wanted changes it was just that hed wanted things to stay the same as well the sun dropped to the horizon entirely unaided for some people it was turning out to be quite a good day the reddened light lit up the three male members of the ptaclusp dynasty as they pored over plans for its called a bridge said iib is that like an aqueduct said ptaclusp in reverse sort of thing said iib the water goes underneath we go over the top oh the k the queen wont like that said ptaclusp the royal familys always been against chaining the holy river with dams and weirs and suchlike iib gave a triumphant grin she suggested it he said and she graciously went on to say could we see to it theres places for people to stand and drop rocks on the crocodiles she said that large pointy rocks she said my word said ptaclusp he turned to his other son you sure youre all right he said feeling fine dad said iia no ptaclusp groped headaches or anything never felt better said iia only you havent asked about the cost said ptaclusp i thought perhaps you were still feeling fl ill the queen has been pleased to ask me to have a look at the royal finances said iia she said priests cant add up his recent experiences had left him with no ill effects other than a profitable tendency to think at right angles to everyone else and he sat wreathed in smiles while his mind constructed tariff rates docking fees and a complex system of value added tax which would shortly give the merchant venturers of ankhmorpork a nasty shock ptaclusp thought about all the miles of the virgin djel totally unbridged and there was plenty of dressed stone around now millions of tons of the stuff and you never knew perhaps on some of those bridges thered be room for a statue or two he had the very thing he put his arms around his sons shoulders lads he said proudly its looking really quantum the setting sun also shone on dil and gern although in this case it was by a roundabout route through the lightwell of the palace kitchens theyd ended up there for no very obvious reason it was just that it was so depressing in the embalming room all alone the kitchen staff worked around them recognising the air of impenetrable gloom that surrounded the two embalmers it was never a very sociable job at the best of times and embalmers didnt make friends easily anyway there was a coronation feast to prepare they sat amid the bustle observing the future over a jug of beer i expect said gern that gwlenda can have a word with her dad thats it boy said dil wearily theres a future there people will always want garlic bloody boring stuff garlic said gern with unusual ferocity and you dont get to meet people thats what i liked about our job always new faces no more pyramids said dil without rancour thats what she said youve done a good job master dil she said but im going to drag this country kicking and screaming into the century of the fruitbat cobra said gern what its the century of the cobra not the fruitbat whatever said dil irritably he stared miserably into his mug that was the trouble now he reflected you had to start remembering what century it was he glared at a tray of canapes that was the thing these days everyone fiddling about he picked up an olive and turned it over and over in his fingers cant say id feel the same about the old job mind said gern draining the jug but i bet you were proud master dil i mean you know when all your stitching held up like that dil his eyes not leaving the olive reached dreamily down to his belt and grasped one of his smaller knives for intricate jobs i said you must have felt very sorry it was all over said gern dil swivelled around to get more light and breathed heavily as he concentrated still youll get over it said gern the important thing is not to let it prey on your mind put this stone somewhere said dil sorry put this stone somewhere said dil gern shrugged and took it out of his fingers right said dil his voice suddenly vibrant with purpose now pass me a piece of red pepper and the sun shone on the delta that little infinity of reed beds and mud banks where the djel was laying down the silt of the continent wading birds bobbed for food in the green maze of stems and billions of zigzag midges danced over the brackish water here at least time had always passed as the delta breathed twice daily the cold fresh water of the tide it was coming in now the foamcrested cusp of it trickling between the reeds here and there soaked and ancient bandages unwound wriggled for a while like incredibly old snakes and then with the mininum of fuss dissolved this is most irregular we re sorry its not our fault how many of you are there more than im afraid very well then please form an orderly queue you bastard was regarding his empty hay rack it represented a subarray in the general cluster hay containing arbitrary values between zero and k it didnt have any hay in it it might in fact have a negative value of hay in it but to the hungry stomach the difference between no hay and minushay was not of particular interest it didnt matter how he worked it out the answer was always the same it was an equation of classical simplicity it had a certain clean elegance which he was not currently in a position to admire you bastard felt illused and hard done by there was nothing particularly unusual about this however since that is the normal state of mind for a camel he knelt patiently while teppic packed the saddlebags well avoid ephebe teppic said ostensibly to the camel well go up the end of the circle sea perhaps to quirm or over the ramtops theres all sorts of places maybe well even look for a few of those cities eh i expect youd like that its a mistake trying to cheer up camels you may as well drop meringues into a black hole the door at the far end of the stable swung open it was a priest he looked rather flustered the priests had been doing a lot of unaccustomed running around today er he began her majesty commands you not to leave the kingdom he coughed he said is there a reply teppic considered no he said i dont think so so i shall tell her that you will be attending on her presently shall i said the priest hopefully no its all very well for you to say said the priest sourly and slunk off he was replaced a few minutes later by koomi very red in the face her majesty requests that you do not leave the kingdom he said teppic climbed on to you bastards back and tapped the camel lightly with a prod she really means it said koomi im sure she does she could have you thrown to the sacred crocodiles you know i havent seen many of them around today how are they said teppic and gave the camel another thump he rode out into the knifeedged daylight and along the packedearth streets which time had turned into a surface harder than stone they were thronged with people and every single person ignored him it was a marvellous feeling he rode gently along the road to the border and did not stop until he was up in the escarpment the valley spreading out behind him a hot wind off the desert rattled the syphacia bushes as he tethered you bastard in the shade climbed a little further up the rocks and looked back the valley was old so old that you could believe it had existed first and had watched the rest of the world form around it teppic lay with his head on his arms of course it had made itself old it had been gently stripping itself of futures for thousands of years now change was hitting it like the ground hitting an egg dimensions were probably more complicated than people thought probably so was time probably so were people although people could be more predictable he watched the column of dust rise outside the palace and work its way through the city across the narrow patchwork of fields disappear for a minute in a group of palm trees near the escarpment and reappear at the foot of the slope long before he could see it he knew thered be a chariot somewhere in the cloud of sand he slid back down the rocks and squatted patiently by the roadside the chariot rattled by eventually halted some way on turned awkwardly in the narrow space and trundled back what will you do shouted ptraci leaning over the rail teppic bowed and none of that she snapped dont you like being king she hesitated yes she said i do of course you do said teppic its in the blood in the old days people would fight like tigers brothers against sisters cousins against uncles dreadful but you dont have to go i need you youve got advisers said teppic mildly i didnt mean that she snapped anyway theres only koomi and hes no good youre lucky i had dios and he was good koomi will be much better you can learn a lot by not listening to what he has to say you can go a long way with incompetent advisers besides chidder will help im sure hes full of ideas she coloured he advanced a few when we were on the ship there you are then i knew the two of you would get along like a house on fire screams flames people running for safety and youre going back to be an assassin are you she sneered i dont think so ive inhumed a pyramid a pantheon and the entire old kingdom it may be worth trying something else by the way you havent been finding little green shoots springing up wherever you walk have you no what a stupid idea teppic relaxed it really was all over then dont let the grass grow under your feet thats the important thing he said and you havent seen any seagulls around theres lots of them today or didnt you notice yes thats good i think you bastard watched them talk a little more that peculiar trailingoff desultory kind of conversation that two people of opposite sexes engage in when they have something else on their minds it was much easier with camels when the female merely had to check the males methodology then they kissed in a fairly chaste fashion insofar as camels are any judge a decision was reached you bastard lost interest at this point and decided to eat his lunch again in the beginning it was peaceful in the valley the river its banks as yet untamed wandered languidly through thickets of rush and papyrus ibises waded in the shallows in the deeps hippos rose and sank slowly like pickled eggs the only sound in the damp silence was the occasional plop of a fish or hiss of a crocodile dios lay in the mud for some time he wasnt sure how hed got there or why half his robes were torn off and the other half scorched black he dimly recalled a loud noise and a sensation of extreme speed while at the same time hed been standing still right at this moment he didnt want any answers answers implied questions and questions never got anyone anywhere questions only spoiled things the mud was cool and soothing and he didnt need to know anything else for a while the sun went down various nocturnal prowlers wandered near to dios and by some animal instinct decided that he certainly wasnt going to be worth all the trouble that would accrue from biting his leg off the sun rose again herons honked mist unspooled between the pools was burned up as the sky turned from blue to new bronze and time unrolled in glorious uneventfulness for dios until an alien noise took the silence and did the equivalent of cutting it into small pieces with a rusty breadknife it was a noise in fact like a donkey being chainsawed as sounds went it was to melody what a boxful of dates is to highperformance motocross nevertheless as other voices joined it similar but different in a variety of fractured keys and broken tones the overall effect was curiously attractive it had lure it had pull it had a strange suction the noise reached a plateau one pure note made of a succession of discordances and then for just the fraction of a second the voices split away each along a vector there was a stirring of the air a flickering of the sun and a dozen camels appeared over the distant hills skinny and dusty running towards the water birds erupted from the reeds leftover saurians slid smoothly off the sandbanks within a minute the shore was a mass of churned mud as the knobblykneed creatures jostled nose deep in the water dios sat up and saw his staff lying in the mud it was a little scorched but still intact and he noticed what somehow had never been apparent before before had there been a before there had certainly been a dream something like a dream each snake had its tail in its mouth down the slope after the camels his ragged family trailing behind him was a small brown figure waving a camel prod he looked hot and very bewildered he looked in fact like someone in need of good advice and careful guidance dioss eyes turned back to the staff it meant something very important he knew he couldnt remember what though all he could remember was that it was very heavy yet at the same time hard to put down very hard to put down better not to pick it up he thought perhaps just pick it up for a while and go and explain about gods and why pyramids were so important and then he could put it down afterwards certainly sighing pulling the remnants of his robes around him to give himself dignity using the staff to steady himself dios went forth the end
