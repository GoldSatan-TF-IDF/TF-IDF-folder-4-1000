punch the fellow was over seven feet tall and when he stepped on buffies flagstone walk one of the stones split with a dust of crushed rock too bad he said sadly i apologize very much wait buffie was glad to wait because buffie recognized his visitor at once the fellow flickered disappeared and in a moment was there again now about five feet two he blinked with pink eyes i materialize so badly he apologized but i will make amends may i let me see would you like the secret of transmutation a cure for simple virus diseases a list of twelve growth stocks with spectacular growth certainties inherent in our development program for your planet that is the earth buffie said he would take the list of growth stocks hugging himself and fighting terribly to keep a straight face my name is chariton buffie he said extending a hand gladly the alien took it curiously and shook it and it was like shaking hands with a shadow you will call me punch please he said it is not my name but it will do because after all this projection of my real self is only a sort of puppet have you a pencil and he rattled off the names of twelve issues buffie had never heard of that did not matter in the least buffie knew that when the aliens gave you something it was money in the bank look what they had given the human race fasterthanlight space ships power sources from hitherto nonradioactive elements like silicon weapons of great force and metalworking processes of great suppleness his wifes aunts brotherinlaw the colonel was even now off in space somewhere in a highly armed space ship built according to their plans buffie thought of ducking into the house for a quick phone call to his broker but instead he invited punch to look around his apple orchard make the most of every moment he said to himself every moment with one of these guys is worth ten thousand dollars i would enjoy your apples awfully said punch but he seemed disap pointed do i have it wrong dont you and certain friends plan a sporting day as senator wenzel advised me oh sure certainly good old walt told you about it did he yes that was the thing about the aliens they liked to poke around in human affairs they said when they came to earth that they wanted to help us and all they asked of us in return was that they be permitted to study our ways it was nice of them to be so interested and it was nice of walt wenzel buffie thought to send the alien along to him were going after mallard down to little egg some of the boys and me theres chuck hes the mayor here and jer second national bank you know and padre that is it cried punch to see you shoot the mallard he pulled out an esso road map overtraced with golden raised lines and asked buffie to point out where little egg was i cannot focus well enough to stay in a moving vehicle he said blinking in a regretful way still i can meet you there if that is you wish i do i do i do buffie was painfully exact in pointing out the place punchs lips moved silently translating the golden lines into polar spacetime coordinates and he vanished just as the station wagon with the rest of the boys came roaring into the carriage drive with a hydromatic spatter of gravel the boys were extremely impressed padre had seen one of the aliens once at a distance drawing pictures of the skaters in rockefeller center but that was the closest any of them had come god what luck did you get a superhairpin from him buffie or a recipe for a nyew smyooth martini with dust on it not buffie fellows he probably held out for something real good like six new ways to oh excuse me padre but seriously buffie these people are unpredictably generous look how they built that dam in egypt has this punch given you anything buffie grinned wisely as they drove along their shotguns firmly held between their knees damn it he said mildly i forgot to bring cigarettes lets stop at the blue jay diner for a minute the cigarette machine at the blue jay was out of sight of the parking lot and so was the phone booth it was too bad he reflected to have to share everything with the boys but on the other hand he already had his growth stocks anyway there was plenty for everyone every nation on earth had its silicondrive space ships now fleets of them milling about on maneuvers all over the solar system with help from the starpeople an american expedition had staked out enormous radium beds on callisto the venezuelans had a diamond mountain on mercury the soviets owned a swamp of purest penicillin near the south pole of venus and individuals had done very well too a tickettaker at steeplechase park explained to them the reason why the air jets blew up ladies skirts and they tipped him with a design for a springless safety pin that was earning him a million dollars a month in royalties an usherette at la scala became the cosmetic queen of europe for showing three of them to their seats they gave her a simple painless eye dye and now of milans women had bright blue eyes from her salon all they wanted to do was help they said they came from a planet very far away and they were lonely and they wanted to help us make the jump into space it would be fun they promised and would help to end poverty and war between nations and they would have company in the void between the stars politely and deferentially they gave away secrets worth trillions and humanity burst with a shower of gold into the age of plenty punch was there before them inspecting the case of bourbon hidden in their blind i am delighted to meet you chuck jer bud padre and of course buffie he said it is kind of you to take a stranger along on your fun i regret i have only some eleven minutes to stay eleven minutes the boys scowled apprehensively at buffie punch said in his wistful voice if you will allow me to give you a memento perhaps you would like to know that three grams of common table salt in a quart of crisco exposed for nine minutes to the radiations from one of our silicon reactors will infallibly remove warts they all scribbled silently planning a partnership corporation and punch pointed out to the bay where some tiny dots rose and fell with the waves are those not the mallards you wish to shoot thats right said buffie glumly say you know what i was thinking i was thinking that transmutation you mentioned before i wonder and are these the weapons with which you kill the birds he examined padres ancient overandunder with the silver chasing extremely lovely he said will you shoot oh not now said buffie scandalized we cant do that that transmutation it is extremely fascinating said the starman looking at them with his mild pink eyes and returning the gun well i may tell you i think what we have not announced a surprise we are soon to be present in the flesh or near at any rate near buffie looked at the boys and the boys looked at him there had been no suggestion of this in the papers and it almost took their minds off the fact that punch was leaving he nodded violently like the ifickering of a bad fluorescent lamp near indeed in a relative way he said perhaps some hundreds of millions of miles my true body of which this is only a projection is at present in one of our own interstellar ships now approaching the orbit of pluto the american fleet together with those of chile new zealand and costa rica is there practicing with its siliconray weapons and we will shortly make contact with them for the first time in a physical way he beamed but only six minutes remain he said sadly that transmutation secret you mentioned buffie began recovering his voice please said punch may i not watch you hunt it is a link between us oh do you shoot asked padre the starman said modestly we have but little game but we love it wont you show me your ways buffie scowled he could not help thinking that twelve growth stocks and a wartcure were small pickings from the starmen who had given wealth weapons and the secret of interstellar travel we cant he growled his voice harsher than he intended we dont shoot sitting birds punch gasped with delight another bond between us but now i must go to our fleet for the hum for the surprise he began to shimmer like a candle neither do we he said and went out
