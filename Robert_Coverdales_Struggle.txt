robert coverdales struggle a l burt company publishers new york robert coverdales struggle chapter i a fishermans cabin robert have you seen anything of your uncle no aunt i suppose hes over at the tavern as usual said the woman despondently he drinks up about all he earns and theres little enough left for us i hope you wont follow in his steps robert you may be sure i wont aunt jane said the boy nodding emphatically i wouldnt drink a glass of rum for a hundred dollars god keep you in that resolution my dear boy i dont want my sisters son to go to destruction as my husband is doing my story opens in a small fishing village on the coast of one of the new england states robert coverdale whom i have briefly introduced is the young hero whose fortunes i propose to record he is a strong wellmade boy with a frank honest face embrowned by exposure to the sun and wind with bright and fearless eyes and a manly look i am afraid his dress would not qualify him to appear to advantage in a drawingroom he wore a calico shirt and wellpatched trousers of great antiquity and stockings and cowhide shoes sadly in need of repairs some of my welldressed boy readers living in cities and large towns may be disposed to turn up their noses at this ragged boy and wonder at my taste in choosing such a hero but robert had manly traits and in spite of his poor clothes possessed energy talent honesty and a resolute will and a boy so endowed cannot be considered poor though he does not own a dollar which was precisely roberts case indeed i may go further and say that never in the course of his life of fifteen years had he been able to boast the ownership of a hundred cents john trafton his uncle was a fisherman his small house or cabin was picturesquely situated on the summit of a cliff at the foot of which rolled the ocean waves and commanded a fine sea view that was perhaps its only recommendation for it was not only small but furnished in the plainest and scantiest style the entire furniture of the house would not have brought twentyfive dollars at auction yet for twentyfive years it had been the home of john and jane trafton and for twelve years of their nephew robert my readers will naturally ask if the fisherman had no children of his own there was a son who if living would be twentythree years old but years before he had left home and whether ben trafton was living or dead who could tell nothing had been heard of him for five years mrs traftons affections had only robert for their object and to her sisters son she was warmly attached nearly as much so as if he had been her own son her husbands love of drink had gradually alienated her from him and she leaned upon robert who was always ready to serve her with boyish devotion and to protect her if need be from the threats of her husband made surly by drink many days she would have gone to bed supperless but for robert he would push out to sea in his uncles boat catch a supply of fish selling a part if he could or trade a portion for groceries indeed he did more for the support of the family than john trafton did himself its about time for supper robert said his aunt but ive only got a little boiled fish to offer you fish is good for the brains aunt jane said robert smiling well i suppose its no use waiting for your uncle if hes at the tavern he will stay there until he is full of liquor and then he will reel home come in and sit down to the table robert entered the cabin and sat down at a side table his aunt brought him a plate of boiled fish and a potato i found just one potato in the cupboard robert she said then eat it yourself aunt dont give it to me no robert ive got a little toast for myself there was a slice of bread too dry to eat as it was so i toasted it and soaked it in hot water that suits me better than the potato havent you any tea aunt for yourself i mean robert added quickly i dont care for it but i know you do i wish i had some tea always goes to the right spot said mrs trafton but i couldnt find a single leaf what a pity said robert regretfully yes sighed mrs trafton we have to do without almost everything it might be so different if mr trafton wouldnt drink did he always drink hes drank more or less for ten years but the habit seems to have grown upon him till five years ago twothirds of his earnings came to me to spend for the house but now i dont average a dollar a week its too bad aunt jane said robert energetically so it is but it does no good to say so it wont mend matters i wish i was a man i am glad you are not robert why are you glad that i am a boy asked robert in surprise because when you are a man you wont stay here you will go out into the world to better yourself and i shant blame you then i shall be left alone with your uncle and heaven only knows how i shall get along i shall starve very likely robert pushed back his chair from the table and looked straight at his aunt do you think aunt jane he demanded indignantly that i will desert you and leave you to shift for yourself i said robert that i shouldnt blame you if you did there isnt much to stay here for i am sorry you have such a poor opinion of me aunt jane said the boy gravely i am not quite so selfish as all that i certainly should like to go out into the world but i wont go unless i can leave you comfortable i should miss you robert i cant tell how much but i dont want to tie you down here when you can do better there isnt much for me to live for im an old woman already but better times may be in store for you you are not an old woman aunt jane you are not more than fifty i am just fifty robert but i feel sometimes as if i were seventy do you know aunt jane i sometimes think that brighter days are coming to both of us sometimes when i sit out there on the cliff and look out to sea i almost fancy i can see a ship coming in laden with good things for us mrs trafton smiled faintly i have waited a long time for my ship to come in robert she said ive waited year after year but it hasnt come yet it may come for all that you are young and hopeful yours may come in some day but i dont think mine ever will have you anything for me to do aunt not at present robert then ill study a little there was an unpainted wooden shelf which robert had made himself and on it were half a dozen books his sole library from this shelf he took down a tattered arithmetic and a slate and pencil and going out of doors flung himself down on the cliff and opened the arithmetic well toward the end ill try this sum in cube root he said to himself i got it wrong the last time i tried he worked for fifteen minutes and a smile of triumph lit up his face it comes right he said i think i understand cube root pretty well now it was a good idea working by myself when i left school i had only got through fractions thats seventyfive pages back and i understand all that i have tried since i wont be satisfied till i have gone to the end of the very last page here his aunt came to the door of the cabin and called robert all right aunt im coming the boy rose to his feet and answered the summons chapter ii robert and mrs jones are you willing to go to the village for me robert asked his aunt to be sure i am aunt answered the boy promptly i hope you dont doubt it i thought you might be tired as you were out all the forenoon in the boat thats sport aunt jane that doesnt tire me it would if you were not very strong for a boy yes i am pretty strong said robert complacently extending his muscular arms i can row the boat when the tide is very strong what errand have you got for me to the village aunt i have been doing a little sewing for mrs jones you mean the landlords wife questioned robert yes i dont feel very friendly toward her husband for its he that sells strong drink to my husband and keeps his earnings from me but i couldnt refuse work from her when she offered it to me mrs trafton spoke half apologetically for it had cost her a pang to work for her enemys family but robert took a practical view of the matter her money is as good as anybodys he said i dont see why you shouldnt take it she has enough of our money thats true robert said his aunt her doubts removed by her young nephews logic is the bundle ready aunt jane here it is robert and the fishermans wife handed him a small parcel wrapped in a fragment of newspaper how much is she to pay for the work i hardly know what to ask i guess twentyfive cents will be about right very well aunt jane any other errands if you get the money robert you may stop at the store and buy a quarter of a pound of their cheapest tea i am afraid its extravagant in me to buy tea when theres so little coming in but it cheers me up when i get lowspirited and helps me to bear what i have to bear of course you must have some tea aunt jane said robert quickly nobody can charge you with extravagance anything more you may stop at the bakers and buy a loaf of bread then tomorrow please god well have a good breakfast all right aunt and robert began to walk rapidly toward the village about a mile inland poor woman her idea of a good breakfast was a cup of tea without milk or sugar and bread without butter it had not always been so but her husbands intemperance had changed her ideas and made her accept thankfully what once she would have disdained it must be said of robert that though he had the hearty appetite of a growing boy he never increased his aunts sorrow by complaining of their meager fare but always preserved a cheerful demeanor in the midst of their privations i have said that the settlement which was known as cooks harbor was a fishing village but this is not wholly correct a mile inland was a village of fair size which included the houses of several summer residents from the city and these were more or less pretentious several comfortable houses belonged to sea captains who had retired from active duties and anchored in the village where they first saw the light the cabins of the fishermen were nearer the sea and of these there were some twenty but they were not grouped together i have said that the main village was a mile away here was the tavern the grocery store and the shops of the tailor and shoemaker here was centered the social life of cooks harbor here unfortunately the steps of john trafton too often tended for he always brought up at the tavern and seldom came home with a cent in his pocket robert was no laggard and it did not take him long to reach the village just in the center stood the tavern a rambling building of two stories with an l which had been added within a few years during the summer there were generally boarders from the city who considered that the invigorating sea air with its healthful influences counterbalanced the rather primitive accommodations and homely fare with which they must perforce be content by hook or crook nahum jones or nick jones as he was called had managed to accumulate a snug competence but much of it was gained by his profit on liquor he was a thrifty man whose thrift extended to meanness and his wife was thoroughly selfish they had but one child a daughter who bade fair to be an old maid though robert had made no objection to carry the work to the tavern he didnt enjoy his visit in anticipation he disliked both mr and mrs jones but felt that this must not interfere with his aunts business he went round to a side door and knocked the door was opened by the daughter selina jones well robert she said abruptly whats wanted is your mother at home i suppose she is can i see her i dont know i guess shes busy wont i do as well i would rather see your mother upon this selina summoned her mother not thinking it necessary to invite our hero into the house oh i see said mrs jones as she glanced at the bundle in roberts hand youve brought back the work i gave your aunt yes maam let me look at it she took the bundle opened it and ran her eye rapidly over it itll do she said might have been better done but itll answer she was about to close the door as if her business with robert was at an end but this did not suit our hero it will be twentyfive cents he said in a businesslike tone were you afraid i would forget to pay you asked mrs jones rather sourly no maam but i supposed you would like to know how much it would be very well now i know if robert had been easily abashed he would have dropped the matter there and suffered her to take her time about paying but he knew that his aunts intended purchasing must be made with ready money and he persisted i would like the money now he said for i am going to the store to buy something it seems to me you are in a great hurry said mrs jones unpleasantly so would you be mrs jones said robert bluntly if you were as poor as my aunt folks neednt be poor if they are smart said the landlords wife i suppose you know where my uncles money goes said robert pointedly mrs jones did know and though she had not much of a conscience she felt the thrust and it made her uncomfortable and therefore angry but it also gave her an idea wait a minute she said and left robert standing in the doorway when she returned which was in a short time her thin lips were wreathed with satisfaction you can tell your aunt there wont be any money coming to her she said why not demanded robert in great surprise mr jones tells me that your uncle is indebted to him and he will credit him with twentyfive cents on account what does my uncle owe him for demanded the boy with flashing eyes for drink i suppose said mrs jones rather reluctantly for drink repeated our hero are you not satisfied with taking all my uncles earnings but you must get my aunt to work her fingers to the bone and then keep back her money in payment for your rum upon my word robert coverdale said mrs jones sharply you are very impudent how dare you speak to me in that way how dare you treat my aunt so meanly retorted robert with righteous indignation i wont stand your impudence so there your aunt neednt expect any more sewing to do said the angry landlady she wouldnt take any more of your work if that is the way you mean to pay her i wont stand here talking with you ill get mr jones to give you a horsewhipping see if i dont hed better not try it said robert with flashing eyes the door was slammed in his face and angry and disappointed he walked slowly out of the tavern yard chapter iii the wind brought good luck john trafton was sitting out on the porch of the tavern when his nephew came out of the side gate theres your nephew trafton said old ben brandon who like john trafton frequented the barroom too much for his good hasnt come here for his dram has he added the old man chuckling john traftons curiosity was excited for he had no idea of any errand that could bring robert to the tavern a suspicion crossed his mind the very thought of which kindled his indignation his wife might have sent to request mr jones not to sell him any more liquor he did not think she would dare to do it but she might at any rate he determined to find out he hastily left the porch and followed robert presently the boy heard his uncle call him and he turned round whats wanted uncle he inquired where have you been robert i called to see mrs jones what did you want of mrs jones it was an errand for aunt jane will you answer my question said trafton angrily what business has your aunt got with mrs jones he still thought that his wife had sent a message to mr jones through the wife of the latter she had been doing a little sewing for mrs jones and asked me to carry the work back oh thats it is it said john trafton relieved and how much did the work come to twentyfive cents you may give me the money robert said the fisherman you might lose it you know could robert be blamed for regarding his uncle with contempt his intention evidently was to appropriate his wifes scanty earnings to his own use spending them of course for drink certainly a man must be debased who will stoop to anything so mean and robert felt deeply ashamed of the man he was forced to call uncle i cant give you the money uncle said robert coldly cant hey what do you mean by that i want to know demanded the fisherman suspiciously my aunt wanted me to buy a little tea and a loaf of bread with the money what if she did cant i buy them just as well as you hand over that money robert coverdale or it will be the worse for you i have no money to hand you why havent you you havent had a chance to spend it yet you neednt lie about it or i will give you a flogging i never lie said robert proudly i told you i havent got the money and i havent then what have you done with it lost it eh i have done nothing with it mrs jones wouldnt pay me and why wouldnt she pay you because she said that you were owing her husband money for drink and she would credit it on your account as robert said this he looked his uncle full in the eye and his uncle flushed a little with transient shame so aunt must go without her tea and bread continued robert john trafton had the grace to be ashamed and said ill fix this with jones you can go to the store and get the tea and tell sands to charge it to me he wont do it said robert hes refused more than once if he wont that isnt my fault ive done all i could trafton turned back and resumed his seat on the porch where he remained till about ten oclock it was his usual evening resort for he did not think it necessary to go home until it was time to go to bed though robert had no money to spend he kept on his way slowly toward the village store he felt mortified and angry poor aunt jane he said to himself its a shame that she should have to go without her tea she hasnt much to cheer her up mrs jones is about the meanest woman i ever saw and i hope aunt jane wont do any more work for her it occurred to robert to follow his uncles direction and ask for credit at the store but he knew very well that there would be little prospect of paying the debt and though a boy he had strict notions on the subject of debt and could not bring his mind even for his aunts sake to buy what he could not pay for when we are sad and discouraged relief often comes in some unexpected form and from an unexpected quarter so it happened now to our young hero walking before him was an elderly gentleman who had on his head a panama straw hat with a broad brim he was a boston merchant who was spending a part of the season at cooks harbor as his custom was he was indulging in an evening walk after supper there was a brisk east wind blowing which suddenly increased in force and being no respecter of persons whisked off mr lawrence tudors expensive panama and whirled it away mr tudor looked after his hat in dismay he was an elderly gentleman of ample proportions who was accustomed to walk at a slow dignified pace and who would have found it physically uncomfortable to run even if he could be brought to think it comported with his personal dignity bless my soul how annoying exclaimed the merchant he looked about him helplessly as if to consider what course it would be best to pursue under the circumstances and as he looked he was relieved to see a boy in energetic pursuit of the lost hat this boy was robert who grasped the situation at once and being fleet of foot thought it very good fun to have a race with the wind he had a good chase for the wind in this case proved to be no mean competitor but at last he succeeded and put his hand on the hat which he carried in triumph to its owner really my boy i am exceedingly indebted to you said mr tudor made happy by the recovery of his hat you are quite welcome sir said robert politely you had a good run after it said mr tudor yes sir the wind is very strong i dont know what i should have done without you i am afraid i couldnt have overtaken it myself i am afraid not said robert smiling at the thought of a man of the merchants figure engaging in a race for a hat i could run when i was a boy like you said mr tudor pleasantly but theres rather too much of me now do you live in the village out on the cliff sir my uncle is a fisherman and do you ever fish sometimes a little sir but you dont expect to be a fisherman when you grow up not if i can find anything better a brightlooking lad like you ought to find something better please accept this he drew from his vest pocket a twodollar bill which he placed in roberts hand what exclaimed our young hero in astonishment all this for saving your hat it is quite too much sir mr tudor smiled you will no doubt be surprised he said when i tell you that my hat cost me fifty dollars it is a very fine panama fifty dollars ejaculated robert he had not supposed it worth two so you see it is worth something to save it and i should undoubtedly have lost it but for you i am very much obliged to you sir said robert i wouldnt accept the money if it were for myself but it will be very acceptable to my aunt i suppose your uncle does not find fishing very remunerative it isnt that sir but he spends nearly all of his money at the tavern and i understand my boy it is a very great pity i too had an uncle who was intemperate and i can understand your position what is your name robert coverdale there is my business card if you ever come to boston come and see me robert took the card from which he learned that his new acquaintance was lawrence tudor chapter iv roberts purchases when robert parted from mr tudor he felt as if he had unexpectedly fallen heir to a fortune two dollars is not a very large sum but to robert nurtured amid privation it assumed large proportions he began at once to consider what he could do with it and it is to his credit that he thought rather of his aunt than himself he would buy a whole pound of tea he decided and a pound of sugar to make it more palatable this would last a considerable time and take less than half his money as to the disposal of the remainder he would consider how to expend that in a long low building with brooms brushes and a variety of nondescript articles displayed in the windows and outside abner sands kept the village store it was a dark gloomy place crowded with articles for family use the proprietor enjoyed a monopoly of the village trade and in spite of occasional bad debts did a snug business and was able every year to make an addition to his store of savings in the county savings bank he was a cautious man and by being well acquainted with the circumstances and habits of every man in the village knew whom to trust and to whom to refuse credit john trafton belonged to the latter class mr sands knew as everybody else knew that all his money was invested in liquor and that the chance of paying a bill for articles needful for the household was very small indeed when therefore robert entered the store he took it for granted that he meant to ask credit and he was all ready for a refusal what do you charge for your tea mr sands the boy asked different prices according to quality answered the storekeeper not thinking it necessary to go into details how much is the cheapest fifty cents a pound do you call it a pretty good article continued our hero very fair i use it in my own family answered abner looking over his spectacles at his young customer i guess ill take a pound said robert with the air of one who had plenty of money a pound ejaculated abner sands in surprise yes sir a pound of tea for one in john traftons circumstances seemed to mr sands an extraordinary order considering that it was probably to be charged it seemed to the cautious trader an impudent attempt to impose upon him and he looked sternly at our young hero we dont trust he said coldly i havent asked you to trust me mr sands said robert independently you dont mean to say youre ready to pay for it cash down do you asked abner his countenance expressing amazement yes i do show me the money ill show you the money when i get my tea said robert provoked at mr sands resolute incredulity ive told you i will pay you before i leave the store if you dont want to sell your goods say so come come there aint no use in gettin angry said the trader in a conciliatory tone your trades as good as anybodys if youve got money to pay for the goods ive already told you i have mr sands all right robert you shall have the tea he weighed out the tea and then asked is there anything more yes sir how do you sell your sugar brown sugar eight cents i guess that will do i will take a pound of brown sugar your folks dont generally buy sugar i didnt know you used it we are going to use a pound said robert who did not fancy the traders interference well id jest as soon sell you a pound as anybody as long as youve got the money to pay for it robert said nothing although this remark was made in an interrogative tone as if mr sands still doubted whether our hero would be able to pay for his purchases there was nothing to do therefore but to weigh out the sugar the two bundles lay on the counter but mr sands watched them as a cat watches a mouse with a vague apprehension that our hero might seize them and carry them off without payment but robert was better prepared than he supposed from his vest pocket he drew the twodollar bill and passing it across the counter he said you may take your pay out of this abner sands took the bill and stared at it as if some mystery attached to it he scrutinized it carefully through his spectacles as if there was a possibility that it might be bad but it had an unmistakably genuine look it seems to be good he remarked cautiously of course its good said robert you dont take me for a counterfeiter do you mr sands its a good deal of money for you to have robert where did you get it why do you ask that question asked our hero provoked i was a leetle surprised at your having so much money thats all did your uncle give it to you i dont see what that is to you mr sands if you dont want to sell your tea and sugar you can keep them if there had been another grocery store in the village robert would have gone thither but it has already been said that abner sands had the monopoly of the village trade youre kind of touchy this evenin robert said abner placidly for he was so given to interesting himself in the affairs of his neighbors that he did not realize that his curiosity was displayed in an impertinent manner of course i want to sell all i can youve got considerable money comin back to you dont you want to buy something else i guess not tonight as long as youve got the cash to pay im perfectly ready to sell you goods lemme see fiftyeight from two dollars leaves a dollarn thirtytwo cents fortytwo corrected robert i declare so it does you are a good hand at subtraction robert felt that he could not truthfully return the compliment and prudently remained silent there is your money continued the trader putting in roberts hand a dollar bill and fortytwo cents in change your uncle must have been quite lucky he looked questioningly at our hero but robert did not choose to gratify his curiosity is it so very lucky to make two dollars he asked and with these words he left the store thats a curus boy soliloquized mr sands looking after him i cant get nothin out of him looks as if john trafton must have turned over a new leaf to give him so much money to buy groceries i hope he has its better that i should get his money than the tavern keeper mr sands did not have to wait long before his curiosity was partially gratified for the very man of whom he was thinking just then entered the store has my nephew been here he inquired just went out i thought you might be willing to let him have what little he wanted on credit ill see that its paid for why he paid for the goods himself fiftyeight cents what exclaimed the fisherman astonished he bought a pound of tea at fifty cents and a pound of sugar at eight cents and paid for em whered he get the money asked trafton i am sure i dont know i supposed you gave it to him hes got more left he paid for the articles with a twodollar bill and hes got a dollar and fortytwo cents left the young hypocrite ejaculated john trafton indignantly all the while he had this money he was worryin me for a quarter to buy some tea and a loaf of bread looks rather mysterious doesnt it said the grocer mr sands said the fisherman ive took care of that boy ever since he was three year old and thats the way he treats me hes a young viper jes so said mr sands who was a politic man and seldom contradicted his neighbors the rest of that money belongs to me by rights continued the fisherman and hes got to give it to me how much did you say it was a dollar and fortytwo cents john but seems to me youd better let him keep it to buy groceries with i must have the money muttered trafton not heeding this advice which was good though selfish i guess ill go home and make the boy give it to me and he staggered out of the store and as well as he could steered for home chapter v give me that money from the village store robert went to the bakers and bought a loaf of bread for six cents making his entire expenditures sixtyfour cents he was now ready to go home he walked rapidly and soon reached the humble cabin where he found his aunt waiting for him she looked with surprise at the three bundles he brought in and asked what have you got there robert first of all here is a pound of tea said the boy laying it down on the kitchen table here is a pound of sugar and here is a loaf of bread but i didnt order all those robert said his aunt i know you didnt answered her nephew but i thought youd be able to make use of them no doubt i shall but surely you did not buy them all for twentyfive cents i should say not why the tea alone cost fifty cents then the sugar came to eight cents and the loaf cost six cents mrs jones didnt pay you enough to buy all those did she mrs jones is about as mean a woman as you can find anywhere robert said warmly she didnt pay me a cent why didnt she like the work she said uncle owed her husband money for drink and the work would part pay up the debt but for the presence of the groceries this would have had a discouraging effect upon mrs trafton but her mind was diverted by her curiosity and she said apprehensively i hope you didnt buy on credit robert i never can pay so much money mr sands isnt the man to sell on credit aunt jane no i paid cash and the best of it is continued our hero i have some money left here he produced and spread on the table before his aunts astonished eyes the balance of the money mrs trafton was startled the possession of so much money seemed to her incomprehensible i hope you came by the money honestly robert what have i ever done aunt jane that you should think me a thief asked robert half amused half annoyed nothing my dear boy but i cant understand how you came to have so much money i see i must explain aunt a strong wind blew it to me then somebody must have lost it you shouldnt have spent it till you had tried to find the owner ill explain to you and he told her the story of the lost hat and the liberal reward he obtained for chasing and recovering it think of a straw hat costing fifty dollars aunt he said wonderingly it does seem strange but i am glad it was worth so much or you wouldnt have been so well paid this mr tudor is a gentleman aunt why plenty of people would have given me only ten cents i would have thought myself well paid if he had even given me that but i couldnt have brought you home so much tea aunt jane do me a favor what is it robert make yourself a good strong cup of tea tonight youll feel ever so much better and theres plenty of it a pound will last a long time wont it oh yes a good while i shall get a good deal of comfort out of that tea but i dont know about making any tonight if you would like some if youll make some ill drink a little aunt jane robert said this because he feared otherwise his aunt would not make any till the next morning very well robert dont let uncle know ive brought so much money home said robert with a sudden thought why not because i dont want him to know i have any money if he knew he would want me to give it to him i dont think he would claim it it was given to you ill tell you why i am sure he would and robert told how his uncle demanded the scanty pittance which he supposed mrs jones had paid for the sewing mrs trafton blushed with shame for her husbands meanness drink changes a mans nature completely she said the time was when john would have scorned such a thing that time has gone by aunt for fear he will find out that i have the money i believe i will go and hide it somewhere shall i take care of it for you robert asked mrs trafton no aunt jane he would find it out and i dont want to get you into any trouble i know of a good place to put it a place where he will never find it i will put it there till we need to use it you must buy something for yourself with it the money is yours robert shook his head decidedly i dont need anything that is i dont need anything but what i can do without we will keep it to buy bread and tea and anything else that we need now aunt while you are steeping the tea i will go out and dispose of the money here it is necessary to explain that though john trafton started for home when he heard from mr sands about roberts unexpected wealth he changed his mind as he passed the tavern he thought he must have one more drink he entered and preferred his request trafton said the landlord dont you think youve had enough not quite i want one more glass and then ill go home but you are owing me several dollars clear off that score and then you may have as much as you will ill pay you a dollar on account tomorrow do you mean it yes bobs got some money of mine over a dollar ill get it tonight and bring it round tomorrow of course trafton if youll keep your credit good i wont mind trusting you well what shall it be john trafton gave his order and sat down again in the barroom he felt so comfortable that he easily persuaded himself that there was no hurry about collecting the money in his nephews hands robert was at home by this time and would have no way of spending the balance of his cash its all right said the fisherman ill wait till ten oclock and then ill go home meanwhile robert went out on the cliff and looked about him he looked down upon the waves as they rolled in on the beach and he enjoyed the sight familiar as it was for he had a love of the grand and beautiful in nature i think if i were a rich man thought the poor fishermans boy i would like to build a fine house on the cliff with an observatory right here where i could always see the ocean its something to live here if i do have to live in a poor cabin but i must consider where i will hide my money at his feet was a small tin box which had been thrown away by somebody and it struck robert that this would make a good depository for his money fortunately the cover of the box was attached to it he took the money from his vest pocket and dropped it into the box then he covered it and finding a good place he scooped out the dirt and carefully deposited the box in the hole he carefully covered it up replacing the dirt and took particular notice of the spot so that there would be no difficulty in finding it again whenever he had occasion having attended to this duty he retraced his steps to the cabin and found that the tea had been steeped and the table was covered with a neat cloth and two cups and saucers were set upon it teas all ready robert said his aunt cheerfully the smell of it does me good its better than all the liquor in the world robert did not like tea as well as his aunt but still he relished the warm drink for the night was cool and more than ever he rejoiced to see how much his aunt enjoyed what had latterly been rather a rare luxury about nine oclock robert went to bed and very soon fell asleep he had not been asleep long before he was conscious of being rudely shaken opening his eyes he saw his uncle with inflamed face and thickened utterance whats wanted uncle he asked wheres that money you young rascal give me the dollar and fortytwo cents youre hiding from me chapter vi man against boy as robert scarcely awake looked into the threatening face of his uncle he felt that the crisis had come and that all his firmness and manliness were demanded our hero was not disposed to rebel against just authority he recognized that his uncle poor as his guardianship was had some claim to his obedience in any ordinary matter he would have unhesitatingly obeyed him but in the present instance he felt that his aunts comfort depended in a measure upon his retention of the small amount of money which he was fortunate enough to possess of course he had thought of all this before he went to sleep and he had decided in case his uncle heard of his good luck to keep the money at all hazards for a minute he remained silent meeting calmly the angry and impatient glance of his uncle give me that money i tell you demanded the fisherman with thickened utterance i havent got any money of yours uncle john said robert now forced to say something you lie boy youve got a dollar and fortytwo cents i havent got as much as that but i have nearly as much have you been spending any more money i bought a loaf of bread for six cents then youve got a dollar and thirtysix cents left yes i have give it to me you want to spend it for rum i suppose uncle curse your impudence what difference does it make to you what i do with it robert rose to a sitting posture and carried away by just indignation he said i mean to keep that money and spend it for my aunt there ought to be no need of it you ought to support her yourself and supply her with all she needs but instead of that you selfishly spend all your money on drink and leave her to get along the best way she can you young rascal exclaimed his uncle half ashamed and wholly angry is that the way you repay me for keeping you out of the poorhouse i can support myself uncle john and for the last two years ive done it and helped aunt jane besides there isnt any danger of my going to the poorhouse i would leave cooks harbor tomorrow if i thought aunt jane were sure of a comfortable support but i am afraid you would let her starve robert had never spoken so plainly before and his uncle was almost struck dumb by the boys bold words he knew they were deserved but he was angry nevertheless and he was as firm as ever in his determination to have the money boy he said you are too young to lecture a grown man like me i know whats best to do where did you get the money he demanded with sudden curiosity did you find it in any of my pockets there wouldnt be much use in searching your pockets for money you never leave any behind where did you get it then mr tudor who boards at the hotel gave it to me thats a likely story he gave it to me because i ran after his hat which was blown off by the wind and brought it back to him it was a very expensive hat so he said i know it is a panama hat thats what he called it did you have that money when i saw you coming out of the tavern yard no when you got it why didnt you come and bring it to me because it was my own money you had no right to claim it said robert firmly he is right john said mrs trafton who had listened uneasily to the conversation but had not yet seen an opportunity to put in a word in roberts favor shut up old woman said the fisherman roughly well said he turning to robert ive heard what youve got to say and it dont make a bit of difference i must have the money i refuse to give it to you robert said pale but firm then said john trafton with a curse ill take it he snatched roberts pants from the chair on which they were lying and thrust his hand into one pocket after the other but he found nothing he next searched the vest in the same manner but the search was equally unavailing you neednt search for i havent got the money said robert then where is it it is safe did he give it to you jane demanded the fisherman turning to his wife no do you know where it is no boy where is that money demanded trafton his face flushed go and get it directly i cant it isnt in the house where is it then i hid it where did you hide it i dug a hole and put it in what made you do that because i was afraid you would get hold of it you were right enough there said john trafton grimly for i will get hold of it get right up and find it and bring it to me here mrs trafton again interposed how can you ask such a thing john she said the night is as dark as a pocket how do you expect robert is going to find the money in the dark though john trafton was a good deal under the influence of liquor he was not wholly deaf to reason and he saw the force of his wifes remark in fact he had himself found sorry trouble in getting home from the tavern familiar as the path was to him on account of the intense darkness well i guess itll do tomorrow morning he said i must have it then for ive promised to pay jones a dollar on account i said i would and ive got to keep my promise do you hear that you young rascal yes i hear it then mind you dont forget it thats all ive got to say and the fisherman staggered into the adjoining room and without taking the trouble of removing his garments threw himself on the bed and in five minutes was breathing loud in a drunken stupor mrs trafton did not immediately go to bed she was troubled in mind for she foresaw that there was only a truce and not a cessation of hostilities in the morning her husband would renew his demand upon robert and should the latter continue to refuse to comply she was afraid there would be violence when her husbands heavy breathing showed that he was insensible to anything that was said she began i dont know but youd better give up that money to your uncle she said how can you advise me to do that aunt asked robert in surprise because im afraid youll make him angry if you refuse i cant help it if he is angry answered robert he has no right to be dont you know what he said that he wanted to pay a dollar to the tavern keeper yes mr jones shall never get a cent of that money said robert firmly but robert said his aunt nervously your uncle may beat you then ill keep my distance from him i would rather he would have the money than that you should get hurt robert aunt jane i am going to take the risk of that though he is my uncle and your husband theres one thing i cant help saying it is a contemptibly mean thing not only to use all his own earnings for drink but to try to get hold of what little i get for the same purpose i dont deny it robert i dont pretend to defend my husband once he was different but drink has changed his whole nature i never had any reason to complain before he took to drink no doubt of it aunt but that dont alter present circumstances i have no respect for my uncle when he acts as he has tonight come what may theres one thing i am determined upon he shant have the money youll be prudent robert for my sake entreated mrs trafton yes ill be prudent tomorrow morning i will get up early and be out of the way till after uncle is gone there is no chance of his getting up early and going afishing the deep and noisy breathing made it probable that the fisherman would awaken at a late hour as both robert and his aunt knew she was reassured by his promise and prepared to go to bed soon all three inmates of the little cabin were sleeping soundly chapter vii the next morning robert rose at six the next morning and half an hour later took his breakfast it consisted of fish bread and a cup of tea and though most of my young readers might not be satisfied with it especially as there was no butter robert thought himself lucky to be so well provided for when his breakfast was finished he rose from the table now im off aunt jane he said where are you going robert ill earn some money if i can weve got a little but it wont last long it wont be very easy to find work i am afraid i shall be ready for anything that turns up aunt something turned up yesterday when i didnt expect it thats true just then the fisherman was heard to stir in the adjoining room and robert not wishing to be near when he awakened hastily left the cabin to avoid a repetition of the scene of the previous night mrs trafton breathed a sigh of relief when her nephew was fairly out of the way about an hour later her husband rose and without needing to dress for he had thrown himself on the bed in his ordinary clothes walked into the room where his wife was at work wheres robert he asked he had his breakfast and went out how long ago about an hour ago john trafton scowled with disappointment is he round about home i dont think he is did he say where he was going he said he would try to find a job why didnt you keep him didnt you know i wanted to see him you didnt ask me to keep him said mrs trafton nervously i see how it is said the fisherman youre in league with him what do you mean by that john you know well enough what i mean you dont want him to give me that money mrs trafton plucked up courage enough to say you ought not to ask for it john why shouldnt i ask for it he demanded pounding forcibly on the table because he means to spend it for things we need and you want it to spend at the tavern there you are again always twitting me because after exposing myself to storm and the dangers of the sea i take a little something to warm me up and make me comfortable to hear john traftons tone one might think him a grievously injured man for two years john trafton you have spent threefourths of your earnings at the tavern said his wife quietly you have left me to suffer want and privation that you might indulge your appetite for drink you seem to be alive still he said with an ugly sneer you dont seem to have starved i might have done so but for robert he has brought me fish and bought groceries with what little money he could earn in various ways oh its robert always sneered trafton he is an angel is he hes only done his duty havent i given him the shelter of my roof you havent given him much else retorted his wife ive heard enough of that now shut up said the fisherman roughly what have you got for breakfast mrs trafton pointed to the table on which while her husband had been speaking she had placed his breakfast humph said he discontentedly thats a pretty poor breakfast it is the best i can give you said his wife coldly i dont care for tea id as soon drink slops what do you prefer i prefer coffee i have none in the house if you will bring me home some from the store i will make you a cup every morning but i dont think you would like it without milk do you think i am made of money how do you expect me to buy coffee with the money you would otherwise spend for drink stop that will you said trafton angrily im tired of it a moment later he said in a milder tone when i get that money of roberts i will buy a pound of coffee mrs trafton said nothing do you know where he has hidden it asked her husband after drinking a cup of the tea which he had so decried no didnt he tell you where he was going to put it no you are sure he didnt give it to you to keep i am very glad he didnt why are you glad because you would have teased me till you got it and ill have it yet mrs trafton do you hear that said the fisherman fiercely yes i hear you you may as well make up your mind that i am in earnest what am i to be defied by a weak woman and a halfgrown boy you dont know me mrs t i do know you only too well mr trafton it was an unlucky day when i married you humph there may be two sides to that story well im going where are you going shall you go out in the boat this morning oh you expect me to spend all my time working for my support do you no i am not going out in the boat i am going to the village to the tavern i suppose and suppose i am going to the tavern repeated the fisherman in a defiant tone have you got anything to say against it i have a great deal to say but it wont do any good thats where you are right john trafton left the cabin but he did not immediately take the road to the village first of all he thought he would look round a little and see if he could not discover the hiding place of the little sum which his nephew had concealed he walked about the cabin in various directions examining carefully to see if anywhere the ground had been disturbed in one or two places he thought he detected signs of disturbance and bending over scooped up the loose dirt but fortunately for our hero he was on a false scent and discovered nothing he was not a very patient man and the fresh disappointment for his hopes had been raised in each case made him still more angry the young rascal he muttered he deserves to be flogged for giving me so much trouble from the window of the cabin mrs trafton saw what her husband was about and she was very much afraid he would succeed she could not help painful as it was regarding with contempt a man who would stoop to such pitiful means to obtain money to gratify his diseased appetite if i thought my wife knew where this money is id have it out of her muttered the fisherman with a dark look at the cabin but likely the boy didnt tell her ill have to have some dealings with him shortly he shall learn that he cannot defy me john trafton giving up the search took his way to the village and as a matter of course started directly for the tavern he entered the barroom and called for a drink mr jones did not show his usual alacrity in waiting upon him trafton said he where is that dollar you promised to pay me this morning havent got it answered the fisherman rather embarrassed ill bring it tomorrow morning then tomorrow morning you may call for a drink you aint going back on me mr jones asked john trafton in alarm you are going back on me as i look at it you promised to bring me a dollar and you havent done it ill tell you how it is mr jones my nephew robert has the money but he was gone when i woke up this morning i shall see him tonight and give you the money you neednt wait till then i saw robert pass here only half an hour ago hes somewhere in the village find him and get the money and then ill talk with you there was no appeal from this decision and trafton angry and sullen left the tavern to look for robert chapter viii robert becomes a prisoner one of the most tasteful houses in cooks harbor was occupied in summer by the family of theodore irving a boston lawyer who liked to have his wife and children in the country though his business required him to spend a part of the hot season in the city the oldest son herbert was about a year younger than robert a lively boy fond of manly sports and thoroughly democratic in his tastes he had scraped acquaintance with our hero making the first advances for robert was not disposed to intrude his company where he was not sure it would be acceptable when robert came to the village to avoid meeting his uncle in passing by the house of mr irving he attracted the attention of herbert who was sitting on the edge of the piazza with him was another boy of about his own age a cousin named george randolph he had come to cooks harbor to spend a fortnight with his cousin but the latter soon found that george was very hard to entertain he was seldom willing to engage in any amusement selected by his cousin but always had some plan of his own to propose moreover he was proud of his social position and always looked down upon boys whose dress indicated a humbler rank than his own the two cousins were sitting on the piazza doing nothing herbert had proposed croquet but george pronounced it too warm he also declined ball for a similar reason it seems to me you are very much afraid of the sun said herbert i dont care to get tanned up it looks vulgar said george i like to have a good time even if i do get browned up said his cousin then i dont agree with you said george in a superior tone just then robert was seen approaching theres a boy that will play with me said herbert brightening up what boy there the one that is just coming along that boy why he isnt dressed as well as our coachmans son i cant help that hes a nice fellow bob come here i want you you surely are not going to invite that common boy into the yard protested george hastily why not he has been here more than once by this time robert had reached the gate herbert jumped up and ran to open it i am glad to see you robert said herbert cordially are you in a hurry no herbert then come in and have a game of croquet all right but youll easily beat me never mind youll learn fast bob this is my cousin george randolph george this is my friend robert coverdale george made the slightest possible inclination of the head and did not stir from where he was sitting he doesnt look very social thought robert greeting his friends visitor politely here bob select a mallet and ball shall i start first if you please wont your cousin play im very much obliged im sure for the invitation said george but id rather not george is afraid of being tanned by exposure to the sun explained herbert i hope you are not i dont think the sun will make me any browner than i am already said robert laughing i agree with you said george in a sneering tone robert looked at him quickly struck by his tone and decided that he had no particular desire to become any better acquainted the game of croquet proceeded and herbert was an easy victor i told you i should be beaten herbert said robert of course i am much more used to the game than you i will give you odds of half the game you shall start from the other stake on the return course and i will try to overtake you he came near succeeding but robert beat him by two wickets after three games herbert proposed ball and robert who felt more at home in this game agreed to it youd better join us george said his cousin no i thank you i have no inclination i assure you i dont see what fun there can be in sitting on the piazza you forget that i have an opportunity of witnessing your friends superior playing his tone made it clear to robert that this was a sneer but he had too much selfrespect and too much regard for herbert to take offense at it you mean my awkwardness he said you are quite welcome to the amusement it must afford you george arched his brows in surprise really this ragged boy is talking to me as if he considered me his equal he thought it is herberts fault he should not treat him so familiarly i really dont care to be in such company you must excuse me herbert said george rising with suitable dignity as you are provided with company you can spare me i will go into the house and read for a while very well george i hope i havent driven your cousin away herbert said robert i dont care whether you have or not bob said herbert im awfully disappointed in him papa invited him to visit us thinking he would be company for me but instead of that he objects to everything i propose i find it very hard to entertain him he doesnt appear to fancy me said robert dont mind him bob hes a mean stuckup fellow if he is my cousin perhaps he is not to blame i am only a poor boy belonging to a fishermans family i am afraid i am not a suitable associate for you or him said robert with proud humility no more of that talk bob said herbert youre suitable for me anyhow and i like you twice as much as my cousin i dont care how you are dressed as long as you are a good fellow at any rate you are a good fellow herbert said robert warmly i liked you the very first day i saw you and i can say the same for you bob well never mind about george leave him to his book well amuse ourselves better as robert was playing he caught sight of his uncle on his way to the tavern he knew therefore that he could return home without danger of annoyance and he excused himself to herbert as it was doubtful whether he could get anything to do in the village and as the boat would not be in use he concluded to go out and see if he could not catch a few fish for his aunts dinner well come and play with me again very soon bob said his friend i will herbert thank you for inviting me oh i do that on my own account i like your company thank you robert went home and spent a short time with his aunt before setting out on his fishing trip he only meant to go out a short distance and there was plenty of time before noon he was just getting out the boat when to his dismay he heard a familiar but unwelcome voice hailing him where are you going i am going afishing i thought you were not going to use the boat well i am said the fisherman shortly are you ready to give me that money no uncle said robert firmly i have a right to it you dont need it and aunt does answered our hero well never mind about that now you can go out with me considerably surprised at getting off so easily robert jumped into the boat with his uncle and they pushed off pull for egg island said john trafton egg island so called from its oval shape was situated about three miles from the cliff on which the fishermans cabin stood and probably did not comprise more than an acre of surface it was rocky partly covered with bushes and quite unoccupied robert was puzzled but did not venture to ask his uncle why they were going to this island in due time they reached the rocky isle and the boat was rounded to shore you may jump out and get me a goodsized stick said the fisherman robert obeyed though he feared the stick was to be used on his back he had scarcely scrambled up the bank than he heard the sound of oars and looking back hastily he saw his uncle pushing off from the island im going to leave you here you young rascal till you agree to give me that money said john trafton triumphantly ill let you know that i wont be defied by a boy already the boat was several rods distant robert sat down on a rocky ledge and tried to realize his position he was a prisoner on egg island and there he must stay till his uncle chose to release him chapter ix alone on an island of course our heros position was not to be compared with that of one left on a lonely island in the pacific but it was not agreeable he was only three miles from the mainland but there was no chance to cross this brief distance he had no boat and though he could swim a little he would inevitably have been drowned had he undertaken to swim to shore robert had read robinson crusoe and he naturally thought of that famous mariner on finding himself in a similar position he had never been on egg island before and he knew it only as he had seen it from the mainland or from a boat thats a mean trick of uncle john said robert to himself if i had suspected what he was after i wouldnt have got out of the boat just then he saw the boat turn the fisherman pulling for the island robert felt relieved he was not to be left on the island after all he sat still and waited for the boat to approach well how do you like it asked trafton when he was within a few rods not very well answered our hero you wouldnt care to stay here i suppose no i will take you back into the boat if you will promise to give me that money it was a tempting proposal and robert was half inclined to yield but he reflected his uncle had no claim to the money and if he secured it would spend it for drink while his aunt would lose the benefit of it he summoned all his courage and answered you have no right to the money uncle i cant give it to you if you dont i will row away and leave you then you will be doing a very mean thing said robert with spirit thats my lookout just understand that i am in earnest now what do you say i say no answered our hero firmly then you may take the consequences said his uncle with a muttered curse as he turned the head of the boat and rowed rapidly away robert watched the receding boat and for an instant he regretted his determination but it was only for an instant i have done what i thought to be right he said and i dont believe i shall have cause to repent it i must see what is best to be done he got up and set about exploring his small island kingdom it was very rocky the only vegetation being some scant grass and some whortleberry bushes luckily it was the height of the berry season and there was a good supply on the bushes i shant starve just yet he said cheerfully these berries will keep me alive for a day or two if i am compelled to remain as long there was this advantage about the berries that in a measure they satisfied his thirst as well as his hunger robert did not immediately begin to gather berries for it was yet early and too short a time had elapsed since breakfast for him to have gained an appetite he wandered at random over his small kingdom and from the highest portion looked out to sea far away he saw several sails but there was little chance of being rescued by any if he were seen it would not be supposed that he was confined a prisoner on an island so near the mainland still robert did not feel that he was likely to be a prisoner for a long time there were other fishermen besides his uncle at cooks harbor and by next morning at the farthest he would be able to attract the attention of some one of them as he cruised near the island but it would not be very pleasant to pass a night alone in such an exposed spot not long before a sloop had been wrecked upon the southwest corner of the island and though no lives were lost the vessel itself had been so injured that there had been no attempt to repair or remove it in coasting near the island robert had often thought he would like to examine the wreck but he never had done so it struck him now that he had a capital opportunity to view it at his leisure of leisure unfortunately he had too much on his hands there was a patch of sand at the corner where the sloop had run ashore and the frame of the vessel had imbedded in it a portion had been swept away but a considerable part still remained robert clambered down and began to make an examination of the stranded vessel i suppose it belongs to me if i choose to claim it he said to himself at any rate no one else is likely to dispute my claim wouldnt it be jolly if i could find a keg of gold pieces hidden somewhere about the old wreck that would keep aunt and me for years and we wouldnt feel any anxiety about support this was very pleasant to think about certainly but kegs of gold pieces are not often carried on sloops nowadays as robert very well knew the chief use the old wreck was likely to be to him was in affording materials for a raft by which he might find his way to the mainland our hero made a critical survey of the wreck and tried to pull it apart this was not easy but finally he was enabled to detach a few planks if i only had a saw a hammer and some nails he thought i could build a raft without much difficulty but i dont see how i am going to get along without these for the hammer he soon found a substitute in a hard rock of moderate size there were nails but they were not easy to extricate from the planks as to a saw there was no hope of getting one or anything that would answer the purpose of one robert worked hard for a couple of hours and in that time he had accomplished something he had extricated half a dozen planks of unequal length secured a supply of nails more or less rusty and thus had already provided the materials of a raft the grand difficulty remained to fashion them into a raft which would convey him in safety to the shore of the mainland i have said that he had no saw he had a jackknife however and this was of some use to him particularly in extricating the nails it was slow work but he had all day before him when the two hours were over he began to feel hungry it was not far from the time when he was accustomed to take dinner and he set about satisfying his hunger he went from bush to bush plucking the ripe berries and eating them they were very good but not quite so hearty as a plate of meat and potatoes however he would have had no meat if he had been able to sit down at home after dinner if his repast of berries can be dignified by such a name robert sat down to rest a while before resuming his labors on the raft he finally lay down with his head in the shadow of an unusually large bush and before he was fully aware of the danger he had fallen asleep when he awoke he saw by the position of the sun that it must be about the middle of the afternoon he jumped up hastily and first of all took a hasty glance around to see if he could anywhere descry a boat but none was to be seen i must set about making my raft he decided it is getting late and i dont know how long it may take me it proved to be slow and rather difficult work robert was pounding away with his stone hammer when to his great joy he descried a boat rounding the corner of the island it was rowed by a single boy when he came near robert recognized him as george randolph the cousin of his friend herbert it happened that george was very fond of rowing and had a boat of his own which he rowed a good deal in boston harbor he had long had an ambition to row to egg island and had selected this day for the trip he had not asked herbert to accompany him being desirous of saying that he had accomplished the entire trip alone though george had not seemed very friendly robert did not for a moment doubt that he would be willing to help him in his strait and he was almost as delighted to see him as he would have been to see herbert himself there would be no need now of the raft and he gladly suspended work upon it rising to his feet he called out hello there george paused in his rowing and asked for he had not yet caught sight of robert who calls i robert coverdale then george turning his glance in the right direction caught sight of the boy he had tried to snub in the morning chapter x robert completes the raft what do you want of me asked george superciliously will you come to shore and take me into your boat asked robert eagerly why should i you have no claims on me said george indeed i dont know you i was at mr irvings this morning playing croquet with herbert i am aware of that but that is no reason why i should take you into my boat i prefer to be alone if robert had not been in such a strait he would not have pressed the request but he was not sure when there would be another chance to leave the island and he persisted you dont understand how i am situated he said i wouldnt ask such a favor if i were not obliged to but i have no other way of getting back if you dont take me in i shall probably be obliged to stay here all night how did you come here asked george his curiosity aroused i came in a boat with my uncle then you can go back with him he has gone back already he is offended with me because i wont do something which he has no right to ask and he has left me here purposely isnt your uncle a fisherman yes i dont care to associate with a fishermans boy said george robert had never before met a boy so disagreeable as george and his face flushed with anger and mortified pride i dont think you are any better than herbert he said and he is willing to associate with me though i am a fishermans boy i dont think much of his taste and so i told him said george my father is richer than mr irving he added proudly do you refuse to take me in your boat then asked robert i certainly do although i may be compelled to stay here all night thats nothing to me robert was silent a moment he didnt like to have any quarrel with herberts cousin but he was a boy of spirit and he could not let george leave without giving vent to his feeling george randolph he broke out i dont care whether your father is worth a million it doesnt make you a gentleman you are a mean contemptible fellow how dare you talk to me in that way you young fisherman gasped george in astonishment and wrath because i think it will do you good to hear the truth said robert hotly you are the meanest fellow i ever met and if i were herbert irving id pack you back to the city by the first train you impudent rascal exclaimed george ive a good mind to come on shore and give you a flogging i wish youd try it said robert significantly you might find yourself no match for a fishermans boy i suppose youd like to get me on shore so that you might run off with my boat sneered george i wouldnt leave you on the island at any rate if i did secure the boat said robert well i wont gratify you returned george i dont care to have my boat soiled by such a passenger youll get paid for your meanness some time george randolph ive taken too much notice of you already you low fisherman said george i hope youll have a good time staying here all night he began to row away and as his boat receded robert saw departing with it the best chance he had yet had of escape from his irksome captivity i didnt suppose any boy could be so contemptibly mean he reflected as his glance followed the boat which gradually grew smaller and smaller as it drew near the mainland i dont think im fond of quarreling but i wish i could get hold of that boy for five minutes roberts indignation was natural but it was ineffective he might breathe out threats but while he was a prisoner his aristocratic foe was riding quickly over the waves he rows well thought our hero willing to do george justice in that respect i didnt think a city boy could row so well i dont believe i could row any better myself though ive been used to a boat ever since i was six years old but it would not do to spend all the afternoon in watching george and his boat or he would lose all chance of getting away himself before nightfall with a sigh he resumed work on the raft which he had hoped he could afford to dispense with and finally got it so far completed that he thought he might trust himself on it robert was a little solicitous about the strength of his raft it must be admitted that though he had done the best he could it was rather a rickety concern if the nails had been all whole and new and he had had a good hammer and strong boards he could easily have made a satisfactory raft but the materials at his command were by no means of the best the nails were nearly all rusty some were snapped off in the middle and his stone did not work with the precision of a regular hammer if it will only hold together till i can get to shore he thought i wont care if it goes to pieces the next minute it seems a little shaky though i must try to find a few more nails it may increase the strength of it there was an end of a beam projecting from the sand just at his feet robert expected that probably he might by unearthing it find somewhere about it a few nails and he accordingly commenced operations if he had had a shovel or a spade he could have worked to better advantage but as it was he was forced to content himself with a large shell which he picked up near the shore soon he had excavated a considerable amount of sand and brought to the surface a considerable part of the buried beam it was at this point that he felt the shell strike something hard i suppose it is a stone thought robert and he continued his work with the object of getting it out of the way it was not long before the object was exposed to view what was roberts surprise and excitement to find it an ivory portemonnaie very much soiled and discolored by sea water now i suppose no one can find a purse or pocketbook without feeling his pulse a little quickened especially where as in roberts case money is so much needed he immediately opened the portemonnaie and to his great delight found that it contained several gold pieces as my readers will feel curious to know the extent of his good luck i will state definitely the amount of his discovery there were two gold tendollar pieces two of five one twodollarandahalf piece and fifty cents in silver in all there were thirtythree dollars in gold and silver roberts delight may be imagined if he had felt in luck the day before when he had been paid two dollars how much more was he elated by a sum which to him seemed almost a fortune i am glad george didnt take me on board his boat he reflected if he had i should never have found this money now i dont care if i do stay here all night uncle had little idea what service he was doing me when he left me alone on egg island though robert expressed his willingness to spend the night on egg island he soon became eager to get home so that he could exhibit to his aunt the evidence of his extraordinary luck he anticipated the joy of the poor woman as she saw assured to her for weeks to come a degree of comfort to which for a long time she had been unaccustomed robert examined his raft once more and resolved to proceed to make it ready for service it took longer than he anticipated and it was nearly two hours later before he ventured to launch it he used a board for a paddle and on his frail craft he embarked with a bold heart for the mainland chapter xi a friend goes to the rescue leaving robert for a time we will accompany george randolph on his homeward trip george did not at all enjoy the plain speaking he had heard from robert the more he thought of it the more his pride was outraged and the more deeply he was incensed the lowlived fellow he exclaimed as he was rowing home i never heard of such impudence before he actually seemed to think that i would take as a passenger a common fishermans boy i havent sunk as low as that george was brought up to have a high opinion of himself and his position he really thought that he was made of a different sort of clay than the poor boys with whom he was brought in contact and his foolish parents encouraged him in this foolish belief probably he would have been very much shocked if it had become known that his own grandfather was an honest mechanic who was compelled to live in a very humble way george chose to forget this or to keep it out of sight as it might have embarrassed him when he was making his high social pretensions falsely trained as he had been and with a strong tendency to selfishness george had no difficulty in persuading himself that he had done exactly right in rebuking the forwardness of his humble acquaintance he isnt fit to associate with a gentleman he said to himself what business is it of mine that he has to stay on the island all night if his uncle left him there i dare say he deserved it george did not immediately land when he reached the beach but floated here and there at will enjoying the delightful sea breeze which set in from seaward at length however he became tired and landed the boat did not belong to him but was hired of a fisherman living near by who had an extra boat the owner of the boat was on hand when george landed he was though a fisherman a man of good sound common sense who read a good deal in his leisure moments and was therefore well informed like many other new england men of low position he was superior to his humble station and was capable of acquitting himself creditably in a much higher sphere it is from persons of his class that our prominent men are often recruited it may be mentioned here that though georges father as he liked to boast was a rich man the boy himself was very mean in money matters and seldom willing to pay a fair price for anything he was not above driving a close bargain and to save five cents would dispute for half an hour so youve got back young man said ben bence the fisherman did you have a pleasant trip quite fair answered george in a patronizing tone i rowed over to egg island and back thats doing very well for a city boy said the fisherman i should think it was good for any boy or man either said george annoyed at this depreciation of his great achievement bence laughed why said he im out for four or five hours sometimes i dont think anything of rowing from fifteen to twenty miles while you have rowed only six i dont expect to row as far as a man said george rather taken down the best rower round here among the boys is bob coverdaie said the fisherman what can he do asked george with a sneer he can row ten miles without feeling it said bence does he say so asked george in a meaning tone no but i have seen him do it hes been out with me more than once hes a muscular boy bob is do you know him i have seen him answered george distantly hes a great chum of your cousin herbert irving said bence and so i thought you might have met him this subject was not to georges taste and he proceeded to change it well my good man he said patronizingly how much do i owe you so i am your good man repeated ben bence with an amused smile i am much obliged to you i am sure well you were gone about two hours i reckon i dont think it was quite as much as that said george i guess twentyfive cents will about pay me twentyfive cents repeated george all his meanness asserting itself i think that is a very high price did you expect to get the boat for nothing asked the fisherman surprised of course not i wouldnt be beholden to a fisherman george said haughtily indeed how much did you calculate to pay i think twenty cents is enough then the only difference between us is five cents yes then you can pay me twenty cents i can live without the extra five cents george pleased at gaining his point put two tencent pieces in the hands of the owner of the boat saying i dont care about the five cents of course but i dont like to pay too much i understand master randolph said the fisherman with a quizzical smile in your position of course you need to be economical what do you mean asked george with a flushed face oh nothing answered ben bence smiling the smile made george uncomfortable was it possible that this common fisherman was laughing at him but of course that did not matter and he had saved his five cents george got home in time for supper but it was not till after supper that he mentioned to herbert i saw that young fisherman this afternoon what young fisherman the one you played croquet with this morning oh bob coverdale where did you see him asked herbert with interest on egg island how came he there inquired herbert rather surprised he went there in a boat with his uncle i expect hes there now why should he stay over there so long its a rich joke said george laughing it seems his uncle was mad with him and landed him there as a punishment hes got to stay there all night i dont see anything so very amusing in that said herbert who was now thoroughly interested he wanted me to take him off proceeded george he was trying to build a raft i told him hed better keep at it if george had watched the countenance of his cousin he would have seen that herbert was very angry but he was so amused by the thought of roberts perplexity that he did not notice do you mean to say that you refused to take him off demanded herbert in a quick stern tone that arrested georges attention of course i did what claim had he on me and you deliberately left him there when it would have been no trouble to give him a passage back really herbert i dont like your way of speaking it was my boat or at least i was paying for the use of it and i didnt choose to take him as a passenger george randolph do you want to know my opinion of you asked herbert hotly what do you mean stammered george i mean this that i am ashamed of you you are the most contemptibly mean fellow i ever met and i am heartily sorry there is any relationship between us i consider that an insult exclaimed george pale with anger i am glad you do i mean it as such just tell my mother i wont be back till late in the evening where are you going i am going to get a boat and row to egg island for bob coverdale and herbert dashed up the street in the direction of the beach he must be crazy muttered george looking after his cousin herbert irving reached the beach and sought out ben bence mr bence he said i want to go to egg island if you can spare the time come with me and ill pay you for your time what are you going for master herbert upon this herbert explained the object of his trip now will you go he asked yes answered the fisherman heartily ill go and wont charge you a cent for the boat or my time bob coverdales a favorite of mine and im sorry his uncle treats him so badly strong sturdy strokes soon brought them to the island bob where are you bob called herbert there was no answer the island was so small that he would have been seen if he had been there he must have got off said herbert george said he was building a raft then i mistrust somethings happened to the poor boy said bence gravely he couldnt build a raft here that would hold together till he reached the mainland herbert turned pale i hope it isnt so bad as that he said let us row back as quick as we can chapter xii a mysterious disappearance as they were rowing back they scanned the sea in every direction but nowhere did they discover any signs of robert or his raft perhaps suggested herbert breaking a long silence bob is already at home he looked inquiringly in the face of his companion to see what he thought of the chances mayhap he is said ben bence slowly but i mistrust he found it too rough for the raft in that case said herbert anxiously and stopped without answering the question in that case the poor boys at the bottom of the sea its likely he could swim mr bence yes but the tide would be too strong for him just about now theres a fearful undertow i couldnt swim against it myself let alone a boy if anything has happened to him its his uncles fault said herbert john trafton will have to answer for it said the fisherman sternly there aint one of us that dont love bob hes a downright good boy bob coverdale is and a smart boy too if hes lost i will never have anything more to do with george randolph i will ask mother to pack him back to boston tomorrow george aint a mite like you said ben bence i hope not returned herbert hastily hes one of the meanest boys i ever met he might just as well have taken poor bob off the island this afternoon if he hadnt been so spiteful and ugly it would serve him right to leave him there a while himself suggested bence i agree with you there was another pause each was troubled by anxious thoughts about the missing boy when they reached the shore herbert said im going to mr traftons to see if bob has got home ill go with you said the fisherman briefly they reached the humble cabin of the traftons and knocked at the door mrs trafton opened it good evening mr bence she said i believe this young gentleman is master herbert irving i have often heard robert speak of him is robert at home asked herbert eagerly no he has been away all day answered his aunt do you know where he is inquired ben bence soberly mr trafton wouldnt tell me he said he had sent him away on some errand but i dont see where he could have gone to stay so long it was clear mrs trafton knew nothing of the trick which had been played upon her nephew tell her mr bence said herbert turning to his companion has anything happened to robert asked mrs trafton turning pale they told her how her husband had conveyed robert to egg island and then treacherously left him there to get off as he might was there any difficulty between bob and his uncle asked ben bence yes the boy had a little money which had been given him and my husband ordered him to give it up to him hed have done it if he hadnt wanted to spend it for me he was always a considerate boy and i dont know what i should have done without him mr bence i know its a good deal to ask but i cant bear to think of robert staying on the island all night would you mind rowing over and bringing him back as yet mrs trafton did not understand that any greater peril menaced her nephew mrs trafton we have just been over to egg island said the fisherman and didnt you find him no he was not there but how could he get off he was seen this afternoon making a raft from the old timbers he found in the wreck he must have put to sea on it then why is he not here the sea was rough and mrs trafton who had been standing sank into a chair with a startled look you dont think my boy is lost i hate to think so mrs trafton but it may be from grief there was a quick transition to righteous indignation if the poor boy is drowned i charge john trafton with his death said the griefstricken woman with an energy startling for one of her usually calm temperament whats this about john trafton demanded a rough voice it was john trafton himself who unobserved had reached the door of the cabin ben bence and herbert shrank from him with natural aversion so youre talking against me behind my back are you asked trafton looking from one to the other with a scowl his wife rose to her feet and turned upon him a glance such as he had never met before what have you done with robert john trafton she demanded sternly oh thats it is it he said laughing shortly ive served him as he deserved what have you done with him she continued in a slow measured voice you neednt come any tragedy over me old woman he answered with annoyance i left him on egg island to punish him for disobeying me i charge you with his murder she continued confronting him with a courage quite new to her murder he repeated starting come now thats a little too strong leaving him on egg island isnt murdering him you talk like a fool trafton said ben bence gravely there is reason to think that your nephew put off from the island on a raft which he made himself and that the raft went to pieces for the first time john traftons brown face lost its color you dont mean to say bobs drowned he ejaculated there is reason to fear that he may be ill bet hes on the island now we have just been there and he is not there at length trafton began to see that the situation was a grave one and he began to exculpate himself if he was such a fool as to put to sea on a crazy raft it aint my fault he said i couldnt help it could i if you hadnt left him there he would still be alive and well john trafton pulled out his red cotton handkerchief from his pocket and began to wipe his forehead on which the beads of perspiration were gathering of course i wouldnt have left him there if id known what he would do he muttered did you mean to leave him there all night asked bence yes i meant it as a lesson to him said the fisherman a lesson to him you are a fine man to give a lesson to him you who spend all your earnings for drink and leave me to starve john trafton i charge you with the death of poor robert exclaimed mrs trafton with startling emphasis perhaps nothing more contributed to overwhelm john trafton than the wonderful change which had taken place in his usually gentle and submissive wife he returned her accusing glance with a look of deprecation come now jane be a little reasonable he said youre very much mistaken it was only in fun i left him i thought it would be a good joke to leave him on the island all night say something for me ben theres a good fellow but ben bence was not disposed to waste any sympathy on john trafton he was glad to see trafton brought to judgment and felt like deepening his sense of guilt rather than lightening it your wife is right he said gravely if poor bob is dead you are guilty of his death in the sight of god but he isnt dead its all a false alarm ill get my boat and row over to the island myself very likely he had gone to sleep among the bushes and that prevented your seeing him there was a bare possibility of this but ben bence had little faith in it go if you like he said if you find him it will lift a great weight from your conscience john trafton dashed to the shore flung himself into his boat and with feverish haste began to row toward the island he bitterly repented now the act which had involved him in such grave responsibility he was perfectly sober for his credit at the tavern was temporarily exhausted of course those who remained behind in the cabin had no hope of robert being found they were forced to believe that the raft had gone to pieces and the poor boy in his efforts to reach the shore had been swept back into the ocean by the treacherous undertow and was now lying stiff and stark at the bottom of the sea what shall i ever do without robert said mrs trafton her defiant mood changing at her husbands departure to an outburst of grief he was all i had to live for you have your husband suggested ben bence doubtfully my husband she repeated drearily you know how little company he is for me and how little he does to make me comfortable and happy i will never forgive him for this days work ben bence who was a just man ventured to represent that trafton did not foresee the result of his action but in the sharpness of her bereavement mrs trafton would find no excuse for him herbert too looked pale and distressed he had a genuine attachment for robert whose good qualities he was able to recognize and appreciate even if he was a fishermans nephew he too thought sorrowfully of his poor friend snatched from life and swept by the cruel and remorseless sea to an ocean grave he too had his object of resentment but for george randolph he reflected robert would now be alive and well and he resolved to visit george with his severest reproaches while all were plunged in a similar grief a strange thing happened the door of the cabin was closed by john trafton as he went out suddenly there was heard a scratching at the door and a sound was heard as of a dog trying to excite attention it must be my dog dash said herbert i wonder how he found me out he advanced to the door and opened it before him stood a dog but it was not dash it was a large black dog with an expression of intelligence almost human he had in his mouth what appeared to be a scrap of writing paper this he dropped on the ground when he saw that he had attracted herberts attention what does this mean thought herbert in great surprise and where does this dog come from he stooped and picked up the paper greatly to the dogs apparent satisfaction it was folded in the middle and contained written in pencil the following message which not being directed to any one in particular herbert felt at liberty to read feel no anxiety about robert coverdale he is safe herbert read the message the dog uttered a quick bark of satisfaction and turning ran down the cliff to the beach herbert was so excited and delighted at the news of his friends safety that he gave no further attention to the strange messenger but hurried into the cabin mrs trafton mr bence he exclaimed bob is safe what do you mean what have you heard they asked quickly read this answered herbert giving mrs trafton the scrap of paper who brought it she asked bewildered a dog ben bence quickly asked what do you mean i know nothing more than that a large black dog came to the door with this in his mouth which he dropped at my feet that is very strange said bence he opened the door and looked out but no dog was to be seen do you believe this can it be true asked mrs trafton i believe it is true though i cant explain it answered ben some dogs are wonderfully trained i dont know whom this dog belongs to but whoever it is he doubtless has robert under his care let us be thankful that he has been saved but why dont he come home asked mrs trafton where can he be he was probably rescued in an exhausted condition cheer up mrs trafton you will no doubt see your boy tomorrow i feel like giving three cheers mr bence said herbert then give em boy and ill help you said old ben the three cheers were given with a will and herbert went home his heart much lighter than it had been ten minutes before chapter xiii the cruise of the raft it is time we carried the reader back to the time when robert after launching his rude raft set out from the island of his captivity notwithstanding his rather critical situation he was in excellent spirits the treasure which he had unearthed from the wreck very much elated him it meant comfort and independence for a time at least and in his new joy he was even ready to forgive his uncle for leaving him on the island and randolph for not taking him off ive heard of things turning out for the best was the thought that passed through his mind but i never understood it so well before robert possessed a large measure of courage and he had been used to the sea from the age of six or as far back as he could remember but when he had rounded the island and paddled a few rods out to sea he began to feel serious there was a strong wind blowing and this had roughened the sea and made it difficult for him to guide his extemporized raft in the direction he desired had it been his uncles fishing boat and had he but possessed a good pair of stout oars he would have experienced no particular difficulty he would perhaps have found it rather hard pulling but he was unusually strong for his age and in the end he would have reached the shore but with a frail raft loosely put together and only a board to row or paddle with his progress was very slow he did make a little progress however but it was so little that at the end of fifteen minutes he seemed as far off from the little cabin on the cliff as ever its hard work said robert to himself i wish i had a boat if it were smooth water i could get along with a raft but now he stopped short as the raft was lifted on the crest of a wave and he nearly slid off into the water he looked back to the island and began to consider whether it would not be best after all to paddle back and trust to being taken off the next morning by some fishermans boat no doubt that would have been the most sensible thing to do but robert was very reluctant to relinquish his project had he not devoted several hours to constructing the raft he was trying to navigate and should he allow this time to be thrown away again the prospect of passing a night upon egg island was not very inviting there was nothing to fear of course for the island was too small to be infested by wild animals or even snakes he could no doubt sleep some even if his bed were not very comfortable robert looked back by this time he was half a mile at a rough guess from egg island and between his raft and the mainland there intervened probably two miles and a half of rough sea if i can get within half a mile of shore thought our young hero i wont care for the raft any longer i will plunge into the waves and swim to the shore he looked toward the shore there in plain view was the humble cabin which he called home inside doubtless was his aunt worrying perhaps about his absence how delighted she will be when i tell her of the money i have found thought robert joyfully come bob brace up now and push out boldly for home with his eyes fixed on the cabin our young hero used his paddle with such energy that in the course of half an hour or thereabouts he was about a mile farther on his way he had gone half way and though he was somewhat fatigued he was strong and muscular and the chances were that he would be able to hold out till he reached the boat landing but now a new danger threatened itself the assaults of the sea had strained heavily the raft which he had not been able for want of nails to make strong and secure roberts heart beat with quiet alarm as he realized that there was small chance of his frail craft holding together till he reached shore the danger was hardly realized before it came a strong wave wrenched apart the timbers and robert coverdale found himself without warning spilled into the sea a mile and a half from land instinctively he struck out and began to swim but the distance was great and he was impeded by his clothes looking neither to the right nor to the left but only straight ahead he swam with all the strength there was left to him but he found himself weakening after a while and gave himself up for lost chapter xiv the hermit of the cliff the last thing that robert could remember was the singing of the waters in his ears and a weight as of lead that bore him downward with a force which he felt unable to resist but at the critical moment when the doors of death seemed to be swinging open to admit him he was firmly seized by a slender muscular arm extended from a boat shaped somewhat like an indian canoe and rowed by a tall thin man with white hair and a long white beard in the dusk our hero had not seen the boat nor known that help was so near at hand but the occupant of the boat had from a distance seen the going to pieces of the raft and appreciated the peril of the brave swimmer and paddled his boat energetically toward him just in time to rescue him when already insensible pale and with closed eyes lay robert in the bottom of the boat the old man for so he appeared rather anxiously opened the boys shirt and placed his hand over his heart an expression of relief appeared on his face he will do he said sententiously and turned his attention to the boat half a mile from the cliff on which stood the fishermans cabin was another rising to a greater height to this the stranger directed his boat he fastened it and then raising our hero in his arms walked toward the cliff there was a cavity as wide as a door but less in height through which he passed lowering his head as he entered inside the opening steadily widened and became higher this cavity was about ten feet above the sandy beach and was reached by a ladder on he passed guided amid the darkness by a light from a lantern hanging from the roof the front portion of the cavern seemed like a hall through which a narrow doorway led into a larger room which was furnished like the interior of a house upon a walnut table stood a lamp which the stranger lighted he took the boy already beginning to breathe more freely and laid him on a lounge covered with a buffalo skin at the opposite side of the apartment from a shelf he took a bottle and administered a cordial to robert who though not yet sensible mechanically swallowed it the effect was almost instantaneous the boy opened his eyes and looked about him in bewilderment where am i he inquired what can you remember asked the old man robert shuddered i was struggling in the water he answered i thought i was drowning then gazing at the strange apartment and the majestic face of the venerable stranger he said hesitatingly am i still living or was i drowned he was not certain whether he had made the mysterious passage from this world to the next so strange and unfamiliar seemed everything about him you are still in life answered the stranger smiling gravely god has spared you and a long life is yet before you if he wills and you saved me yes how can i thank you i owe you my life said robert gratefully i am indebted to you for the opportunity once more to be of use to one of my race i dont understand how you could have saved me when i went down i could see no one near on account of the dusk i was not far away in my boat i saw your peril and hastened to your assistance fortunately i was not too late do you know who it is that has saved you yes answered robert you have seen me before yes but not often how do people call me they call you the hermit of the cliff as well that as anything else said the old man what more do they say of me robert seemed reluctant to tell but there was something imperative in the old mans tone some say you are crazy he answered i am not surprised to hear it the world is apt to say that of one who behaves differently from his fellows but i must not talk too much of myself how do you feel i feel weak answered robert doubtless swimming against such a current was a severe strain upon your strength let me feel your pulse he pressed his finger upon roberts pulse and reported that the action was slow it means exhaustion he said you must sleep well and tomorrow morning you will feel as well as usual but i ought to go home said robert trying to rise my aunt will feel anxious about me who is your aunt i am the nephew of john trafton who has a small house on the cliff i know he is a fisherman yes sir dont disturb yourself word shall be sent to your aunt that you are safe i will give you a sleeping draught and tomorrow morning we will speak further somehow robert did not dream of resisting the will of his host the old man had an air of command to which it seemed natural to submit moreover he knew that to this mysterious stranger the hermit of the cliff as the fishermen called him he was indebted for his life and such a man must necessarily be his friend robert was besides in that condition of physical languor when if he had felt disposed he would have found it very difficult to make resistance to the will of another first of all said the old man you must take off your wet clothes i will place them where they can dry so that you may put them on in the morning with assistance robert divested himself of his wet garments as we know he had little to take off the stranger brought out a nightgown and then placed our hero in his own bed wrapping him up in blankets now for the sleeping draught he said from a bottle he poured out a few drops which robert swallowed in less than three minutes he had closed his eyes and was in a profound slumber the old man regarded him with satisfaction as he lay breathing tranquilly upon the bed he is young and strong nature has been kind to him and given him an excellent constitution sleep will repair the ill effects of exposure i must remember my promise to the boy he said turning to the table he drew from a drawer writing materials and wrote the brief message which as we have already seen was duly delivered and then walked to the entrance of the cavern he placed a whistle to his lips and in response to his summons a black dog came bounding to him from the recesses of the grotto and fawned upon him come with me carlo i have work for you he said the dog as if he understood followed his master out upon the beach they walked far enough to bring into clear distinctness the cabin on the cliff do you see that house carlo asked his master directing the dogs attention with his outstretched finger carlo answered by a short quick bark which apparently meant yes carry this note there do you understand the dog opened his mouth to receive the missive and trotted contentedly away the hermit turned and retraced his steps to the cavern he stood beside the bed and saw to his satisfaction that robert was still sleeping peacefully it is strange said he musingly that i should feel such an interest in this boy i had forsworn all intercourse with my kind save to provide myself with the necessaries of life for two years i have lived here alone with my dog and i fancied that i felt no further interest in the affairs of my fellow men yet here is a poor boy thrown on my hands and i feel positive pleasure in having him with me yet he is nothing to me he belongs to a poor fishermans family and probably he is uneducated and has no tastes in common with me yet he is an attractive boy he has a wellshaped head and a bright eye there must be a capacity for something better and higher i will speak with him in the morning he opened a volume from his bookcase to which reference has not as yet been made and for two hours he seemed to be absorbed by it closing it at length he threw himself upon the couch on which robert had at first been placed and finally fell asleep chapter xv the home of the hermit when robert awoke the next morning he found himself alone his strange host was absent on some errand perhaps after a brief glance of bewilderment robert remembered where he was and with the recovery of his strength which had been repaired by sleep he felt a natural curiosity about his host and his strange home so far as he knew he was the first inhabitant of the village who had been admitted to a sight of its mystery for two years the hermit of the cliff had made his home there but he had shunned all intercourse with his neighbors and had coldly repelled all advances and checked all curiosity by his persistent taciturnity from time to time he went to the village for supplies and when they were too bulky to admit of his carrying them he had had them delivered on the beach in front of the entrance to his cave dwelling and at his leisure carried them in himself he always attracted attention as with his tall slender majestic figure he moved through the village or paced the beach or impelled his frail boat but speculation as to who he was or what had induced him to become a recluse had about ceased from the despair of obtaining any light upon these points no wonder then that robert admitted by chance to his dwelling looked about him in curious wonder cavern as it was the room was fitted up with due regard to comfort and even luxury the bed on which our hero reposed was soft and inviting the rough stone floor was not carpeted but was spread with turkish rugs there was a bookcase containing perhaps two hundred books there was a table and writing desk an easychair and a rockingchair and the necessarily dark interior was lighted by an astral lamp diffusing a soft and pleasant light on a shelf ticked a french clock and underneath it was a bureau provided with toilet necessaries no one in the village knew how these articles had been spirited into the cavern no one of the villagers had assisted indeed no one except robert knew that the hermit was so well provided with comforts our hero found his clothes on a chair at his bedside they were drier and suitable for wearing i may as well dress thought robert i wont go away till ive seen the hermit i want to thank him again for taking such good care of me he did not have to wait long however he had scarcely completed his toilet when the hermit appeared so my young friend you arc quite recovered from your bath yes sir that is well i think sir i had better go home now for my aunt will be anxious about me i sent a message to your aunt last evening she knew before she went to bed that you were safe thank you sir i am not apt to be curious but i wish before you leave me to ask you a few questions sit down if you please robert seated himself he felt that the hermit had a right to ask some questions of one whom he had saved how came you so far out at sea on a frail raft if you had been shipwrecked that would explain it but as you have not been to sea i cannot understand it i found myself on egg island without any means of getting off so i made a raft from the timbers of the wreck and launched it i thought it would last long enough for me to reach land it was a hazardous enterprise but how came you on the island surely you did not swim there no sir my uncle carried me there in his boat he refused to take me off unless i would give up some money which i wanted to spend for my aunt was the money yours yes sir it was given me by a gentleman living at the hotel your uncle john trafton is not a temperate man no sir he spends all the money he earns on drink and my aunt and i have to live as we can what a fool is man said the hermit musingly he alone of created beings allows himself to be controlled by his appetites while professing to stand at the head of the universe robert felt that he was not expected to answer this speech and remained respectfully silent till his host resumed his questioning and you said the old man abruptly what do you do sometimes i go out with my uncles boat and catch fish for use at home sometimes i find jobs to do in the village which bring in a little money i am always glad of that for we cant buy groceries without money and my uncle never gives us any my aunt is very fond of tea but once for three weeks she had to do without it that was a pity there are some who find great comfort in tea it is so with aunt jane she says it puts new life in her have you any money now oh i forgot to tell you of my good luck said robert eagerly just before i left the wreck i dug up this and he displayed the purse with the gold pieces in it it would have been a pity if i had been drowned with all this in my pocket my poor boy your young life would have outweighed a thousandfold the value of these paltry coins still i do not depreciate them for they may be exchanged for comforts but will not your uncle seek to take them from you he will not know that i have this money i shall not tell him it will be better for a brief time the hermit gazed at robert in thoughtful silence and then said how old are you fifteen sir have you ever thought of life and its uses i mean of the uses of your own life have you ever formed plans for the future no sir it did not seem of much use i have had to consider how to get enough for my aunt and myself to live upon so your uncles burdens have been laid on your young shoulders have you no aspirations are you willing to follow in his steps and grow up a fisherman like your neighbors no sir i should be very sorry if i thought i must always live here at cooks harbor and go out fishing i should like to see something of the world as i suppose you have yes i have seen much of the world too much for my happiness or i would not have come to this quiet spot to end my days but for a young and guileless boy whose life is but beginning the world has its charms do you care for books i have never looked into many sir but that is not my fault i have half a dozen tattered books at home and i study in some of them every day i have been nearly through the arithmetic and i know something of geography sometimes i get hold of a paper but not often for my uncle takes none and does not care for reading look among my books see if there is any one you would like to read robert had already cast wistful glances at the rows of books in the handsome bookcase he had never before seen so many books together for cooks harbor was not noted for its literary men and book lovers he gladly accepted the hermits invitation his attention was quickly drawn to a set of the waverley novels he had often heard of them and an extract which he had seen in his school reader from rob roy had given him a strong desire to read the story from which it was taken i should like to borrow rob roy he said you may take it when you have read it you may upon returning it have another then i may call to see you sir i shall be glad to have you do so it is an invitation i never expected to give but you have interested me and i may be able to serve you at some time thank you sir if you should ever want any one to run errands for you i hope you will call upon me i should like to make some return for your great kindness that is well thought of you may come to me every tuesday and friday mornings at nine oclock and carry my orders to the village i do not care to go there but have had no messenger i could trust for this service i will pay you two dollars a week robert was astonished at the mention of such liberal payment but sir that is rather too much he began let it be so said the hermit i have money in plenty and it does not bring me happiness in your hands it may do good it will be a great help to me sir it is understood then i will not detain you longer go home and gladden the heart of your aunt robert left the cavern more than ever puzzled by his brief acquaintance with the mysterious recluse chapter xvi the fishermans temptation it is needless to say that robert received a joyful welcome from his aunt her joy was increased when her nephew showed her the gold which he had found upon the island you see aunt he said it wasnt such bad luck after all to be left on the island god has so shaped events as to bring good out of evil answered mrs trafton who was a religious woman and went regularly to church though her husband never accompanied her but i am afraid your uncle will try to get the money away from you i dont want him to know it aunt i shall not tell him robert but he may find out that is not all i have got regular work to do which will bring me in two dollars a week then robert told his surprised aunt the story of his engagement by the hermit who for two years had been the mystery of the village it never rains but it pours you see aunt he said cheerfully he wondered how his uncle would receive him and whether he would make a fresh demand for the small sum of money which had been the cause of the original trouble but john trafton had been thoroughly alarmed by the consequences of his former act and he had besides such experience of roberts firmness that he concluded it would not be worth while to carry the matter any further he greeted robert sullenly so you are back he said gruffly yes answered the boy who took you off i put off on a raft and should have been drowned but for the hermit he saved me you deserved to be drowned for putting off on a raft did you think i was going to stay on the island asked robert with spirit if i had been drowned it would have been your fault none of your impudence boy said john trafton and then he dropped the subject without referring to the money during the day robert called on herbert irving to thank him for his interest in his behalf george was in the yard but his valise was in his hand and he seemed on the point of departure he scowled at robert but didnt speak im glad to see you back bob said herbert warmly what an old rascal your uncle is now tell me all about how you escaped while robert was telling the story the stage drove up and george got on board goodby george said herbert george did not deign a reply and rode sullenly away he doesnt find that the climate of cooks harbor suits him said herbert significantly he doesnt seem very happy about going said robert i didnt expect he would notice me but he did not bid you goodby the fact is george and i have had a flareup said herbert i was disgusted with his heartlessness in refusing to take you from egg island and i told him so pretty plainly he accused me of insulting him and threatened to lay a complaint before my mother i requested him to do so considerably to his surprise she took my part and reproved him for his selfish and disagreeable pride this was too much for the young gentleman and he gave notice that he should return to the city no one attempted to keep him and he has felt compelled to carry out his threat a good deal to his disappointment i am sorry you are losing your visitor on my account herbert you neednt though he is my cousin i am glad to have him go but you will feel lonely not if you come to see me every day bob if we didnt live in a poor cabin i would ask you to visit me never mind about how you live i will come it isnt the house i shall come to see but you some time when you are going out fishing i wish you would take me along with all my heart if you will come to herbert alone robert confided his discovery of the purse of gold it was about a week before robert had occasion to use any of his gold by that time he had spent the balance of the money given him by mr lawrence tudor and was forced to fall back upon his gold having as yet received nothing from the hermit who knew that he was not in immediate want of money abner sands was standing behind the counter in his grocery when robert entered what can i do for ye robert asked the trader you may give me two pounds of tea and six pounds of flour i spose yeve got the money said sands cautiously of course i have youre doin well now robert i take it said the trader better than i used to answered robert he did not choose to make a confidant of mr sands who was a man of great curiosity and an inveterate gossip when the goods were done up in separate parcels robert took out the twodollarandahalf gold piece and passed it to the grocer why i declare its gold exclaimed mr sands wonderingly yes it is gold of all things i didnt expect to get gold from you robert coverdale i reckon youve found a gold mine perhaps i have said robert smiling as he put his hand in his pocket another gold piece dropped to the floor and he picked it up hastily provoked at his carelessness not however before the astonished trader had seen it he was sorely puzzled to know how a poor boy like robert could have so much money in his possession and put one or two questions which our hero evaded the tea and flour came to a dollar and a quarter said the shrewd trader and that leaves a dollar and a quarter to come to you he tendered robert a onedollar bill and twentyfive cents after robert went home mr sands searched his brain in trying to guess where he could have obtained his gold but the more he thought the darker and more mysterious it seemed while in this state of perplexity john trafton entered the store he had seen robert going out with two large parcels and he came in to learn what he could about them how dye do sands he said has bob been in here yes did he buy anything two pounds of tea and half a dozen pounds of flour seems to have considerable money does he inquired trafton eagerly i thought you knew why he paid me in gold in gold ejaculated trafton to be sure he give me a twoandahalf gold piece and that wasnt all he dropped a tendollar gold piece by accident but picked it right up you dont mean it said the fisherman astounded yes i do but i sposed you knew all about it i only know what youve told me the fact is that boy hasnt a spark of gratitude it seems hes rolling in wealth and leaves me to get along as i can nephews aint generally expected to provide for their uncles said abner sands dryly but john trafton did not hear him as he left the store an idea entered his mind he knew that robert had found a friend in the hermit and he decided that the gold came from him if that was the case the hermit must be rich who knows but he might have thousands of dollars in the cave the fishermans eyes sparkled with greed and he was assailed by a powerful temptation his credit at the tavern was about exhausted what a pity he could not get some of the gold which appeared to do its possessor so little good chapter xvii john traftons new plan with the new but unlawful purpose which he had begun to entertain john trafton resolved to find out all he could about the hermit and he rightly judged that robert could give him more information than anybody else he decided to go home early and question his nephew cautiously if he could find out something about the hermits habits and peculiarities it would help him in his plan for there was no beating about the bush now he acknowledged to himself that he meant to enter the cave and if he could only find the gold which he was persuaded the occupant owned in large quantities to enrich himself at his expense his imagination was dazzled at the prospect all his life he had been working for a bare living probably in his most prosperous year not over three hundred dollars in money had come into his hands as the recompense of his toil probably there are few people who do not at some time indulge in dreams of sudden wealth this time had come to john trafton and unfortunately the temptation which came with it was so powerful as to confuse his notions of right and wrong and almost to persuade him that there was nothing very much out of the way in robbing the recluse of his hoards it dont do him any good argued the fisherman while it would make me comfortable for life if i had ten thousand dollars or even five id go away from here and live like a gentleman my wife should be rigged out from top to toe and wed jest settle down and take things easy john trafton was not very strict in his principles and his conscience did not trouble him much even if it had the dazzling picture which his fancy painted of an easy and luxurious future would probably have carried the day it was only eight oclock in the evening when the fisherman lifted the latch of the outer door and entered the cabin his wife and robert looked up in surprise for it was about two hours earlier than he generally made his appearance another surprise his gait and general appearance showed that he was quite sober this was gratifying even if it was the result of his credit being exhausted during the preceding week it may be mentioned that he had worked more steadily than usual having made several trips in his boat and had thus been enabled to pay something on his score at the tavern john trafton sat down before the fire his wife was mending stockings by the light of a candle which burned on the table at her side and robert was absorbed by the fascinating pages of scotts rob roy a side glance showed the fisherman how his nephew was employed and rightly judging where the book came from he seized upon it as likely to lead to the questions he wanted to ask what book have you got there bob he inquired it is a story by sir walter scott uncle never heard of him does he live in boston asked trafton no he was a scotchman some scotchmen are pretty smart ive heard tell scott was a wonderful genius said robert glowing with enthusiasm i dare say he was said the fisherman placidly where did you get the book i borrowed it of the hermit this was the name which robert used for even now he had no knowledge of his mysterious friends name has he got many books a whole bookcase full he must be a rich man suggested john trafton with apparent carelessness i think he is said robert wondering a little at his uncles newborn interest in his new acquaintance but suspecting nothing of his design in asking the question it stands to reason he must be continued the fisherman he doesnt do anything for a living no then of course hes got enough to live on besides all his furniture is very nice cried robert falling into the trap he seems not to mind money and talks as if he was always used to it i spose he pays you for running of errands for him said trafton yes answered robert reluctantly for he feared that his uncle would ask to have the money transferred to him but the next words of trafton reassured him thats all right he said you can spend the money as you please i dont ask you for any of it thank you uncle said robert warmly mrs trafton regarded her husband in surprise he was appearing in a character new to her what could his sudden unselfishness mean i only asked because i didnt want you to work for nothing bob said his uncle not wishing it to appear that he had any other motive as his plan must of course be kept secret from all i wouldnt mind working for nothing uncle it would be small pay for his saving my life robert said with perfect sincerity he wouldnt want you to do it a rich man like him returned the fisherman complacently its the only money he has to spend except what he pays for victuals im glad youve fallen in with him you might as well get the benefit of his money as anybody uncle seems to think i only think of money robert said to himself with some annoyance i begin to like the hermit he is very kind to me he did not give utterance to this thought rightly deeming that it would not be expedient but suffered his uncle to think as he might does the hermit always stay at home in the evening asked the fisherman after a pause sometimes he goes out in his boat late at night and rows about half the night i suppose he gets tired of being alone or else cant sleep john trafton nodded with an expression of satisfaction this would suit his plans exactly if he could only enter the cave in one of these absences he would find everything easy and might accomplish his purpose without running any risk it was clear to him now that the gold of which the trader spoke was given to his nephew by the hermit he was justified in thinking so as there was no other conceivable way in which robert could have obtained it he coveted the tendollar gold piece but he was playing for a higher stake and could afford to let that go for the present at least the fisherman lit his pipe and smoked thoughtfully his wife was not partial to the odor of strong tobacco but tobacco she reflected was much to be preferred to drink and if her husband could be beguiled from the use of the latter by his pipe then she would gladly endure it john trafton smoked about ten minutes in silence and then rose from his chair i guess ill go out on the beach and have my smoke there he said as he took his hat from the peg on which he had hung it on entering the cabin youre not going back to the tavern john said his wife in alarm no ive quit the tavern for tonight ill just go out on the beach and have my smoke there i wont be gone very long when trafton had descended from the cliff to the beach he took the direction of the hermits cave of course he had been in that direction a good many times but then there was nothing on his mind and he had not taken particular notice of the entrance or its surroundings it was a calm pleasant moonlight night and objects were visible for a considerable distance trafton walked on till he stood at the foot of the cliff containing the cave there was the rude ladder leading to the entrance it was short it could be scaled in a few seconds and the box or chest of gold in whose existence trafton had a thorough belief could be found but caution must be used possibly the hermit might be at home and if he were he would of course be awake at that hour besides the cave was dark and he had no light when i come i will bring matches and a candle thought the fisherman i cant find the gold unless i can see my way what a fool this hermit must be to stay in such a place when with his money he could live handsomely in the city but i dont find fault with him for that its so much the better for me he turned his eyes toward the sea and by the light of the moon he saw the hermits slender skiff approaching the old man was plainly visible with his long gray hair floating over his shoulders as he bent to the oars he mustnt see me muttered the fisherman i had better go home chapter xviii a desperate conflict about eight oclock the next evening john trafton sat in the barroom at the tavern enjoying himself in the manner characteristic of the place all day long his mind had been dwelling upon the plan which he had so recently formed and he felt a feverish desire to carry it out one bold stroke he said to himself and i am a made man no more hard work for me i will live like a gentleman it was rather a strange idea the fisherman had that he could live like a gentleman on the proceeds of a burglary but there are many who like him consider that nothing is needed but money to make a gentleman that very night john trafton decided to make the attempt if circumstances seemed favorable he shrank from it as the time approached and felt that he needed some artificial courage for this reason he visited the tavern and patronized the bar more liberally than usual trafton had prudently resolved to keep his design entirely secret and not to drop even a hint calculated to throw suspicion upon him after the event but there is an old proverb that when the wine is in the wit is out and though the fisherman indulged in whisky rather than wine the saying will apply just as well to the one as to the other among the company present in the barroom was one man who had been in the village a day or two but was a stranger to all present he was a short powerfully made man roughly dressed with a low brow and quick furtive eyes that had a look of suspicion in them he had naturally found his way to the tavern bar and proved himself a liberal patron of the establishment therefore the landlord though he did not fancy the looks of his new guest treated him with politeness somehow the conversation on that particular evening drifted to the probable wealth of city people who made their homes at cooks harbor during the summer it was afterward remembered that the roughly dressed stranger had introduced the subject in a casual way its my opinion said ben barton that mr irving is our richest man what makes you think so ben asked the landlord the way he lives partly hes got everything that money can buy besides i heard his boy say that his fathers watch cost him five hundred dollars now it stands to reason that a man dont wear a watch like that unless hes got the money to back it theres something in that the landlord admitted the stranger seemed interested does this irving stay down here himself he asked no he only comes down saturday to stay over sunday does he have much silver in the house i dont know why inquired ben barton turning a surprised look upon the stranger because a real tiptop rich man generally has plenty of plate answered the man after a pause i guess he doesnt keep it down here said barton its likely hes got plenty in the city the stranger shrugged his shoulders does his wife wear diamonds he asked not down here there wouldnt be any occasion does he get his groceries here or in the city he sends them down here by express the stranger seemed to lose all interest in the irving family two or three summer residents were mentioned who were supposed to be rich but it did not appear that any of them kept valuables at their summer homes john trafton had not taken any part in the conversation hitherto and if he had been prudent he would have continued to remain silent but a man excited by drink is not likely to be discreet he broke silence when there came a lull in the discussion theres one man you havent mentioned he said who keeps more money on hand than mr irving or any one else you have spoken of a man in the village here asked the landlord he means you mr jones said ben barton jocosely aint we all of us bringing you money every day you ought to have a pile by this time so i might if all that were owing me would pay up retorted the landlord as ben was one of his debtors this was felt to be a fair hit and there was a laugh at his expense praps trafton means himself suggested ben by way of diversion i wish i did said the fisherman well i may be rich some time stranger things have happened i cant think of any stranger thing than that said ben and the laugh now was at traftons expense but he didnt seem to mind it by this time the general curiosity was aroused who is this rich man youre talkin about trafton asked sam cummings the hermit of the cliff answered the fisherman there was a general rustle of surprise what reason have you for saying that asked mr jones the landlord by this time however john trafton began to suspects that he had been imprudent and he answered with a mysterious shake of the head ive no call to tell you that but ive got my reasons cant you tell us john asked ben barton i might but i wont but i stand by what ive said doesnt your boy do errands for the hermit asked the landlord suppose he does and he goes into the hermits cave perhaps he does and perhaps he doesnt i know he does for i was on the beach a day or two ago and i see him aclimbin the ladder and goin in said ben barton youll have to ask him about that said the fisherman whereabouts is his cave asked the stranger who had listened intently to what had been said one of the party described its location fully then ive seen it said the other i was walking on the beach this morning and i wondered what the ladder was for he asked various questions about the hermit and his mode of life which excited no wonder as the curiosity about the hermit was shared by all john trafton allowed himself to say one thing more that increased this feeling i wont tell all i know he said but i can tell you this hermit lives like a prince hes got handsomer furniture than there is in any house in cooks harbor no one had told the fisherman this but he knew the statement would make a sensation and chose to embellish what he had heard from robert thats a strange idea to furnish a cave that way said the stranger it may be strange but its true do you think he keeps a good deal of money by him asked the stranger with evident interest john trafton nodded significantly the conversation now drifted into other channels the stranger ordered another glass of whisky and went out where is that man staying asked cummings not here answered the landlord i dont like his looks and dont care where he stays as long as he dont ask for a room here you dont mind selling him drink landlord not as long as hes got money to pay thats a different matter a few minutes later john trafton left the tavern he had drunk considerable but not enough to make him incapable of action the drink excited him and nerved him for the task he had in view for upon this very evening he had decided to force an entrance into the hermits mysterious residence and he hoped to be well paid for his visit he had to pass his own cabin on the way he glanced toward it and saw a light shining through the window but he took care to keep far enough away so that he might not be seen half a mile farther and he stood opposite the cavern there was the ladder making access to the cave easy he looked for the hermits boat which was usually kept fastened near the entrance to the cave and to his joy he saw that it was missing the old man must be out in his boat he said to himself all the better for me if i am quick i may get through before he gets back with a confident step he ascended the ladder and entered what might be called the vestibule of the cave he halted there to light the candle he had brought with him he was bending over striking the match against his foot when he was attacked from behind and almost stunned by a very heavy blow he recovered himself sufficiently to grasp his assailant and in an instant the two were grappling in fierce conflict i never thought the old man was so strong passed through the fishermans mind as he found himself compelled to use his utmost strength against his opponent chapter xix a tragedy on the beach it is hardly necessary to say that the man with whom the fisherman was engaged in deadly conflict was not the hermit it was the stranger who in the tavern had manifested so much curiosity on the subject of the rich residents of cooks harbor he was a desperado from new york who being too well known to the police of that city had found it expedient to seek a new field where he would not excite suspicion he had arrived at the cave only a few minutes before the fisherman and had already explored the inner room in search of the large sum of money which trafton had given him to understand the hermit kept on hand he had no candle but he found a lamp and lighted it he was in the midst of his search when he heard the entrance of the fisherman he concluded very naturally that it was the hermit and he prepared himself for an attack he instantly extinguished the lamp and stole out into the vestibule it was his first thought to glide by the supposed hermit and escape but this would cut him off from securing the booty of which he was in quest he resolved upon a bolder course he grappled with the newcomer confident of easily overcoming a feeble old man but to his disagreeable surprise he encountered a vigorous resistance far beyond what he anticipated neither of the two uttered a word but silently the fierce conflict continued i must be weak if i cannot handle an old man thought the professional burglar and he increased his efforts if he masters me and finds out who i am i am lost thought john trafton and he too put forth his utmost strength the fisherman had the disadvantage in one respect he was wholly unarmed and his opponent had a knife when he found that trafton who was of muscular build was likely to gain the advantage with a muttered oath he drew his knife and plunged it into his opponents breast they were struggling just on the verge of the precipice and trafton when he felt the blow tottered and fell his antagonist with him the old fools dead and i must fly thought the burglar with hasty step he fled along the sands till he came to a point where he could easily scale the cliff reaching the top he walked quickly away from cooks harbor half an hour later the hermit beached his boat fastened it and proceeded to his quarters he was plunged in thought and observed nothing till he stumbled against the fishermans body some drunken fellow probably he said to himself he lit a match and bending over was horrorstricken to see the fixed features and the blood upon the garments of the unfortunate fisherman there has been murder here who can it be he exclaimed he lit another match and took a closer look as i live it is trafton roberts uncle he cried what mystery is here how did the unhappy man come to his death he was not long left to wonder alone for robert as was not unusual with him had been taking an evening stroll on the beach and seeing his employer came up to speak to him good evening sir he said as yet innocent of the sad knowledge which was soon to be his is anything the matter robert said the hermit solemnly prepare yourself for a terrible surprise a man has been killed and that man is my uncle exclaimed our hero in dismay yes it is he how did it happen sir asked robert a frightful suspicion entering his mind i know no better than you my boy i have just arrived from an evening trip on the water i was about to enter my quarters when i stumbled over your uncles body what could have brought him here i cannot tell nor can i conjecture who killed him it cant be he thought robert dismissing his fleeting suspicion what shall i do sir he asked unprepared with his boyish inexperience to decide what to do under such terrible circumstances go and summon some of your neighbors to carry the poor man to his home meanwhile break the news to your aunt as you best can said the hermit in a tone of quiet decision but should i not call the doctor it will be of no avail your uncle is past the help of any physician go and i will stay here till you return the startling news which robert brought to the fishermen served to bring men women and children to the spot where john trafton lay ghastly with blood well known as he was the sight startled and agitated them and in their ignorance of the real murderer suspicion fastened upon the hermit who tall and dignified with his white hair falling upon his shoulders stood among them like a being from another world traftons habits were well known but the manner of his death enlisted public sympathy poor john said tom scott ive known him man and boy for amost fifty years and i never thought to see him lying like this and what will you do with his murderer asked his wife in a shrill voice mrs scott was somewhat of a virago but she voiced the popular thought and all looked to scott for an expression of feeling he ought to be strung up when hes found said scott you wont have to look far for him im thinkin said mrs scott what do you mean wife asked scott who was not of a suspicious turn there he stands said the virago pointing with her extended finger to the hermit as this was a thought which had come to others hostile eyes looked upon the hermit and two or three moved forward as if to seize him the old man regarded the fishermen with surprise and said with dignity my friends what manner of man do you think i am that you suspect me of such a deed theres no one could have done it but you said a young man doggedly here lies trafton at the foot of your ladder with no one near him but you you was found with him its a clear case to be sure exclaimed two or three of the women didnt robert find you here standin by the dead body of his uncle the hermit turned to our hero who stood a little in the background and said quietly robert do you think i killed your uncle i am sure you didnt said robert manfully meeting the angry glances which were now cast upon him i am glad to have one friend here said the hermit one who judges me better than the rest of my neighbors he doesnt know anything about you and hes only a boy said mrs scott thrusting herself forward with arms akimbo i allus said there was something wrong about you or you wouldnt hide yourself away from the sight of men in a cave like as not youve committed murder before my good woman said the hermit with a sad smile i am sorry you have so poor an opinion of me dont you call me good woman said mrs scott provoked im no more a good woman than yourself i tell you friends and neighbors youll do wrong if you let this man go we may all be murdered in our beds she was interrupted by the arrival of mrs trafton who had not been apprised of the tragedy from considerations for her feelings but hearing the stir and excitement had followed her neighbors to the spot and just ascertain what had happened where is my husband she cried all made way for her feeling that hers was the foremost place and she stood with startled gaze before her dead husband ill as he had provided for her and unworthy of her affections as he had proved at that moment she forgot all but that the husband of her youth lay before her bereft of life and she kneeled sobbing at his side the hermit took off his hat and stood reverently by her side oh john she sobbed i never thought it would come to this who could have had the heart to kill you thats the man he murdered him said mrs scott harshly pointing to the hermit the widow lifted her eyes to the man of whom she had heard so much from robert with a glance of incredulity he was too proud to defend himself from the coarse accusation and returned her look with a glance of sympathy and compassion i never can believe that said the widow in utter incredulity he has been kind to my boy he never would lift his hand against my husband the hermit looked deeply gratified mrs trafton he said you are right i had no cause to harm your husband nor would i have killed him for roberts sake whatever wrong he might have done me but in truth i know of no reason why i should seek to injure him if you are an innocent man persisted mrs scott tell us who you are and what brought you here yes tell us who you are echoed two others who had always felt curious about the hermit i do not choose to declare myself now said the hermit gravely the time may come when i shall do so but not now thats because youre a thief or murderer exclaimed mrs scott exasperated wife youre goin too far said her husband mind your own business tom scott retorted his wife in a tone with which he was only too familiar you ought to be ashamed of yourself tryin to screen the murderer of your nextdoor neighbor i am doing nothing of the kind theres no proof that the hermit of the cliff murdered john trafton you must be a fool if you cant see it said mrs scott robert coverdale was shocked to hear his friend so abused and he said boldly mrs scott i dont know who murdered my poor uncle but i know the hermit did not he has been a good friend to me and he is no murderer go home and go to bed boy said mrs scott violently you take that mans part against your poor uncle robert was provoked and answered with energy i would sooner suspect you than him i never heard the hermit say a word against my uncle while only yesterday you called him a drunken vagabond this so turned the tables on mrs scott that she was unable to return to the attack well if i ever she ejaculated tom scott are you goin to see your wife sassed by a boy it seems to me wife that the boy is in the right in this instance answered tom who had a sense of justice so you turn against your lawful wife do you exclaimed mrs scott violently ill come up with you yet see if i dont tom scott shrugged his shoulders with resignation ive no doubt you will he answered with a half smile my friends said the hermit with calm dignity as it appears that some of you suspect me of this dastardly deed i am quite willing to submit to any restraint you may desire till the groundlessness of the charge appears you may leave a guard here in the cave or i will accompany you to any of your own houses i certainly have no desire to escape while such suspicions are entertained robert indignantly protested against such a step but the hermit stayed his words robert he said it is better it will do me no harm and under the circumstances while the matter is involved in mystery i admit that it is perfectly justifiable and proper my friends i am in your hands what will you do with me mrs scott expressed her opinion that he should be strung up immediately but no one seconded her it was decided that two of the fishermen should remain at the cave that night to prevent any attempt at escape on the part of the hermit the body of the murdered fisherman was carried to his own cabin and properly cared for till the coroner who must be brought from a neighboring town should make his appearance chapter xx mr jones makes a call when morning dawned a new face was put upon the matter steps were discovered leading from the scene of the murder along the beach and up the cliff there were also discovered signs of a struggle in the cave and it became clear that there had been a conflict and that one of the two concerned had escaped of course it could not have been the hermit for he was now in custody moreover a fisherman who had been out in his boat in the evening remembered meeting the hermit rowing at about the time the murder must have been committed these discoveries cleared the hermit but the question arose who was this other man there was no difficulty in solving this question there were plenty who remembered the stranger who had spent a part of the previous evening in the barroom of the tavern and his evident curiosity as to the wealth of the hermit was also remembered the real state of the case was now pretty well understood this stranger had suddenly resolved to rob the hermit and had secretly found his way to the cavern but how did he happen to find the fisherman there and what was the object of the latter then it was remembered that trafton also had seemed much interested in the supposed hoards of the hermit and when his own want of money was considered it was suspected that he too went on an errand similar to the burglar but he was dead and his neighbors who knew that he must have yielded to the force of a sudden and new temptation did not care to speculate upon his object they were disposed to spare their old neighbor and charitably drop a veil over his attempted crime which had brought upon him such fearful retribution of course the hermit was released from custody and there was not a person in the village who did not acquit him of all wrong except mrs scott who could not forgive him for proving her suspicions groundless you may say what you will she said perversely i know the mans a burglar or a murderer or something else bad he couldnt have murdered john trafton for we traced the murderers steps on the beach there is no doubt it was that stranger we saw in the barroom so said her husband i dont care whether he murdered john trafton or not said mrs scott im sure hes murdered somebody and im ready to take my bible oath of it what makes you so prejudiced against the poor man he hasnt done you any harm mrs scott i dont like the airs he puts on he looks at you jest as if you were dust beneath his feet what right has he to look down upon honest people i want to know but mrs scott did not succeed in creating a prejudice against the hermit whose courageous and dignified bearing had impressed all who observed his manner in this trying crisis when the funeral was over the hermit called in the evening upon the widow of john trafton it was the first he had ever made upon any of his neighbors and it excited surprise robert brought forward the rockingchair and invited the visitor cordially to sit down mrs trafton said the hermit i want to thank you and robert for the confidence you showed in me at a time when all others suspected me of a terrible deed you were the ones most affected yet you acquitted me in your hearts just for a moment i suspected you when i saw you standing by the dead body of my uncle said robert but it was only for a moment i respect you for your fearless candor my boy you were justified in your momentary suspicion i am ashamed of it you had been such a kind friend it was only natural and now my friends what are your plans how will you be able to maintain yourselves i dont think it will make much difference began robert hesitatingly my husband did very little for our support said mrs trafton not more certainly than his own food amounted to you know sir i think robert must have told you the unfortunate habits of my poor husband he was enslaved by drink and he spent nearly all he earned in the barroom yes i knew what your husbands habits were said the hermit gently it is a great pity he could not have lived to change them i am afraid he never would said the widow they had grown upon him from year to year and he seemed to get weaker and weaker in purpose i had a brother who was equally unfortunate said the hermit there are few families who are wholly free from the evils of intemperance but have you formed any plans i suppose we can get along as we have answered mrs trafton with what you kindly pay robert and what he can pick up elsewhere and the sewing i do i think we can get along do you own this cottage inquired the hermit yes sir then you will have no rent to pay no i dont know how we could do that the hermit looked thoughtful i will see you again he said as he rose to go on the whole mrs trafton and robert were likely to get along as well as before john traftons death robert could use his uncles boat for fishing selling what they did not require while regularly every week two dollars came in from the hermit it was a great source of relief that no rent must be paid the fishermans cabin and lot originally cost about five hundred dollars and the household furniture was of little value the taxes were small and could easily be met so there seemed nothing to prevent their living on in the same way as before some time robert hoped and expected to leave cooks harbor he was a smart enterprising ambitious boy and he felt that he would like a more stirring life in a larger place he was not ashamed of the fishermans business but he felt qualified for something better it did not escape his notice that most of his neighbors were illiterate men who had scarcely a thought beyond the success of their fishing trips and he had already entered so far into the domain of study and books as to feel the charm of another world the great world of knowledge which lay spread out before him and beckoned him onward but he was not impatient my duty at present he reflected is to stay in cooks harbor and take care of my aunt i am young and strong and i dont mean that she shall want for any comforts which i can get for her he soon learned however that there was one great mistake in his calculations robert was sitting by the door reading after his return from a fishing trip about a week after his uncles funeral when he heard the steps of some one approaching looking up he saw advancing toward their humble residence the stout ponderous figure of nahum jones the landlord of the village inn it was not often that mr jones found his way to the beach usually he kept close to the tavern unless he rode to some neighboring town therefore robert was surprised to see him nahum jones nodded slightly and taking off his straw hat wiped the perspiration from his forehead here you bob he said is your aunt at home yes sir answered robert but not cordially for he felt that mr jones had been no friend of his uncle well tell her ive come to have a talk with her do you hear yes i hear answered the boy coolly he rose from his chair and entered the house aunt jane he said here is mr jones come to see you what the tavern keeper asked his aunt in great surprise yes aunt what can that man want of me the question was answered not by robert but by nahum jones himself i want to have a little talk with you maam said the burly landlord entering without an invitation and seating himself unceremoniously i will listen to what you have to say mr jones said the widow but i will not pretend that i am glad to see you you were an enemy to my poor husband i dont know what you mean mrs trafton did he ever tell you that i was his enemy no but it was you who sold him liquor and took the money which he should have spent on his own family all nonsense maam you women are the most unreasonable creatures i didnt ask him to drink you tempted him to do it i deny it said the landlord warmly i couldnt refuse to sell him what he asked for could i you must be a fool to talk so said the landlord roughly ill trouble you to speak respectfully to my aunt mr jones said robert with flashing eyes mind your own business you young rascal said nahum jones whose temper was not of the best i mean to retorted robert my business is to protect my aunt from being insulted wait till youre a little bigger boy said jones with a sneer robert involuntarily doubled up his fist and answered i mean to protect her now mrs trafton said nahum jones highly irritated youd better silence that young cub or i may kick him out of doors you appear to forget that you are not in your own house nahum jones said the widow with dignity my nephew has acted perfectly right and only spoke as he should so you sustain him in his impudence do you snarled jones showing his teeth if that is all you have come to say to me mr jones you may as well go by george maam you are mighty independent i am not dependent on the man who ruined my poor husband no but youre dependent on me exclaimed the landlord pounding the floor forcibly with his cane will you explain yourself sir i will said mr jones emphatically you talk about my not being in my own house but its just possible you are mistaken what do you mean asked mrs trafton startled i mean this that i hold a mortgage on this house for two hundred dollars and thats as much as it will fetch at auction what do you say to that robert looked and felt as much troubled as his aunt on his young shoulders fell this new burden and he was at an utter loss what could be done i thought id shut you up you young cub said the landlord glancing maliciously at robert you havent shut me up retorted robert with spirit what have you got to say hey that you ought to be ashamed to take all my uncles earnings and then steal his home thats what ive got to say ive a great mind to give you a caning said mr jones in a rage youd better not said robert he was as tall as the landlord and though not as strong considerably more active and he did not feel in the least frightened nahum jones was of a choleric disposition and his face was purple with rage but he hadnt yet said all he intended i give you warning mrs trafton he said shaking his cane at our hero that im going to foreclose this mortgage and turn you into the street youve got yourself to thank you and this young rascal i came here thinking id be easy with you but i dont mean to stand your insulting talk ill give you four weeks to raise the money and if you dont do it out you go bag and baggage perhaps when youre in the poorhouse you may be sorry you didnt treat me better oh robert what shall we do asked the poor woman her courage failing as she reflected on the possibility that the landlords prediction might be fulfilled dont be alarmed aunt jane ill take care of you said robert more cheerfully than he felt oh you will will you sneered mr jones anybodyd think to hear you that you were worth a pile of money if your aunt depends on you to keep her out of the poorhouse i would not give much for her chance you wont have the satisfaction of seeing either of us there said robert defiantly you neednt expect my wife to give you any more sewing said mr jones scowling at the widow i dont think my aunt wants any considering she hasnt been paid for the last work she did said robert what do you mean by that i credited your uncle with twentyfive cents on his score without my aunts consent mr jones was so incensed at the defiant mien of the boy that he rocked violently to and fro so violently that the chair whose rockers were short tipped over backward and the wrathful landlord rolled ignominiously on the floor heres you hat mr jones said robert smiling in spite of himself as he picked it up and restored it to the mortified visitor youll hear from me roared the landlord furiously aiming a blow at robert and leaving the room precipitately youll repent this day see if you dont after he had left the room robert and his aunt looked at each other gravely they had made an enemy out of a man who could turn them out of doors the future looked far from bright chapter xxi the hermits secret mr jones in his anger at robert regretted that he must wait four weeks before he could turn him and his aunt out of the house it would be a great satisfaction to him to see the boy without a roof to shelter him reduced to becoming a tramp or to take refuge in the poorhouse by george ill humble the young beggars pride exclaimed mr jones as he hastened homeward from his unsatisfactory interview it must be admitted that robert had not been exactly respectful but on the other hand it is quite certain that the landlord had been rude and rough in manner and speech why then did not mr jones foreclose the mortgage instantly and gratify his resentment because in the instrument there was a proviso requiring a notice of four weeks however he felt that it would make little difference they cant raise the money in four weeks he reflected theres nobody round here who will lend them the money and they dont know anybody anywhere else so on the whole he was satisfied four weeks would soon pass and then his thirst for revenge would be sated what makes you so sober my boy asked the hermit when robert made his regular call upon him the next day i feel anxious answered the boy but why need you you told me your uncle did very little for the family i think you will be able to take care of your aunt if not i will help you more thank you sir you are very kind but we thought when you called the other day that we owned the house and would have no rent to pay were you mistaken about this asked the hermit quickly it seems so mr jones the tavern keeper has a mortgage on the property and threatens to foreclose in four weeks unless the money is paid of course we cant pay him and i suppose we shall be turned out how large is this mortgage two hundred dollars that is not a very great sum it is very large to us you know how poor we are but have you no friend who will lend you the money no sir are you sure of that asked the hermit with a peculiar smile which inspired new hope in robert then without waiting for a reply the man continued if you are willing i will pay this mortgage when the time comes and i will be your creditor instead of mr jones how can i thank you exclaimed robert joyfully my aunt will be delighted tell her then but no one else it will give mr jones a surprise it wont be a pleasant one he was very rude and impolite and said he hoped to see us in the poorhouse i dont believe you will ever go there robert said the hermit looking earnestly at the strong energetic face of the boy before him no sir i dont believe we will but you are doing a great deal for us sir how can i ever repay you if there was anything i could do for you i should be glad perhaps you can said the hermit in a musing tone let me know what it is sir and ill be glad to do it have you ever wondered asked the hermit abruptly why i have left the haunts of men and retired to this outoftheway spot yes sir i have thought of that often your curiosity is natural i am not a poor man in fact i should be called rich poverty and pecuniary troubles therefore have nothing to do with my strange act as the world considers it in my life there have been two tragedies i was married at the age of thirty to a very beautiful young lady whom i tenderly loved i made my home in a city of considerable size and lived as my means warranted one evening as my wife stood before the open grate dressed for a party her dress caught fire and before help could arrive she was fatally injured of course the blow was a terrible one but i had a child a boy of five on whom my affections centered a year later he mysteriously disappeared and from that day i have never heard a word of him when search proved unavailing i became moody and a settled melancholy took possession of me i could not endure the sight of other parents happy in the possession of children and i doomed myself to a solitary life wandering here and there till two years since i chanced to find this cave and made my home here how old would your son be now asked robert with interest about your own age perhaps a little older it was this and a fancied resemblance which attracted me toward you had you any suspicion that your son was stolen asked robert yes in particular i suspected a cousin who would be my probable heir in case my boy died but i could never prove anything and the man expressed so much sympathy that i was ashamed to avow any suspicions but charles waldo was a covetous man insatiable in his greed of money and absolutely cold and unsympathetic though his manner was plausible he hoped that this second blow would kill me but he has been disappointed if the boy is living perhaps he knows where he is said robert if he abducted him yes he would not kill him for he is too cautious a man and has too great fear of the law where is mr waldo now living in ohio he has a large farm and a moderate amount of money invested some twenty thousand dollars perhaps so that he is able to live at ease he was disappointed because i would not give him the charge of my property but with the lingering suspicion in my mind i could not make up my mind to do it he also sought a loan of ten thousand dollars which i refused how then does he expect to be your heir asked robert twothirds of my property is entailed and must be left to him if my boy is dead if he really stole your son he must be a wicked man said robert with boyish indignation at the thought yes for he has wrecked two lives mine and my boys have you no hope of ever again seeing your son only a slight one i have thought of a plan in which i need your help if i can help you sir said robert heartily i will do so gladly i do not doubt it robert said the hermit kindly i will explain my meaning if charles waldo knows anything of my lost boy he must from time to time hold communication with him and if he is watched he may some day reveal his hiding place why do you not go out to where he lives and watch him it would do no good it would only put him on his guard i intend this office for you for me exclaimed robert in amazement yes you are young but you have natural ability and shrewdness at any rate you are the only one i have to send it is a desperate chance but i shall feel better satisfied when i have tried it i will follow your instructions whenever you wish said robert his heart beating at the prospect of seeing something of that world of which he had seen so little and heard so much my instructions will be few i must trust much to your shrewdness you will need to visit the town where my cousin lives to observe his habits and any unusual visitors he may have in fact try to arrive at the knowledge of the secret if there is one connected with my boys disappearance what was your sons name julian huet my own name is gilbert huet but this information is for your ear alone i will not mention it sir you need not feel anxious about leaving your aunt i will see that her wants are provided for during your absence thank you sir and the mortgage shall be paid when it comes due i wish i could be here to see mr jones disappointed you can hardly be back so soon it may take you six months the task is one that will require time by the way i do not wish you to mention to your aunt the nature of your errand merely tell her that you are traveling on business for me very well sir how soon do you wish me to start at the beginning of next week i am afraid sir i have no clothes that are fit to wear said robert with hesitation you will provide yourself in boston with a suitable outfit you will be supplied with an ample sum of money and i will instruct my bankers to honor any drafts you may make you will be spending a great deal of money for me mr huet i am rich and living as i have each year this made me richer i will not grudge ten twenty fifty thousand dollars if you find my boy or bring me a clew which will lead to his discovery robert was dazzled it was evident that the hermit must be very rich he walked home in high spirits he was on the eve of an exciting journey and he enjoyed the prospect chapter xxii two persons are surprised aunt said robert his face aglow with excitement i am going to make a journey i hope you wont feel lonely while i am away a journey exclaimed mrs trafton in astonishment yes i am going away on business for the hermit where are you going to boston first to boston lands sake how can a boy like you find your way round in such a great city as boston a boy of my age ought to be able to take care of himself why child youll lose your way theres ever so many streets and roads i went to boston once and i got so puzzled i didnt know whether i stood on my head or my heels if there was some older person going with you now aunt dont make a baby of me i guess i can get along as well as anybody well you can try it when will you be back when i get my business done you wont be gone over two days i calculate i may be gone two months or more well i never exclaimed the astonished woman staring at robert as if she thought his mind was wandering what sort of business is it thats going to take so long the hermit wants it kept secret aunt jane but how am i going to get along without you asked his aunt in dismay i cant go out fishing and the money i earn by sewing is almost nothing robert smiled for he knew he could allay his aunts fears the hermit will pay you five dollars a week while i am gone and here is the first weeks pay he said drawing from his pocket a bill well i must say your friend the hermit is a gentleman five dollars a week is more than i can spend then save a part of it if you like aunt but what shall i do robert if mr jones comes upon me to pay the mortgage when you arc gone said his aunt with new alarm the hermit has agreed to pay off the mortgage and take one himself for the same amount he is very kind robert dont you think that i ought to call and thank him what call at the cave yes no aunt said robert hastily he would not like to have you you can wait till you see him but mind you dont tell anybody least of all mr jones that you will be able to pay the mortgage as he is so mean we want to give him a surprise just as you say robert i am glad well be able to disappoint him for he is certainly a very mean man now when do you want to start for boston tomorrow but how am i going to get ready your shirts and socks so soon i shall not take any of them robert coverdale you must be crazy you cant wear one shirt for two months if youre going so long i dont expect to aunt said the boy smiling i am going to buy a whole outfit of new things when i get to boston the hermit wants me to he must be awful rich said the good woman whose ideas on the subject of wealth were limited all the better for us aunt jane as he is willing to spend some of his money for us mrs trafton was considerably excited by the prospect of roberts journey and notwithstanding what he had said occupied herself in washing his clothes and making a small bundle for him to carry but robert declined taking them with a smile you see aunt my clothes wouldnt be good enough to wear in boston he said just keep them till i get back perhaps i may need them then ill lay em away carefully robert when you get a little larger i guess youll be able to wear some of your uncles clothes his best suit might be made over for you he hadnt had it but six years and theres a good deal of wear in it yet i might cut it over myself when youre gone better wait till i come back aunt said robert hastily he knew the suit very well it was snuffcolored and by no means a good fit even for his uncle while under his aunts unpracticed hands it would probably look considerably worse when made over for him it must be confessed that roberts ideas were expanding and he was rapidly growing more fastidious he instinctively felt that he was about to turn a new leaf in his book of life and to enter on new scenes in which he was to play a less obscure part than had been his hitherto in the little village of cooks harbor but no such change had come to his aunt she still regarded robert as the same boy that he always had been born to the humble career of a fisherman and she examined her husbands best suit with much complacency mentally resolving that in spite of roberts objection she would devote her leisure time to making it over for him he can wear it for best for a year or two she thought and then put it on every day i am sure it will look well on him in the evening robert went to the cave to have a farewell interview with the hermit or gilbert huet to give him the name which was properly his you may write to me about once a week if you have anything to say robert said the hermit how shall i direct you sir shall i use your name how am i known in the village they call you the hermit of the cliff then direct your letters to the hermit of the cliff they are not likely to go astray mr huet gave robert his instructions and finally produced a roll of banknotes you will find two hundred dollars in this roll robert he said you can buy a wallet to keep it in when you reach boston two hundred dollars exclaimed the boy in amazement you wont find it so large a sum as you suppose when you are required to pay traveling expenses you need not try to be overeconomical i prefer that you should stop at good hotels and put on a good appearance but i warn you to keep your mouth shut and tell your business to no one i depend upon your discretion not to fall into the hands of knaves or adventurers i know that i am putting unusual confidence in a boy of your limited experience but i have no one else to trust and i feel that you may be relied upon i hope i shall not disappoint you mr huet well robert i will bid you good night and god bless you we dont know what lies before us but if you succeed i will take care that your career shall be a fortunate one robert walked slowly back to his humble home almost wishing that the night were over and his journey actually begun there was but one way out of cooks harbor that is by land a stage left the village every morning for kaneville six miles distant a small station on a road which terminated many miles away in boston the stage started at seven oclock so robert was forced to get up betimes take an early breakfast and walk up to the tavern mr jones the landlord was standing on the piazza when robert made his appearance he had no proprietary right in the stage line but the driver generally stopped overnight at the tavern and the horses were kept in his stable so that he had come to assume a certain air of proprietorship as robert was climbing up to take a seat by the driver mr jones with a frown called out look here you young rascal come right down why am i to come down mr jones said robert independently because i tell you to we cant have any boys stealing rides is this stage yours asked robert surveying the landlord with provoking coolness no matter whether it is or not retorted jones red in the face i tell you to come down do you hear yes i hear then youd better come down double quick or ill give you a taste of a horsewhip i advise you to mind your own business mr jones said robert hotly and not interfere with the passengers by this stage youre not a passenger you young beggar i am a passenger and now youd better stop talking have you got money to pay your fare asked the landlord beginning to suspect he had made a fool of himself when the driver calls for the fare it will be time enough to tell luke said mr jones to the driver youd better take that boys fare now he wants to swindle you out of a ride you may take it out of this said robert tendering a fivedollar bill i guess well let it stand till we get to kaneville said luke gathering up the reins robert darted a glance of triumph at the discomfited and bewildered landlord and his journey was begun the latter on lukes return learned to his further surprise that robert had gone to boston on reflection he concluded that mrs trafton must have some relatives in the city from whom they hoped to borrow enough money to raise the mortgage but he wont succeed and in four weeks i shall turn him and his aunt out of doors mr jones complacently reflected chapter xxiii an unpleasant surprise when robert arrived in boston he was at first bewildered by the noise and bustle to which in the quiet fishing village he was quite unaccustomed all that he knew about the city was the names of the principal streets it was not necessary however that he should go in any particular direction he decided therefore to walk along keeping a good lookout and when he saw a clothing store to go in and provide a new outfit he was sensible that he was by no means dressed in city style his clothes were coarse and being cut and made by his aunt who though an excellent woman was by no means an excellent tailor looked countrified and outlandish the first hint robert had of this was when two welldressed boys meeting him simultaneously burst out laughing robert was sensitive but he was by no means bashful or timid accordingly he stepped up to the boys and demanded with kindling eyes are you laughing at me oh no of course not answered one of the boys rolling his tongue in his cheek certainly not my dear fellow said the other winking i think you were said robert firmly do you see anything to laugh at in me well to tell the truth said the first boy we were wondering whether you import your clothes from paris or london oh thats it said robert goodhumoredly for he was aware that his clothes were of strange cut my clothes were made in the country and i dont think much of them myself if youd tell me where i can get some better ones i will buy a suit the boys were not badhearted and were won over by roberts good humor youre a good fellow said the first speaker and i am sorry i was rude enough to laugh at you there is a store where i think you can find what you want he pointed to a clothing store in front of which was a good display of readymade clothing thank you said robert he entered and the boys walked on if robert had been better dressed he would have received immediate attention as it was he looked like a poor boy in want of work and not at all like a customer so at all events decided a dapperlooking clerk whose attention was drawn to the new arrival well boy what do you want he demanded roughly approaching robert civil treatment to begin with answered robert with spirit if youve come for a place we dont want any scarecrows here it appears that the firm had advertised for an errand boy that very morning and it was naturally supposed that robert was an applicant are you the owner of this shop asked robert coolly no answered the clerk lowering his tone a little i thought so ill tell my business to somebody else youd better not put on airs said the clerk angrily you are the one who is putting on airs retorted robert whats the matter here asked a portly gentleman walking up to the scene of the altercation i was telling this boy that he would not do for the place answered the clerk i believe mr turner that you are not commissioned to make a selection said the gentleman and turner retired discomfited so you want a place he said inquiringly to robert no sir i dont mr turner said you did i never told him so here turner said the gentleman why did you tell me this boy wanted a place i supposed he did he looked like it sir i dont want a place i want to buy a suit of clothes said robert if that young man hadnt treated me so rudely i should have asked him to show me some look here mr turner said the gentleman sternly if you have no more sense than to insult our customers we can dispense with your services mr conway will you wait on this young man turner was mortified and slunk away beginning to understand that it is not always safe to judge a man or boy by the clothes he wears mr conway was more of a gentleman and civilly asked robert to follow him what kind of a suit would you like he added a pretty good one answered robert he was shown several suits and finally selected one of gray mixed cloth of excellent quality that is one of our most expensive suits said conway doubtfully will it wear well it will wear like iron then i will take it how much will it cost conway named the price robert would have hesitated about paying so much but that he was acting under instructions from the hermit shall we send it to you anywhere asked mr conway a little surprised at roberts readiness to pay so high a price no i should like to put it on here you can do so that is after paying for it robert drew out a wallet and from his roll of bills took out sufficient to pay for the new suit mr conway went to the cashiers desk the two had a conversation together then the stout gentleman was called to the desk robert saw them open a copy of a morning paper and read a paragraph looking at him after reading it he wondered what it all meant presently conway came back and asked him to walk up to the desk robert did so wonderingly you seem to have a good deal of money with you commenced the stout gentleman yes sir answered robert composedly a great deal of money for a boy dressed as you are continued the speaker pointedly robert began to understand now and he replied proudly do you generally ask your customers how much money they have no but yours is a peculiar case the money is mine that is i have a right to spend it i am acting under orders from the gentleman who employs me who is that no one that you would know he lives at cooks harbor but i didnt come in here to answer questions if you dont want to sell me a suit of clothes i will go somewhere else to be plain with you my boy said the stout gentleman not unkindly we are afraid that you have no right to this money the herald of this morning gives an account of a boy who has run away from a town in new hampshire with three hundred dollars belonging to a farmer you appear to be the age mentioned i never stole a dollar in my life said robert indignantly it may be so but i feel it a duty to put you in charge of the police who will investigate the matter james call an officer robert realized that he was in an unpleasant situation it would be hard to prove that the money in his hands was really at his disposal help came from an unexpected quarter a young man fashionably dressed had listened to the conversation of which robert was the subject he came forward promptly saying there is no occasion to suspect this boy he is all right do you know him asked the proprietor politely yes i know him well he is in the employ of a gentleman at cooks harbor as he says you can safely sell him the clothes the young man spoke so positively that all suspicion was removed i am glad to learn that it is all right said the clothing merchant my young friend i am sorry to have suspected you we shall be glad to sell you the suit and to recompense you for the brief inconvenience we will take off two dollars from the price thank you sir it would not do for us to receive stolen money hence our caution robert did not bear malice and he accepted the apology and dressed himself in the suit referred to which very much changed his appearance for the better in fact but for his hat and shoes he looked like a city boy of a welltodo family he felt fortunate in getting off so well but he was puzzled to understand where he could have met the young man who professed to know him so well he left the store but almost immediately was tapped on the shoulder by the young man in question i got you off well didnt i said the young man with a wink i am much obliged to you sir said robert you dont seem to remember me continued the young man winking again no sir good reason why i never saw you in my life before nor you me but i thought you said you had met me at cooks harbor said robert in surprise the young man laughed only way to get you off youd have been marched off by a policeman if i hadnt this seemed rather irregular to our hero still he knew that he was innocent of any wrongdoing and as the young man appeared to have acted from friendly motives he thanked him again thats all very well said the young man but considering the scrape ive saved you from i think you ought to give me at least twentyfive dollars but the money isnt mine said robert opening his eyes for he could hardly have expected an application for money from a young man so fashionably dressed of course it isnt said the young man winking again it belongs to the man you took it from im fairly entitled to a part so just give me twentyfive and well call it square if you mean that i stole the money youre quite mistaken said robert indignantly it belongs to my employer just what i thought said the other but i have a right to spend it i am doing just as he told me to do come young fellow that wont go down its too thin said the young man his countenance changing you dont take me in so easily just hand over twentyfive dollars or ill hand you over to the police theres one coming robert certainly did not care to have the threat executed but he did not choose to yield if you do he said ill tell him that you did it because i would not give you twentyfive dollars this did not strike his new acquaintance as desirable since it would be in effect charging him with blackmail moreover he could bring nothing tangible against our young hero he changed his tone therefore i dont want to harm you he said but i deserve something for getting you out of a scrape you might spare me five dollars i got my suit two dollars cheaper through what you said said robert ill give you that sum well that will do said the other finding the country boy more unmanageable than he expected i ought to have more but i will call it square on that robert drew a twodollar bill from his pocket and handed it to the stranger that i can give he said because it was part of the price of my suit all right good morning said the young man and thrusting the bill into his vest pocket he walked carelessly away robert looked after him with a puzzled glance i shouldnt think a young man dressed like that could be in want of money he reflected i am afraid he told a lie on my account but i thought at the time he had really seen me even if i couldnt remember him soon robert came to a hat store where he exchanged his battered old hat for one of fashionable shape and a little later his cowhide shoes for a pair of neat calfskin he surveyed himself now with natural satisfaction for he was as well dressed as his friend herbert irving he had by this time reached washington street and had just passed milk street when he met george randolph who looked as consequential and conceited as ever good morning george said robert george looked at him doubtfully how could he suppose that the boy before him dressed as well as himself was the poor fisher boy of cooks harbor i dont seem to remember you said george civilly robert smiled you met me at cooks harbor he explained i am robert coverdale what not the young fisherman ejaculated george incredulously the same you havent come into a fortune have you what brings you here demanded the city boy in great amazement i am in the city on business no i havent come into a fortune but i am better off than i was can you recommend me a good hotel i dont know about the cheap hotels i dont care for a cheap hotel i want a good one more and more surprised george said you might go to youngs i will go there thank you for telling me i dont understand how a boy like you can afford to go to such a hotel as that said george looking very much puzzled no i suppose not returned robert smiling if you dont mind telling me i am sorry i cant but my errand is a secret one did my uncle send you no neither he nor herbert knows of my coming i didnt have time to see herbert before i came away are you going to stay long in boston no i think not i am going to new york or albany it seems queer to me very likely goodby thank you for directing me george had been remarkably civil but in a boy like him that is easily explained he was civil not to robert but to his new suit and his new prosperity its the strangest thing i ever heard of he muttered as he walked away why the young fisherman is dressed as well as i am chapter xxiv on long island sound had he possessed plenty of leisure robert would have been glad to remain in boston long enough to see the principal objects of interest in the city and its vicinity but he never for a moment forgot that his time was not his own he had entered the service of the hermit and every days delay was so much additional expense to his employer true gilbert huet was a rich man as he had himself acknowledged but robert was conscientious and felt that this would not justify him in gratifying himself at the expense of the man who had so trusted him robert felt proud of this trust this very unusual proof of confidence in a boy so young and inexperienced as he was and he was ambitious to justify it i am sure therefore that he would have had little satisfaction in postponing it out of regard to his own pleasure there were two ways of going to the west which it will be remembered was his destination by the way of albany or new york city finding that it would not matter much how he went robert decided upon the latter it would enable him to see the great city of which he had heard so much and who knows but in this great metropolis which swallows up so many he might hear something of the lost boy he decided therefore to go at once to new york and after some inquiry he fixed upon the fall river route this includes railroad travel to fall river a distance of about fifty miles where the traveler embarks on a great steamer and arrives in new york after a night on long island sound guided by an advertisement in the daily papers robert made his way to the old state house at the head of state street and entering the office of the steamboat line asked for a ticket will you take a stateroom also asked the clerk is that necessary asked robert who was unused to traveling no its not necessary your ticket will entitle you to a comfortable berth but in a stateroom you have greater privacy what is a stateroom asked our hero the clerk was rather surprised by this question but decided that robert was not accustomed to traveling and answered politely enough it is very much like a room in a hotel only much smaller there is a berth and a washstand and you can lock yourself in there is greater security against robbery for you hold the key and no one can enter it without your knowledge as robert carried considerable money belonging to mr huet he felt that he ought to take this precaution if it were not too expensive how much must i pay for a stateroom he asked you can get a good one for a dollar then i will take one number fiftysix said the clerk handing him a card with the number penciled on it whats your name robert coverdale so robert walked out of the office with his passage engaged this was on the morning after his arrival and as the steamboat train did not start till afternoon this afforded him a chance to spend several hours in seeing the city first he went to the common and walked across it surveying with interest the large and noble trees which add so much beauty to a park which in size is insignificant compared with the great parks of new york and philadelphia but appears older and more finished than either he rode in various directions in the cars and enjoyed the varied sights that passed under his notice at halfpast four he paid his bill at the hotel and took a car which passed the depot from which the steamboat train for new york starts the train was an express and in little more than an hour he boarded the beautiful sound steamer he was astonished at its magnificence as he went upstairs to the main saloon as he was looking about him in rather a bewildered way a colored man employed on the boat inquired what are you looking for young man where shall i get a key to my stateroom he was told and opening the door he found himself in a comfortable little room with two berths i can pass the night here very pleasantly he thought there is some difference between sleeping here and on a sailboat once in company with his uncle he had been compelled to pass the night on the ocean in a small sailboat used for fishing purposes robert left his valise in the stateroom and went into the saloon a gong was heard which he found was the announcement of supper it was now past seven oclock and he felt hungry he accordingly followed the crowd downstairs and ate a hearty meal when he went upstairs again the band soon began to play and helped to while away the time some of the passengers read papers others read books and magazines while others from the outer decks watched the progress of the large boat as it swiftly coursed over the waves in this last company was robert without being aware of it our hero attracted the notice of one of his fellow passengers a man possibly of thirtyfive tall and thin and dressed in black finally he accosted robert a fine evening he remarked yes sir very fine you are going to new york i suppose yes sir do you tarry there not long i am going to ohio you seem young to travel alone perhaps however you have company no sir robert answered i am traveling alone there was a look of satisfaction on the mans face which robert did not see even if he had he would not have known how to interpret it it is pleasant to go to new york by boat said the stranger i prefer it to the cars that is when i can get a stateroom did you secure one yes sir you are more fortunate than i i found they had all been taken i would not care so much if i were not suffering from fever and ague i suppose you have a berth said robert yes but the berths are exposed to draughts and are not as desirable as staterooms robert did not know that so far from this being the case the great fault of the ordinary berths was a lack of air i suppose your stateroom contains two berths said the stranger yes i believe so i may be taking a liberty but i have a proposal to make if you will allow me to occupy one of them i will pay half the cost of your room it would oblige me very much but i would not ask if i were not sick robert did not entirely like this proposal he preferred to be alone still he was naturally obliging and he hardly knew how to refuse this favor to a sick man i see you hesitate said the stranger pray think no more of my request i would not mind paying the entire cost of the room if you will take me in it cost you a dollar did it not yes sir then said the man drawing a dollar bill from his pocketbook allow me to pay for it and share it with you i ought not to be selfish thought robert i would rather be alone but if this man is sick i think i will let him come in with me he so expressed himself and the other thanked him warmly and pressed the dollar upon him no said robert i cant take so much you may pay for your share fifty cents you are very kind murmured the other and replacing the bill in his pocketbook he took out a half dollar and tendered it to our hero half an hour later both repaired to stateroom no as they entered the room the stranger glanced at the two berths and said it is only fair that you should occupy the best berth which is the best berth asked robert the lower one is generally so considered said the other it is a little wider and it is less trouble to get into it i will take the upper one no said robert generously you are sick and ought to have the best i am perfectly well and i shant mind climbing into the upper one but it seems so selfish in me protested the stranger to step into your stateroom and take the best accommodations not if i am willing responded robert cheerfully so it is all settled how kind you are murmured the invalid though we have met so recently i cannot help feeling toward you as if you were my younger brother robert thanked him but could hardly reciprocate the feeling in truth he had taken no fancy to the man whom he had accepted as roommate and was only influenced by compassion for his reported sickness they undressed and retired to their berths as the stranger was about to step into his he said it is only fair to tell you my name i am called mortimer fairfax and i am a partner in a business firm in baltimore are you in business not exactly answered robert though i am traveling on business just now i believe you didnt mention your name said fairfax my name is robert coverdale an excellent name i know a family in philadelphia by that name are you sleepy a little then suppose we go to sleep all right goodnight then there was silence in the stateroom it was not long before roberts eyes closed he had gone about considerable during the day and was naturally fatigued generally he had no difficulty in sleeping soundly but tonight proved an exception he tossed about in his narrow berth and he was troubled with disagreeable dreams sometimes it happens that such dreams visit us to warn us of impending danger robert finally dreamed that a pickpocket had drawn his pocketbook from his pocket and was running away with it and he awoke with a sudden start his face bathed in perspiration it was midnight the band had ceased playing for two hours and all who had staterooms had retired to them only here and there in the main saloon a passenger lay asleep in an armchair there was a scanty light which entered the stateroom through a small window and by this light robert half rising in bed saw a sight that startled him mr mortimer fairfax his roommate was out of his berth he had taken down roberts trousers from the nail on which he had hung them and was in the act of pulling out his wallet which he had imprudently left in it this sight fully aroused the lad and he prepared for action fairfax was half bent over and robert who was deeply incensed threw himself from the upper berth landing on the back of his roommate who was borne to the floor releasing the garment with a startled cry what did you do that for he asked nervously what business had you with my pocketbook you thief demanded robert sternly mortimer fairfax who had supposed robert to be fast asleep saw that he was in a scrape but he was a man fertile in expedients and he instantly decided upon his course what do you mean he inquired in a tone of innocent bewilderment what do i mean retorted our hero i want to know what business you had with my pocketbook in your hand you dont mean to say that i was meddling with your pocketbook said fairfax with an air of surprise that is exactly what i do say mr fairfax if i hadnt waked up just as i did you would have had all my money and i should have been penniless that is the sort of fever and ague that troubles you i suppose my young friend said fairfax i am shocked at what you tell me i do not blame you for accusing me if i were in your place and you in mine i should no doubt act in the same way yet i am entirely innocent i can assure you it dont look much like it robert said rather astonished at the mans effrontery when i find you examining my pockets and taking out my pocketbook it looks very much as if you were trying to rob me true it does i admit it all but if you knew me you would see how groundless nay how absurd such suspicions are why i am a rich man i am worth fifty thousand dollars then why did you try to rob me i did not it was only in appearance did you ever hear of a somnambulist no it is one who gets up in his sleep and is entirely unconscious of what he does from early youth from the days of my innocent boyhood i have been a victim of this unfortunate malady do you often steal in your sleep inquired robert sarcastically not often but i have done it before once when a boy i got up and took a purse from the pocket of my uncle who occupied the same room with me what did your uncle say robert asked with some curiosity he was angry till my mother assured him that i was a somnambulist and not responsible for what i did at such a time then we had a good laugh over it do you mean to say mr fairfax that when you had your hand in my pocket just now you were asleep sound asleep i had no idea that i was out of my berth you seemed to wake up pretty quick afterward to be sure i did i rather think you would wake up too if i should jump upon your back from the top berth but i forgive you dont apologize i beg i should have been misled as you were if our situations had been changed certainly mr mortimer fairfax was cool in his limited acquaintance with the world robert had never dreamed of the existence of such a character but he was gifted with shrewd common sense and he did not for an instant believe the story which the other palmed off upon him mr fairfax he said shall i tell you what i think of your story yes if you please i dont believe it what exclaimed fairfax sadly is it possible you believe that i would rob you my kind benefactor i dont pretend to be your benefactor but i havent a doubt about it my dear young friend said fairfax putting his handkerchief to his eyes you grieve me deeply indeed you do i had thought you would understand me better you do not consider that i am a rich man and can have no object in depriving you of your little store of money let us go to bed and forget this unpleasant little circumstance no mr fairfax you cannot stay here any longer i insist upon your dressing yourself and leaving the stateroom but my young friend it is the middle of the night i cant help it said robert resolutely and in my delicate health it would be dangerous i dont believe you are in delicate health but i cant help it if you are you must go you forget said fairfax in a different tone that half of the stateroom is mine i have paid for it then i will return the money here it is i prefer to remain here if you dont go said robert energetically i will call for help and report that you tried to rob me you will repent this unkind treatment said fairfax sullenly but he proceeded to dress nevertheless and in a few minutes he left the stateroom robert locked the door after him and then returning to bed he said with a sigh of relief now i can sleep without fear i am sure that fellow is a rascal and i am glad to be rid of him chapter xxv a baggage smashers revenge when robert awoke in the morning it was eight oclock and the steamer lay quietly at its pier almost all the passengers had landed and he was nearly alone on the great steamer of course mortimer fairfax had gone with the rest in fact fairfax was one of the first to land he had passed the remainder of the night in the saloon anxious as long as he remained on board lest robert should denounce him for his attempted theft robert was a stranger in new york he was instantly impressed by what he could see of the great city from the deck of the steamer he took his valise in his hand and walked across the gangplank upon the pier at the entrance he was accosted by a hackman carriage sir no answered robert i will carry you cheap what do you call cheap where do you want to go astor house this hotel had been suggested by the hermit all right jump in and the hackman was about to take roberts valise wait a moment said the lad firmly i havent agreed to ride what do you charge two dollars two dollars how far is it about five miles answered the hackman with unblushing falsehood is there no stage that goes to that part of the city no your only way is to take a carriage though robert had never before been in new york he felt convinced that this was untrue and said quietly then i will walk it is too far young man nobody walks up there then ill be the first one to try it said robert coolly wait a minute youngster ill take you for a dollar and a half robert did not answer but crossed the street carry your bag sir said a boy of about his own age who seemed to be waiting for a job do you know the way to the astor house asked robert i ought to how far is it half a mile that hack driver told me it was five miles the boy grinned he thought you were green he said say boss shall i carry that vlise how much do you charge ill take it to broadway for a quarter all right ill pay it i see thought robert i shall have to look out or i shall be cheated it seems to cost a good deal of money to travel as robert walked along he asked various questions of his young partner as to the buildings which they passed on reaching broadway he said i dont care about riding if you will walk along with me and carry the valise i will pay you a quarter more all right only pay me the first quarter now said the boy cautiously just as you like are you afraid i wont pay you i dunno i was served that way once how was it i was carryin a bag a thunderin big bag it was too for a man to this very hotel id carried it about a mile when we got there he took it and was goin in without payin me look here boss i says you havent paid me yes i did he says i paid you when you took the bag then i knew he was a beat and i made a fuss i tell you and follered him into the hotel whats the matter asked one of the hotel men comin forrard this boy wants me to pay him twice he says of course the hotel people took up for the man and kicked me out of the hotel i didnt blame them so much for whod think of a gentleman cheatin a poor boy that was pretty hard on you said robert in a tone of sympathy he must have been a mean man mean i guess he was but i got even with him and i didnt wait long neither how was that i got an egg and i laid for him toward night he come out all dressed up like as if he was goin to the theayter i follered him and when i got a good chance i just hove it at him i hit him just in his bosom and the egg was spattered over his face and clothes he gave a yell and then i dodged round the corner oh it was rich to see how he looked i guess hed better have paid me robert could not help laughing and did not find it in his heart to blame the boy who had chosen this summary way to redress his grievances i hope he said you havent got any eggs with you now why aint you goin to pay me oh yes i mean to pay you i wouldnt cheat a poor boy im a poor boy myself his guide looked at him in surprise you a poor boy with them cloes he repeated if you was a poor boy you wouldnt pay me for carryin your baggage but would carry it myself yes so i would but i wanted somebody to guide me to the hotel i am traveling for a gentleman that pays the bills oh cricky aint that jolly wouldnt he like me to travel for him i guess not said robert laughing if he should just give a feller a chance i might if i knew your name and where you live i left my cardcase at home on the planner along with my jewelry but my names michael burke the boys call me mike i live at the newsboys lodge when im at home all right mike ill remember the remainder of the walk was enlivened by conversation of a similar kind though mike was not much of a scholar he was well informed on local matters and it was upon such points that robert wished to be posted when they reached the hotel mike uttered an exclamation of surprise say do you see that man in the doorway he asked eagerly what of him hes the very man that cheated me out of my pay the man i hit wid an egg here he is again robert surveyed the man with curious interest he was a man of middle age well dressed but with a hard stern look upon his face he was by no means one likely to attract strangers how do you know it is the same one asked robert in a low voice hes got the same look id remember him if it was a dozen years but its only six months but you might be mistaken ill show you whether i am come along when they entered the vestibule of the hotel mike paused a moment and in hearing of the stranger said last night as i was walkin along i seed a man hit wid a rotten egg he looked mad enough to kill the one that throwed it the stranger wheeled round and regarded mike intently boy said he i think ive seen you before maybe you have answered mike coolly lots of people has seen me did you ever carry a valise for me maybe i did ive carried lots of em i think you once brought a valise for me to this very hotel how much did you pay me for doin it maybe i could tell by that i dont know i presume i paid you liberally then i guess it was some other boy said mike grinning the gentleman looked puzzled but just then a young man came up and spoke to him addressing him as mr waldo robert started at the sound of this name he remembered that this was the name of his employers cousin who was suspected of abducting the boy of whom he was in search bidding goodby to his young guide he registered his name and then turned over the pages back in the list of arrivals for the day before he came upon this entry charles waldo sullivan ohio its the very man he said to himself in excitement chapter xxvi two important discoveries charles waldo was the name of the hermits cousin who was suspected of kidnapping the boy who stood between him and the property it was to find this very man that robert was sent out by gilbert huet robert felt that he was fortunate in so soon running across this man and decided that as long as mr waldo remained in the hotel it was his policy to remain also he did not see how he was to find out anything about the missing boy but resolved to watch and wait in the hope of obtaining a clew he did not wish to attract mr waldos suspicions but took care to keep him in view the next morning he observed mr waldo in the reading room at the rear of the hotel talking with another person rather a pretentiouslooking man with black whiskers and a jaunty air at the news stand he bought a copy of a morning paper and took a seat sufficiently near to hear what was said though waldo and his companion spoke in low tones neither was apprehensive of being heard as it was hardly to be presumed that any one within hearing distance would feel an interest in what they had to say as i was saying this was the first sentence which robert heard from mr waldo it is entirely uncertain when i shall derive any advantage from my cousins estate during his life he holds it how is his health i suppose he is well in fact i dont know but he is likely to live as long as i do there cant be more than five years difference in our ages that is a discouraging outlook i should say so but there is one chance for me during his life what is that he may be declared insane in that case the management of the estate would naturally be transferred to me as the direct heir but is there any ground for assumption that he is insane yes ever since his sons death he has acted in an eccentric way made a hermit of himself and withdrawn from society you know grief brooded over often terminates in insanity then there was his wifes terrible death which had a strange effect upon him i did not understand that the boy died well he disappeared he is undoubtedly dead it is his being out of the way that makes you the heir is it not of course answered waldo then all i can say is that it was mighty fortunate for you said his companion dryly it hasnt done me any good yet and may not these hermits are likely to live long their habits are regular and they are not tempted to violate the laws of health i tell you mr thompson its a tantalizing thing to be so near a large fortune and yet kept out of it i suppose you pray for your cousins death then not so bad as that but as he dont enjoy the property it is a pity i cant how much does the estate amount to probably asked the other with interest well it cant be less than two hundred thousand dollars whew thats a great fortune so it is if i get it or when i get it i wont mind doing as you ask me and setting you up in a snug business you could do it now mr waldo you are a rich man said thompson you are mistaken i may have a competence but nothing more youve got a fine farm that dont support me farming doesnt pay and money in stock and bonds enough to make up the deficiency in my income i assure you i dont lay up a cent i cant do it may i ask what is your errand in new york i want to speak to you about that i want to find my cousin dont his bankers know where he is if they do they wont tell i suppose they are acting under orders from him suppose you find him then said charles waldo significantly i shall raise the question of his sanity it wont be a difficult matter to prove him insane it only needs a certificate from a couple of doctors i think i can find two parties who will oblige me i say waldo youre a cool calculating fellow thompson was about to use another word but checked himself i wouldnt like to stand in your way nonsense i only want to do what is right and it very conveniently happens that you consider right what is to your interest i say have you any idea how the boy came to disappear of course not how should i answered waldo uneasily i dont know but as he stood in your way i thought you think too much said waldo oh i dont mean to censure you i suppose if i had been in your place i might have been tempted i know nothing about the boys disappearance said waldo hastily but let us drop that i sent for you because i saw that you could serve me go on if theres money in it i am your man i shall pay you of course that is i will pay you fairly we will speak of that hereafter what do you want me to do is there anybody you want to disappear hush you go too far sir i want to find out the whereabouts of gilbert huet it is important for me to know where he is can you give me a clew if i could i should not need to employ you come up to my room and i will communicate further with you the two left the reading room and robert was left to digest the important information he had received what a rascal that man is he reflected after stealing mr huets boy he wants to put him in a madhouse i must let him know so that he may be on his guard i dont believe they will think of looking for him at cooks harbor by a curious coincidence the room assigned to robert was next to that occupied by mr waldo and when the boy was about entering it some hours later he saw the gentleman going in just ahead of him as the latter placed one hand upon the door he drew his handkerchief from his coat pocket and in so doing brought out a letter which fell upon the floor without his seeing it passing into his room he slammed the door leaving the missive lying in the hall it is a mean thing laughed robert as he stooped down and picked it up to examine a letter not intended for me but he is such a scamp that ill do it in this case hoping to learn something that will help me find this poor boy and so without any compunctions robert took the letter which had been opened into his room and read with feelings which may possibly be imagined the following letter dear sir i feel oblidged to rite to you about the boy i took from you you told me he would work enough to pay for his keep and did not want to pay me anything for my trubble now mr waldo you are mistaken the boy aint tuff nor strong and i cant got moren half as much work out of him as i ought he dont eat much i kno but the fact is i need a good strong boy and i shall have to git another and have two to feed if things go on so you told me i might be strict and harsh with him and i am he says he has the headache about half the time but i dont pay no attenshun to that if i did i wouldnt git any work done one day he fainted away in the feald but its my opinyun he brought it on apurpose by not eatin much breakfast i tell you mr waldo it is very aggravatin to have such a shifless boy now what i want to ask you is if you cant allow me a dollar or a dollar and a half a week to make it square im willin to take care of the boy but i dont want to lose money by it i kno you give him his cloes but that dont cost you much he aint had a suit for a year and he needs one bad im sure you will see the thing the way i do if you are a reasonable man as i have no reason to doubt you are and so i remain yours to command nathan badger to mr charles waldo robert could hardly express his excitement and indignation when he was reading this letter he felt sure that this poor boy who was so cruelly treated was the unfortunate son of his friend the hermit who ought to be enjoying the comforts of a luxurious home as it was he was the victim of a cruel and unscrupulous relative influenced by the most mercenary motives i will be his friend robert resolved and if i can i will restore him to his father he looked for the date of the letter and found it it had been written in the town of dexter in ohio where this town was robert did not know but he could find out i wont wait for mr waldo he said to himself i know all i need to i will start for ohio tomorrow as for the letter he resolved to keep it as it might turn out to be important evidence in case of need he could not understand how mr waldo could be careless enough to mislay so important a document but this did not concern him it was his business to profit by it chapter xxvii the bound boy the town of dexter was almost entirely agricultural its population was small and scattered there were no large shops or manufactories to draw people to the place many of the farmers were well to do carrying on agricultural operations on a considerable scale among the smaller farmers was nathan badger he was fond of money but knew no better way to get it than to live meanly drive hard bargains and spend as little as possible in this way though not a very good farmer he was able to lay by a couple of hundred dollars a year which he put away in the county savings bank mrs badger was a fitting wife for such a man she was about as mean as he was with scarcely any of the traits that make women attractive she had one however an indulgent love of her only child andrew jackson badger who was about as disagreeable a cub as can well be imagined yet i am not sure that andrew was wholly responsible for his ugliness as most of his bad traits came to him by inheritance from the admirable pair whom he called father and mother andrew jackson badger was by no means a youthful apollo to speak more plainly he was no beauty a tow head and freckled face often belong to a prepossessing boy of popular manners but in andrews case they were joined to insignificant features small ferret eyes a retreating chin and thin lips set off by a repulsive expression there was another member of the family a bound boy the same one referred to in mr nathan badgers letter this boy was five years previous placed in mr badgers charge by charles waldo i do not want my young readers to remain under any uncertainty as to this boy and i state at once that he was the abducted son of gilbert huet the hermit of cooks harbor and the rightful heir to a large estate at the time of our introduction to bill benton for this is the name by which he was known he had a hoe in his hand and he was about starting for the field to hoe potatoes he was a slender boy with delicate features and a face which indicated a sensitive temperament his hair was dark brown his features were refined his eyes were blue and he looked like a boy of affectionate temperament who would feel injustice and harshness keenly this was indeed the case he lacked the strong sturdy character the energy and selfreliance which made robert coverdale successful robert was not a boy to submit to injustice or wrong he was not easily intimidated and could resist imposition with all his might but bill to call him by the name given him by mr waldo was of a more gentle yielding disposition and so he was doomed to suffer he was certainly unfortunately situated mr badger required him to work beyond his strength and seldom or never gave him a kind word the same may be said of mrs badger it was perhaps fortunate for him that he had a small appetite for in the badger household he would have been unable to gratify the hearty appetite of an average boy the table was very mean and the only one who lived well was andrew jackson whom his mother petted and indulged there was always something extra on the table for andrew which it was well understood that no one else in the family was to eat mr badger did not interfere with his wifes petting if he had a soft place in his heart it was for andrew who seemed to his partial parents a remarkably smart and interesting boy to bill benton he was a cruel tyrant he delighted in making the life of his fathers bound boy intolerable and succeeded only too well he was stronger than bill and backed by the authority of his father and mother he dared do anything while bill knew that it was useless to resist still gentle as he was sometimes his spirit rose and made a feeble resistance where are you going bill asked andrew as the bound boy started off after breakfast i am going to hoe potatoes andrew no youre not i want you to go and dig some worms for bait i am going afishing but your father told me to go to the field at once i cant help that he didnt know i wanted you he will scold me if i dont go to work that is my business i tell you to go and dig some worms poor bill he knew very well that if andrew got him into a scrape he would not help him out but leave his father to suppose that bill disobeyed of his own accord if necessary stoutly asserting it for andrew was by no means a boy of truth i would rather not go andrew said bill uneasily then take that and andrew brutally struck him with a whip he had in his hand the bound boy flushed at this indignity gentle as he was he resented a blow dont you do that again andrew he said i wont stand it you wont stand it repeated andrew tauntingly what will you do about it id like to know you have no right to hit me and i wont submit to it said bill with a spirit which quite astonished the young tyrant he laughed scornfully and repeated the blow but with more emphasis even the most gentle and longsuffering turn sometimes and this was the case now the bound boy lifted the hoe and with the handle struck andrew so forcibly that he dropped upon the ground bellowing like a calf like most bullies he was cowardly and the unexpected resistance and the pain of the blow quite overcame his fortitude and he cried like a baby it must be confessed that the bound boy was frightened by what he had done too well he knew that he would suffer for his temerity besides his compassion was aroused for andrew whom he thought to be worse hurt than he was he threw down the hoe and kneeled by the prostrate boy oh andrew i hope i didnt hurt you he cried i ought not to have struck you youll catch it when father comes home screamed andrew furiously you almost killed me oh andrew im so sorry i hope youll forgive me by this time mrs badger had come to the door and andrew catching a glimpse of her gave a yell as if in extreme anguish his mother came flying out of the house whats the matter my darling she cried in alarm bill knocked me down with a hoe and i think im going to die answered andrew with a fresh burst of anguish mrs badger was almost paralyzed with astonishment and wrath she could hardly believe her ears what her andrew assaulted by a beggarly bound boy bill knocked you down with a hoe she repeated you dont mean it yes i do ask him if he didnt bill benton said mrs badger in an awful voice did you strike andrew with a hoe yes maam and im sorry for it but he struck me with a whip first no doubt he had a good reason for doing it and so you tried to murder him you young ruffian no i didnt mrs badger he had no right to whip me and i defended myself but im sorry andrew set up another howl though he no longer felt any pain and his mothers wrath increased youll end your life on the gallows you young brute she exclaimed glaring wrathfully at the poor boy some night youll try to murder us all in our beds the only place for you is in jail when mr badger comes home i will report the case to him now go to work poor bill was glad to get away from the infuriated woman andrew was taken into the house and fed on preserves and sweetmeats by his doting mother while the poor bound boy was toiling in the hot sun dreading the return of his stern master nathan badger was not far away he had driven to the village in the buggy not that he had any particular business there but at present there was no farm work of a pressing nature except what the bound boy could do and mr badger did not love work for its own sake in spite of his parsimony he generally indulged himself in a glass of bitters of which he was very fond whenever he went to the village his parsimony stood him in good stead in one respect at least for it prevented his becoming a drunkard i have said that mr badger had no particular business at the village but this is not strictly true he had business at the post office some time since he had written to mr waldo asking for a money allowance for the care of bill benton he knew very well that he was not entitled to it he was at no expense for the boys clothes and certainly bill richly earned the very frugal fare of which he partook sparingly and the privilege of a hard bed in the attic but it had struck him as possible that mr waldo not knowing the falsehood of his representations would comply with his request if i can get a dollar or a dollar n a half for the boys keep mr badger soliloquized i can make a good thing outn him a dollar a week will come to fiftytwo dollars a year and i cant put a cent into the savings bank a dollar n a half will come to lemme see to seventyeight dollars a year that in five years would be three hundred and ninety dollars without counting the interest mr badgers eyes glistened and his heart was elated as he took in the magnificent idea but alas he was counting chickens that were not likely to be hatched when sufficient time had elapsed for an answer to be due he went to the post office every day but there had been unusual delay at last an answer had been received that very morning mr badger tore open the envelope in eager haste but there was no remittance as he had fondly hoped the contents of the letter also threw cold water on his aspiring hopes as may be seen from the following transcript of it mr nathan badger your letter is received asking me to pay you a weekly sum for the boy whom i bound out to you some years ago i can hardly express the surprise i felt at this application you certainly cannot forget that i furnish the boys clothes and that all you are required to do is to provide him board and lodging in return for his work this is certainly a very good bargain for you i need not say that the work of a boy of fifteen or sixteen years will amply repay you for his board especially if as i infer from your letter he is a small eater generally farmers are willing to provide clothes also and i think i am dealing very liberally with you in exempting you from this additional expense you seem to forget one thing more for three years on account of the boys being young and so unable to work much i allowed you fifty dollars a year though i could readily have found another man to take him without this allowance under the circumstances i consider it very extraordinary that you should apply to me at this late day for an extra allowance i am not made of money and whatever i do for this boy is out of pure benevolence for he has no claim upon me but i assure you that i will not be imposed upon therefore i say no most emphatically one other thing you say the boy doesnt work as much as he ought to i can only say this is no business of mine you have full authority over him and you can make him work i dont believe in pampering boys and indulging them in laziness i recommend you to be strict with william to let him understand that you are not to be trifled with such would be my course yours etc charles waldo nathan badger was deeply disappointed he had made up his mind that mr waldo would allow him at least a dollar a week and had complacently calculated how much this would enable him to lay aside now this dream was over of course he could have given up the boy for he was not formally bound to him but this he did not care to do the fact was that bill earned his board twice over and mr badger knew it though he would not have admitted it it was for his interest to keep him he went home deeply disappointed and angry and disposed to vent his spite on the poor victim of his tyranny even had there been no plausible excuse for doing so when he reached home he was met by mrs badger with a frowning brow well mr badger theres been a pretty scene since you went away what do you mean cornelia bill has nearly killed andrew jackson are you crazy wife no i am in earnest the young rascal attacked poor andrew with a hoe and nearly killed him then he must be crazy ejaculated mr badger where is andrew i want his account of it if it is as you say the boy shall suffer chapter xxviii the victim of tyranny andrew jackson made his appearance with a piece of brown paper over an imaginary bruise on his head and eye and the carefully assumed expression of a suffering victim what is this i hear asked his father have you had a difficulty with bill yes answered andrew in the tone of a martyr he knocked me down with a hoe and if mother had not come out just as she did i think he would have killed me what made him attack you asked mr badger exceedingly surprised i asked him if he would dig some fishworms for me couldnt you dig some yourself i spose i could but he knew better than i where to find them what next he said he wouldnt i told him that i would tell you about his impertinence then he hit me with the hoe as hard as he could was that all that passed yes i dont quite understand it you are surely stronger than bill how did it happen that you allowed him to strike you he had a hoe and i hadnt anything answered andrew meekly he was so furious that he wouldnt have made anything of killing me i always thought he was rather mild and milkandwatery said nathan badger thoughtfully you wouldnt have thought so if youd seen him mr badger said his wife drawing upon her imagination he looked like a young fiend dear andrew is right the boy is positively dangerous i dont know but we shall be murdered in our beds some night if we let him go on this way mr badger shrugged his shoulders for he was not quite a fool and answered dryly that thought wont keep me awake he isnt that kind of a boy oh well mr badger if you are going to take his part against your own flesh and blood ive got no more to say whos taking his part retorted mr badger sharply im not going to uphold him in attacking andrew but im rather surprised at his mustering spunk enough to do it as for his doing us any harm thats all nonsense you may change your mind when its too late mr badger are you afraid of him asked her husband contemptuously as he regarded the tall muscular figure of his wife who probably would have been a match for himself in physical strength i can defend myself if i am awake said mrs badger but whats to hinder his attacking me when im asleep you can fasten your door if you are afraid but that isnt my trouble with him theres something more serious mrs b what is it whats he been doin it isnt he its charles waldo im free to say that mr waldo is the meanest man i ever had dealings with you know i wrote to him to see if he wouldnt allow me something extra toward the boys keep yes well read that letter or stay ill read it to you mr badger took the letter from his pocket and read it aloud to his wife and son mrs badger was as much disappointed as her husband for she was quite as fond of money as he what are you goin to do she asked i cant do anything answered mr badger in deep disgust will you keep the boy of course i will between ourselves he more than earns his victuals but all the same mr waldo is perfectly able to allow us a little profit you must make him work harder suggested mrs badger i mean to now we will settle about this little affair where is bill out in the field digging potatoes said andrew glibly go and call him all right sir and the boy prepared to obey the command with uncommon alacrity poor bill nervous and unhappy had been hard at work in the potato field through the long forenoon meditating bitterly on his sad position so far as he knew there was no one that loved him no one that cared for him he was a friendless boy from mr and mrs badger and andrew he never received a kind nor encouraging word but instead taunts and reproaches and the heart of the poor boy hungering for kindness found none will it always be so he asked himself if andrew would only be kind to me i would do anything for him but he seems to hate me and so does mrs badger mr badger isnt quite so bad but he only cares for the work i do the poor boy sighed heavily as he leaned for a moment upon his hoe he was roused by a sharp voice shirking your work are you said andrew ive caught you this time whatll my father say to that i have been working hard andrew said bill i can show you what i have done this forenoon thats too thin youre lazy and thats all about it well my fathers got home and now youre going to catch it maybe youll knock him down with a hoe said andrew tauntingly im sorry i hit you andrew as i told you but you shouldnt have struck me with a whip i had a perfect right to do it im your master no youre not returned bill with spirit well see whether i am or not come right up to the house who says so my father told me to call you very well i will come and the bound boy shouldered his hoe and followed andrew wearily to the farmhouse yard where mr and mrs badger were standing one look at the stern faces of the pair satisfied bill that trouble awaited him he knew very well that he could not hope for justice and that one word from andrew in the mind of his parents would outweigh all he could say here comes the young ruffian said mrs badger as soon as he came within hearing distance here comes the wicked boy who tried to kill my poor andrew that is not true mrs badger said bill earnestly i was only defending myself you hear mr badger he as much as tells me i lie do you hear that demanded the incensed woman bill benton said mr badger sternly i hear you have made a savage and brutal attack on andrew jackson now what have you to say for yourself sir he struck me twice with a whip mr badger and i got mad i didnt mean to hurt him you might have killed him broke in mrs badger no i wouldnt maam contradicting me again if there was ever a boy looked like a young fiend you did when i came out to save my boy from your brutal temper oh youll swing on the gallows some day sir im sure of that to an unprejudiced observer all this would have been very ridiculous the delicate refinedlooking boy whose face showed unmistakable gentleness and mildness almost carried to an extreme was about the last boy to whom such words could suitably have been addressed andrew jackson did you strike bill with a whip asked mr badger turning to his son no i didnt answered andrew without a blush how can you tell such a lie said bill indignantly mr badger will you allow this young ruffian to accuse your own son of falsehood cried the mother did you have a whip in your hand andrew asked his father andrew hesitated a moment but finally thought it best to say he did did you strike bill with it no you see how candid the poor boy is said his mother he tells you that he had a whip in his hand though many boys would have denied it but my andrew was always truthful even andrew felt a little embarrassed at this undeserved tribute to a virtue in which he knew that he was very deficient bill benton said mr badger sternly it appears that you have not only made an atrocious assault on my son but lied deliberately about it you shall have neither dinner nor supper and tonight i will give you a flogging now go back to your work ho ho youll hit me again will you said andrew triumphantly as the poor boy slowly retraced his way to the field as the bound boy walked wearily back to the field he felt that he had little to live for hard work too hard for his slender strength accompanied by poor fare and cruel treatment constituted his only prospect but there seemed no alternative he must keep on working and suffering so far he could foresee he worked an hour and then he began to feel faint he had eaten but little breakfast and he needed a fresh supply of food to restore his strength how he could hold out till evening he could not tell already his head began to ache and he felt weary and listless he was left to work alone for mr badger usually indulged himself in the luxury of an afterdinner nap lasting till at least three oclock as he was plodding along suddenly he heard his name called in a cheery voice hello bill looking up he saw dick schmidt the son of a neighbor a goodnatured boy whom he looked upon as almost his only friend hello dick he responded youre looking pale bill said his friend whats the matter i dont feel very well dick you ought not to be at work have you had dinner i am not to have any why not asked dick opening his eyes i knew old badger was mean but i didnt think he was mean enough for that its a punishment bill explained what for for hitting andrew jackson with a hoe and knocking him down did you do that bill exclaimed dick in great delight for he disliked mr badgers petted heir i didnt think it was in you shake hands old fellow and tell me all about it i am afraid it was wicked dick but i couldnt help it i must have hurt him for he screamed very loud better and better i know how he treats you bill and i tell you itll do him good the young tyrant but you havent told me about it bill told the story to which dick listened with earnest attention he expressed hearty approval of bills course and declared that he would have done the same so you are in disgrace he said never mind bill itll all come out right it is worth something to have punished that young bully but whats the matter bill what makes you so pale i think its going without my dinner the hard work makes me hungry just wait a minute ill be back in a jiffy dick was off like a shot when he returned he brought with him two slices of bread and butter a slice of cold meat and two apples eat em bill he said theyll make you feel better oh dick i didnt want to trouble you so much it was no trouble old fellow what will your mother say to your taking all this shell be glad of it she isnt so mean as mrs badger i say bill you must come over and take supper with us some time theres plenty to eat at our house i should like to dick if mr badger would let me dont talk any more till you have eaten what i brought you bill obeyed his friends directions and to dicks great satisfaction ate all that had been brought him with evident appetite i feel a good deal better he said as he took the hoe once more and set to work i feel strong now its lucky i came along i say bill is that your only punishment a shadow came over bills face i am to be flogged this evening he said mr badger told me so and he always keeps his word dick set his teeth and clinched his fists id like to flog old badger he said energetically are you going to stand it i cant help it dick id help it said his friend nodding emphatically bill shook his head despondently the whipping seemed to him inevitable and there seemed to be no way of avoiding it what time do you expect he will whip you the old brute asked dick he waits till nine oclock just after i have gone to bed then will you follow my advice what is it dick whispered in bills ear the plan he had in view there was no need to whisper but he did it to show that the communication was confidential this was the plan bill was to go to bed as usual but in about fifteen minutes he was to get out of the window slide along the roof of the l and descend to the ground when dick was to meet him escort him to his house and allow him to share his room for the night then said he when the old man comes up to tackle you hell have to pound the bed and get his satisfaction out of that wont that be a splendid joke bill smiled faintly it seemed to him a daring defiance of mr badger but after all he wouldnt fare any worse than he was sure of doing and he finally acquiesced though with serious doubts as to the propriety of the plan dont say a word to let em know what youre going to do bill mind that no i wont youll be sure to find me waiting for you outside the house just at the back of the barn ill give you some supper when you reach the house when the bound boy came from work in the evening he met stern cold looks from mr and mrs badger but andrew jackson wore a look of triumphant malice he was gloating over the punishment in reserve for the boy whom he so groundlessly hated aint you hungry he said tauntingly bill looked at him but did not answer oh you neednt answer i know you are said the young tyrant you didnt like it very much going without your dinner you aint going to have any supper either if youre very hungry though and will go down on your knees and beg my pardon ill get you something to eat what do you say i wont do what you say said bill slowly i dont care enough for supper to do that you dont exclaimed andrew angrily so youre stubborn are you anyhow you cant say i havent given you a chance youre very kind said the bound boy sarcastically in spite of his gentleness of course i am blustered andrew jackson most boys wouldnt be after the way you treated me you want the satisfaction of having me beg your pardon said bill looking full in the face of the petty despot yes i do and i mean to have it you can upon one condition whats that asked andrew jackson his curiosity overcoming his indignation if youll beg my pardon for striking me with your whip ill beg yours for hitting you with the hoe andrew fairly gasped for breath at this daring proposal and he looked for a moment as if he were in danger of having a stroke of apoplexy you saucy beggar he ejaculated how dare you talk to me in that impertinent way ill tell father to give you the worst flogging ever you had tonight see if i dont and the boy left to report bills new insolence to his mother bill crept up to bed a little earlier than usual he knew that mr badger would not ascend to his humble room to administer the threatened punishment till nine oclock or later through a refinement of cruelty that humane gentleman chose to let his intended victim lie in an anxious anticipation of the flogging thus making it assume greater terror in fact he probably would not return from the village till nine oclock or later and this was an additional reason why he put it off his absence made it easier for bill to carry out the plan which had been formed for him by his trusty friend dick schmidt and escape from the house he accomplished his escape unnoticed about halfpast eight oclock dick was waiting for him behind the barn he had been a little afraid that bill would repent the promise he had made and back out when he saw him he welcomed him gladly i was afraid you wouldnt dare to come bill he said i shant be any worse off said the bound boy mr badger was going to give me a flogging anyway and he cant do any more than that as it is what an old brute he is exclaimed dick he isnt as bad as his wife or andrew jackson thats so andrew is a mean boy im glad you hit him i am sorry dick dont you think he deserved it yes but i dont like to be the one to do it i wouldnt mind it said dick but hes precious careful not to get into any muss with me youre not bound to mr badger if i were he wouldnt dare to order me round catch him bulldozing me youre more plucky than i am dick youre too goodnatured bill thats whats the matter with you i hate fighting dick what did andrew say to you when you came home from work he wanted me to go down on my knees and beg his pardon for hitting him why didnt you knock him down said dick quickly i told him id do it what exclaimed dick schmidt in the deepest disgust if hed beg my pardon first for striking me with a whip thats better i thought you wouldnt be so much of a coward as to beg his pardon he didnt accept the offer said bill smiling no i suppose not was he mad he looked as if he was he called me a saucy beggar and threatened to tell his father ive no doubt he will hes just mean enough to do that i say bill its a pity you dont work for my father i wish i did dick but perhaps youd boss me too not much danger wed be like brothers while this conversation was going on the two boys were walking across the fields to mr schmidts farm the distance was not great and by this time they were at the back door as they went in bills eyes glistened as he saw a nice supper laid on the kitchen table waiting for him for dick had told his mother of the guest he expected he decided to say nothing of the circumstances that led to the invitation he might safely have done so however for mrs schmidt was a good motherly woman who pitied the boy and understood very well that his position in mr badgers family must be a very disagreeable one i am glad to see you william she said sit right down and eat supper ive got a hot cup of tea for you ill sit down too mother i only ate a little supper for i wanted to keep bill company presently the boys went to bed and had a social chat before going to sleep i wish said dick i could be where i could look on when old badger goes up to your room and finds the bird flown if dick could have been there he would have witnessed an extraordinary scene chapter xxix the battle in the attic about ten minutes after bill benton left his little chamber an illlooking man whose garb and general appearance made it clear that he was a tramp came strolling across the fields he had made some inquiries about the farmers in the neighborhood and his attention was drawn to nathan badger as a man who was likely to keep money in the house some tramps are honest men the victims of misfortune not of vice but tom tapley belonged to a less creditable class he had served two terms in a state penitentiary without deriving any particular moral benefit from his retired life therein his ideas on the subject of honesty were decidedly loose and none who knew him well would have trusted him with the value of a dollar such was the man who approached the badger homestead now it happened that mrs badger and andrew jackson had gone to make a call both intended to be back by nine oclock as neither wished to lose the gratification of being near by when bill benton received his flogging as for mr badger he was at the village as usual in the evening thus it will be seen that as bill also had left the house no one was left in charge tom tapley made a careful examination of the house from the outside and his experienced eyes discovered that it was unprotected heres luck he said to himself now whats to prevent my explorin this here shanty and makin off with any valuables i come across two objections however occurred to the enterprising tramp first it was not likely at that time in the evening that he would be left alone long enough to gather in his booty and secondly the absent occupants of the house might have money and articles of value on their persons which at present it would be impossible to secure the front door was not locked mr tapley opened it and finding the coast clear went upstairs continuing his explorations he made his way to the little attic chamber usually occupied by the bound boy nobody sleeps here i expect though the bed is rumpled he said to himself theres two boys ive heard but its likely they sleep together downstairs i guess ill slip into bed and get a little rest till its time to attend to business the tramp with a sigh of enjoyment for he had not lately slept in a bed lay down on bills hard couch it was not long before drowsiness overcame him and he fell asleep in the meantime the three absent members of the family came home first mrs badger and andrew jackson returned from their visit your father isnt home yet andrew said his mother i hope he will come soon for im sleepy said andrew then you had better go to bed my darling no i wont i aint goin to lose seein bills flogging i hope fatherll lay it on well no doubt the boy deserves it what do you think he had the impudence to say to me mother asked andrew i shall not be surprised at any impudence from the young reprobate he wanted me to beg his pardon for strikin him with a whip as he said i did well i never did ejaculated mrs badger to think of my boy apologizing to a low hired boy like him oh hes gettin awful airy ma shouldnt wonder if he thought he was my equal theres nothing but a flogging will subdue such a boy as that i aint unmerciful and if the boy showed a proper humility i wouldnt mind doin all i could for him and overlookin his faults but when he insults my andrew i cant excuse him but theres one thing i cant understand he didnt use to be so bold i know what has changed him ma what is it andrew its that dick schmidt dick treats him as if he was his equal and that makes him put on airs then dick lowers himself though to be sure i dont hold him to be equal to you the badgers are a better family than the schmidts and so are the coneys which was my name before i was married i wonder whether bills asleep said andrew you might go to the foot of the stairs and listen said his mother andrew followed his mothers advice and opening the door at the foot of the attic stairs was astonished to hear the deep breathing which issued from bills chamber ma he said bill is snoring like a house afire reckless boy does he make so light of the flogging which your father has promised him i dont know hes gettin awful sassy lately i do wish father would come home i think i hear him now said mrs badger listening intently her ears did not deceive her soon the steps of the master of the house as he considered himself were heard upon the doorstep and mr nathan badger entered im glad youve come pa are you goin to flog bill now yes my son get me a stout stick from the woodshed andrew jackson obeyed with alacrity armed with the stick mr badger crept upstairs rather astonished by his bound boys noisy breathing and entering the darkened chamber brought the stick down smartly on the astonished sleeper in about two minutes mrs badger and andrew standing at the foot of the stairs were astonished by the noise of a terrible conflict in the little attic chamber as if two men were wrestling there was the sound of a heavy body flung on the floor and the voice of mr badger was heard shouting help help murder the young villains killing your father exclaimed the astonished mrs badger go up and help him i dont dare to said andrew pale as a sheet then i will said his mother and she hurried upstairs only to be met by her husband who was literally tumbled downstairs by the occupant of the attic chamber husband and wife fell together in a heap and andrew jackson uttered a yell of dismay in all the confidence of assured victory mr nathan badger seeing the dim outline of a figure upon the bed had brought down his stick upon it with emphasis ill larn you he muttered in audible accents it was a rude awakening for tom tapley the tramp who was sleeping as peacefully as a child the first blow aroused him but left him in a state of bewilderment so that he merely shrank from the descending stick without any particular idea of what had happened to him didnt feel it did yer exclaimed mr badger well ill see if i cant make yer feel it and he brought down the stick for the second time with considerably increased vigor by this time tom tapley was awake by this time also he thoroughly understood the situation or thought he did he had been found out and the farmer had undertaken to give him a lesson that depends on whether youre stronger than i am thought tom and he sprang from the bed and threw himself upon the astonished farmer nathan badger was almost paralyzed by the thought that bill benton his hired boy was absolutely daring enough to resist his lawful master he was even more astounded by bills extraordinary strength why as the boy grappled with him he actually felt powerless he was crushed to the floor and with the boys knee upon his breast struggled in vain to get up it was so dark that he had not yet discovered that his antagonist was a man and not a boy nathan badger had heard that insane persons are endowed with extraordinary strength and it flashed upon him that the boy had become suddenly insane the horror of being in conflict with a crazy boy so impressed him that he cried for help then it was that tom tapley gathering all his strength lifted up the prostrate farmer and pitched him downstairs just as mrs badger was mounting them so that she and her husband fell in a breathless heap on the lower stairs to the indescribable dismay of andrew jackson mrs badger was the first to pick herself up what does all this mean mr badger she asked thats what id like to know said mr badger ruefully you dont mean to say you aint a match for a boy she demanded sarcastically perhaps youd like to try him yourself said her husband this is very absurd mr badger you know very well hes weak for a boy of sixteen and he hasnt had anything to eat since morning if you think hes weak youd better tackle him retorted nathan i tell you wife hes got the strength of a man and a strong man too i dont understand it tell me exactly what happened well you saw me go upstairs with the stick andrew jackson gave me said mr badger assuming a sitting position i saw the boy lyin on the bed snoring and i up with my stick and brought it down pretty hard he quivered a little but that was all so i thought id try it again he jumped out of bed and sprang on me like a tiger grinding his teeth but not saying a word i tell you wife he seemed as strong as a horse i couldnt get up and he sat and pounded me the idea of being pounded by a small boy ejaculated mrs badger just what id have said a quarter of an hour ago it seems impossible perhaps it does but its so he never acted so before no and he never hit andrew jackson before but yesterday he did it i tell you what wife i believe the boys gone crazy crazy ejaculated mrs badger and andrew in a breath just so when folks are crazy theyre a good deal stronger than its nateral for them to be and thats the way with bill benton but what could possibly make him crazy demanded mrs badger incredulously it may be the want of vittles i dont know as wed orter have kept him without his dinner and supper i dont believe a bit in such rubbish said mrs badger whose courage had come back with the absolute silence in the attic chamber i believe youre a coward nathan badger ill go upstairs myself and see if i cant succeed better than you did youd better not wife oh dont go ma said andrew jackson pale with terror im going said the intrepid woman it shant be said of me that im afraid of a little bound boy whos as weak as a rat youll find out how weak he is said mr badger i warn you not to go im goin all the same said mrs badger youll see how ill tame him down give me the stick then go if youre so plaguy obstinate said her husband and it must be confessed that he rather hoped his wife who had ventured to ridicule him might herself meet with a reception that would make her change her tune somewhat mrs badger stick in hand marched up to the door of the attic and called out boldly open the door you young villain how does she know im young thought tom tapley who was on guard in the room well now if she wasnt such an old woman i should feel flattered i guess ill have to scare her a little it wouldnt be polite to tumble her downstairs as i did her husband have you gone crazy demanded mrs badger behind the door not that i know of muttered the tramp perhaps you think you can manage me as well as mr badger she continued i should smile if i couldnt commented tom tapley that woman must think shes extra strong to be a match for me im coming in to whip you till you cry for mercy really shes a pretty spunky old woman thought the tramp if i cant hold my own against her ill sell myself for old rags mrs badger pushed open the door saw dimly the outline of the tramp and struck at it with the stick but alas the stick was wrenched from her hand a pistol loaded only with powder was discharged and the intrepid lady in a panic flew out of the room and downstairs tumbling into her husbands arms nathan badger was delighted at his wifes discomfiture she couldnt taunt him any longer i told you so he chuckled how do you like tacklin him yourself my dear wouldnt you like to try it again ho ho mr badger youre a fool exclaimed his wife sharply it strikes me youre a little in that way yourself mrs badger did you give him a floggin ho ho you were in a great hurry to come away mr badger he fired at me with a pistol i tell you hes a dangerous boy to have in the house oh no mrs badger you can manage him just as easy shut up mr badger how did i know he had a pistol i tell you its a serious thing before morning you and andrew jackson and me may be dead corpses at this awful statement andrew jackson burst into a terrified howl ill tell you what wed better do mr badger well go into our room and lock ourselves in let me come in too said andrew hell kill me he hates me yes my darling you may come too said his mother so the valiant three locked themselves up in a chamber and listened nervously but tom tapley was already out of the house he made his escape over the roof fearing that the neighborhood would be roused and his safety endangered so passed a night of unparalleled excitement in the badger homestead chapter xxx attacked in the rear early the next morning the three badgers held a council of war it was unanimously decided that something must be done but what that something should be it was not easy to determine mr badger suggested that the town constable should be summoned the boy has committed assault and battery upon our persons mrs badger he said and it is proper that he should be arrested shall i go for the constable asked andrew jackson i should like to have him put in jail then we should be safe the constable would not be up so early andrew besides said mrs badger we shall be laughed at for not being able to take care of a single smallsized boy you know what he is capable of mrs badger at least you did when you came flyin down the attic stairs into my arms shut up mr badger said his wife who was ashamed when she remembered her panic youd better not say anything he got you on the floor and pounded you you a fullgrown man id like to pound him said badger setting his teeth hard its a pity if three of us cant manage him without calling in a constable continued mrs badger who on the whole had more courage than her husband what do you propose wife asked nathan i propose that we all go up and seize him he is probably asleep and cant give any trouble we can tie him hand and foot before he wakes up capital said mr badger who was wonderfully assured by the thought that his young enemy might be asleep well go right up he may be awake suggested andrew jackson true we must go well armed ill carry the gun it will do to knock the pistol out of his hand before he gets a chance to use it perhaps so assented mrs badger and you andrew jackson what can you take ill take the poker said the heroic andrew very good we had better arm ourselves as soon as possible or he may wake up by the way mr badger where is the ball of twine it will be useful to tie the boys hands if his hands are tied he cant work no but i will only keep them tied while i give him a thrashing you can take possession of his pistol and hide it when he is thoroughly subdued we will untie him and send him to work without his breakfast suggested andrew no he has already fasted since yesterday morning and it may make him desperate he shall have some breakfast and that will give him strength to work andrew jackson was rather disappointed at the decision that bill was to have breakfast but on this point he did not venture to oppose his father the plan of campaign having been decided upon it only remained to carry it out mr badger took the old musket and headed the procession his wife slipped downstairs and returned with the kitchen broom and a poker the last she put in the hands of her son use it andrew jackson if occasion requires you may be called upon to defend your father and mother should such be the case do not flinch but behave like a hero i will ma exclaimed andrew fired perhaps by the example of the great general after whom he was named but you and pa must tackle him first we will exclaimed the intrepid matron the disgraceful scenes of last evening must not again be enacted this time we march to certain victory mr badger go on and i will follow the three in the order arranged advanced to the foot of the stairs and mr badger slowly and cautiously mounted them pausing before the door of the room that contained as he supposed the desperate boy shall i speak to him before entering he asked in a tone of indecision turning back to his wife certainly not it will put him on his guard keep as still as you can we want to surprise him to account for what followed it must be stated that dick schmidt awakened his visitor early and the two went down to breakfast mr schmidt was going to the market town and found it necessary to breakfast at five oclock this happened fortunately for bill as he was able to obtain a much better breakfast there than at home when breakfast was over he said soberly dick i must go back why do you go back at all said dick impulsively i must it is the only home i have i wish you could stay with me so do i but mr badger would come after me i suppose he would do you think he will flog you i am sure he will id like to flog him the brute dont take it too hard bill youll be a man some time and then no one can punish you poor bill as he took his lonely way back to the house of his tyrannical employer in the early morning he could not help wishing that he was already a man and his days of thraldom were over he was barely sixteen five long weary years lay before him ill try to stand it though its hard murmured bill i suppose hes very mad because i wasnt home last night but im glad i went i had two good meals and a quiet nights sleep it was not long before he came in sight of home probably no one was up in the badger household usually bill was the first to get up and mrs badger next for andrew jackson and his father were neither of them fond of early rising the front and back doors were no doubt locked but bill knew how to get in he went to the shed raised a window and clambered in perhaps i can get up to my room without anybody hearing me he reflected he passed softly through the front room into the entry and up the front stairs all was quiet bill concluded that no one was up he came to the foot of the attic stairs and his astonished gaze rested on the three badgers armed respectively with a gun a broom and a poker all on their way to his room were they going to murder me he thought just then andrew jackson who led the rear and was therefore nearest to bill looked back and saw the terrible foe within three feet of him he uttered a loud yell and scarcely knowing what he was about brought down the poker with force on his mothers back at the same time crying there he is ma mrs badger in her flurry struck her husband with the broom while her husband equally panicstricken fired the musket it was overloaded and as a natural result kicked overthrowing mr badger who in his downward progress carried with him his wife and son astonished and terrified bill turned and fled leaving the house in the same way he entered it he struck across the fields and in that moment decided that he would never return to mr badger unless he was dragged there he felt sure that if he did he would be murdered he had no plans except to get away he saw dick schmidt bade him a hurried goodby and took the road toward the next town for three days he traveled indebted to compassionate farmers for food but excitement and fatigue finally overcame him and he sank by the roadside about fifty miles from the town of dexter whence he had started on his pilgrimage chapter xxxi bill benton finds a friend late one afternoon robert coverdale reached columbus on his western trip the next day he was to push on to the town of dexter where he had information that the boy of whom he was in search lived the train however did not leave till eleven oclock in the forenoon and robert felt justified in devoting his leisure hours to seeing what he could of the city and its surroundings he took an early breakfast and walked out into the suburbs as he strolled along a little boy about seven years old ran to meet him please mister he said wont you come quick theres a boy layin by the road back there and i guess hes dead robert needed no second appeal his heart was warm and he liked to help others when he could show me where bub he said the little fellow turned and ran back robert keeping pace with him by the roadside stretched out pale and with closed eyes lay the poor bound boy known as bill benton he was never very strong and the scanty fare to which he had been confined had sapped his physical strength robert at first sight thought he was dead he bent down and put his hand upon the boys heart it was beating though faintly is he dead mister asked the boy no but he has fainted away is there any water near by yes there was a spring close at hand the little boy said robert ran to it soaked his handkerchief in it and returning laved the boys face the result was encouraging bill opened his eyes and asked in a wondering tone where am i you are with a friend said robert soothingly how do you feel i am very tired and weak murmured bill are you traveling yes where i dont know robert thought that the boys mind might be wandering but continued have you no friends in columbus no i have no friends anywhere answered bill sorrowfully except dick schmidt i suppose dick is a boy yes where have you been living you wont take me back there said bill uneasily i wont take you anywhere where you dont want to go i want to be your friend if you will let me i should like a friend answered bill slowly then examining the kind boyish face that was bent over him he said i like you have you had anything to eat today asked robert no will you go with me to my hotel i have no money poor boy thought robert it is easy enough to see that bills ragged clothes were assurance enough of the truth of what he said i must take care of this poor boy thought robert it will delay me but i cant leave him he heard the sound of approaching wheels and looking up saw a man approaching in a wagon robert signaled him to stop i want to take this boy to the hotel he said but he has not strength enough to walk will you take us aboard i will pay you a fair price poor little chap he looks sick thats a fact said the kindhearted countryman yes ill give you both a lift and i wont ask a cent there was some surprise felt at the hotel when robert appeared with his newfound friend some of the servants looked askance at the ragged clothes but robert said quietly i will pay for him and no objection was made when bill was undressed and put to bed and had partaken of a refreshing breakfast he looked a great deal brighter and seemed much more cheerful you are very kind he said to robert i hope somebody would do as much for me if i needed it answered robert do you mind telling me about yourself i will tell anything you wish said bill who now felt perfect confidence in his new friend what is your name bill benton at any rate thats what they call me dont you think its your real name then no have you any remembrance of your real name asked robert not dreaming of the answer he would receive when i was a little boy they called me julian but julian repeated robert eagerly yes can you tell what was your last name asked robert quickly bill shook his head no i dont remember tell me said robert did you live with a man named badger in the town of dexter the sick boy started and seemed extremely surprised how did you find out he asked did mr badger send you for me i never saw mr badger in my life bill er perhaps i ought to say julian looked less anxious yes he said but he treated me badly and i ran away did you ever hear of a man named charles waldo yes he was the man that sent me to mr badger its a clear case thought robert overjoyed i have no doubt now that i have found the hermits son poor boy how he must have suffered julian said he do you know why i am traveling what brought me here but of course you dont i came to find you to find me but you said no it was not mr badger nor mr waldo that sent me they are your enemies the one that sent me is your friend julian how would you like to have a

roberts opinion the youngster will be all right in a week or ten days he said all he wants is rest and good living how soon will he be able to travel in a week at the outside during this week roberts attention was drawn to the following paragraph in a copy of the dexter times a small weekly paper which he found in the reading room of the hotel a desperate young ruffian we understand that a young boy in the service of mr nathan badger one of our most respected citizens has disappeared under very extraordinary circumstances the evening previous to his departure he made an unprovoked attack upon mr and mrs badger actually throwing mr badger downstairs and firing a pistol at mrs badger he was a small slight boy but the strength he exhibited was remarkable in thus coping successfully with a strong man mr badger thinks the boy must have been suddenly attacked by insanity of a violent character what does this mean julian asked robert reading the paragraph to his young protege i dont know answered julian astonished i spent the last night before i came away with my friend dick schmidt in a few days julian looked quite another boy his color began to return and his thin form to fill out while his face wore a peaceful and happy expression in a new and handsome suit of clothes he looked like a young gentleman and not at all like bill benton the bound boy he was devotedly attached to robert the more so because he had never before as far as his memory went received so much kindness from any one as from him now thought robert i am ready to go back to cooks harbor and restore julian to his father chapter xxxii once more in cooks harbor various had been the conjectures in cooks harbor as to what had become of robert coverdale upon this point the hermit was the only person who could have given authentic information but no one thought of applying to him naturally questions were put to mrs trafton but she herself had a very vague idea of roberts destination and moreover she had been warned not to be communicative mr jones the landlord supposed he had gone to try to raise the amount of his mortgage among distant relatives but on this point he felt no anxiety he wont succeed said he to his wife you may depend on that i dont believe hes got any relations that have money and even if he has theyre goin to think twice before they give a boy two hundred dollars on the security of property they dont know anything about what do you intend to do with the cottage mr jones its worth five hundred dollars and i can get more than the interest of five hundred dollars in the way of rent is anybody likely to hire it john sheltons oldest son talks of getting married hell be glad to hire it of me whats to become of mrs trafton i dont know and i dont care answered the landlord carelessly the last time i called she was impudent to me came near ordering me out of the house till i made her understand that i had more right to the house than she had she puts on a good many airs for a poor woman said mrs jones its too ridiculous for a woman like her to be proud if anything she isnt as bad as that young whelp bob coverdale the boy actually told me i wasnt respectful enough to his precious aunt i wonder if theyll be respectful to her in the poorhouse where its likely shell fetch up i dont see where the boy got money enough to go off said mrs jones he didnt need much to get to boston or new york hes probably blackin boots or sellin papers in one of the two i hope he is i wonder how that sort of work will suit the young gentleman tomorrow the times up and i shall foreclose the mortgage ill fix up the place a little and then offer it to young shelton i guess hell be willin to pay me fifty dollars a year rent and thatll be pretty good interest on my two hundred dollars have you given mrs trafton any warning no why should i she knows perfectly well when the time is out and shes had time to get the money if shes got it well and good but if she hasnt she cant complain oh theres young shelton said the landlord looking out of the window ill call him and see if we can make a bargain about renting the cottage frank shelton called out mr jones raising

i shall said the young man bashfully whereabouts do you callate to live well i dont know any place what do you say to the widder traftons house is she goin to leave i think shell have to fact is frank ive got a mortgage on the place which she cant pay and ill have to foreclose you can have it as soon as you want it how much rent did you callate to ask mr jones id ought to have five dollars a month but seein its you said the politic landlord you may have it for fifty dollars a year ill speak to nancy about it said the young fisherman i dont want to turn mrs trafton out but if shes got to go i suppose i might as well hire the house as any one else just so i tell you frank im offerin you a bargain just then frank shelton who was looking out of the window exclaimed in surprise why theres bob coverdale where he just walked by with a smaller boy alongside you dont say so uttered mr jones hardly knowing whether to be glad or sorry well hes come in time to bid goodby to his old home ill go up tomorrow first thing and settle this matter i spose theyll try to beg off but it wont be any use robert had written to the hermit from columbus a letter which conveyed the glad tidings of his success it filled the heart of the recluse with a great and abounding joy life seemed wholly changed for him now he felt that he had something to live for and he determined to change his course of life entirely he would move to boston or new york and resume the social position which he had abandoned there he would devote himself to the training and education of his boy and robert yes he would richly reward the boy who had restored to him the son lost so long he would not yet decide what he would do for him but he felt that there was no reward too great for such a service he knew on what day to expect the two boys for robert had informed him by letter restless he waited for the moment which should restore his son to his arms he took a position on the beach in front of the entrance to the cave and looked anxiously for the approach of the two boys no longer was he clad in his hermit dress but from a trunk he had drawn out a longdisused suit made for him in other days by a fashionable tailor on broadway and he had carefully trimmed and combed his neglected locks my boy must not be ashamed of my appearance he said proudly my hermit life is over henceforth i will live as a man among men presently his waiting glance was rewarded two boys one of whom he recognized as robert descended the cliff and walked briskly toward him on the firm sand beach he did not wait now but hurried toward them he fixed his eyes eagerly upon the second boy julian had much improved in appearance since we first made his acquaintance it does not take long to restore strength and bloom into a boy of sixteen he was slender still but the hue of health mantled his cheeks he was no longer sad but hopeful and in his delicate and refined features his father could see a strong resemblance to the wife he had lost julian said robert coverdale thats your father who is coming let him see that you are glad to meet him mr huet he said this is your son you do not need to tell me he is too like his mother julian my boy heaven be praised that has restored you to me it is hardly to be expected that julian should feel the rapture that swelled the fathers heart for the thought of having a father at all was still new and strange but it was not long before he learned to love him the poor boy had received so little kindness that his fathers warm affection touched his heart and he felt glad and happy to have such a protector god bless and reward you robert said mr huet taking the hand of our hero you shall find that i am not ungrateful for this great service i want to talk to my boy alone for a time but i will come to your aunts house to supper with julian please tell her so and ask her to let it be a good one i will mr huet from julian his father drew the story of his years of hardship and ill treatment and his heart was stirred with indignation as he thought of the cruelty of the relative who had subjected him and his son to that long period of grief and suffering your trials are over now julian he said you will be content to live with me will you not will robert live with us asked the boy do you like robert asked his father i love him like a brother said julian impulsively you dont know how kind he has been to me father yes robert shall live with us if he will said mr huet i will speak about it to him tomorrow will you live here father oh no you must be educated i shall take you to boston or new york and there you shall have every advantage that money can procure hitherto i have not cared to be rich now julian i value money for your sake together they went to mrs traftons cottage to supper what makes you look so sober robert asked mr huet observing that the boy looked grave i have heard that mr jones will foreclose his mortgage tomorrow not if you pay it said mr huet quietly come with me after supper and i will hand you all the money you require robert was about to express his gratitude but mr huet stopped him you owe me no thanks he said it is only the first installment of a great debt which i can never wholly repay chapter xxxiii the landlords defeat about ten oclock the next morning mr nahum jones approached the trafton cottage sitting on a bench

might be bound out to a farmer i dont know any farmer that wants a boy said robert meekly id take you myself said nahum jones if you wasnt so impudent im afraid youre a little too airy for me wouldnt you let the house to me mr jones asked the widow its worth a good deal more than the face of the mortgage you couldnt get a dollar more in my opinion said the landlord as to takin you for a tenant i havent any assurance that you could pay the rent what rent do you want for it mr jones five dollars a month five dollars a month when you say its only worth two hundred dollars im goin to fix it up a little said mr jones rather nonplussed i think mr jones we wont move said robert wont move ejaculated the landlord getting red in the face youve got to move who says so i say so you young whelp no hard names if you please mr jones the fact is my aunt doesnt fancy going to the poorhouse to be sure if she could have your society there it might make a difference youll repent this impudence bob coverdale how am i impudent to talk of my being in the poorhouse you spoke of aunt jane going to the poorhouse thats a different matter at any rate she wont go said robert decidedly wont well see about that how are you going to help it by paying the mortgage answered robert quietly you cant do it said mr jones his jaw drooping you are mistaken mr jones if youll write a receipt i am ready to pay it now principal and interest robert drew out a roll of bills from the pocket of his ragged vest and began to count them where did you get this money ejaculated the landlord i must decline telling you mr jones its good money as you can see i think youll have to tell frank shelton he cant have the house unless he wants to hire of my aunt nahum jones hated to take the money that was offered him but there was no loophole to escape the good bargain was slipping from his grasp the triumphant look faded from his face and he looked exceedingly ill at ease ill come up with you for this bob coverdale he muttered angrily for what paying you money mr jones you know what i mean yes i do know what you mean returned the boy gravely this money is in payment for liquor furnished to my poor uncle liquor which broke up the happiness of his home and finally led to his death you laid a plot to deprive my aunt whom you had so much injured of her home but you have been defeated we dont care to have anything more to do with you there is no need of recording the landlords illnatured answer he was angry and humiliated and when he got home snapped up mrs jones when she began to make

his wife that is to be the arrangement will be very agreeable to me but objected robert how can i build an addition to the house i have no money i beg your pardon said mr huet smiling but i dont think a young gentleman worth ten thousand dollars can truthfully say he has no money i hope robert you are not growing mean ten thousand dollars ejaculated robert his eyes wide open with amazement

thousand dollars payable to robert coverdale or order it was signed by gilbert huet you see you are rich robert said julian smiling with joy at his friends good fortune oh mr huet i dont deserve this said robert his heart full you must let me judge of that my dear boy say no more or you will be depreciating julians value you have restored him to me and i consider him worth much more than ten thousand dollars of course robert joyfully accepted the munificent gift so cordially offered by mr huets advice he invested the money in good dividendpaying securities and monthly sent his aunt twentyfive dollars which with the rent made her quite easy in her circumstances the additions were made to the cottage and frank shelton and his wife were glad to hire the house thus providing mrs trafton with society as well as adding to her income as for robert henceforth he shared in all the educational advantages which julian enjoyed mr huet took a house engaged an excellent housekeeper and at length enjoyed a home one letter he wrote to charles waldo a scathing letter denouncing him for his infamous conduct and threatening severe punishment if he ever again conspired against his happiness mr waldo did not answer the letter for very shame what excuse or apology could he possibly offer three years later robert and julian made a vacation journey westward i should like to call on

wonderful respect for wealth and of mine chimed in mrs badger and im sure my andrew jackson loved you like a brother andrew jackson a gawky youth no more prepossessing than his boyhood promised winked hard and looked enviously at julian when the latter drew from his pocket a silver watch and chain and asked andrew to accept it for old acquaintance sake he was quite overcome and said he liked julian better than any feller he knew then you forgive me for hitting you with a hoe andrew said julian smilingly i dont care for that said andrew jackson stoutly and i guess you moren got even with us that time you stayed with dick schmidt and father tried to thrash a tramp thinking it was you and got thrashed himself then andrew jackson fixed an admiring glance on the watch he had coveted so long boys
