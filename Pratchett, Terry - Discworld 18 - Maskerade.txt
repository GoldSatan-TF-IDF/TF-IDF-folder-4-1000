maskerade by terry pratchett dedication my thanks to the people who showed me that opera was stranger than i could imagine i can best repay their kindness by not mentioning their names here the wind howled the storm crackled on the mountains lightning prodded the crags like an old man trying to get an elusive blackberry pip out of his false teeth among the hissing furze bushes a fire blazed the flames driven this way and that by the gusts an eldritch voice shrieked when shall we two meet again thunder rolled a rather more ordinary voice said whatd you go and shout that for you made me drop my toast in the fire nanny ogg sat down again sorry esme i was just doing it for you know old times sake doesnt roll off the tongue though id just got it nice and brown too sorry anyway you didnt have to shout sorry i mean i aint deaf you couldve just asked me in a normal voice and id have said next wednesday sorry esme just you cut me another slice nanny ogg nodded and turned her head magrat cut granny ano oh mind wandering there for a minute ill do it myself shall i hah said granny weatherwax staring into the fire there was no sound for a while but the roar of the wind and the sound of nanny ogg cutting bread which she did with about as much efficiency as a man trying to chainsaw a mattress i thought itd cheer you up coming up here she said after a while really it wasnt a question take you out of yourself sort of thing nanny went on watching her friend carefully mm said granny still staring moodily at the fire oh dear thought nanny i shouldntve said that the point was well the point was that nanny ogg was worried very worried she wasnt at all sure that her friend wasnt well going well sort of in a manner of speaking well black she knew it happened with the really powerful ones and granny weatherwax was pretty damn powerful she was probably an even more accomplished witch now than the infamous black aliss and everyone knew what had happened to her at the finish pushed into her own stove by a couple of kids and everyone said it was a damn good thing even if it took a whole week to clean the oven but aliss up until that terrible day had terrorized the ramtops shed become so good at magic that there wasnt room in her head for anything else they said weapons couldnt pierce her swords bounced off her skin they said you could hear her mad laughter a mile off and of course while mad laughter was always part of a witchs stockintrade in necessary circumstances this was insane mad laughter the worst kind and she turned people into gingerbread and had a house made of frogs it had been very nasty towards the end it always was when a witch went bad sometimes of course they didnt go bad they just went somewhere grannys intellect needed something to do she did not take kindly to boredom shed take to her bed instead and send her mind out borrowing inside the head of some forest creature listening with its ears seeing with its eyes that was all very well for general purposes but she was too good at it she could stay away longer than anyone nanny ogg had ever heard of one day almost certainly she wouldnt bother to come back and this was the worst time of the year with the geese honking and rushing across the sky every night and the autumn air crisp and inviting there was something terribly tempting about that nanny ogg reckoned she knew what the cause of the problem was she coughed saw magrat the other day she ventured looking sidelong at granny there was no reaction shes looking well queening suits her hmm nanny groaned inwardly if granny couldnt even be bothered to make a nasty remark then she was really missing magrat nanny ogg had never believed it at the start but magrat garlick wet as a sponge though she was half the time had been dead right about one thing three was a natural number for witches and theyd lost one well not lost exactly magrat was queen now and queens were hard to mislay but that meant that there were only two of them instead of three when you had three you had one to run around getting people to make up when thered been a row magrat had been good for that without magrat nanny ogg and granny weatherwax got on one anothers nerves with her all three had been able to get on the nerves of absolutely everyone else in the whole world which had been a lot more fun and there was no having magrat back at least to be precise about it there was no having magrat back yet because while three was a good number for witches it had to be the right sort of three the right sort of types nanny ogg found herself embarrassed even to think about this and this was unusual because embarrassment normally came as naturally to nanny as altruism comes to a cat as a witch she naturally didnt believe in any occult nonsense of any sort but there were one or two truths down below the bedrock of the soul which had to be faced and right in among them was this business of well of the maiden the mother and the other one there shed put words around it of course it was nothing but an old superstition and belonged to the unenlightened days when maiden or mother or the other one encompassed every woman over the age of twelve or so except maybe for nine months of her life these days any girl bright enough to count and sensible enough to take nannys advice could put off being at least one of them for quite some time even so it was an old superstitionolder than books older than writingand beliefs like that were heavy weights on the rubber sheet of human experience tending to pull people into their orbit and magrat had been married for three months that ought to mean she was out of the first category at least nanny twitched her train of thought on to a branch lineshe probably was oh surely young verence had sent off for a helpful manual it had pictures in it and numbered parts nanny knew this because she had sneaked into the royal bedroom while visiting one day and had spent an instructive ten minutes drawing moustaches and spectacles on some of the figures surely even magrat and verence could hardly fail to no they must have worked it out even though nanny had heard that verence had been seen enquiring of people where he might buy a couple of false moustaches itd not be long before magrat was eligible for the second category even if they were both slow readers of course granny weatherwax made a great play of her independence and selfreliance but the point about that kind of stuff was that you needed someone around to be proudly independent and selfreliant at people who didnt need people needed people around to know that they were the kind of people who didnt need people it was like hermits there was no point freezing your nadgers off on top of some mountain while communing with the infinite unless you could rely on a lot of impressionable young women to come along occasionally and say gosh they needed to be three again things got exciting when there were three of you there were rows and adventures and things for granny to get angry about and she was only happy when she was angry in fact it seemed to nanny she was only granny weatherwax when she was angry yes they needed to be three or else it was going to be grey wings in the night or the clang of the oven door the manuscript fell apart as soon as mr goatberger picked it up it wasnt even on proper paper it had been written on old sugar bags and the backs of envelopes and bits of outofdate calendar he grunted and grabbed a handful of the musty pages to throw them on the fire a word caught his eye he read it and his eye was dragged to the end of the sentence then he read to the end of the page doubling back a few times because he hadnt quite believed what hed just read he turned the page and then he turned back and then he read on at one point he took a ruler out of his drawer and looked at it thoughtfully he opened his drinks cabinet the bottle tinkled cheerfully on the edge of the glass as he tried to pour himself a drink then he stared out of the window at the opera house on the other side of the road a small figure was brushing the steps and then he said oh my finally he went to the door and said could you come in here mr cropper his chief printer entered clutching a sheaf of proofs were going to have to get mr cripslock to engrave page again he said mournfully hes spelled famine with seven letters read this said goatberger i was just off to lunch read this guild agreement says read this and see if you still have an appetite mr cropper sat down with bad grace and glanced at the first page then he turned to the second page after a while he opened the desk drawer and pulled out a ruler which he looked at thoughtfully youve just read about banana soup surprise said goatberger yes you wait till you get to spotted dick well my old granny used to make spotted dick not to this recipe said goatberger with absolute certainty cropper fumbled through the pages blimey do you think any of this stuff works who cares go down to the guild right now and hire all the engravers thatre free preferably elderly ones but ive still got the grune june august and spune predictions for next years almanack to forget them use some old ones peoplell notice theyve never noticed before said mr goatberger you know the drill astounding rains of curry in klatch amazing death of the seriph of ee plague of wasps in howondaland this is a lot more important he stared unseeing out of the window again considerably more important and he dreamed the dream of all those who publish books which was to have so much gold in your pockets that you would have to employ two people just to hold your trousers up the huge becolumned gargoylehaunted face of ankhmorporks opera house was there in front of agnes nitt she stopped at least most of agnes stopped there was a lot of agnes it took some time for outlying regions to come to rest well this was it at last she could go in or she could go away it was what they called a life choice shed never had one of those before finally after standing still for long enough for a pigeon to consider the perching possibilities of her huge and rather sad black floppy hat she climbed the steps a man was theoretically sweeping them what he was in fact doing was moving the dirt around with a broom to give it a change of scenery and a chance to make new friends he was dressed in a long coat that was slightly too small for him and had a black beret perched incongruously on spiky black hair excuse me said agnes the effect was electric he turned around tangled one foot with the other and collapsed on to his broom agness hand flew to her mouth and then she reached down oh im so sorry the hand had that clammy feel that makes a holder think longingly of soap he pulled it away quickly pushed his greasy hair out of his eyes and gave her a terrified smile he had what nanny ogg called an underdone face its features rubbery and pale no trouble miss are you all right he scrambled up got the broom somehow tangled between his knees and sat down again sharply er shall i hold the broom said agnes helpfully she pulled it out of the tangle he got up again after a couple of false starts do you work for the opera house said agnes yes miss er can you tell me where i have to go for the auditions he looked around wildly stagedoor he said ill show you the words came out in a rush as if he had to line them up and fire them all in one go before they had time to wander off he snatched the broom out of her hands and set off down the steps and towards the corner of the building he had a unique stride it looked as though his body were being dragged forward and his legs had to flail around underneath it landing wherever they could find room it wasnt so much a walk as a collapse indefinitely postponed his erratic footsteps led towards a door in the side wall agnes followed them in just inside was a sort of shed with one open wall and a counter positioned so that someone standing there could watch the door the person behind it must have been a human being because walruses dont wear coats the strange man had disappeared somewhere in the gloom beyond agnes looked around desperately yes miss said the walrus man it really was an impressive moustache which had sapped all the growth from the rest of its owner er im here for the the auditions said agnes i saw a notice that said you were auditioning she gave a helpless little smile the doorkeepers face proclaimed that it had seen and been unimpressed by more desperate smiles than even agnes could have eaten hot dinners he produced a clipboard and a stub of pencil you got to sign here he said who was thatperson who came in with me the moustache moved suggesting a smile was buried somewhere below everyone knows our walter plinge this seemed to be all the information that was likely to be imparted agnes gripped the pencil the most important question was what should she call herself her name had many sterling qualities no doubt but it didnt exactly roll off the tongue it snapped off the palate and clicked between the teeth but it didnt roll off the tongue the trouble was she couldnt think of one with great rotational capabilities catherine possibly or perdita she could go back to trying perdita shed been embarrassed out of using that name in lancre it was a mysterious name hinting of darkness and intrigue and incidentally of someone who was quite thin shed even given herself a middle initialxwhich stood for someone who has a cool and exciting middle initial it hadnt worked lancre people were depressingly resistant to cool she had just been known as that agnes who calls herself perditax shed never dared tell anyone that shed like her full name to be perdita x dream they just wouldnt understand theyd say things like if you think thats the right name for you why have you still got two shelves full of soft toys well here she could start afresh she was good she knew she was good probably no hope for the dream though she was probably stuck with the nitt nanny ogg usually went to bed early after all she was an old lady sometimes she went to bed as early as a m her breath puffed in the air as she walked through the woods her boots crunched on the leaves the wind had died away leaving the sky wide and clear and open for the first frost of the season a petalnipping fruitwithering little scorcher that showed you why they called nature a mother a third witch three witches could sort of spread the load maiden mother and crone there the trouble was that granny weatherwax combined all three in one she was a maiden as far as nanny knew and she was at least in the right agebracket for a crone and as for the third well cross granny weatherwax on a bad day and youd be like a blossom in the frost there was bound to be a candidate for the vacancy though there were several young girls in lancre who were just about the right age trouble was the young men of lancre knew it too nanny wandered the summer hayfields regularly and had a sharp if compassionate eye and damn good overthehorizon hearing violet frottidge was walking out with young deviousness carter or at least doing something within ninety degrees of walking out bonnie quarney had been gathering nuts in may with william simple and it was only because shed thought ahead and taken a little advice from nanny that she wouldnt be bearing fruit in february and pretty soon now young mildred tinkers mother would have a quiet word with mildred tinkers father and hed have a word with his friend thatcher and hed have a word with his son hob and then thered be a wedding all done in a properly civilized way except for maybe a black eye or two no doubt about it thought nanny with a mistyeyed smile innocence in a hot lancre summer was that state in which innocence is lost and then a name rose out of the throng oh yes her why hadnt she thought of her but you didnt of course whenever you thought about the young girls of lancre you didnt remember her and then you said oh yes her too of course o course shes got a wonderful personality and good hair of course she was bright and talented in many ways her voice for one thing that was her power finding its way out and of course she also had a wonderful personality so thered be not much chance of her being disqualified well that was settled then another witch to bully and impress would set granny up a treat and agnes would be bound to thank her eventually nanny ogg was relieved you needed at least three witches for a coven two witches was just an argument she opened the door of her cottage and climbed the stairs to bed her cat the tom greebo was spread out on the eiderdown like a puddle of grey fur he didnt even awake as nanny lifted him up bodily so that nightdressclad she could slide between the sheets just to keep bad dreams at bay she took a swig out of a bottle that smelled of apples and happy braindeath then she pummelled her pillow thought her yes and drifted off to sleep presently greebo awoke stretched yawned and hopped silently to the floor then the most vicious and cunning a pile of fur that ever had the intelligence to sit on a bird table with its mouth open and a piece of toast balanced on its nose vanished through the open window a few minutes later the cockerel in the garden next door stuck up his head to greet the bright new day and died instantly middoodledoo there was a huge darkness in front of agnes while at the same time she was halfblinded by the light just below the edge of the stage giant flat candles floated in a long trough of water producing a strong yellow glare quite unlike the oil lamps of home beyond the light the auditorium waited like the mouth of a very big and extremely hungry animal from somewhere on the far side of the lights a voice said when youre ready miss it wasnt a particularly unfriendly voice it just wanted her to get on with it sing her piece and go ive er got this song its a youve given your music to miss proudlet er there isnt an accompaniment actually it oh its a folk song is it there was a whispering in the darkness and someone laughed quietly off you go then perdita right agnes launched into the hedgehog song and knew by about word seven that it had been the wrong choice you needed a tavern with people leering and thumping their mugs on the table this big brilliant emptiness just sucked at it and made her voice hesitant and shrill she stopped at the end of verse three she could feel the blush starting somewhere around her knees itd take some time to get to her face because it had a lot of skin to cover but by then itd be strawberry pink she could hear whispering words like timbre emerged from the susurration and then she wasnt surprised to hear came impressive build she did she knew have an impressive build so did the opera house she didnt have to feel good about it the voice spoke up you havent had much training have you dear no which was true lancres only other singer of note was nanny ogg whose attitude to songs was purely ballistic you just pointed your voice at the end of the verse and went for it whisper whisper sing us a few scales dear the blush was at chestheight now thundering across the rolling acres scales whisper muffled laugh doremi you know dear starting low lalalah oh yes as the armies of embarrassment stormed her neckline agnes pitched her voice as low as she could and went for it she concentrated on the notes working her way stolidly upwards from sealevel to mountaintop and took no notice at the start when a chair vibrated across the stage or at the end when a glass broke somewhere and several bats fell out of the roof there was silence from the big emptiness except for the thud of another bat and far above a gentle tinkle of glass is is that your full range lass people were clustering in the wings and staring at her no no if i go any higher people faint said agnes and if i go lower everyone says it makes them feel uncomfortable whisper whisper whisper whisper whisper and er any other i can sing with myself in thirds nanny ogg says not everyone can do that sorry up here like domi at the same time whisper whisper show us lass laaaaaa the people at the side of the stage were talking excitedly whisper whisper the voice from the darkness said now your voice projection oh i can do that snapped agnes she was getting rather fed up where would you like it projected im sorry were talking about agnes ground her teeth she was good and shed show them to here or there or here it wasnt that much of a trick she thought it could be very impressive if you put the words in the mouth of a nearby dummy like some of the travelling showmen did but you couldnt pitch it far away and still manage to fool a whole audience now that she was accustomed to the gloom she could just make out people turning around in their seats bewildered whats your name again dear the voice which had at one point shown traces of condescension had a distinct beatenup sound ag per perdita said agnes perdita nitt perdita x nitt we may have to do something about the nitt dear granny weatherwaxs door opened by itself jarge weaver hesitated of course she were a witch peopled told him this sort of thing happened he didnt like it but he didnt like his back either especially when his back didnt like him it came to something when your vertebrae ganged up on you he eased himself forward grimacing balancing himself on two sticks the witch was sitting in a rocking chair facing away from the door jarge hesitated come on in jarge weaver said granny weatherwax and let me give you something for that back of yours the shock made him try to stand upright and this made something whitehot explode somewhere in the region of his belt granny weatherwax rolled her eyes and sighed can you sit down she said no miss i can fall over on a chair though granny produced a small black bottle from an apron pocket and shook it vigorously jarges eyes widened you got that all ready for me he said yes said granny truthfully shed long ago been resigned to the fact that people expected a bottle of something funnycoloured and sticky it wasnt the medicine that did the trick though it was in a way the spoon this is a mixture of rare herbs and suchlike she said including suckrose and akwa my word said jarge impressed take a swig now he obeyed it tasted faintly of liquorice you got to take another swig last thing at night granny went on an then walk three times round a chestnut tree three times round a chestnut tree anan put a pine board under your mattress got to be pine from a twentyyearold tree mind twentyyearold tree said jarge he felt he should make a contribution sos the knots in me back end up in the pine he hazarded granny was impressed it was an outrageously ingenious bit of folk hokum worth remembering for another occasion you got it exactly right she said and thats it you wanted more i thought there were dancin and chantin and stuff did that before you got here said granny my word yes er about payin oh i dont want payin said granny s bad luck taking money oh right jarge brightened up but maybe if your wifes got any old clothes praps im a size black for preference or bakes the odd cake no plums they gives me wind or got a bit of old mead put by could be or praps youll be killing a hog about now best backs my favourite maybe some ham a few pig knuckles anything you can spare really no obligation i wouldnt go around puttin anyone under obligation just cos im a witch everyone all right in your house are they blessed with good health i hope she watched this sink in and now let me help you out of the door she added weaver was never quite certain about what happened next granny usually so sure on her feet seemed to trip over one of his sticks as she went through the door and fell backward holding his shoulders and somehow her knee came up and hit a spot on his backbone as she twisted sideways and there was a click aargh sorry me back me back still jarge reasoned later she was an old woman and she might be getting clumsy and shed always been daft but she made good potions they worked damn fast too he was carrying his sticks by the time he got home granny watched him go shaking her head people were so blind she reflected they preferred to believe in gibberish rather than chiropracty of course it was just as well this was so shed much rather they went oo when she seemed to know who was approaching her cottage than work out that it conveniently overlooked a bend in the track and as for the doorlatch and the trick with the length of black thread but what had she done shed just tricked a rather dim old man shed faced wizards monsters and elves and now she was feeling pleased with herself because shed fooled jarge weaver a man whod twice failed to become village idiot through being overqualified it was the slippery slope next thing itd be cackling and gibbering and luring children into the oven and it wasnt as if she even liked children for years granny weatherwax had been contented enough with the challenge that village witchcraft could offer and then shed been forced to go travelling and shed seen a bit of the world and it had made her itchyespecially at this time of the year when the geese were flying overhead and the first frost had mugged innocent leaves in the deeper valleys she looked around at the kitchen it needed sweeping the washingup needed doing the walls had grown grubby there seemed to be so much to do that she couldnt bring herself to do any of it there was a honking far above and a ragged v of geese sped over the clearing they were heading for warmer weather in places granny weatherwax had only heard about it was tempting the selection committee sat around the table in the office of mr seldom bucket the opera houses new owner hed been joined by salzella the musical director and dr undershaft the chorus master and so said mr bucket we come to lets see yes christine marvellous stage presence eh good figure too he winked at dr undershaft yes very pretty said dr undershaft flatly cant sing though what you artistic types dont realize is this is the century of the fruitbat said bucket opera is a production not just a lot of songs so you say but the idea that a soprano should be fifteen acres of bosom in a horned helmet belongs to the past like salzella and undershaft exchanged glances so he was going to be that kind of owner unfortunately said salzella sourly the idea that a soprano should have a reasonable singing voice does not belong to the past she has a good figure yes she certainly has a sparkle but she cant sing you can train her cant you said bucket a few years in the chorus yes maybe after a few years if i persevere she will be merely very bad said undershaft er gentlemen said mr bucket ahem all right cards on the table eh im a simple man me no beating about the bush speak as you find call a spade a spade do give us your forthright views said salzella definitely that kind of owner he thought selfmade man proud of his handiwork confuses bluffness and honesty with merely being rude i wouldnt mind betting a dollar that he thinks he can tell a mans character by testing the firmness of his handshake and looking deeply into his eyes ive been through the mill i have bucket began and i made myself what i am today selfraising flour thought salzella but i have to er declare a bit of a financial interest her dad did er in fact er lend me a fair whack of money to help me buy this place and he made a heartfelt fatherly request in regard to his daughter if i bring it to mind correctly his exact words er were dont make me have to break your legs i dont expect you artistes to understand its a business thing the gods help those who help themselves thats my motto salzella stuck his hands in his waistcoat pockets leaned back and started to whistle softly i see said undershaft well its not the first time its happened normally its a ballerina of course oh its nothing like that said bucket hurriedly its just that with the money comes this girl christine and you have to admit she does look good oh very well said salzella its your opera house im sure and now perdita they smiled at one another perdita said bucket relieved to get the christine business over so that he could go back to being bluff and honest again perdita x salzella corrected him what will these girls think of next i think she will prove an asset said undershaft yes if we ever do that opera with the elephants but the range what a range shes got quite i saw you staring i meant her voice salzella she will add body to the chorus she is a chorus we could sack everyone else ye gods she can even sing in harmony with herself but can you see her in a major role good grief no wed be a laughingstock quite so she seems quite amenable though wonderful personality i thought and good hair of course shed never expected it to be this easy agnes listened in a kind of trance while people talked at her about wages the need for training and accommodation and then more or less she was forgotten about she stood and watched at the side of the stage while a group of ballet hopefuls were put through their delicate paces you do have an amazing voice said someone behind her she turned as nanny ogg had once remarked it was an education seeing agnes turn around she was light enough on her feet but the inertia of outlying parts meant that bits of agnes were still trying to work out which way to face for some time afterwards the girl who had spoken to her was slightly built even by ordinary standards and had gone to some pains to make herself look even thinner she had long blond hair and the happy smile of someone who is aware that she is thin and has long blond hair my names christine she said isnt this exciting and she had the type of voice that can exclaim a question it seemed to have an excited little squeak permanently screwed to it er yes said agnes ive been waiting for this day for years agnes had been waiting for it for about twentyfour hours ever since shed seen the notice outside the opera house but shed be danged if shed say that where did you train said christine i spent three years with mme venturi at the quirm conservatory um i was agnes hesitated trying out the upcoming sentence in her head i trained with dame ogg but she hasnt got a conservatory because its hard to get the glass up the mountain christine didnt appear to want to question this anything she found too difficult to understand she ignored the money in the chorus isnt very good is it she said no it was less than youd get for scrubbing floors the reason was that when you advertised a dirty floor hundreds of hopefuls didnt turn up but its what ive always wanted to do besides theres the status yes i expect there is ive been to look at the rooms we get theyre very poky what room have you been given agnes looked down blankly at the key she had been handed along with many sharp instructions about no men and an unpleasant notthatyouneedtelling expression on the chorus mistresss face oh christine clapped her hands oh goody pardon im so glad youre next to me agnes was taken aback shed always been resigned to being the last to be picked in the great team game of life well yes i suppose so she said youre so lucky youve got such a majestic figure for opera and such marvellous hair the way you pile it up like that black suits you by the way majestic thought agnes it was a word that would never ever have occurred to her and shed always steered away from white because in white she looked like a washingline on a windy day she followed christine it occurred to agnes as she trudged after the girl en route to her new lodgings that if you spent much time in the same room as christine youd need to open a window to stop from drowning in punctuation from somewhere at the back of the stage quite unheeded someone watched them go people were generally glad to see nanny ogg she was good at making them feel at home in their own home but she was a witch and therefore also expert at arriving just after cakes were baked or sausages were made nanny ogg generally travelled with a string bag stuffed up one kneelength knicker legin case as she put it someone wants to give me something so mrs nitt she observed around about the third cake and fourth cup of tea hows that daughter of yours agnes it is to whom i refer oh didnt you hear mrs ogg shes gone off to ankhmorpork to be a singer nanny oggs heart sank thats nice she said she has a good singing voice i remember of course i gave her a few tips i used to hear her singing in the woods its the air here said mrs nitt shes always had such a good chest yes indeed noted for it so er shes not here then you know our agnes she never says much i think she thought it was a bit dull dull lancre said nanny ogg thats what i said said mrs nitt i said we get some lovely sunsets up here and theres the fair every soul cake tuesday regular nanny ogg thought about agnes you needed quite large thoughts to fit all of agnes in lancre had always bred strong capable women a lancre farmer needed a wife whod think nothing of beating a wolf to death with her apron when she went out to get some firewood and while kissing initially seemed to have more charms than cookery a stolid lancre lad looking for a bride would bear in mind his fathers advice that kisses eventually lost their fire but cookery tended to get even better over the years and direct his courting to those families that clearly showed a tradition of enjoying their food agnes was nanny considered quite goodlooking in an expansive kind of way she was a fine figure of typical young lancre womanhood this meant she was approximately two womanhoods from anywhere else nanny also recalled her as being rather thoughtful and shy as if trying to reduce the amount of world she took up but she had shown signs of craft ability that was only to be expected there was nothing like that not fitting in feeling to stimulate the old magical nerves that was why esme was so good at it in agness case this had manifested itself in a tendency to wear soppy black lace gloves and pale makeup and call herself perdita plus an initial from the arse of the alphabet but nanny had assumed that would soon burn off when she got some serious witchcraft under her rather strained belt she should have paid more attention to the thing about music power found its way out by all sorts of routes music and magic had a lot in common they were only two letters apart for one thing and you couldnt do both damn nanny had rather been counting on the girl she used to send off to ankhmorpork for music said mrs nitt see she handed nanny several piles of papers nanny leafed through them songsheets were common enough in the ramtops and a singsong in the parlour was considered the third best thing to do on long dark evenings but nanny could see this wasnt ordinary music it was far too crowded for that cosi fan hita she read die meistersinger von scrote thats foreign said mrs nitt proudly it certainly is said nanny mrs nitt was looking expectantly at her what said nanny and then oh mrs nitts eyes flickered to her emptied teacup and back again nanny ogg sighed and laid the music aside occasionally she saw granny weatherwaxs point sometimes people expected too little of witches yes indeedy she said trying to smile let us see what destiny in the form of these driedup bits of leaf has in store for us eh she set her features in a suitable occult expression and looked down into the cup which a second later smashed into fragments when it hit the floor it was a small room in fact it was half a small room since a thin wall had been built across it junior members of the chorus ranked rather lower than apprentice sceneshifters in the opera there was room for a bed a wardrobe a dressingtable and quite out of place a huge mirror as big as the door impressive isnt it said christine they tried to take it out but its built into the wall apparently im sure it will be very useful agnes said nothing her own halfroom the other half of this one didnt have a mirror she was glad of that she did not regard mirrors as naturally friendly it wasnt just the images they showed her there was something worrying about mirrors shed always felt that they seemed to be looking at her agnes hated being looked at christine stepped into the small space in the middle of the floor and twirled there was something very enjoyable about watching her it was the sparkle agnes thought something about christine suggested sequins isnt this nice she said not liking christine would be like not liking small fluffy animals and christine was just like a small fluffy animal a rabbit perhaps it was certainly impossible for her to get a whole idea into her head in one go she had to nibble it into manageable bits agnes glanced at the mirror again her reflection stared at her she could have done with some time to herself right now everything had happened so quickly and this place made her uneasy everything would feel a lot better if she could just have some time to herself christine stopped twirling are you all right agnes nodded do tell me about yourself er well agnes was gratified despite herself im from somewhere up in the mountains youve probably never heard of she stopped a light had gone off in christines head and agnes realized that the question had been asked not because christine in any way wanted to know the answer but for something to say she went on and my father is the emperor of klatch and my mother is a small tray of raspberry puddings thats interesting said christine who was looking at the mirror do you think my hair looks right what agnes would have said if christine had been capable of listening to anything for more than a couple of seconds was shed woken up one morning with the horrible realization that shed been saddled with a lovely personality it was as simple as that oh and very good hair it wasnt so much the personality it was the but that people always added when they talked about it but shes got a lovely personality they said it was the lack of choice that rankled no one had asked her before she was born whether she wanted a lovely personality or whether shed prefer say a miserable personality but a body that could take size in dresses instead people would take pains to tell her that beauty was only skindeep as if a man ever fell for an attractive pair of kidneys she could feel a future trying to land on her shed caught herself saying poot and dang when she wanted to swear and using pink writing paper shed got a reputation for being calm and capable in a crisis next thing she knew shed be making shortbread and apple pies as good as her mothers and then thered be no hope for her so shed introduced perdita shed heard somewhere that inside every fat woman was a thin woman trying to get out so shed named her perdita she was a good repository for all those thoughts that agnes couldnt think on account of her wonderful personality perdita would use black writing paper if she could get away with it and would be beautifully pale instead of embarrassingly flushed perdita wanted to be an interestingly lost soul in plumcoloured lipstick just occasionally though agnes thought perdita was as dumb as she was was the only alternative the witches shed felt their interest in her in a way she couldnt exactly identify it was of a piece with knowing when someone was watching you although she had in fact occasionally seen nanny ogg watching her in a critical kind of fashion like someone inspecting a secondhand horse she knew she did have some talent sometimes she knew things that were going to happen although always in a sufficiently confused way that the knowledge was totally useless until afterwards and there was her voice she was aware it wasnt quite natural shed always enjoyed singing and somehow her voice had just done everything shed wanted it to do but shed seen the ways the witches lived oh nanny ogg was all rightquite a nice old baggage really but the others were weird lying crosswise on the world instead of nicely parallel to it like everyone else old mother dismass who could see into the past and the future but was totally blind in the present and millie hopwood over in slice who stuttered and had runny ears and as for granny weatherwax oh yes finest job in the world being a sour old woman with no friends they were always looking for weird people like themselves well they could look in vain for agnes nitt fed up with living in lancre and fed up with the witches and above all fed up with being agnes nitt shed escaped nanny ogg didnt look built for running but she covered the ground deceptively fast her great heavy boots kicking up shoals of leaves there was a trumpeting overhead another skein of geese passed across the sky so fast in pursuit of the summer that their wings were hardly moving in the ballistic rush granny weatherwaxs cottage looked deserted it had nanny felt a particularly empty feel she scurried around to the back door and burst through pounded up the stairs saw the gaunt figure on the bed reached an instant conclusion grabbed the pitcher of water from its place on the marble washstand ran forward a hand shot up and grabbed her wrist i was having a nap said granny opening her eyes gytha i swear i could feel you comin half a mile away we got to make a cup of tea quick gasped nanny almost sagging with relief granny weatherwax was more than bright enough not to ask questions but you couldnt hurry a good cup of tea nanny ogg jiggled from one foot to the other while the fire was pumped up the small frogs fished out of the water bucket the water boiled the dried leaves allowed to seep i aint saying nothing said nanny sitting down at last just pour a cup thats all on the whole witches despised fortunetelling from tealeaves tealeaves are not uniquely fortunate in knowing what the future holds they are really just something for the eyes to rest on while the mind does the work practically anything would do the scum on a puddle the skin on a custard anything nanny ogg could see the future in the froth on a beer mug it invariably showed that she was going to enjoy a refreshing drink which she almost certainly was not going to pay for you recall young agnes nitt said nanny as granny weatherwax tried to find the milk granny hesitated agnes who calls herself perditax perdita x said nanny she at least respected anyones right to recreate themselves granny shrugged fat girl big hair walks with her feet turned out sings to herself in the woods good voice reads books says poot instead of swearing blushes when anyone looks at her wears black lace gloves with the fingers cut out you remember we once talked about maybe how possibly she might be suitable oh theres a twist in the soul there youre right said granny but its an unfortunate name her fathers name was terminal said nanny ogg reflectively there were three sons primal medial and terminal im afraid the familys always had a problem with education i meant agnes said granny always puts me in mind of carpet fluff that name probly thats why she called herself perdita said nanny worse got her fixed in your mind said nanny yes i suppose so good now look at them tealeaves granny looked down there was no particular drama perhaps because of the way nanny had built up expectations but granny did hiss between her teeth well now theres a thing she said see it see it yep likea skull yep and them eyes i nearly pi i was pretty damn surprised by them eyes i can tell you granny carefully replaced the cup her main showed me her letters home said nanny i brung em with me its worrying esme she could be facing something bad shes a lancre girl one of ours nothings too much trouble when its one of your own i always say tealeaves cant tell the future said granny quietly everyone knows that tealeaves dont know well whod be so daft as to tell anything to a bunch of dried leaves nanny ogg looked down at agness letters home they were written in the careful rounded script of someone whod been taught to write as a child by copying letters on a slate and had never written enough as an adult to change their style the person writing them had also very conscientiously drawn faint pencil lines on the paper before writing dear mam i hope this finds you as it leaves me here i am in ankhmorpork and everything is all right i have not been ravished yet i am staying at treacle mine road it is alright and granny tried another dear mum i hope you are well everything is fine but the money runs away like water here i am doing some singing in taverns but i am not making much so i went to see the guild of seamstresses about getting a sewing job and i took along some stitching to show them and youd be amazed thats all i can say and another dear mother some good news at last next week theyre holding auditions at the opera house whats opera said granny weatherwax its like theatre with singing said nanny ogg hah theatre said granny darkly our nev told me about it its all singing in foreign languages he said he couldnt understand any of it granny put down the letters yes but your nev cant understand a lot of things what was he doing at this opera theatre anyway nicking the lead off the roof nanny said this quite happily it wasnt theft if an ogg was doing it cant tell much from the letters except thats shes picking up an education said granny but its a long way to there was a hesitant knock on the door it was shawn ogg nannys youngest son and lancres entire civil and public service currently he had his postmans badge on the lancre postal service consisted of taking the mailbag off the nail where the coach left it and delivering it to the outlying homesteads when he had a moment although many citizens were in the habit of going down to the sack and rummaging until they found some mail they liked he touched his helmet respectfully at granny weatherwax got a lot of letters mum he said to nanny ogg er theyre all addressed to er well er youd better have a look mum nanny ogg took the proffered bundle the lancre witch she said aloud thatd be me then said granny weatherwax firmly and took the letters ah well id better be going said nanny backing towards the door cant imagine why peopled be writing to me said granny slitting an envelope still i suppose news gets around she focused on the words dear witch she read i would just like to say how much i appreciated the famous carrot and oyster pie recipe my husband nanny ogg made it halfway down the path before her boots became suddenly too heavy to lift gytha ogg you come back here right now agnes tried again she didnt really know anyone in ankhmorpork and she did need someone to talk to even if they didnt listen i suppose mainly i came because of the witches she said christine turned her eyes wide with fascination so was her mouth it was like looking at a rather pretty bowling ball witches she breathed oh yes said agnes wearily yes people were always fascinated by the idea of witches they should try living around them she thought do they do spells and ride around on broomsticks oh yes no wonder you ran away what oh no its not like that i mean theyre not bad its much worse than that worse than bad they think they know whats best for everybody christines forehead wrinkled as it tended to when she was contemplating a problem more complex than what is your name that doesnt sound very ba they mess people around they think that just because theyre right thats the same as good its not even as though they do any real magic its all fooling people and being clever they think they can do what they like the force of the words knocked even christine back oh dear did they want you to do something they want me to be something but im not going to christine stared at her and then automatically forgot everything shed just heard come on she said lets have a look around nanny ogg balanced on a chair and took down an oblong wrapped in paper granny watched sternly with her arms folded thing is nanny babbled under the laser glare my late husband i remember him once sayin to me after dinner he said you know mother itd be a real shame if all the stuff you know just passed away when you did why dont you write some of it down so i scribbled the odd one when i had a moment and then i thought itd be nice to have it all properly done so i sent it off to the almanack people in ankhmorpork and they hardly charged me anything and a little while ago they sent me this i think its a very good job its amazing how they get all the letters so neat you done a book said granny only cookery said nanny ogg meekly as one might plead a first offence what do you know about it you hardly ever do any cooking said granny i do specialities said nanny granny looked at the offending volume the joye of snacks she read out loud bye a lancre witch hah why dint you put your own name on it eh booksve got to have a name on em sos everyone knows whos guilty its my gnome de plum said nanny mr goatberger the almanack man said itd make it sound more mysterious granny cast her gimlet gaze to the bottom of the crowded cover where it said in very small lettering cxx viith printyng more than twenty thoufand solde one half dollar you sent them some money to get it all printed she said only a couple of dollars said nanny damn good job they made of it too and then they sent the money back afterwards only they got it wrong and sent three dollars extra granny weatherwax was grudgingly literate but keenly numerate she assumed that anything written down was probably a lie and that applied to numbers too numbers were used only by people who wanted to put one over on you her lips moved silently as she thought about numbers oh she said quietly and that was it was it you never wrote to him again not on your life three dollars mind i dint want him saying he wanted em back i can see that said granny still dwelling in the world of numbers she wondered how much it cost to do a book it couldnt be a lot they had sort of printing mills to do the actual work after all theres a lot you can do with three dollars said nanny right enough said granny you aint got a pencil about you have you you being a literary type and all i got a slate said nanny pass it over then i bin keeping it by me in case i wake up in the night and i get an idea for a recipe see said nanny good said granny vaguely the slate pencil squeaked across the grey tablet the paper must cost something and youd probably have to tip someone a couple of pennies to sell itangular figures danced from column to column ill make another cup of tea shall i said nanny relieved that the conversation appeared to be coming to a peaceful end hmm said granny she stared at the result and drew two lines under it but you enjoyed it did you she called out the writin nanny ogg poked her head around the scullery door oh yes the money dint matter she said youve never been very good at numbers have you said granny now she drew a circle around the final figure oh you know me esme said nanny cheerfully i couldnt subtract a fart from a plate of beans thats good cos i reckon this master goatberger owes you a bit more than you got if theres any justice in the world said granny money aint everything esme what i say is if youve got your health i reckon if theres any justice its about four or five thousand dollars said granny quietly there was a crash from the scullery so its a good job the money dont matter granny weatherwax went on itd be a terrible thing otherwise all that money matterin nanny oggs white face appeared around the edge of the door he never could be a bit more said granny ptmsoansilanguageengbit never you just adds up and divides and that nanny ogg stared in horrified fascination at her own fingers but thats a she stopped the only word she could think of was fortune and that wasnt adequate witches didnt operate in a cash economy the whole of the ramtops by and large got by without the complications of capital fifty dollars was a fortune a hundred dollars was a was a was well it was two fortunes that was what it was its a lot of money she said weakly what couldnt i do with money like that dunno said granny weatherwax what did you do with the three dollars got it in a tin up the chimney said nanny ogg granny nodded approvingly this was the kind of good fiscal practice she liked to see beats me why peopled fall over themselves to read a cookery book though she added i mean its not the sort of thing that the room fell silent nanny ogg shuffled her boots granny said in a voice laden with a suspicion that was all the worse because it wasnt yet quite sure what it was suspicious of it is a cookery book isnt it oh yes said nanny hurriedly avoiding grannys gaze yes recipes and that yes granny glared at her just recipes yes oh yes yes and some cookery anecdotes yes granny went on glaring nanny gave in er look under famous carrot and oyster pie she said page granny turned the pages her lips moved silently then i see anything else er cinnamon and marshmallow fingerspage granny looked it up and ercelery astonishment page granny looked that up too cant say it astonished me she said and er well more or less all of humorous puddings and cake decoration thats all of chapter six i done illustrations for that granny turned to chapter six she had to turn the book around a couple of times what one you looking at said nanny ogg because an author is always keen to get feedback strawberry wobbler said granny ah that one always gets a laugh it did not appear to be obtaining one from granny she carefully closed the book gytha she said this is me askin you this is there any page in this book is there any single recipe which does not in some way relate to goingson nanny ogg her face red as her apples seemed to give this some lengthy consideration porridge she said eventually really yes er no i tell a lie its got my special honey mixture in it granny turned a page what about this one maids of honour weeelll they starts out as maids of honour said nanny fidgeting with her feet but they ends up tarts granny looked at the front cover again the joye of snacks an you actually set out to it just sort of turned out that way really granny weatherwax was not a jouster in the lists of love but as an intelligent onlooker she knew how the game was played no wonder the book had sold like hot cakes half the recipes told you how to make them it was surprising the pages hadnt singed and it was by a lancre witch the world was granny weatherwax modestly admitted well aware of who the witch of lancre was viz it was her gytha ogg she said yes esme gytha ogg you look me in the eye sorry esme a lancre witch it says here i never thought esme so youll go and see mr goatberger and have this stopped right i dont want people lookin at me and thinkin about the banana soup surprise i dont even believe the banana soup surprise and i aint relishin going down the street and hearin people makin cracks about bananas yes esme and ill come with you to make sure you do yes esme and well talk to the man about your money yes esme and we might just drop in on young agnes to make sure shes all right yes esme but well do it diplomatic like we dont want people thinkin were pokin our noses in yes esme no one could say i interfere where im not wanted you wont find anyone callin me a busybody yes esme that was yes esme you wont find anyone callin you a busybody was it oh yes esme you sure about that yes esme good granny looked out at the dull grey sky and the dying leaves and felt amazingly enough her sap rising a day ago the future had looked aching and desolate and now it looked full of surprises and terror and bad things happening to people if she had anything to do with it anyway in the scullery nanny ogg grinned to herself agnes had known a little bit about the theatre a travelling company came to lancre sometimes their stage was about twice the size of a door and backstage consisted of a bit of sacking behind which was usually a man trying to change trousers and wigs at the same time and another man dressed as a king having a surreptitious smoke the opera house was almost as big as the patricians palace and far more palatial it covered three acres there was stabling for twenty horses and two elephants in the cellar agnes spent some time there because the elephants were reassuringly larger than her there were rooms behind the stage so big that entire sets were stored there there was a whole ballet school somewhere in the building some of the girls were on stage now ugly in woolly jumpers going through a routine the inside of the opera houseat least the backstage insideput agnes strongly in mind of the clock her brother had taken apart to find the tick it was hardly a building it was more like a machine sets and curtains and ropes hung in the darkness like dreadful things in a forgotten cellar the stage was only a small part of the place a little rectangle of light in a huge complicated darkness full of significant machinery a piece of dust floated down from the blackness high above she brushed it off i thought i heard someone up there she said its probably the ghost said christine weve got one you know oh i said we isnt this exciting a man with his face covered by a white mask said agnes oh youve heard about him then what who the ghost blast thought agnes it was always ready to catch her out just when she thought shed put all that behind her shed know things without quite knowing why it upset people it certainly upset her oh i suppose someone must have told meshe mumbled he moves around the opera house invisibly they say one moment hell be in the gods next moment hell be backstage somewhere no one knows how he does it really they say he watches every performance thats why they never sell tickets for box eight didnt you know box eight said agnes whats a box boxes you know thats where you get the best people look i shall show you christine marched to the front of the stage and waved a hand grandly at the empty auditorium the boxes she said over there and right up there the gods her voice bounced back from the distant wall arent the best people in the gods it sounds oh no the best people will be in boxes or possibly in the stalls agnes pointed whos down there they must get a good view dont be silly thats the pit thats for the musicians well that makes sense anyway er which ones box eight i dont know but they say if ever they sell seats in box eight therell be a dreadful tragedy isnt that romantic for some reason agness practical eye was drawn to the huge chandelier that hung over the auditorium like a fantastic sea monster its thick rope disappeared into the darkness near the ceiling the glass chimes tinkled another flare of that certain power which agnes did her best to suppress at every turn flashed a treacherous image across her mind that looks like an accident waiting to happen if ever i saw one she mumbled im sure its perfectly safe trilled christine im sure they wouldnt allow a chord rolled out shaking the stage the chandelier tinkled and more dust came down what was that said agnes it was the organ its so big its behind the stage come on lets go and see other members of the staff were hurrying towards the organ there was an overturned bucket nearby and a spreading pool of green paint a carpenter reached past agnes and picked up an envelope that was lying on the organ seat its for the boss he said when its my mail the postman usually just knocks said a ballerina and giggled agnes looked up ropes swung lazily in the musty darkness for a moment she thought she saw a flash of white and then it was gone there was a shape just visible tangled in the ropes something wet and sticky dripped down and splashed on the keyboard people were already screaming when agnes reached past dipped her finger in the growing puddle and sniffed its blood said the carpenter its blood isnt it said a musician blood screamed christine blood it was agness terrible fate to keep her head in a crisis she sniffed her finger again its turpentine said agnes er sorry is that wrong up in the tangle of ropes the figure moaned shouldnt we get him down she added cando cutoff was a humble woodcutter he wasnt humble because he was a woodcutter he would still have been quite humble if hed owned five logging mills he was just naturally humble and he was unpretentiously stacking some logs at the pointwhere the lancre road met the main mountain road when he saw a farm cart rumble to a halt and unload two elderly ladies in black both carried a broomstick in one hand and a sack in the other they were arguing it was not a raisedvoice argument but a chronic wrangle that had clearly been going on for some time and was set in for the rest of the decade its all very well for you but its my three dollars so i dont see why i cant say how we go i likes flying and im telling you its too draughty on broomsticks this time of year esme the breeze gets into places i wouldnt dream of talking about really cant imagine where thosed be then oh esme dont oh esme me it werent me that come up with the amusing wedding trifle with the special sponge fingers anyway greebo dont like it on the broomstick hes got a delicate stomach cutoff noticed that one of the sacks was moving in a lazy way gytha ive seen him eat half a skunk so dont tell me about his delicate stomach said granny who disliked cats on principle anyway hes been doing it again nanny ogg waved her hands airily oh he only does it sometimes when hes really in a corner she said he did it in ole mrs gropes henhouse last week she went into see what all the ruckus was and he did it right in front of her she had to have a lie down he was probably more frightened than she was said nanny defensively thats what comes of getting strange ideas in foreign parts said granny now youve got a cat who yes what is it cutoff had meekly approached them and was hovering in the kind of halfcrouch of someone trying to be noticed while also not wanting to intrude are you ladies waiting for the stagecoach yes said the taller of the ladies um im afraid the next coach doesnt stop here it doesnt stop until creel springs they gave him a couple of polite stares thank you said the tall one she turned to her companion it gave her a nasty shock anyway i dread to think what hell learn this time he pines when im gone he wont take food from anyone else only cos they try to poison him and no wonder cutoff shook his head sadly and wandered back to his log pile the coach turned up five minutes later coming around the corner at speed it drew level with the women and stopped that is the horses tried to stand still and the wheels locked it wasnt so much a skid as a spin and the whole thing gradually came to rest about fifty yards down the road with the driver in a tree the women strolled towards it still arguing one of them poked the driver with her broomstick two tickets to ankhmorpork please he landed in the road what do you mean two tickets to ankhmorpork the coach doesnt stop here looks stopped to me did you do something what us listen lady even if i was stopping here the tickets are forty damn dollars each oh whyve you got broomsticks shouted the driver are you witches yes have you got any special low terms for witches yeah how about meddling interfering old baggages cutoff felt that he must have missed part of the conversation because the next exchange went like this what was that again young man two complimentary tickets to ankhmorpork maam no problem inside seats mind no travelling on the top certainly maam excuse me while i just kneel in the dirt sos you can step up maam cutoff nodded happily to himself as the coach pulled away again it was nice to see that good manners and courtesy were still alive with great difficulty and much shouting and untangling of ropes far above the figure was lowered to the stage he was soaked in paint and turpentine the swelling audience of off duty staff and rehearsal truants crowded in around him agnes knelt down loosened his collar and tried to unwind the rope that had caught around arm and neck does anyone know him she said its tommy cripps said a musician he paints scenery tommy moaned and opened his eyes i saw him he muttered it was horrible saw what said agnes and then she had a sudden feeling that shed intruded on some private conversation around her there was a babble of voices giselle said she saw him last week hes here its happening again are we all doomed squeaked christine tommy cripps gripped agness arm hes got a face like death who the ghost what gho its white bone he has no nose a couple of ballet dancers fainted but carefully so as not to get their clothes dirty then how does hue agnes began i saw him too on cue the company turned an elderly man advanced across the stage he wore an ancient opera hat and carried a sack over one shoulder while his spare hand made the needlessly expansive gestures of someone who has got hold of some direful information and cant wait to freeze all nearby spines the sack must have contained something alive because it was bouncing around i saw him ooooooh yes wi his great black cloak and his white face with no eyes but only two holes where eyes should be ooohhhh and he had a mask on said agnes the old man paused and shot her the dark look reserved for all those who insist on injecting a note of sanity when things are getting interestingly ghastly and he had no nose he went on ignoring her i just said that muttered tommy cripps in a rather annoyed voice i told them that they already know that if he had no nose how did he sme agnes began but no one was listening to her did you mention about the eyes said the old man i was just getting round to the eyes snapped tommy yes he had eyes like are we talking about some kind of mask here said agnes now everyone was giving her that kind of look ufologists get when they suddenly say hey if you shade your eyes you can see it is just a flock of geese after all the man with the sack coughed and regrouped like great holes they were he began but it was clear that it had all been spoiled for him great holes he said sourly thats what i saw and no nose i might add thank you so very much its the ghost again said a sceneshifter he jumped out from behind the organ said tommy cripps next thing i knew there was a rope around my neck and i was upsidedown the company looked at the man with the sack in case he could trump this great big black holes he managed sticking to what he knew all right everyone whats going on here an imposing figure strode out of the wings he had flowing black hair carefully brushed to give it a carefree alfresco look but the face underneath was the face of an organizer he nodded at the old man with the sack what are you staring at mr pounder he said the old man looked down i knows what i saw mr salzella he said i see lots o things i do as much as is visible through the bottom of a bottle i have no doubt you old reprobate what happened to tommy it was the ghost said tommy delighted to have centrestage again he swooped out at me mr salzella i think my leg is broken he added quickly in the voice of one who is suddenly aware of the timeoff opportunities of the situation agnes expected the newcomer to say something like ghosts theres no such thing he had the kind of face that said that instead he said back again is he where did he go didnt see mr salzella he just swooped off again some of you help tommy down to the canteen said salzella and someone else fetch a doctor his leg isnt broken said agnes but thats a nasty rope burn on his neck and hes filled his own ear with paint what do you know about it miss said tommy a paintfilled ear didnt sound as though it had the possibilities of a broken leg ive er had some training said agnes and then added quickly its a nasty burn though and of course there may be some delayed shock brandy is very good for that isnt it said tommy perhaps you could try forcing some between my lips thank you perdita the rest of you go back to what you were doing said salzella big dark holes said mr pounder big ones yes thank you mr pounder help ron with mr cripps will you perdita you come here and you christine the two girls stood before the director of music did you see anything said salzella i saw a great creature with great flapping wings and great big holes where his eyes should be said christine im afraid i just saw something white up in the ceiling said agnes sorry she blushed aware of how useless that sounded perdita would have seen a mysterious cloaked figure or something something interesting salzella smiled at her you mean you just see things that are really there he said i can see you havent been with the opera for long dear but i may say im pleased to have a levelheaded person around here for once oh no screamed someone its the ghost shrieked christine automatically er its the young man behind the organ said agnes sorry observant as well as levelheaded said salzella whereas i can see that you christine will fit right in here whats the matter andrй a fairhaired young man peered around the organ pipes someones been smashing things mr salzella he said mournfully the pallet springs and the backfalls and everything completely ruined im sure i wont be able to get a tune out of it and its priceless salzella sighed all right ill tell mister bucket he said thank you everyone he gave agnes a gloomy nod and strode off you shouldnt ort to do that to people said nanny ogg in a vague sort of way as the coach began to get up speed she looked around with a wide friendly grin at the now rather dishevelled occupants of the coach morning she said delving into the sack im gytha ogg ive got fifteen children this is my friend esme weatherwax were going to ankhmorpork would anyone like an egg sandwich ive brung plenty the cats been sleepin on them but theyre fine look they bend back all right no please yourself im sure lets see what else weve got ah has anybody got an opener for a bottle of beer a man in the corner indicated that he might have such a thing fine said nanny ogg anyone got something to drink a bottle of beer out of another man nodded hopefully good said nanny ogg now has anybody got a bottle of beer granny for once not the centre of attention as all horrified eyes were on nanny and her sack surveyed the other occupants of the coach the express stage went right over the ramtops and all the way through the patchwork of little countries beyond if it cost forty dollars just from lancre then it must have cost these people a lot more what sort of folk spent the best part of two months wages just to travel fast and uncomfortably the thin man who sat clutching his bag was probably a spy she decided the fat man whod volunteered the glass looked as if he sold things he had the unpleasant complexion of someone whod hit too many bottles but missed too many meals they were huddled together on their seat because the rest of it was occupied by a man of almost wizardly proportions he didnt appear to have woken up when the coach stopped there was a handkerchief over his face he was snoring with the regularity of a geyser and looked as though the only worries he might have in the world were a tendency for small objects to gravitate towards him and the occasional tide nanny ogg continued to rummage around in her bag and as was the case when she was preoccupied her mouth had wired itself to her eyeballs without her brain intervening she was used to travelling by broomstick long distance ground travel was a novelty to her so shed prepared with some care lessee now book of puzzles for long journeys cushion foot powder mosquito trap phrase book bag to be sick into oh dear the audience which against all probability had managed to squeeze itself further away from nanny during the litany waited with horrified interest what said granny how often dyou reckon this coach stops whats the matter i shouldve gone before we left sorry its the jolting anyone know if theres a privy on this thing she added brightly er said the probable spy we generally wait until the next stop or he stopped he had been about to add theres always the window which was a manly option on the bumpier rural stretches but he stopped himself in the horrible apprehension that this ghastly old woman might seriously consider the possibility theres ohulan just a bit further on the road said granny who was trying to doze you just wait this coach doesnt stop at ohulan said the spy helpfully granny weatherwax raised her head up until now that is said the spy mr bucket was sitting in his office trying to make sense of the opera houses books they didnt make any kind of sense he reckoned he was as good as the next man at reading a balancesheet but these were to bookkeeping what grit was to clockwork seldom bucket had always enjoyed opera he didnt understand it and never had but he didnt understand the ocean either and he enjoyed that too hed looked upon the purchase as well something to do a sort of working retirement the offer had been too good to pass up things had been getting pretty tough in the wholesale cheeseandmilkderivatives business and hed been looking forward to the quieter climes of the world of art the previous owners had put on some good operas it was only a shame that their genius hadnt run to bookkeeping as well money seemed to have been taken out of the accounts when anyone needed it the financialrecord system largely consisted of notes on torn bits of paper saying ive taken to pay q see you monday r who was r who was q what was the money for you wouldnt get away with this sort of thing in the world of cheese he looked up as the door opened ah salzella he said thank you for coming you dont know who q is by any chance no mr bucket or r im afraid not salzella pulled up a chair its taken me all morning but ive worked out we pay more than fifteen hundred dollars a year for ballet shoes said bucket waving a piece of paper in the air salzella nodded yes they do rather go through them at the toes i mean its ridiculous ive still got a pair of boots belonging to my father but ballet shoes sir are rather more like foot gloves salzella explained youre telling me they cost seven dollars a pair and they last hardly any time at all a few performances there must be some way we can make a saving ptmsoansilanguageengbsalzella gave his new employer a long cool stare possibly we could ask the girls to spend more time in the air he said a few extra grands jetes bucket looked puzzled would that work he said suspiciously well their feet wouldnt be on the ground for so long would they said salzella in the tones of one who knows for a fact that hes much more intelligent than anyone else in the room good point good point have a word with the ballet mistress will you of course i am sure she will welcome the suggestion you may well have halved costs at a stroke bucket beamed which is perhaps just as well said salzella there is in fact another matter that ive come to see you about yes it is to do with the organ we had had what do you mean had said bucket adding youre going to tell me something expensive are you what have we got now a lot of pipes and some keyboards said salzella everything else has been smashed smashed who by salzella leaned back he was not a man to whom amusement came easily but he realized that he was rather enjoying this tell me he said when mr pnigeus and mr cavaille sold you this opera house did they mention anything supernatural bucket scratched his head well yes after id signed and paid it was a bit of a joke they said oh and by the way people say theres some man in evening dress who haunts the place haha ridiculous isnt it these theatrical people like children really haha but you may find it keeps them happy if you always keep box eight free on first nights haha i remember that quite well handing over thirty thousand dollars concentrates the memory a bit and then they rode off quite a fast carriage now i come to think about it ah said salzella and he almost smiled well now that the ink is dry i wonder if i might fill you in on the fine detail you make yourself useful esme weatherwax said the voice from the bushes by obligin me and findin any dock or burdock plants that might happen to be around out there thank you very much herbs whatre you plannin with them im plannin to say thank goodness big leaves just what i need birds sang the wind rattled the dried seedheads of moor land flowers granny weatherwax poked in the ditches to see if there were any interesting herbs hereabouts high over the hills a buzzard screamed and wheeled the coach stood by the side of the road despite the fact that it should have been speeding along at least twenty miles away at last granny grew bored and sidled towards a clump of gorse bushes howre you doing gytha fine fine said a muffled voice only i reckon the coach driver is getting a bit impatient you cant hurry nature said nanny ogg well dont blame me you was the one who said it was too draughty on the broomsticks some distance from the bushes where nanny ogg was communing with nature there was placid under the autumn sky a lake in the reeds a swan was dying or was due to die there was however an unforeseen snag death sat down on the bank now look he said i know how it is supposed to go swans sing just once beautifully before they die thats where the word swansong originates it is very moving now let us try this again he produced a tuning fork from the shadowy recesses of his robe and twanged it on the side of his scythe theres your note uhuh said the swan shaking its head why make it difficult i like it here said the swan that has nothing to do with it did you know i can break a mans arm with a blow of my wing how about if i get you started do you know moonlight bay thats no more than a barbershop ditty i happen to be a swan little brown jug death cleared his throat ha ha ha hee hee hee little thats a song the swan hissed angrily and swayed from one crabbed foot to the other i dont know who you are sirrah but where i come from weve got better taste in music really would you care to show me an example uhuh damn thought youd got me there didnt you said the swan thought youd tricked me eh thought i might unthinkingly give you a couple of bars of the pedlars song from lohenshaak eh i dont know that one the swan took a deep laboured breath thats the one that goes schneide meinen eigenen hals thank you said death the scythe moved bugger a moment later the swan stepped out of its body and ruffled fresh but slightly transparent wings now what it said thats up to you its always up to you mr bucket leaned back in his creaky leather chair with his eyes shut until his director of music had finished so bucket said let me see if ive got this right theres this ghost every time anyone loses a hammer in this place its been stolen by the ghost every time someone cracks a note its because of the ghost but also every time someone finds a lost object its because of the ghost every time someone has a very good scene it must be because of the ghost he sort of comes with the building like the rats every so often someone sees him but not for long because he comes and goes like a well a ghost apparently we let him use box eight for free on every firstnight performance and you say people like him like isnt quite the right word said salzella it would be more correct to say that well its pure superstition of course but they think hes lucky thought he was anyway and you wouldnt understand a thing about that would you you coarse little cheesemonger he added to himself cheese is cheese milk goes rotten naturally you dont have to make it happen by having several hundred people wound up until their nerves go twang lucky said bucket flatly luck is very important said salzella in a voice in which pained patience floated like ice cubes i imagine that temperament is not an important factor in the cheese business we rely on rennet said bucket salzella sighed anyway the company feel that the ghost is lucky he used to send people little notes of encouragement after a really good performance sopranos would find a box of chocolates in their dressingroom that sort of thing and dead flowers for some reason dead flowers well not flowers at all as such just a bouquet of dead rosestems with no roses on them its something of a trademark of his its considered lucky dead flowers are lucky possibly live flowers certainly are terribly bad luck on stage some singers wont even have them in their dressingroom so dead flowers are safe you might say odd but safe and it didnt worry people because everyone thought the ghost was on their side at least they did until about six months ago mr bucket shut his eyes again tell me he said there have been accidents what kind of accidents the kind of accidents that you prefer to call accidents mr buckets eyes stayed closed like the time when reg plenty and fred chiswell were working late one night up on the curdling vats and it turned out reg had been seeing freds wife and somehow bucket swallowed somehow he must have tripped fred said and fallen i am not familiar with the gentlemen concerned but that kind of accident yes bucket sighed that was some of the finest farmhouse nutty we ever made do you want me to tell you about our accidents im sure youre going to a seamstress stitched herself to the wall a deputy stage manager was found stabbed with a prop sword oh and you wouldnt like me to tell you what happened to the man who worked the trapdoor and all the lead mysteriously disappeared from the roof although personally i dont think that was the work of the ghost and everyone calls these accidents well you wanted to sell your cheese didnt you i cant imagine anything that would depress the house like news that dead bodies are dropping like flies out of the flies he took an envelope out of his pocket and placed it on the table the ghost likes to leave little messages he said there was one by the organ a scenery painter spotted him andnearly had an accident bucket sniffed the envelope it reeked of turpentine the letter inside was on a sheet of the opera houses own notepaper in neat copperplate writing it said ahahahahaha ahahahaha aahahaha beware yrs sincerely the opera ghost what sort of person said salzella patiently sits down and writes a maniacal laugh and all those exclamation marks you notice five a sure sign of someone who wears his underpants on his head opera can do that to a man look at least lets search the building the cellars go on for ever ill need a boat a boat in the cellar oh didnt they tell you about the subbasement bucket smiled the bright crazed smile of a man who was nearing double exclamation marks himself no he said they didnt tell me about the subbasement they were too busy not telling me that someone goes around killing the company i dont recall anyone saying oh by the way people are dying a lot and incidentally theres a touch of rising damp theyre flooded oh good said bucket what with buckets of blood didnt you have a look they said the cellars were fine and you believed them well there was rather a lot of champagne salzella sighed bucket took offence at the sigh i happen to pride myself that i am a good judge of character he said look a man deeply in the eye and give him a firm handshake and you know everything about him yes indeed said salzella oh blast senor enrico basilica will be here the day after tomorrow do you think something might happen to him oh not much cut throat perhaps what you think so how should i know what do you want me to do close the place as far as i can see it doesnt make any money as it is why hasnt anyone told the watch that would be worse said salzella big trolls in rusty chain mail tramping everywhere getting in everyones way and asking stupid questions theyd close us down bucket swallowed oh we cant have that he said cant have them putting everyone on edge salzella sat back he seemed to relax a little on edge mr bucket he said this is opera everyone is always on edge have you ever heard of a catastrophe curve mr bucket seldom bucket did his best well i know theres a dreadful bend in the road up by a catastrophe curve mr bucket is what opera runs along opera happens because a large number of things amazingly fail to go wrong mr bucket it works because of hatred and love and nerves all the time this isnt cheese this is opera if you wanted a quiet retirement mr bucket you shouldnt have bought the opera house you should have done something peaceful like alligator dentistry nanny ogg was easily bored but on the other hand she was also easy to amuse certainly an interestin way to travel she said you do get to see places yes said granny every five miles it seems to me cant think whats got into me i shouldnt think the horses have managed to get fastern a walk all morning they were by now alone except for the huge snoring man the other two had got out and joined the travellers on top the main cause of this was greebo with a cats unerring instinct for people who dislike cats hed leapt heavily into their laps and given them the young masser back on de ole plantation treatment and hed treadled them into submission and then settled down and gone to sleep claws gripping not sufficiently to draw blood but definitely to suggest that this was an option should the person move or breathe and then when he was sure they were resigned to the situation hed started to smell no one knew where it came from it was not associated with any known orifice it was just that after five minutes doze the air above greebo had a penetrating smell of fermented carpets he was now trying it out on the very large man it wasnt working at last greebo had found a stomach too big for him also the continuing going up and down was beginning to make him feel ill the snores reverberated around the coach wouldnt like to come between him and his pudding said nanny ogg granny was staring out of the window at least her face was turned that way but her eyes were focused on infinity gytha yes esme mind if i ask you a question you dont normally ask if i mind said nanny doesnt it ever get you down the way people dont think properly ohoh thought nanny i reckon i got her out just in time thank goodness for literature how dyou mean she said i means the way they distracts themselves cant say i ever really thought about it esme likespose i was to say to you gytha ogg your house is on fire whats the first thing youd try to take out nanny bit her lip this is one of them personality questions aint it she said thats right like you try to guess what im like by what i say gytha ogg ive known you all my life i knows what youre like i dont need to guess but answer me all the same i reckon id take greebo granny nodded cos that shows ive got a warm and considerate nature nanny went on no it shows youre the kind of person who tries to work out what the right answers supposed to be said granny untrustworthy that was a witchs answer if ever i heard one devious nanny looked proud the snores changed to a blurtblurt noise and the handkerchief quivered treacle pudding with lots of custard hey he just said something said nanny he talks in his sleep said granny weatherwax hes been doing it on and off i never heard him you were out of the coach oh at the last stop he was going on about pancakes with lemon said granny and mashed potatoes with butter makes me feel hungry just listening to that said nanny ive got a pork pie in the bag somewhere the snoring stopped abruptly a hand came up and moved the handkerchief aside the face beyond was friendly bearded and small it gave the witches a shy smile which turned inexorably towards the pork pie want a slice mister said nanny ive got some mustard here too oo would you dear lady said the man in a squeaky voice dont know when i last had a pork pieoh dear he grimaced as if hed just said something wrong and then relaxed got a bottle of beer if you want a drop too said nanny she was one of those women who enjoy seeing people eat almost as much as eating itself beer said the man beer you know they dont let me drink beer hah its supposed to be the wrong ambience id give anything for a pint of beer just a thank you would do said nanny passing it over whos this they to whom you refers said granny s my fault really said the man through a faint spray of pork crumbs got caught up i suppose there was a change in the sounds from outside the lights of a town were going past and the coach was slowing down the man forced the last of the pie into his mouth and washed it down with the dregs of the beer oo lovely he said then he leaned back and put the handkerchief over his face he raised a corner dont tell anyone i spoke to you he said but youve made a friend of henry slugg and what do you do henry slugg said granny carefully im im on the stage yes we can see said nanny ogg no i meant the coach stopped gravel crunched as people climbed down the door was pulled open granny saw a crowd of people peering excitedly through the doorway and reached up automatically to straighten her hat but several hands reached out for henry slugg who sat up smiled nervously and let himself be helped out several people also shouted out a name but it wasnt the name of henry slugg whos enrico basilica said nanny ogg dont know said granny maybe hes the person mr sluggs afraid of the coaching inn was a rundown shack with only two bedrooms for guests as helpless old ladies travelling alone the witches got one simply because all hell would have been let loose if they hadnt mr bucket looked pained i may just be a big man in cheese to you he said you may think im just some hardheaded businessman who wouldnt know culture if he found it floating in his tea but i have been a patron of the opera here and elsewhere for many years i can hum nearly the whole of i am sure youve seen a lot of opera said salzella but how much do you know about production ive been behind the scenes in lots of theatres oh theatre said salzella theatre doesnt even approach it opera isnt theatre with singing and dancing operas opera you might think a production like lohenshaak is full of passion but its a sandpit of toddlers compared to what goes on behind the scenes the singers all loathe the sight of one another the chorus despises the singers they both hate the orchestra and everyone fears the conductor the staff on one prompt side wont talk to the staff on the opposite prompt side the dancers are all crazed from hunger in any case and thats only the start of it because what is really there was a series of knocks at the door they were painfully irregular as if the knocker were having to concentrate quite hard come in walter said salzella walter plinge shuffled in a pail dangling at the end of each arm come to fill your coalscuttle mr bucket bucket waved a hand vaguely and turned back to the director of music you were saying salzella stared at walter as the man carefully piled lumps of coal in the scuttle one at a time salzella what oh im sorry what was i saying something about it being only the start what oh yes yes you see its fine for actors theres plenty of parts for old men actings something you can do all your life you get better at it but when your talent is singing or dancing time creeps up behind you all the he fumbled for a word and settled lamely for time time is the poison you watch backstage one night and youll see the dancers checking all the time in any mirror they can find for that first little imperfection you watch the singers everyones on edge everyone knows that this might be their last perfect night that tomorrow might be the beginning of the end thats why everyone worries about luck you see all the stuff about live flowers being unlucky you remember well sos green and real jewellery worn on stage and real mirrors on stage and whistling on stage and peeking at the audience through the main curtains and using new makeup on a first night and knitting on stage even at rehearsals a yellow clarinet in the orchestra is very unlucky dont ask me why and as for stopping a performance before its proper ending well thats worst of all you might as well sit under a ladder and break mirrors behind salzella walter carefully placed the last lump of coal on the pile in the scuttle and dusted it carefully good grief said bucket at last i thought it was tough in cheese he waved a hand at the pile of papers and what passed for the accounts i paid thirty thousand for this place he said its in the centre of the city prime site i thought it was hard bargaining theyd have probably accepted twentyfive and tell me again about box eight you let this ghost have it the ghost considers it is his for every first night yes how does he get in no one knows weve searched and searched for secret entrances he really doesnt pay no its worth fifty dollars a night there will be trouble if you sell it said salzella good grief salzella youre an educated man how can you sit there so calmly and accept this sort of madness some creature in a mask has the run of the place gets a prime box all to himself kills people and you sit there saying there will be trouble i told you the show must go on why we never said the cheese must go on whats so special about the show going on salzella smiled as far as i understand it he said the power behind the show the soul of the show all the effort thats gone into it call it what you will it leaks out and spills everywhere thats why they burble about the show must go on it must go on but most of the company wouldnt even understand why anyone should ask the question bucket glared at the pile of what passed for the opera houses financial records they certainly dont understand bookkeeping who does the accounts all of us really said salzella all of you money gets put in money gets taken out said salzella vaguely is it important buckets jaw dropped is it important because salzella went on smoothly opera doesnt make money opera never makes money good grief man important whatd i ever have achieved in the cheese business id like to know if id said that money wasnt important salzella smiled humourlessly there are people out on the stage right now sir he said whod say that you would probably have made better cheeses he sighed and leaned over the desk you see he said cheese does make money and opera doesnt operas what you spend money on but what do you get out of it you get opera you put money in you see and opera comes out said salzella wearily theres no profit profit profit murmured the director of music scratching his forehead no i dont believe ive come across the word then how do we manage we seem to rub along bucket put his head in his hands i mean he muttered half to himself i knew the place wasnt making much but i thought that was just because it was run badly we have big audiences we charge a mint for tickets now im told that a ghost runs around killing people and we dont even make any money salzella beamed ah opera he said greebo stalked over the inns rooftops most cats are nervous and ill at ease when taken out of their territory which is why cat books go on about putting butter on their paws and so on presumably because constantly skidding into the walls will take the animals mind off where the walls actually are but greebo travelled well purely because he took it for granted that the whole world was his dirt box he dropped heavily on to an outhouse roof and padded towards a small open window greebo also had a cats approach to possessions which was simply that nothing edible had a right to belong to other people from the window came a variety of smells which included pork pies and cream he squeezed through and dropped on to the pantry shelf of course sometimes he got caught at least sometimes he got discovered there was cream he settled down he was halfway down the bowl when the door opened greebos ears flattened his one good eye sought desperately for an escape route the window was too high the person opening the door was wearing a long dress that militated against the old through the legs routine and and and there was no escape his claws scrabbled on the floor oh no here it came something flipped in his bodys morphogenic field here was a problem a cat shape couldnt deal with oh well we know another one crockery crashed around him shelves erupted as his head rose a bag of flour exploded outwards to make room for his broadening shoulders the cook stared up at him then she looked down and then up and then her gaze dragged as though it were on a winch down again she screamed greebo screamed he grabbed desperately at a bowl to cover that part which as a cat he never had to worry about exposing he screamed again this time because hed just poured lukewarm pork dripping all over himself his groping fingers found a large copper jelly mould clasping it to his groinal areas he barrelled forward and fled out of the pantry and out of the kitchen and out of the diningroom and out of the inn and into the night the spy who was dining with the travelling salesman put down his knife thats something you dont often see he said what said the salesman whod had his back to the excitement one of those old copper jellymoulds theyre worth quite a lot now my aunt had a very good one the hysterical cook was given a big drink and several members of staff went out into the darkness to investigate all they found was a jellymould lying forlornly in the yard at home granny weatherwax slept with open windows and an unlocked door secure in the knowledge that the ramtops various creatures of the night would rather eat their own ears than break in in dangerously civilized lands however she took a different view i really dont think we need to shove the bed in front of the door esme said nanny ogg heaving on her end you cant be too careful said granny supposing some man started rattlin the knob in the middle of the night not at our time of life said nanny sadly gytha ogg you are the most granny was interrupted by a watery sound it came from behind the wall and went on for some time it stopped and then started againa steady splashing that gradually became a trickle nanny started to grin someone fillin a bath said granny or i suppose it could be someone fillin a bath nanny conceded there was the sound of a third jug being emptied footsteps left the room a few seconds later a door opened and there was a rather heavier tread followed after a brief interval by a few splashes and a grunt yes a man gettin into a bath said granny whatre you doin gytha seem if theres a knothole in this wood somewhere said nanny ah heres one come back here sorry esme and then the singing started it was a very pleasant tenor voice given added timbre by the bath itself show me the way to go home im tired and i want to go to bed someones enjoyin themselves anyway said nanny wherever i may roam there was a knock at the distant bathroom door upon which the singer slipped smoothly into another language per via di terra mare o schiuma the witches looked at one another a muffled voice said ive brought you your hot water bottle sir thank you verr mucha said the bather his voice dripping with accent footsteps went away in the distance indicame la strada to go home splash splash good eeeeevening frieeeends well well well said granny more or less to herself it seems once again that our mr slugg is a secret polyglot fancy and you havent even looked through the knothole said nanny gytha is there anything in the whole world you cant make sound grubby not found it yet esme said nanny brightly i meant that when he mutters in his sleep and sings in his bath he talks just like us but when he thinks people are listening he comes over all foreign thats probably to throw that basilica person off the scent nanny said oh i reckon mr basilica is very close to henry slugg said granny in fact i reckon that theyre one and there was a gentle knock at the door whos there granny demanded its me maam mr slot this is my tavern the witches pushed the bed aside and granny opened the door a fraction yes she said suspiciously er the coachman said you were witches yes maybe you could help us whats wrong its my boy granny opened the door further and saw the woman standing behind mr slot one look at her face was enough there was a bundle in her arms granny stepped back bring him in and let me have a look at him she took the baby from the woman sat down on the rooms one chair and pulled back the blanket nanny ogg peered over her shoulder hmm said granny after awhile she glanced at nanny who gave an almost imperceptible shake of her head theres a curse on this house thats what it is said slot my best cows been taken mortally sick too oh you have a cowshed said granny very good place for a sickroom a cowshed its the warmth you better show me where it is you want to take the boy down there right now the man looked at his wife and shrugged well im sure you know your business best he said its this way he led the witches down some back stairs and across a yard and into the foetid sweet air of the byre a cow was stretched out on the straw it rolled an eye madly asthey entered and tried to moo granny took in the scene and stood looking thoughtful for a moment then she said this will do what do you need said slot just peace and quiet the man scratched his head i thought you did a chant or made up some potion or something he said sometimes i mean i know where theres a toad all i shall require is a candle said granny a new one for preference thats all yes mr slot looked a little put out despite his distraction something about his manner suggested that granny weatherwax was possibly not that much of a witch if she didnt want a toad and some matches said granny noting this a pack of cards might be useful too and ill need three cold lamb chops and exactly two pints of beer said nanny ogg the man nodded this didnt sound too toadlike but it was better than nothing whatd you ask for that for hissed granny as the man bustled off cant imagine what good thosed do anyway you already had a big dinner well im always prepared to go that extra meal you wont want me around and ill get bored said nanny did i say i didnt want you around well even i can see that boy is in a coma and the cow has the red bugge if im any judge thats bad too so i reckon youre planning some direct action granny shrugged time like that a witch needs to be alone said nanny but you just mind what youre doing esme weatherwax the child was brought down in a blanket and made as comfortable as possible the man followed behind his wife with a tray mrs ogg will do her necessary procedures with the tray in her room said granny haughtily you just leave me in here tonight and no one is to come in right no matter what the mother gave a worried curtsey but i thought i might look in about midn no one now off you go when theyd been gently but firmly ushered out nanny ogg stuck her head around the door what exactly are you planning esme youve sat up with the dyin often enough gytha oh yes its nannys face fell oh esme youre not going to enjoy your supper gytha granny closed the door she spent some time arranging boxes and barrels so that she had a crude table and something to sit on the air was warm and smelled of bovine flatulence periodically she checked the health of both patients although there was little enough to check in the distance the sounds of the inn gradually subsided the last one was the clink of the innkeepers keys as he locked the doors granny heard him walk across to the cowshed door and hesitate then he went away and began to climb the stairs she waited a little longer and then lit the candle its cheery flame gave the place a warm and comforting glow on the plank table she laid out the cards and attempted to play patience a game shed never been able to master the candle burned down she pushed the cards away and sat watching the flame after some immeasurable piece of time the flame flickered it would have passed unnoticed by anyone who hadnt been concentrating on it for some while she took a deep breath and good morning said granny weatherwax good morning said a voice by her ear nanny ogg had long ago polished off the chops and the beer but she hadnt got into bed she lay on it fully clothed with her arms behind her head staring at the dark ceiling after a while there was a scratching on the shutters she got up and opened them a huge figure leapt into the room for a moment the moonlight lit a glistening torso and a mane of black hair then the creature dived under the bed oh deary deary me said nanny she waited for a while and then fished a chop bone off her tray there was still a bit of meat on it she lowered it towards the floor a hand shot out and grabbed it nanny sat back poor little man she said it was only on the subject of greebo that nannys otherwise keen sense of reality found itself all twisted to nanny ogg he was merely a larger version of the little fluffy kitten he had once been to everyone else he was a scarred ball of inventive malignancy but now he had to deal with a problem seldom encountered by cats the witches had a year ago turned him into a human for reasons that had seemed quite necessary at the time it had taken a lot of effort and his morphogenic field had reasserted itself after a few hours much to everyones relief but magic is never as simple as people think it has to obey certain universal laws and one is that no matter how hard a thing is to do once it has been done itll become a whole lot easier and will therefore be done a lot a huge mountain might be scaled by strong men only after many centuries of failed attempts but a few decades later grandmothers will be strolling up it for tea and then wandering back afterwards to see where they left their glasses in accordance with this law greebos soul had noted that there was one extra option for use in a tight corner and that was become human it tended to wear off after a short time most of which he spent searching desperately for a pair of pants there were snores from under the bed gradually to nannys relief they turned into a purr then she sat bolt upright she was some way from the cowshed but hes here she said granny breathed out slowly come and sit where i can see you thats good manners and let me tell you right now that i aint at all afraid of you the tall blackrobed figure walked across the floor and sat down on a handy barrel leaning its scythe against the wall then it pushed back its hood granny folded her arms and stared calmly at the visitor meeting his gaze eyetosocket i am impressed i have faith really in what particular deity oh none of them then faith in what just faith you know in general death leaned forward the candlelight raised new shadows on his skull courage is easy by candlelight your faith i suspect is in the flame death grinned granny leaned forward and blew out the candle then she folded her arms again and stared fiercely ahead of her after some length of time a voice said all right youve made your point granny lit a match its flare illuminated the skull opposite which hadnt moved fair enough she said as she relit the candle we dont want to be sitting here all night do we how many have you come for one the cow death shook his head it could be the cow no that would be changing history history is about things changing no granny sat back then i challenge you to a game thats traditional thats allowed death was silent for a moment this is true good challenging me by means of a game is allowable yes however you understand that to win all you must gamble all double or quits yes i know but not chess cant abide chess or cripple mr onion ive never been able to understand the rules very well how about one hand of poker five cards each no draws sudden death as they say death thought about this too you know this family no then why are we talking or are we playing oh very well granny picked up the pack of cards and shuffled it not looking at her hands and smiling at death all the time she dealt five cards each and reached down a bony hand grasped hers but first mistress weatherwax we will exchange cards he picked up the two piles and transposed them and then nodded at granny madam ptmsoansilanguageengbgranny looked at her cards and threw them down four queens hmm that is very high death looked down at his cards and then up into grannys steady blueeyed gaze neither moved for some time then death laid the hand on the table i lose he said all i have is four ones he looked back into grannys eyes for a moment there was a blue glow in the depth of his eye sockets maybe for the merest fraction of a second barely noticeable even to the closest observation one winked off granny nodded and extended a hand she prided herself on the ability to judge people by their gaze and their handshake which in this case was a rather chilly one take the cow she said it is a valuable creature who knows what the child will become death stood up and reached for his scythe he said ow ah yes i couldnt help noticing said granny weatherwax as the tension drained out of the atmosphere that you seem to be sparing that arm oh you know how it is repetitive actions and so on it could get serious if you left it how serious want me to have a look would you mind it certainly aches on cold nights granny stood up and reached out but her hands went straight through look youre going to have to make yourself a bit more solid if im to do anything possibly a bottle of suckrose and akwa sugar and water i expect you know thats only for the hard of thinking come on roll up that sleeve dont be a big baby whats the worst i can do to you grannys hands touched smooth bone shed felt worse at least these had never had flesh on them she felt thought gripped twisted there was a click ow now try it above the shoulder er hmm yes it does seem considerably more free yes indeed my word yes thank you very much if it gives you trouble again you know where i live thank you thank you very much you know where everyone lives tuesday mornings is a good time im generally in i shall remember thank you by appointment in your case no offence meant thank you death walked away a moment later there was a faint gasp from the cow that and a slight sagging of the skin were all that apparently marked the transition from living animal to cooling meat granny picked up the baby and laid a hand on its forehead fevers gone she said mistress weatherwax said death from the doorway yes sir i have to know what would have happened if i had not lost at the cards you mean yes what would you have done granny laid the baby down carefully on the straw and smiled well she said for a start id have broken your bloody arm agnes stayed up late simply because of the novelty most people in lancre as the saying goes went to bed with the chickens and got up with the cows but she watched the evenings performance and watched the set being struck afterwards and watched the actors leave or in the case of younger chorus members head off for their lodgings in odd corners of the building and then there was no one else except walter plinge and his mother sweeping up she headed for the staircase there didnt seem to be a candle anywhere back here but the few left burning in the auditorium were just enough to give the darkness a few shades the stairs went up the wall at the rear of the stage with nothing but a rickety handrail between them and the drop besides leading to the attics and storeroom on the upper floors they were also one route to the fly loft and the other secret platforms where men in flat hats and grey overalls worked the magic of the theatre usually by means of pulleys there was a figure on one of the gantries over the stage agnes saw it only because it moved slightly it was kneeling down looking at something in the darkness she stepped back the stair creaked the figure jerked around a square of yellow light opened in the darkness its beam pinning her against the brickwork whos there she said raising a hand to shade her eyes whos that said a voice and then after a moment oh its perdita isnt it the square of light swung towards her as the figure made its way over the stage andrй she said she felt inclined to back away if only the brickwork would let her and suddenly he was on the stairs quite an ordinary person no shadow at all holding a very large lantern what are you doing here said the organist i was just going to bed oh yes he relaxed a little some of you girls have got rooms here the management thought it was safer than having you going home alone late at night what are you doing up here said agnes suddenly aware that there was just the two of them i was looking at the place where the ghost tried to strangle mr cripps said andrй why i wanted to make certain everything was safe now of course didnt the stagehands do that oh you know them i just thought id better make certain agnes looked down at the lantern ive never seen one like that before how did you make it light up so quickly er its a dark lantern theres this flap you see he demonstrated so you can shut it right down and open it up again that must be very useful when youre looking for the black notes dont be sarcastic i just dont want there to be any more trouble youll find that you start looking around when goodnight andrй goodnight then she hurried up the rest of the flights and ducked into her bedroom no one followed her when shed calmed down which took some time she undressed in the voluminous tent of her red flannel nightdress and got into bed resisting any temptation to pull the covers over her head she stared at the dark ceiling thats stupid she thought eventually he was on the stage this morning no one could move that fast she never knew whether she actually got some sleep or whether it happened just as she was dozing off but there was a very faint knock at the door perdita only one person she knew could exclaim a whisper agnes got up and padded over to the door she opened the door a fraction just to check and christine halffell into the room whats the matter im frightened what of the mirror its talking to me can i sleep in your room agnes looked around it was crowded enough with the two of them standing up in it the mirrors talking yes are you sure christine dived into agness bed and pulled the covers over her yes she said indistinctly agnes stood alone in the darkness people always tended to assume that she could cope as if capability went with mass like gravity and merely saying briskly nonsense mirrors dont talk would probably not be any help especially with one half of the dialogue buried beneath the bedclothes she felt her way into the next room stubbing her foot on the bed in the darkness there must be a candle in here somewhere she felt for the tiny bedside table hoping to start the reassuring rattle of a matchbox a faint glimmer from the midnight city filtered through the window the mirror seemed to glow she sat down on the bed which creaked ominously under her oh well one bed was as good as another she was about to lie back when something in the darkness went ting it was a tuning fork and a voice said christine please attend she sat upright staring at the darkness and then realization dawned no men theyd said theyd been very strict about that as if opera were some kind of religion it was not a problem in agness case at least in the way they meant but for someone like christine they said love always found a way and of course so did a number of associated activities oh good grief she felt the blush start in darkness what kind of a reaction was that agness life unrolled in front of her it didnt look as though it were going to have many high points but it did hold years and years of being capable and having a lovely personality it almost certainly held chocolate rather than sex and while agnes was not in a position to make a direct comparison and regardless of the fact that a bar of chocolate could be made to last all day it did not seem a very fair exchange she felt the same feeling shed felt back home sometimes life reaches that desperate point where the wrong thing to do has to be the right thing to do it doesnt matter what direction you go sometimes you just have to go she gripped the bedclothes and replayed in her mind the way her friend spoke you had to have that little gulp that breathless tinkle in the tone that people got whose minds played with the fairies half the time she tried it out in her head and then delivered it to her vocal cords yes whos there a friend agnes pulled the bedclothes up higher in the middle of the night night is nothing to me i belong to the night and i can help you it was a pleasant voice it seemed to be coming from the mirror help me to do what dont you want to be the best singer in the opera oh perdita is a lot better than me there was silence for a moment and then the voice said but while i cannot teach her to look and move like you i can teach you to sing like her agnes stared into the darkness shock and humiliation rising from her like steam tomorrow you will sing the part of iodine but i will teach you how to sing it perfectly next morning the witches had the interior of the coach almost to themselves news like greebo gets around but henry slugg was there if that was indeed his name sitting next to a very welldressed thin little man well here we are again then said nanny ogg henry smiled nervously that was some good singing last night nanny went on henrys face set in a goodnatured grimace in his eyes terror waved a white flag i am afraid senor basilica doesnt speak morporkian maam said the thin man but i will translate for you if you like what said nanny then how come ow sorry said granny weatherwax my elbow must have slipped nanny ogg rubbed her side i was saying she said that he was ow dear me i seem to have done it again said granny this gentleman was telling us that his friend doesnt speak our language gytha eh butwhat oh but ah really oh all right said nanny oh yes eats our pies though when ow excuse my friend its her time of life she gets confused said granny we did enjoy his singing heard him through the wall you were very fortunate said the thin man primly sometimes people have to wait years to hear senor basilica probably waiting for him to finish his dinner a voice muttered in fact at la scalda in genua last month his singing made ten thousand people shed tears hah i can do that i dont see theres anything special about that grannys eyes hadnt left henry senor basilica sluggs face he had the expression of a man whose profound relief was horribly tempered by a dread that it wouldnt last very long senor basilicas fame has spread far and wide said the manager primly just like senior basilica muttered nanny on other peoples pies i expect oh yes too posh for us now just because hes the only man you could find on an atlasow well well said granny smiling in a way that everyone except nanny ogg would think of as innocent its nice and warm in genua i expect senor basilica really misses his home and what do you do young sir i am his manager and translator er you have the advantage of me maam yes indeed granny nodded we have some good singers where we come from too said nanny ogg rebelliously really said the manager and where do you ladies come from lancre the man politely endeavoured to position lancre on his mental map of great centres of music do you have a conservatory there yes indeed said nanny ogg stoutly and then just to make sure she added you should see the size of my tomatoes granny rolled her eyes gytha you havent got a conservatory its just a big windowsill yes but it catches the sun nearly all day ow i expect senor basilica is going to ankhmorpork said granny we said the manager primly have allowed the opera house to engage us for the rest of the season his voice faltered hed looked up at the luggage rack whats that granny glanced up oh thats greebo she said and mister basilicas not to eat him said nanny what is it hes a cat its grinning at me the manager shifted uneasily and i can smell something he said s funny said nanny i cant smell a thing there was a change in the sound of the hooves outside and the coach lurched as it slowed ah said the manager awkwardly i eri see were stopping to change horses its a a nice day i think i may just er see if theres room on the seats outside he left when the coach stopped when it started again a few minutes later he hadnt come back well well said granny as they lurched away again it seems theres just you and me gytha and senor basilica who doesnt speak our language does he mr henry slugg henry slugg took out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead ladies dear ladies i beg you for pitys sake have you done anything bad mr slugg said nanny took advantage of women who dint want to be took advantage of stole done any murders of anyone who dint deserve it no he tellin the truth esme henry writhed under granny weatherwaxs stare yes oh well thats all right then said nanny i understand i dont have to pay taxes myself but i know all about people not wantin to oh its not that i assure you said henry i have people to pay my taxes for me thats a good trick said nanny mr sluggs got a different trick said granny i reckon i know the trick its like sugar and water henry waved his hands uncertainly its just that if they knew he began everythings better if it comes from a long way away thats the secret said granny its yes thats part of it said henry i mean no one wants to listen to a slugg wherere you from henry said nanny really from said granny i grew up in rookery yard in the shades theyre in ankhmorpork said henry it was a terrible rough place there were only three ways out you could sing your way out or you could fight your way out what was the third way said nanny oh you could go down that little alleyway into shamlegger street and then cut down into treacle mine road said henry but no one ever amounted to anything who went that way he sighed i made a few coppers singing in taverns and suchlike he said but when i tried for anything better they said what is your name and i said henry slugg and theyd laugh i thought of changing my name but everyone in ankhmorpork knew who i was and no one wanted to listen to anyone called plain henry slugg nanny nodded its like with conjurers she said theyre never called fred wossname its always something like the great astoundo fresh from the court of the king of klatch and gladys and everyone takes notice said granny and are always careful not to ask themselves if hes come from the king of klatch whys he doing card tricks here in slice population seven the trick is to make sure that everywhere you go you are from somewhere else said henry and then i was famous but youd got stuck as enrico said granny he nodded i was only going to do it to make some money i was going to come back and marry my little angeline who was she said granny oh a girl i grew up with said henry vaguely sharing the same gutter in the back streets of ankhmorpork kind of thing said nanny in an understanding voice gutter in those days you had to put your name down and wait five years for a gutter said henry we thought people in gutters were nobs we shared a drain with two other families and a man who juggled eels he sighed but i moved on and then there was always somewhere else to go and they liked me in brindisi and and he blew his nose on the handkerchief carefully folded it up and produced another one from his pocket i dont mind the pasta and the squid he said well not much but you cant get adecent pint for love nor money and they put olive oil on everything and tomatoes give me a rash and there isnt what id call a good hard cheese in the whole country he dabbed at his face with the handkerchief and people are so kind he said i thought id get a few beefsteaks when i travelled but wherever i go they do pasta especially for me in tomato sauce sometimes they fry it and what they do to the squid he shuddered then they all grin and watch me eat it they think i enjoy it what id give for a plate of nice roast mutton with clootie dumplings why dont you say said nanny he shrugged enrico basilica eats pasta he said theres not much i can do about it now he sat back youre interested in music mrs ogg nanny nodded proudly i can get a tune out of just about anything if you give me five minutes to study it she said and our jason can play the violin and our kev can blow the trombone and all my kids can sing and our shawn can fart any melody you care to name a very talented family indeed said enrico he fumbled in a waistcoat pocket and took out two oblongs of cardboard so please ladies accept these as a small token of gratitude from someone who eats other peoples pies our little secret eh he winked desperately at nanny theyre open tickets for the opera well thats amazin said nanny because were going toow why thank you very much said granny weatherwax taking the tickets how very gracious of you we shall be sure to go and if youll excuse me said enrico i must catch up on my sleep dont worry i shouldnt think its had time to get far away said nanny the singer leaned back pulled the handkerchief over his face and after a few minutes began to snore the happy snore of someone who had done his duty and now with any luck wouldnt have to meet these rather disconcerting old women ever again hes well away said nanny after a while she glanced at the tickets in grannys hand you want to visit the opera she said granny stared into space i said do you want to visit the opera granny looked at the tickets what i want dont signify i suspect she said nanny ogg nodded granny weatherwax was firmly against fiction life was hard enough without lies floating around and changing the way people thought and because the theatre was fiction made flesh she hated the theatre most of all but that was ithate was exactly the right word hate is a force of attraction hate is just love with its back turned she didnt loathe the theatre because had she done so she would have avoided it completely granny now took every opportunity to visit the travelling theatre that came to lancre and sat bolt upright in the front row of every performance staring fiercely even honest punch and judy men found her sitting among the children snapping things like taint so and is that any way to behave as a result lancre was becoming known throughout the sto plains as a really tough gig but what she wanted wasnt important like it or not witches are drawn to the edge of things where two states collide they feel the pull of doors circumferences boundaries gates mirrors masks and stages breakfast was served in the opera houses refectory at halfpast nine actors were not known for their habit of early rising agnes started to fall forward into her eggs and bacon and stopped herself just in time good morning christine sat down with a tray on which was agnes was not surprised to see a plate holding one stick of celery one raisin and about a spoonful of milk she leaned towards agnes and her face very briefly expressed some concern are you all right you look a little peaky agnes caught herself in midsnore im fine she said just a bit tired oh good this exchange having exhausted her higher mental processes christine went back to operating on automatic do you like my new dress she exclaimed isnt it fetching agnes looked at it yes she said very white very lacy very figurehugging and do you know what no what i already have a secret admirer isnt that thrilling all the great singers have them you know a secret admirer yes this dress it arrived at the stage door just now isnt that exciting amazing said agnes glumly and its not as if youve even sung er whos it from he didnt say of course it has to be a secret admirer hell probably want to send me flowers and drink champagne out of my shoe really agnes made a face do people do that its traditional christine boiling over with cheerfulness had some to share you do look very tired she said her hand went to her mouth oh we swapped rooms didnt we i was so silly and dyou know she added with that look of halfempty cunning that was the nearest she came to guile i could have sworn i heard singing in the night someone trying scales and things agnes had been brought up to tell the truth she knew she should say im sorry i appear to have got your life by mistake there seems to have been a bit of a confusion but she decided shed also been brought up to do what she was told not to put herself first to be respectful to her elders and to use no swearword stronger than poot she could borrow a more interesting future just for a night or two she could give it up any time she liked you know thats funny she said because im right next door to you and i didnt oh well thats all right then agnes stared at the tiny meal on christines tray is that all youre having for breakfast oh yes i can just blow up like a balloon dear its lucky for you you can eat anything dont forget its practice in half an hour and she skipped off shes got a head full of air agnes thought im sure she doesnt mean to say anything hurtful but deep inside her perdita x dream thought a rude word mrs plinge took her broom out of the cleaning cupboard and turned walter her voice echoed around the empty stage walter she tapped the broomhandle warily walter had a routine it had taken her years to train him into it it wasnt like him not to be in the right place at the right time she shook her head and started work she could see itd be a mop job later it would probably be ages before they got rid of the smell of turpentine someone came walking across the stage they were whistling mrs plinge was shocked mr pounder the opera houses professional rat catcher stopped and lowered his struggling sack mr pounder wore an old opera hat to show that he was a cut above your normal rodent operative and its brim was thick with wax and the old candle ends he used to light his way through the darker cellars hed worked among the rats so long that there was something ratlike about him now his face seemed to be merely a rearward extension of his nose his moustache was bristly his front teeth were prominent people found themselves looking for his tail whats that mrs plinge you know you mustnt whistle on stage thats terrible bad luck ah well its cos of good luck mrs plinge oh yes if you did know what i dknow youd be a happy man too o course in your case youd be a happy woman on account of you being a woman ah some of the things ive seen mrs plinge found gold down there mr pounder mrs plinge knelt down carefully to scrape away a spot of paint mr pounder picked up his sack and continued on his way could be gold mrs plinge ah could very well be gold it took a moment for mrs plinge to coax her arthritic knees into letting her stand up and shuffle around pardon mr pounder she said somewhere in the distance there was a soft thump as a bundle of sandbags landed gently on the boards the stage was big and bare and empty except for a sack which was scuttling determinedly for freedom mrs plinge looked both ways very carefully mr pounder are you there it suddenly seemed to her that the stage was even bigger and even more distinctly empty than before mr pounder coooeee she craned around hello mr pounder something floated down from above and landed beside her it was a grubby black hat with candle ends around the brim she looked up mr pounder she said mr pounder was used to darkness it held no fears for him and hed always prided himself on his night vision if there was any light at all any speck any glimmer of phosphorescent rot he could make use of it his candled hat was as much for show as anything else his candled hat hed thought i hed lost it but it was strange here it was still on his head yes indeed he rubbed his throat thoughtfully there was something important he couldnt quite remember it was very dark squeak he looked up standing in the air at eyelevel was a robed figure about six inches high a bony nose with bent grey whiskers protruded from the hood tiny skeletal fingers gripped a very small scythe mr pounder nodded thoughtfully to himself you didnt rise to membership of the inner circle of the guild of rat catchers without hearing a few whispered rumours rats had their own death they said as well as their own kings parliaments and nations no human had ever seen it though up until now he felt honoured hed won the golden mallet for most rats caught every year for the past five years but he respected them as a soldier might respect a cunning and valiant enemy er im dead arent i squeak mr pounder felt that many eyes were watching him many small shining eyes and what happens now squeak the soul of mr pounder looked at his hands they seemed to be elongating and getting hairier he could feel his ears growing and a certain rather embarrassing elongation happening at the base of his spine hed spent most of his life in a singleminded activity in dark places yet even so but i dont believe in reincarnation he protested squeak and this mr pounder understood with absolute rodent clarity meant reincarnation believes in you mr bucket went through his mail very carefully and finally breathed out when the pile failed to disgorge another letter with the opera house crest he sat back and pulled open his desk drawer for a pen there was an envelope there he stared at it and then slowly picked up his paperknife sliiiiit rustle i will be obliged if christine sings the role of iodine in la triviata tonight the weather continues fine i trust you are well yrs the opera ghost mr salzella mr salzella bucket pushed back his chair and hurried to the door opening it just in time to confront a ballerina who screamed at him since his nerves were already strained he responded by screaming back at her this seemed to have the effect that usually a wet flannel or a slap was necessary to achieve she stopped and gave him an affronted look hes struck again hasnt he moaned bucket hes here its the ghost said the girl determined to get the line out even though it was not required yes yes i think i know muttered bucket i just hope it wasnt anybody expensive he stopped halfway along the corridor and then spun around the girl cringed away from his wavering finger at least stand on tiptoe he shouted you probably cost me a dollar just running up here there was a crowd in a huddle on the stage in the centre was that new girl the fat one kneeling down and comforting an old woman bucket vaguely recognized the latter she was one of the staff that had come with the opera house as much part of the whole thing as the rats or the gargoyles that infested the rooftops she was holding something in front of her it just fell out of the flies she said his poor hat bucket looked up as his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness he made out a shape up among the battens spinning slowly oh dear he said and i thought hed written such a polite letter really then now read this one said salzella coming up behind him must i its addressed to you bucket unfolded the piece of paper ahahahaha yrs the opera ghost ps ahahahaha he gave salzella an agonized look whos the poor fellow up there mr pounder the rat catcher rope dropped around his neck other end attached to some sandbags they went down he went up i dont understand is this man mad salzella put an arm around his shoulders and led him away from the crowd well now he said as kindly as he could a man who wears evening dress all the time lurks in the shadows and occasionally kills people then he sends little notes writing maniacal laughter five exclamation marks again i notice we have to ask ourselves is this the career of a sane man but why is he doing it wailed bucket that is only a relevant question if he is sane said salzella calmly he may be doing it because the little yellow pixies tell him to sane how can he be sane said bucket you were right you know the atmosphere in this placed drive anyone crazy i very well may be the only one here with both feet on the ground he turned his eyes narrowed when he saw a group of chorus girls whispering nervously you girls dont just stand there lets see you jump up and down he rasped on one leg he turned back to salzella what was i saying you were saying said salzella that you have both feet on the ground unlike the corps de ballet and the corpse de mr pounder i think that comment was in rather poor taste said bucket coldly my view said the director of music is that we should shut down get all the ablebodied men together issue them with torches go through this place from top to bottom flush him out chase him through the city catch him and beat him to a pulp and then throw whats left into the river its the only way to be sure you know we cant afford to shut down bucket said we seem to make thousands a week but we seem to spend thousands a week too im sure i dont know where it goes i thought running this place was just a matter of getting bums on seats but every time i look up theres a bum spinning gently in the air whats he going to do next i ask myself they looked at one another and then as if pulled by some kind of animal magnetism their gazes turned and flew out over the auditorium until they found the huge glittering bulk of the chandelier oh no moaned bucket he wouldnt would he that would shut us down salzella sighed look it weighs more than a ton he said the supporting rope is thicker than your arm the winch is padlocked when its not in use its safe they looked at one another ill have a man guard it every minute theres a performance said salzella ill do it personally if you like and he wants christine to sing iodine tonight shes got a voice like a whistle salzella raised his eyebrows that at least is not a problem is it he said isnt it its a key role salzella put his arm around the owners shoulders i think perhaps it is time for you to explore a few more littleknown corners of the wonderful world that is opera he said the stagecoach rolled to a halt in sator square ankhmorpork the coach agent was waiting impatiently youre fifteen hours late mr reever he shouted the coachdriver nodded impassively he laid the reins down jumped off the box and inspected the horses there was a certain woodenness about his movements passengers were grabbing their baggage and hurrying away well said the agent we had a picnic said the coachdriver his face was grey you stopped for a picnic and a bit of a singsong said the driver pulling the horses feedbags from under the seat you are telling me that you stopped the mail coach for a picnic and a singsong oh and the cat got stuck up a tree he sucked his hand and the agent noticed that a handkerchief was tied around it a hazy look of recollection clouded the drivers eyes and then there were the stories he said what stories the little fat one said everyone had to tell a story to help pass the time yes well i dont see how that could slow you down you shouldve heard her story the one about the very tall man and the piano i was so embarrassed i fell off the coach i wouldnt use words like that even to my own dear grandmother and of course said the agent who prided himself on his ironic approach the word timetable never crossed your mind while all this was going on the driver turned to look directly at him for the first time the agent took a step back here was a man who had hangglided over hell you tell them said the driver and walked away the agent stared after him and then walked around to the door a small man with a hunted look climbed out dragging a huge fat man behind him and gabbling urgently in a language the agent didnt understand and then the agent was left alone with a coach and horses and an expanding circle of hurrying passengers he opened the door and peered inside good morning mister said nanny ogg he looked in some puzzlement from her to granny weatherwax is everything all right ladies very nice journey said nanny ogg taking his arm we shall defnitly patronize you another time the driver seemed to think there was a problem problem said granny i didnt notice any problems did you gytha he couldve been a bit quicker fetching the ladder said nanny climbing down and im sure he muttered something under his breath that time we stopped to admire the view but im prepared to be gracious about it you stopped to admire the view said the agent when oh several times said nanny no sense in rushing around the whole time is there more haste less speed ekcetra could you point us in the direction of elm street only weve lodgings at mrs palms our nev speaks highly of the place he says no one ever looked for him there the agent stepped back as people generally did in the face of nannys pumpaction chatter elm street he stuttered but respectable ladies shouldnt go there nanny patted him on the shoulder thats good she said that way we wont run into anyone we know as granny walked past the horses they tried to hide behind the coach bucket smiled brightly there were little beads of sweat around the edges of his face ah perdita he said do sit down lass er you are enjoying your time with us so far yes thank you mr bucket said agnes dutifully good thats good isnt that good mr salzella dont you think thats good dr undershaft agnes looked at the three worried faces were all very pleased said mr bucket and er well we have an amazing offer for you which im sure will help you to enjoy it even more agnes watched the assembled faces yes she said guardedly i know you er have only been with us hardly any time but we have decided to er bucket swallowed and glanced at the other two for moral supportlet you sing the part of iodine in tonights production of la triviata yes um it isnt the major role but of course it does include the famous departure aria oh yes er there is er that is er bucket gave up and looked helplessly at his director of music mr salzella salzella leaned forward what in fact we would like you to do perdita is sing the role indeed but not in fact play the role agnes listened while they explained shed stand in the chorus just behind christine christine would be told to sing very softly it had been done dozens of times before salzella explained it was done far more often than the audiences ever realizedwhen singers had a sore throat or had completely dried or had turned up so drunk they could barely stand or in one notorious instance many years previously had died in the interval and subsequently sung their famous aria by means of a broomhandle stuck up their back and their jaw operated with a piece of string it wasnt immoral the show had to go on the ring of desperately grinning faces watched her i could just walk away she thought walk away from these grinning faces and the mysterious ghost they couldnt stop me but theres nowhere to walk to except back yes er yes she said im very er but why do it like this couldnt i simply take her place and sing the part the men looked at one another and then all started talking at once yes but you see christine is has more stage experience technical grasp stage presence apparent lyrical ability fits the costume agnes looked down at her big hands she could feel the blush advancing like a barbarian horde burning everything as it came we would like you as it were said bucket to ghost the part ghost said agnes its a stage term said salzella oh i see said agnes yes well of course i shall certainly do my best jolly good said bucket we wont forget this and im certain a very suitable part for you will come along very soon see dr undershaft this afternoon and he will take you through the role er i know it quite well i think said agnes uncertainly really how ive been taking lessons that is good lass said mr bucket shows keenness were very impressed but see dr undershaft in any case agnes got up and still looking down trooped out undershaft sighed and shook his head poor child he said born too late opera used to be just about voices you know i remember the days of the great sopranos dame violetta gigh dame clarissa extendo whatever became of them i sometimes wonder didnt the climate change said salzella nastily there goes a figure that should prompt a revival of the ring of the nibelungingung undershaft went on now that was an opera three days of gods shouting at one another and twenty minutes of memorable tunes said salzella no thank you very much but cant you hear her singing hildabrun leader of the valkyries yes oh yes but unfortunately i can also hear her singing nobbo the dwarf and lo chief of the gods those were the days said undershaft sadly shaking his head we had proper opera then i recall when dame veritasi stuffed a musician into his own tuba for yawning yes yes but this is the century of the fruitbat said salzella standing up he glanced at the door again and shook his head amazing he said do you think she knows how fat she is the door of mrs palms discreet establishment opened at grannys knock the person on the other side was a young woman very obviously a young woman there was no possible way that she could have been mistaken for a young man in any language especially braille nanny peered around the young ladys powdered shoulder at the red plush and gilt interior beyond and then up at granny weatherwaxs impassive face and then back at the young lady ill tan our nevs hide when i get home she muttered come away esme you dont want to go in there itd take too long to explain why granny weatherwax said the girl happily and whos this nanny looked up at granny whose expression hadnt changed nanny ogg nanny said eventually yes im nanny ogg nevs mum she added darkly yes indeed yes on account of me bein athe words respectable widow woman tried to range themselves in her vocal cords and shrivelled at the sheer enormity of the falsehood forcing her to settle for mother to him nev yes nevs mum hello colette said granny what fascinatin earrings you are wearing is mrs palm at home shes always at home to important visitors said colette do come in everyone will be so pleased to see you again there were cries of welcome as granny stepped into the scarlet gloom what youve been here before said nanny eyeing the pink flesh and white late that made up much of the scenery oh yes mrs palm is an old friend practicly a witch you you do know what kind of place this is do you esme said nanny ogg she felt curiously annoyed shed happily give way to grannys expertise in the worlds of mind and magic but she felt very strongly that there were some more specialized areas that were definitely ogg territory and granny weatherwax had no business even to know what they were oh yes said granny calmly nannys patience gave out its a house of ill repute is what it is on the contrary said granny i believe people speak very highly of it you knew and you never told me granny raised an ironic eyebrow the lady who invented the strawberry wobbler well yes but we all live life the best way we can gytha and theres a lot of people who think witches are bad yes but before you criticize someone gytha walk a mile in their shoes said granny with a faint smile in those shoes she was wearin id twist my ankle said nanny gritting her teeth id need a ladder just to get in em it was infuriating the way granny tricked you into reading her half of the dialogue and opened your mind to yourself in unexpected ways and its a welcoming place and the beds are soft said granny warm too i expect said nanny ogg giving in and theres always a friendly light in the window dear me gytha ogg i always thought you were unshockable shockable no said nanny easily surprised yes dr undershaft the chorus master peered at agnes over the top of his halfmoon spectacles the um departure aria as it is known he said is quite a little masterpiece not one of the great operatic highlights but very memorable nevertheless his eyes misted over questa maledetta sings iodine as she tells peccadillo how hard it is for her to leave him questa maledetta porta si blocccccca si blocca comunque diavolo to faccccccio he stopped and made great play of cleaning his glasses with his handkerchief when gigh sang it there wasnt a dry eye in the house he mumbled i was there it was then that i decided that i would oh great days indeed he put his glasses on and blew his nose ill run through it once he said just so that you can understand how it is supposed to go very well andrй the young man who had been drafted in to play the piano in the rehearsal room nodded and winked surreptitiously at agnes she pretended not to have seen him and listened with an expression of acute studiousness as the old man worked his way through the score and now he said let us see how you manage he handed her the score and nodded at the pianist agnes sang the aria or at least a few bars of it andrй stopped playing and leaned his head against the piano trying to stifle a laugh ahem said undershaft was i doing something wrong you were singing tenor said undershaft looking sternly at andrй she was singing in your voice sir perhaps you can sing it like er christine would sing it they started again kwesta maledetta undershaft held up both hands andrйs shoulders were shaking with the effort of not laughing yes yes accurately observed i daresay youre right but could we start again and er perhaps you would sing it how you think it should be sung agnes nodded they started again and finished undershaft had sat down halfturned away he wouldnt look round to face her agnes stood watching him uncertainly er was that all right she said andrй the pianist got up slowly and took her hand i think wed better leave him he said softly pulling her towards the door was it that bad not exactly undershaft raised his head but didnt turn it towards her more practice on those rs madam and strive for greater security above the stave he said hoarsely yes yes i will andrй led her out into the corridor shut the door and then turned to her that was astounding he said did you ever hear the great gigh sing i dont even know who gigh is what was i singing you didnt know that either i dont know what it means no andrй looked down at the score in his hand well im not much good at the language but i suppose the opening could be sung something like this this damn door sticks this damn door sticks it sticks no matter what the hell i do its marked pull and indeed i am pulling perhaps it should be marked push agnes blinked thats it yes but i thought it was supposed to be very moving and romantic it is said andrй it was this isnt real life this is opera it doesnt matter what the words mean its the feeling that matters hasnt anyone told look im in rehearsals for the rest of the afternoon but perhaps we could meet tomorrow perhaps after breakfast oh no thought agnes here it comes the blush was moving inexorably upwards she wondered if one day it might reach her face and carry on going so that it ended up as a big pink cloud over her head er yes she said yes that would be very helpful now ive got to go he gave her a weak little smile and patted her hand and im really sorry its happening this way because that was astounding he went to walk away and then stopped uhsorry if i frightened you last night he said what on the stairs oh that i wasnt frightened you er didnt mention it to anyone did you id hate people to think i was worrying over nothing hadnt given it another thought to tell you the truth i know you cant be the ghost if thats what youre worried about eh me the ghost haha haha said agnes so er see you tomorrow then fine agnes headed back to her room deep in thought christine was there looking critically at herself in the mirror she spun around as agnes entered she even moved with exclamation marks oh perdita have you heard im to sing the part of iodine tonight isnt that wonderful she dashed across the room and endeavoured to pick agnes up and hug her settling eventually for just hugging her and i heard theyre already letting you in the chorus yes indeed isnt that nice ive been practising all morning with mr salzella kesta mallydetta porter see bloker she twirled happily invisible sequins filled the air with their shine when i am very famous she said you wont regret having a friend in me i shall do my very best to help you i am sure you bring me luck yes indeed said agnes hopelessly because my dear father told me that one day a dear little pixie would arrive to help me achieve my great ambition and do you know i think that little pixie is you agnes smiled unhappily after youd known christine for any length of time you found yourself fighting a desire to look into her ear to see if you could spot daylight coming the other way er i thought we had swapped rooms oh that said christine smiling wasnt i silly anyway i shall need the big mirror now that i am to be a prima donna you dont mind do you what oh no no of course not er if youre sure agnes looked at the mirror and then at the bed and then at christine no she said shocked at the enormity of the idea that had just presented itself delivered from the perdita of her soul im sure that will be fine dr undershaft blew his nose and tried to tidy himself up well he didnt have to stand for it perhaps the child was somewhat on the heavy side but gigli for example had once crushed a tenor to death and no one had thought any worse of her for it hed protest to mr bucket dr undershaft was a singleminded man he believed in voices it didnt matter what anyone looked like he never watched opera with his eyes open it was the music that mattered not the acting and certainly not the shape of the singers what did it matter what shape she was dame tessitura had a beard you could strike a match on and a nose flattened half across her face but she was still one of the best basses who ever opened beer bottles with her thumb of course salzella said that while everyone accepted that large women of fifty could play thin girls of seventeen people wouldnt accept that a fat girl of seventeen could do it he said theyd cheerfully swallow a big lie and choke on a little fib salzella said that sort of thing something was going wrong these days the whole place seemed sick if a building could be sick the crowds were still coming but the money just didnt seem to be there any more everything seemed to be so expensive and now they were owned by a cheesemonger for heavens sake some grubby counter jumper whod probably want to bring in fancy ideas what they needed was a businessman some clerk who could add up columns of figures properly and not interfere that was the trouble with all the owners he had experiencedthey started off thinking of themselves as businessmen and then suddenly began to think they could make an artistic contribution still possibly cheesemongers had to add up cheeses just so long as this one stayed in his office with the books and didnt go around acting as though he owned the place just because he happened to own the place undershaft blinked hed gone the wrong way again no matter how long youd been here this place was a maze he was behind the stage in the orchestras room instruments and folding chairs had been stacked everywhere his foot toppled a beer bottle the twang of a string made him look around broken instruments littered the floor there were half a dozen smashed violins several oboes had been broken the from had been pulled right out of a trombone he looked up into someones face but why are you the halfmoon spectacles tumbled over and over and smashed on the boards then the attacker lowered his mask as smooth and white as the skull of an angel and stepped forward purposefully dr undershaft blinked there was darkness a cloaked figure raised its head and looked at him through bony white sockets dr undershafts recent memories were a little confused but one fact stood out aha he said got you youre the ghost you know youre rather amusingly wrong dr undershaft watched another masked figure pick up the body of dr undershaft and drag it into the shadows oh i see im dead death nodded such would appear to be the case that was murder does anyone know the murderer and you of course but him how can undershaft began we must go said death but he just killed me strangled me with his bare hands yes chalk it up to experience you mean i cant do anything about it leave it to the living generally speaking they get uneasy when the deceased takes a constructive role in a murder investigation they tend to lose concentration you know you do have a very good bass voice thank you are there going to be choirs and things would you like some agnes slipped out through the stagedoor and into the streets of ankhmorpork she blinked in the light the air felt slightly prickly and sharp and too cold what she was about to do was wrong very wrong and all her life shed done things that were right go on said perdita in fact she probably wouldnt even do it but there was no harm in just asking where there was a herbal shop so she asked and there was no harm in going in so she went in and it certainly wasnt against any kind of law to buy the ingredients she bought after all she might get a headache later on or be unable to sleep and it would mean nothing at all to take them back to her room and tuck them under the mattress thats right said perdita in fact if you averaged out the moral difficulty of what she was proposing over all the little activities she had to undergo in order to do it it probably wasnt that bad at all really these comforting thoughts were arranging themselves in her mind as she headed back she turned a corner and nearly walked into nanny ogg and granny weatherwax she flung herself against the wall and stopped breathing they hadnt seen her although nannys foul cat leered at her over its owners shoulder theyd take her back she just knew they would the fact that she was a free agent and her own mistress and quite at liberty to go off to ankhmorpork had nothing to do with it theyd interfere they always did she scurried back along the alley and ran as fast as she could to the rear of the opera house the stagedoorkeeper took no notice of her granny and nanny strolled through the city towards the area known as the isle of gods it wasnt exactly ankh and it wasnt exactly morpork being situated where the river bent so much it almost formed an island it was where the city kept all those things it occasionally needed but was uneasy about like the watchhouse the theatres the prison and the publishers it was the place for all those things which might go off bang in unexpected ways greebo ambled along behind them the air was full of new smells and he was looking forward to seeing if any of them belonged to anything he could eat fight or ravish nanny ogg found herself getting increasingly worried this isnt really us esme she said who is it then i mean the book was just a bit of fun no sense in making ourselves unpopular is there cant have witches being done down gytha i dont feel done down i felt fine until you told me i was done down said nanny putting her finger on a major sociological point youve been exploited said granny firmly no i aint yes you have youre a downtrodden mass no i aint youve been swindled out of your life savings said granny two dollars well its all youd actually saved said granny accurately only cos i spent everything else said nanny other people salted away money for their old age but nanny preferred to accumulate memories well there you are then i was putting that by for some new piping for my still up at copperhead said nanny you know how that scumble eats away at the metal you were putting a little something by for some security and peace of mind in your old age granny translated you dont get peace of mind with my scumble said nanny happily pieces yes but not peace its made from the finest apples you know she added well mainly apples granny stopped outside an ornate doorway and peered at the brass plate affixed thereon this is the place she said they looked at the door ive never been one for front doors said nanny shifting from one foot to the other granny nodded witches had a thing about front doors a brief search located an alleyway which led around the back of the building here was a pair of much larger doors wide open several dwarfs were loading bundles of books on to a cart a rhythmic thumping came from somewhere beyond the doorway no one took any notice of the witches as they wandered inside movable type was known in ankhmorpork but if wizards heard about it they moved it where no one could find it they generally didnt interfere with the running of the city but when it came to movable type the pointy foot was put down hard they had never explained why and people didnt press the issue because you didnt press the issue with wizards not if you liked yourself the shape you were they simply worked around the problem and engraved everything this took a long time and meant that ankhmorpork was for example denied the benefit of newspapers leaving the population to fool themselves as best they could a press was thumping gently at one end of the warehouse beside it at long tables a number of dwarfs and humans were stitching pages together and gluing on the covers nanny took a book off a pile it was the joye of snacks can i help you ladies said a voice its tone suggested very clearly that it wasnt anticipating offering any kind of help whatsoever except out into the street at speed weve come about this book said granny im mrs ogg said nanny ogg the man looked her up and down oh yes can you identify yourself certainly id know me anywhere hah well i happen to know what gytha ogg looks like madam and she does not look like you nanny ogg opened her mouth to reply and then said in the voice of one who has stepped happily into the road and only now remembers about the onrushing coach oh and how do you know what mrs ogg looks like said granny oh is that the time wed better be goingsaid nanny because as a matter of fact she sent me a picture said goatberger taking out his wallet im sure were not at all interested said nanny hurriedly pulling on grannys arm im extremely interested said granny she snatched a folded piece of paper out of goatbergers hands and peered at it hah yes thats gytha ogg all right she said yes indeed i remember when that young artist came to lancre for the summer i wore my hair longer in those days muttered nanny just as well considering said granny i didnt know you had copies though oh you know how it is when youre young said nanny dreamily it was doodle doodle doodle all summer long she awoke from her reverie and i still weigh the same now as i did then she added except that its shifted said granny nastily she handed the sketch back to goatberger thats her all right she said but its out by about sixty years and several layers of clothing this is gytha ogg right here youre telling me this came up with banana soup surprise did you try it said nanny mr cropper the head printer did yes was he surprised not half as surprised as mrs cropper it can take people like that said nanny i think perhaps i overdo the nutmeg goatberger stared at her doubt was beginning to assail him you only had to look at nanny ogg grinning back at you to believe she could write something like the joye of snacks did you really write this he said from memory said nanny proudly and now shed like some money said granny mr goatbergers face twisted up as though hed just eaten a lemon and washed it down with vinegar but we gave her the money back he said see said nanny her face falling i told you esme she wants some more said granny no i dont no she doesnt goatberger agreed she does said granny she wants a little bit of money for every book youve sold i dont expect to be treated like royalty said nanny you shut up said granny i know what you want we want some money mr goatberger and what if i wont give it to you granny glared at him then we shall go away and think about what to do next she said thats no idle threat said nanny theres a lot of peopleve regretted esme thinking about what to do next come back when youve thought then snapped goatberger he stormed off i dont know authors wanting to be paid good grief he disappeared among the stacks of books er do you think that could have gone better said nanny granny glanced at the table beside them it was stacked with long sheets of paper she nudged a dwarf who had been watching the argument with some amusement whatre these she said theyre proofs for the almanack he saw her blank expression theyre sort of a trial run for the book sos we can check that all the spelling mistakes have been left in granny picked it up come gytha she said i dont want trouble esme said nanny ogg as she hurried after her its only money it aint money any more said granny its a way of keepin score mr bucket picked up a violin it was in two pieces held together by the strings one of them broke whod do something like this he said honestly salzella what is the difference between opera and madness is this a trick question no then id say better scenery ah i thought so salzella rooted among the destruction and stood up with a letter in his hand would you like me to open it he said its addressed to you bucket shut his eyes go on he said dont bother about the details just tell me how many exclamation marks five oh salzella passed the paper over bucket read dear bucket whoops ahahahahahahahaha yrs the opera ghost what can we do he said one moment he writes polite little notes the next he goes mad on paper herr trubelmacher has got everyone out hunting for new instruments said salzella are violins more expensive than ballet shoes there are few things in the world more expensive than ballet shoes violins happen to be among them said salzella further expense it seems so yes but i thought the ghost liked music herr trubelmacher tells me the organ is beyond repair he stopped he was aware that he had exclaimed a little less rationally than a sane man should oh well bucket continued wearily the show must go on i suppose yes indeed said salzella bucket shook his head hows it all going for tonight i think it will work if thats what you mean perdita seems to have a very good grasp of the part and christine she has an astonishingly good grasp of wearing a dress between them they make one prima donna the proud owner of the opera house got slowly to his feet it all seemed so simple he moaned i thought opera how hard can it be songs pretty girls dancing nice scenery lots of people handing over cash got to be better than the cutthroat world of yoghurt i thought now everywhere i go theres something crunched under his shoe he picked up the remains of a pair of halfmoon spectacles these are dr undershafts arent they he said whatre they doing here his eyes met salzellas steady gaze oh no he groaned salzella turned slightly and stared hard at a big double bass case leaning against the wall he raised his eyebrows oh no said bucket again go on open it my hands have gone all sweaty salzella padded across to the case and grasped the lid ready bucket nodded wearily the case was flung open oh no salzella craned round to see ah yes he said a broken neck and the body has been kicked in considerably thatll cost a dollar or two to repair and no mistake and all the strings are busted are double basses more expensive to rebuild than violins i am afraid that all musical instruments are incredibly expensive to repair with the possible exception of the triangle said salzella however it could have been worse hmm what well it could have been dr undershaft in there yes bucket gaped at him and then shut his mouth oh yes of course oh yes that would have been worse yes bit of luck there i suppose yes um so thats an opera house is it said granny looks like someone built a great big box and glued the architecture on afterwards she coughed and appeared to be waiting for something can we have a look around said nanny dutifully aware that grannys curiosity was equalled only by her desire not to show it it cant do any harm i suppose said granny as if granting a big favour seein as weve nothing else to do right this minute the opera house was indeed that most efficiently multifunctional of building designs it was a cube but as granny had pointed out the architect had suddenly realized late in the day that there ought to be some sort of decoration and had shoved it on hurriedly in a riot of friezes pillars corybants and curly bits gargoyles had colonized the higher reaches the effect seen from the front was of a huge wall of tortured stone round the back of course there was the usual drab mess of windows pipes and damp stone walls one of the rules of a certain type of public architecture is that it only happens at the front granny paused under a window someones singing she said listen lalalalalalah trilled someone doremifahsolatido thats opera right enough said granny sounds foreign to me nanny had an unexpected gift for languages she could be comprehensibly incompetent in a new one within an hour or two what she spoke was one step away from gibberish but it was authentically foreign gibberish and she knew that granny weatherwax whatever her other qualities had an even bigger tin ear for languages than she did for music er could be she said theres always a lot going on i know that our nev said they sometimes do different operations every night how did he find that out said granny well there was a lot of lead that takes some shifting he said he liked the noisy ones he could hum along and also no one heard the hammering the witches strolled onwards did you notice young agnes nearly bump into us back there said granny yes it was all i could do not to turn around said nanny she wasnt very pleased to see us was she i practically heard her gasp thats very suspicious if you ask me said nanny i mean she sees two friendly faces from back home youd expect her to come runnin up were old friends after all old friends of her grandma and her mum anyway and thats practicly the same remember those eyes in the teacup said nanny she could be under the gaze of some strange occult force we got to be careful people can be very tricky when theyre in the grip of a strange occult force remember mr scruple over in slice that wasnt a strange occult force that was acid stomach well it certainly seemed strangely occult for a while especially if the windows were shut their perambulation had taken them to the opera houses stagedoor granny looked up at a line of posters la triviata she read aloud the ring of the nibelungingung well basically there are two sorts of opera said nanny who also had the true witchs ability to be confidently expert on the basis of no experience whatsoever theres your heavy opera where basically people sing foreign and it goes like oh oh oh i am dyin oh i am dyin oh oh oh thats what im doin and theres your light opera where they sing in foreign and it basically goes beer beer beer beer i like to drink lots of beer although sometimes they drink champagne instead thats basically all of opera reely what either dyin or drinkin beer basically yes said nanny contriving to suggest that this was the whole gamut of human experience and thats opera well there might be some other stuff but mostly its stout or stabbin granny was aware of a presence she turned a figure had emerged from the stagedoor carrying a poster a bucket of glue and a brush it was a strange figure a sort of neat scarecrow in clothes slightly too small for it although to be truthful there were probably no clothes that would have fit that body the ankles and wrists seemed infinitely extensible and independently guided it encountered the two witches standing at the poster board and stopped politely they could see the sentence marshalling itself behind the unfocused eyes excuse me ladies the show must go on the words were all there and they made sense but each sentence was fired out into the world as a unit granny pulled nanny to one side thank you they watched in silence as the man with great and meticulous care applied paste to a neat rectangle and then affixed the poster smoothing every crease methodically whats your name young man said granny walter thats a nice beret you have there my mum bought it for me walter chased the last air bubble to the edge of the paper and stood back then completely ignoring the witches in his preoccupation with his task he picked up the pastepot and went back inside the witches stared at the new poster in silence yknow i wouldnt mind seein an operation said nanny after a while senior basilica did give us the tickets oh you know me said granny cant be having with that sort of thing at all nanny looked sideways at her and grinned to herself this was a familiar weatherwax opening line it meant of course i want to but youve got to persuade me youre right o course she said its for them folks in all their fine carriages its not for the likes of us granny looked hesitant for a moment i expect its having ideas above our station nanny went on i expect if we went in theyd say be off you nasty ole crones oh they would would they i dont expect they want common folk like what we are comin in with all those smart nobby people said nanny is that a fact is that a fact madam you just come with me granny stalked round to the front of the building where people were already alighting from coaches she pushed her way up the steps and shouldered through the crowd to the ticket office she leaned forward the man behind the grille leaned back nasty old crones eh she snapped i beg your pardon not before time see here weve got tickets for she looked down at the pieces of cardboard and pulled nanny ogg over it says here stalls the cheek of it stalls us she turned back to the ticket man see here stalls arent good enough we want seats inshe looked up at the board by the ticket windowthe gods yes that sounds about right im sorry youve got tickets for stalls seats and you want to exchange them for seats in the gods yes and dont you go expecting us to pay any more money i wasnt going to ask you for just as well said granny smiling triumphantly she looked approvingly at the new tickets come gytha er excuse me said the man as nanny ogg turned away but what is that on your shoulders its a fur collar said nanny excuse me but i just saw it flick its tail yes i happen to believe in beauty without cruelty agnes was aware of something happening backstage little groups of men were forming and then breaking up as various individuals hurried away about their mysterious tasks out in front the orchestra was already tuning up the chorus was filing on to be a busy marketplace in which various jugglers gypsies swordswallowers and gaily dressed yokels would be entirely unsurprised at an apparently drunken baritone strolling on to sing an enormous amount of plot at a passing tenor she saw mr bucket and mr salzella deep in argument with the stage manager how can we search the entire building this place is a maze he might have just wandered off somewhere hes as blind as a bat without those glasses but we cant be certain somethings happened to him oh yes you didnt say that when we opened the doublebass case you were certain he was going to be inside admit it i wasnt expecting just to find a smashed double bass yes but i was feeling a bit mithered at that point a swordswallower nudged agnes what curtain up in one minute dear he said smearing mustard on his sword has something happened to dr undershaft couldnt say dear you wouldnt have any salt would you scuse me scuse me sorry scuse me was that your foot scuse me leaving a trail of annoyed and pained patrons in their wake the witches trod their way to their seats granny elbowed herself comfortable and then having in some matters the boredom threshold of a fouryearold said whats happenin now nannys skimpy knowledge of opera didnt come to her aid so she turned to the lady beside her scuse me could i borrow your programme thank you scuse me could i borrow your spectacles so kind she spent a few moments in careful study this is the overture she said its kind of a free sample of whats going to happen s got a summary of the story too la triviata her lips moved as she read occasionally her brow wrinkled well its quite simple reely she said at last a lot of people are in love with one another theres considerable dressing up as other people and general confusion theres a cheeky servant no one really knows who anyone is a couple of ole dukes go mad chorus of gypsies etc your basic opera someones probly going to turn out to be someone elses long lost son or daughter or wife or something shh said a voice behind them wish wed brought something to eat muttered granny i think ive got some peppermints in my knicker leg shh i would like my spectacles back please here you are maam theyre not very good are they someone tapped nanny ogg on the shoulder madam your fur stole is eating my chocolates and someone tapped granny weatherwax on her shoulder madam kindly remove your hat nanny ogg choked on her peppermint granny weatherwax turned to the redfaced gentleman behind her you do know what a woman in a pointy hat is dont you she said yes madam a woman in a pointy hat is sitting in front of me granny gave him a stare and then to nannys surprise she removed her hat i do beg your pardon she said i can see i was inadvertently badmannered pray excuse me she turned back to the stage nanny ogg started breathing again you feeling all right esme never better granny weatherwax surveyed the auditorium oblivious to the sounds around her i assure you madam your fur is eating my chocolates its started on the second layer oh dear show him the little map inside the lid will you hes only after the truffles and you can soon rub the dribble off the others do you mind being quiet i dont mind its this man and his chocolates thats making the noise a big room granny thought a great big room without windows there was a tingling in her thumbs she looked at the chandelier the rope disappeared into an alcove in the ceiling her gaze passed along the rows of boxes they were all quite crowded on one though the curtains were almost closed as if someone inside wanted to see out without being seen then granny looked among the stalls the audience was mainly human here and there was the hulking shape of a troll although the troll equivalent of operas usually went on for a couple of years a few dwarf helmets gleamed although dwarfs normally werent interested in anything without dwarfs in there seemed to be a lot of feathers down there and here and there the glint of jewellery shoulders were being worn bare this season a lot of attention had been paid to appearances the people were here to look not to see she closed her eyes this was when you started being a witch it wasnt when you did headology on daft old men or mixed up medicines or stuck up for yourself or knew one herb from another it was when you opened your mind to the world and carefully examined everything it picked up she ignored her ears until the sounds of the audience became just a distant buzz or at least a distant buzz broken by the voice of nanny ogg says here that dame timpani who sings the part of quizella is a diva said nanny so i reckon this is like a parttime job then probly quite a good idea on account of you have to be able to hold your breath good trainin for the singin granny nodded without opening her eyes she kept them closed as the opera started nanny who knew when to leave her friend to her own devices tried to keep quiet but felt impelled to give out a running commentary then she said theres agnes hey thats agnes stop wavin and sit down murmured granny trying to hold on to her waking dream nanny leaned over the balcony shesdressed up as a gypsy she said and now theres a girl come forward to sing she peered at the stolen programmethe famous departure aria it says here now thats what i call a good voice thats agnes singin said granny no its this girl christine shut your eyes you daft old woman and tell me if that isnt agnes singin said granny nanny ogg obediently shut her eyes for a moment and then opened them again its agnes singing yes but theres that girl with the big smile right out there in front moving her lips and everything yes nanny scratched her head something a bit wrong here esme cant have people stealing our agness voice grannys eyes were still shut tell me if the curtains on that box down there on the right have moved she said i just saw them twitch esme ah granny let herself relax again she sank into the seat as the aria washed over her and opened her mind once more edges walls doors once a space was enclosed it became a universe of its own some things remained trapped in it the music passed through one side of her head and out the other but with it came other things strands of things echoes of old screams she drifted down further down below the conscious into the darkness beyond the circle of firelight there was fear here it stalked the place like a great dark animal it lurked in every corner it was in the stones old terror crouched in the shadows it was one of the most ancient terrors the one that meant that no sooner had mankind learned to walk on two legs than it dropped to its knees it was the terror of impermanence the knowledge that all this would pass away that a beautiful voice or a wonderful figure was something whose arrival you couldnt control and whose departure you couldnt delay it wasnt what she had been looking for but it was perhaps the sea in which it swam she went deeper and there it was roaring through the nighttime of the soul of the place like a deep cold current as she drew closer she saw that it was not one thing but two twisted around one another she reached out trickery lies deceit murder no she blinked everyone had turned to look at her nanny tugged at her dress sit down esme granny stared the chandelier hung peacefully over the crowded seats they beat him to death whats that esme and they throw him into the river esme sh madam will you sit down at once and now its started on the nougat whirls granny snatched at her hat and did a crabwise run along the row crushing some of the finest footwear in ankhmorpork under her thick lancre soles nanny hung back reluctantly shed quite enjoyed the song and she wanted to applaud but her pair of hands wasnt necessary the audience had exploded as soon as the last note had died away nanny ogg looked at the stage and took note of something and smiled like that eh gytha she sighed coming esme scuse me scuse me sorry scuse me granny weatherwax was out in the red plush corridor leaning with her forehead against the wall this is a bad one gytha she muttered its all twisted up i aint at all sure i can make it happen right the poor soul she straightened up look at me gytha will you gytha obediently opened her eyes wide she winced a little as a fragment of granny weatherwaxs consciousness crept behind her eyes granny put her hat on tucking in the occasional errant wisp of grey hair and then taking one by one the eight hatpins and ramming them home with the same frowning deliberation with which a mercenary might check his weapons all right she said at last nanny ogg relaxed its not that i mind esme she said but i wish youd use a mirror waste of money said granny now fully armoured she strode off along the corridor glad to see you didnt lose your temper with the man who went on about your hat said nanny running along behind no point hes going to be dead tomorrow oh dear what of run over by a cart i think why didnt you tell him i could be wrong granny reached the stairs and thundered down them wherere we going i want to see whos behind those curtains the applause distant but still thunderous filled the stairwell they certainly like agness voice said nanny yes i hopes were in time oh bugger what i left greebo up there well he likes meeting new people good grief this place is a maze granny stepped out into a curved corridor rather plusher than the one they had left there was a series of doors along it ah now then she walked along the row counting and then tried a handle can i help you ladies they turned a little old woman had come up softly behind them carrying a tray of drinks granny smiled at her nanny ogg smiled at the tray we were just wondering said granny which person in these boxes likes to sit with the curtains nearly shut the tray began to shake here shall i hold that for yousaid nanny youll spill something if youre not careful what do you know about box eight said the old lady ah box eight said granny thatd be the one yes thats this one over here isnt it no please granny strode forward and grasped the handle the door was locked the tray was thrust into nannys welcoming hands well thank you i dont mind if i do she said the woman pulled at grannys arm dont itll bring terrible bad luck granny thrust out her hand the key madam behind her nanny inspected a glass of champagne dont make him angry its bad enough as it is the woman was clearly terrified iron said granny rattling the handle cant magic iron here said nanny stepping forward a little unsteadily give me one of your hatpins our nevs taught me all kindsa tricks grannys hand rose to her hat and then she looked at mrs plinges lined face she lowered her hand no she said no i reckon well leave it for now i dont know whats happening sobbed mrs plinge it never used to be like this have a good blow said nanny handing her a grubby handkerchief and patting her kindly on the back there was none of this killing people he just wanted somewhere to watch the opera it made him feel better whos this were talking about said granny nanny ogg gave her a warning look over the top of the old womans head there were some things best left to nanny hed unlock it for an hour every friday for me to tidy up and there was always his little note saying thank you or apologizing for the chocolates down the seat and where was the harm in it thats what id like to know have another good blow said nanny and now theres people dropping like flies out of the flies they say its him but i know he never meant any harm course not said nanny soothingly manys the time ive seen em look up at the box they always felt the better for it if they saw him and then poor mr pounder was strangulated i looked around and there was his hat just like that its terrible when that happens said nanny ogg whats your name dear mrs plinge sniffed mrs plinge it came right down in front of me id have recognized it anywhere i think it would be a good idea if we took you home mrs plinge said granny oh dear ive got all these ladies and gentlemen to see to and anyway its dangerous going home this time of night walter walks me home but hes got to stay late tonight oh dear have another good blow said nanny find a bit that isnt too soggy there was a series of sharp pops granny weatherwax had interlocked her fingers and extended her hands at arms length so that her knuckles cracked dangerous eh she said well we cant see you all upset like this ill walk you home and mrs ogg will see to things here only ive got to attend to the boxes ive got all these drinks to serve couldve sworn i had them a moment ago mrs ogg knows all about drinks said granny glaring at her friend theres nothing i dont know about drinks agreed nanny shamelessly emptying the last glass especially these and what about our walter hell worry himself silly walters your son said granny wears a beret the old woman nodded only i always comes back for him if hes working late she began you come back for him but he sees you home said granny its hes hes mrs plinge rallied hes a good boy she said defiantly im sure he is mrs plinge said granny she carefully lifted the little white bonnet off mrs plinges head and handed it to nanny who put it on and also took the little white apron that was the good thing about black you could be nearly anything wearing black mother superior or madam it was really just a matter of the style it just depended on the details there was a click box eight had bolted itself and then there was the very faint scrape of a chair being wedged under the door handle granny smiled and took mrs plinges arm ill be back as soon as i can she said nanny nodded and watched them go there was a little cupboard at the end of the corridor it contained a stool mrs plinges knitting and a small but very well stocked bar there were also on a polished mahogany plank a number of bells on big coiled springs several of them were bouncing up and down angrily nanny poured herself a gin and gin with a dash of gin and inspected the rows of bottles with considerable interest another bell started to ring there was a huge jar of stuffed olives nanny helped herself to a handful and blew the dust off a bottle of port a bell fell off its spring somewhere out in the corridor a door opened and a young mans voice bellowed where are those drinks woman nanny tried the port nanny ogg was used to the idea of domestic service as a girl shed been a maid at lancre castle where the king was inclined to press his intentions and anything else he could get hold of young gytha ogg had already lost her innocence but she had some clear ideas about unwelcome intentions and when he jumped out at her in the scullery she had technically committed treason with a large leg of lamb swung in both hands that had ended her life below stairs and put a lengthy crimp in the kings activities above them the brief experience had given her certain views which werent anything so definite as political but were very firmly oggish and mrs plinge had looked as if she didnt get very much to eat and not a lot of time to sleep either her hands had been thin and red nanny had a lot of time for the plinges of the world did port go with sherry oh well no harm in trying all the bells were ringing now it must be coming up to the interval she methodically unscrewed the top off ajar of cocktail onions and thoughtfully crunched a couple then as other people started to poke their heads around the doors and make angry demands she went to the champagne shelf and took down a couple of magnums she gave them a damn good shake tucked one under each arm with a thumb on the corks and stepped out into the corridor nannys philosophy of life was to do what seemed like a good idea at the time and do it as hard as possible it had never let her down the curtains closed the audience was still on its feet applauding what happens now whispered agnes to the next gypsy he pulled off his bandanna well dear we generally nip out to oh no theyre going for a curtain call the curtains opened again the light caught christine who curtsied and waved and sparkled her fellowgypsy nudged agnes look at dame timpani he said theres a nose in a sling if ever i saw one agnes stared at the prima donna shes smiling she said so does a tiger dear the curtains shut once more with a finality that said the stage manager was going to strike the set and would scream at someone if they dared to touch those ropes again agnes ran off with the others there wasnt too much to do in the next act shed tried to memorize the plot earlieralthough other members of the chorus had done their best to dissuade her on the basis that you could either sing them or understand them but not both nevertheless agnes was conscientious so peccadillo the son of duke tagliatella has secretly disguised himself as a swineherd to woo quizella not knowing that doctor bufola has sold the elixir to ludi the servant without realizing he is really the maid iodine dressed up as a boy because count artaud claims that a deputy stage manager pulled her out of the way and waved at someone in the wings lose the countryside ron there was a series of whistles from offstage answered by another from above the backcloth rose from the gloom above the sandbag counterweights began to descend then artaud reveals er that zibeline must marry fideli i mean fiabe not knowing er that the family fortunes the sandbags came down on one side of the stage at least on the other side agnes was interrupted in her impossible task by the screaming and looked around into the upsidedown and not at all well features of the late dr undershaft nanny skipped through a handy door shut it behind her and leaned on it after a few moments the sound of running feet clattered past well that had been fun she removed the lace bonnet and apron and because there was a basic honesty in nanny she tucked them in a pocket to give back to mrs plinge later then she pulled out a flat round black shape and banged it against her arm the point shot out after a few adjustments her official hat was almost as good as new she looked around a certain absence of light and carpeting together with a very presence of dust suggested that this was a part of the place the public werent supposed to see oh damn she supposed she had better find another door of course thatd mean shed have to leave greebo wherever he was but hed turn up he always did when he wanted feeding there was a flight of steps leading down she followed them to a corridor which was slightly better lit and ambled along it for quite a way and then all she had to do was follow the screams she emerged among the flats and jumbled props backstage no one bothered about her the appearance of a small amiable old lady was not about to cause comment at this point people were running backwards and forwards shouting more impressionable people were just standing in one place and screaming a large lady was sprawled over two chairs having hysterics while some distracted stagehands tried to fan her with a script nanny ogg was not certain whether something important had happened or whether this was just a continuation of opera by other means i should loosen her corsets if i was you she said as she ambled past good heavens madam theres enough panic in here as it is nanny moved on to an interesting crowd of gypsies noblemen and stagehands witches are curious by definition and inquisitive by nature she moved in let me through im a nosy person she said employing both elbows it worked as this sort of approach generally does there was a dead person lying on the floor nanny had seen death in a wide variety of guises and certainly knew strangulation when it presented itself it wasnt the nicest end although it could be quite colourful oh dear she said poor man what happened to him mr bucket says he must have got caught up in the someone began he didnt get caught in anything this is the ghosts work said someone else he could still be up there all eyes turned upwards mr salzellas sent some stagehands to flush him out have they got flaming torches said nanny several of them looked at her as if wondering for the first time who she was what got to have flaming torches when youre tracking down evil monsters said nanny wellknown fact there was a moment while this sunk in and then thats true shes right you know wellknown fact dear did they have flaming torches dont think so just ordinary lanterns oh theyre no good said nanny thats for smugglers lanterns for evil monsters you need flaming excuse me boys and girls the stage manager had stood on a box now he said a little pale around the face i know youre all familiar with the phrase the show must go on there was a chorus of groans from the chorus its very hard to sing a jolly song about eating hedgehogs when youre waiting for an accident to happen to you shouted a gypsy king funny thing if were talking about songs about hedgehogs i myself nanny began but no one was paying her any attention now we dont actually know what happened really shall we guess said a gypsy but we have men up in the fly loft now oh in case of more accidents and mr bucket has authorized me to say that there will be an additional two dollars bonus tonight in recognition of your bravely agreeing to continue with the show money after a shock like this money he thinks he can offer us a couple of dollars and well agree to stay on this cursed stage shame heartless unthinkable should be at least four right right for shame my friends to talk about a few dollars when there is a dead man lying there have you no respect for his memory exactly a few dollars is disrespectful five dollars or nothing nanny ogg nodded to herself and wandered off and found a sufficiently big piece of cloth to cover the late dr undershaft nanny rather liked the theatrical world it was its own kind of magic that was why esme disliked it she reckoned it was the magic of illusions and misdirection and foolery and that was fine by nanny ogg because you couldnt be married three times without a little fooling but it was just close enough to grannys own kind of magic to make granny uneasy which meant she couldnt leave it alone it was like scratching an itch people didnt take any notice of little old ladies who looked as though they fitted in and nanny ogg could fit in faster than a dead chicken in a maggot factory besides nanny had one additional little talent which was a mind like a buzzsaw behind a face like an elderly apple someone was crying a strange figure was kneeling beside the late chorus master it looked like a puppet with the strings cut can you give me a hand with this sheet mister said nanny quietly the face looked up two watery eyes running with tears blinked at nanny he wont wake up nanny mentally changed gear thats right luv she said youre walter aint you he was always very good to me and our mum he never gave me a kick it was obvious to nanny that there was no help here she knelt down and began to do her best with the departed miss they say it were the ghost miss it werent the ghost miss hed never do a thing like that he was always good to me and our mum nanny changed gear again you had to slow down a bit for walter plinge my mumd know what to do yes well shes gone home early walter walters waxy face started to contort into an expression of terminal horror she mustnt walk home without walter to look after her he shouted i bet she always says that said nanny i bet she always makes sure her walters with her when she goes home but i expect that right now shed want her walter to just get on with things sos she can be proud of him shows not half over yet s dangerous for our mum nanny patted his hand and absentmindedly wiped her own hand on her dress thats a good boy she said now ive got to go off the ghost wouldnt harm no one yes walter only ive got to go but ill find someone to help you and you must put poor dr undershaft somewhere safe until after the show understand and im mrs ogg walter gawped at her and then nodded sharply good boy nanny left him still looking at the body and headed further backstage a young man hurrying past found that hed suddenly acquired an ogg scuse me young man said nanny still holding his arm but dyou know anyone around here called agnes agnes nitt cant say i do maam what does she do he made to hurry on as politely as possible but nannys grip was steel she sings a bit big girl voice with double joints in it wears black you dont mean perdita perdita oh yes thatd be her all right i think shes seeing to christine theyre in mr salzellas office would christine be the thin girl in white yes maam and i expect youre going to show me where this mr salzellas office is er am i er yes its just along the stage there first door on the right what a good boy to help an old lady said nanny her grip increased to a few ounces short of cutting off circulation and wouldnt it be a good idea if you helped young walter back there do something respectful for the poor dead man back where nanny turned around the late dr undershaft had gone nowhere but walter had vanished poor chap was a bit upset i shouldnt wonder said nanny only to be expected so how about if you got another strapping young lad to help you out instead er yes what a good boy nanny repeated it was midevening granny and mrs plinge pushed their way through the crowds towards the shades a part of the city that was as thronged as a rookery fragrant as a cesspit and vice versa so said granny as they entered the network of foetid alleys your boy walter usually sees you home does he hes a good boy mistress weatherwax said mrs plinge defensively im sure youre grateful for a strong lad to lean on said granny mrs plinge looked up looking into grannys eyes was like looking into a mirror what you saw looking back at you was yourself and there was no hidingplace they torment him so she mumbled they poke at him and hide his broom theyre not bad boys round here but they will torment him he brings his broom home does he he looks after his things said mrs plinge ive always brought him up to look after his things and not be a trouble but they will poke the poor soul and call him such names the alleyway opened into a yard like a well between the high buildings washinglines crisscrossed the rectangle of moonlit sky im just in here said mrs plinge much obliged to you how does walter get home without you said granny oh theres plenty of places to sleep in the opera house he knows that if i dont come for him hes to stop there for the night he does what hes told mistress weatherwax hes never any trouble i never said he was mrs plinge fumbled in her purse as much to escape grannys stare as to look for the key i expect your walter sees most of what goes on in the opera house said granny taking one of mrs plinges wrists in her hand i wonder what your walter saw the pulse jumped at the same time as the thieves did shadows unfolded themselves there was the scrape of metal a low voice said theres two of you ladies and theres six of us theres no use in screaming oh deary deary me said granny mrs plinge dropped to her knees oh please dont hurt us kind sirs we are harmless old ladies havent you got mothers granny rolled her eyes damn damn and blast she was a good witch that was her role in life that was the burden she had to bear good and evil were quite superfluous when youd grown up with a highly developed sense of right and wrong she hoped oh she hoped that young though these were they were dyedinthewool criminals i ad a mother once said the nearest thief only i think i must of et er ah top marks granny raised both hands to her hat to draw out two long hatpins a tile slid off the roof and splashed into a puddle they looked up a caped figure was visible for a moment against the moonlight it thrust out a sword at arms length then it dropped landing lightly in front of one astonished man the sword whirled the first thief spun and thrust at the shadowy shape in front of him which turned out to be another thief whose arm jerked up and dragged its own knife along the ribcage of the thief beside him the masked figure danced among the gang his sword almost leaving trails in the air it occurred to granny later that it never actually made contact but then it never needed towhen six are against one in a melee in the shadows and especially if those six arent used to a target that is harder to hit than a wasp and even more so if they got all their ideas of knifefighting from other amateurs then theres six chances in seven that theyll stab a crony and about one chance in twelve that theyll nick their own earlobe the two that remained uninjured after ten seconds looked at one another turned and ran and then it was over the surviving vertical figure bowed low in front of granny weatherwax ah bella donna there was a swirl of black cloak and red silk and it too was gone for a moment soft footsteps could be heard skimming over the cobbles grannys hand was still halfway to her hat well i never she said she looked down various bodies were groaning or making soft bubbling noises deary deary me she said then she pulled herself together i reckon were going to need some nice hot water and some bits of bandage and a good sharp needle for the stitching mrs plinge she said we cant let these poor men bleed to death now can we even if they do try to rob old ladies mrs plinge looked horrified weve got to be charitable mrs plinge granny insisted ill pump up the fire and tear up a sheet said mrs plinge dont know if i can find a needle oh i spect ive got a needle said granny extracting one from the brim of her hat she knelt down by a fallen thief its rather rusty and blunt she added but we shall have to do the best we can the needle gleamed in the moonlight his round frightened eyes focused on it and then on grannys face he whimpered his shoulder blades tried to dig him into the cobbles it was perhaps as well that no one else could see grannys face in the shadows lets do some good she said salzella threw his hands in the air supposing hed come down in the middle of the act he said all right all right said bucket who was sitting behind his desk as a man might hide behind a bunker i agree after the show we call in the watch no two ways about it we shall just have to ask them to be discreet discreet have you ever met a watchman said salzella not that theyll find anything hell have been over the rooftops and away you may depend upon it whoever he is poor dr undershaft he was always so highly strung never more so than tonight said salzella that was tasteless salzella leaned over the desk tasteless or not the company are theatre people superstitious one little thing like someone being murdered on stage and they go all to pieces he wasnt murdered on stage he was murdered off stage and we cant be sure it was murder hed been very depressed lately agnes had been shocked but it hadnt been shock at dr undershafts death shed been astonished at her own reaction it had been startling and unpleasant to see the man but even worse to see herself actually being interested in what was happeningin the way people reacted in the way they moved in the things they said it had been as if shed stood outside herself watching the whole thing christine on the other hand had just folded up so had dame timpani far more people had fussed over christine than around the prima donna despite the fact that dame timpani had come around and fainted again quite pointedly several times and had eventually been forced to go for hysterics no one had assumed for a minute that agnes couldnt cope christine had been carried into salzellas backstage office and put on a couch agnes had fetched a bowl of water and a cloth and was wiping her forehead for there are some people who are destined to be carried to comfortable couches and some people whose only fate is fetching a bowl of cold water curtain goes up again in two minutes said salzella id better go and round up the orchestra theyll all be in the stab in the back over the road the swine can get through half a pint before the applause has died away are they capable of playing they never have been so i dont see why they should start now said salzella theyre musicians bucket the only way a dead body would upset them is if it fell in their beer and even then theyd play if you offered them dead body money bucket walked over to the recumbent christine how is she she keeps mumbling a bit agnes began cup of tea tea cup of tea anyone nothing nicer than a cup of tea well i tell a lie but i see the couch is occupied just my little joke no offence meant anyone for a nice cup of tea agnes looked around in horror well i could certainly do with one said bucket with false joviality how about you miss nanny winked at agnes erno thank you do you work here said agnes im just helping out for mrs plinge who has been taken poorly said nanny giving her another wink im mrs ogg dont mind me this seemed to satisfy bucket if only because random teadistributors represented the most minor of threats at this point its more like grand guignol than opera out there tonight said nanny she nudged bucket s foreign for blood all over the stage she said helpfully really yep it means big gignol music started in the distance thats the overture to act two said bucket well if christine is still unwell then he looked desperately at agnes well at a time like this people would understand agness chest swelled further with pride yes mr bucket perhaps we could find you a white christine her eyes still shut raised her wrist to her forehead and groaned oh dear what happened bucket knelt down instantly are you all right you had a nasty shock do you think you could go on for the sake of your art and people not asking for their money back she gave him a brave smile unnecessarily brave it seemed to agnes i cant disappoint the dear public she said jolly good said bucket i should hurry on out there then perdita will help youwont you perdita yes of course and youll be in the chorus for the duet said bucket nearby in the chorus agnes sighed yes i know come on christine dear perdita said christine nanny watched them go then she said ill have that cup if youve finished with it oh yes yes it was very nice said bucket er i had a bit of an accident up at the boxes said nanny bucket clutched at his chest how many died oh no one died no one died they got a bit damp because i spilled some champagne bucket sagged with relief oh i wouldnt worry about that he said when i say spilled i mean it went on happening he waved her away it cleans up well off the carpet he said does it stain ceilings mrs ogg please just go away nanny nodded gathered up the teacups and wandered out of the office if no one questioned an old lady with a tray of tea they certainly werent bothered about one behind a pile of washingup washingup is a badge of membership anywhere as far as nanny ogg was concerned washingup was also something that happened to other people but she felt that it might be a good idea to stay in character she found an alcove with a pump and a sink in it rolled up her sleeves and set to work someone tapped her on the shoulder you shouldnt do that you know said a voice thats very unlucky she glanced around at a stagehand what washingup causes seven years bad luck she said you were whistling well i always whistle when im thinkin you shouldnt whistle on stage i meant its unlucky i suppose you could say that we use whistle codes when were shifting the scenery having a sack of sandbags land on you could be unlucky i suppose nanny glanced up his gaze followed hers just here the ceiling was about two feet away its just safest not to whistle the boy mumbled ill remember that said nanny no whistlin interestin we do live and learn dont we the curtain went up on act two nanny watched from the wings the interesting thing was the way in which people contrived to keep one hand higher than their necks in case of accidents there seemed to be far more salutes and waves and dramatic gestures than were strictly called for in the opera she watched the duet between iodine and bufola possibly the first in the history of the opera where both singers kept their eyes turned resolutely upwards nanny enjoyed music as well if music were the food of love she was game for a sonata and chips at any time but it was clear that the sparkle had gone out of things tonight she shook her head a figure moved through the shadows behind her and reached out she turned and looked at a fearsome face oh hello esme how did you get in youve still got the tickets so i had to talk to the man on the door but hell be right as rain in a minute or two whats been happening well the dukes sung a long song to say that he must be going and the count has sung a song saying how nice it is in the springtime and a dead bodys fallen out of the ceiling that goes on a lot in opera does it shouldnt think so ah in the theatre ive noticed if you watch dead bodies long enough you can see them move doubt if this onell move strangled someones murdering opera people i bin chatting to the ballet girls indeed its this ghost theyre all talking about hmm wears one of those black opera suits and a white mask how did you know that granny looked smug i mean i cant imagine whod want to murder opera people nanny thought of the expression on dame timpanis face except praps other opera people and praps the musicians and some of the audience praps i dont believe in ghosts said granny firmly oh esme you know ive got a dozen of em in my house oh i believe in ghosts said granny sad things hangin around goin woogy woogy woogy but i dont believe they kill people or use swords she walked away a little theres too many ghosts here already nanny kept quiet it was best to do so when granny was listening without using her ears gytha yes esme what does bella donna mean its the nobby name for deadly nightshade esme i thought so huh the cheek of it only in opera it means beautiful woman really oh grannys hand reached up and patted the ironhard bun of her hair foolishness hed moved like music like someone dancing to a rhythm inside his head and his face for a moment in the moonlight was the skull of an angel the duet got another standing ovation agnes faded gently back into the chorus she had to do little else during the remainder of the act except dance or at least move as rhythmically as she could with the rest of the chorus during the gypsy fair and listen to the duke singing a song about how lovely the countryside was in summer with an arm extended dramatically above his head she kept peering into the wings if nanny ogg was here then the other one would be around somewhere she wished shed never written those wretched letters home well they wouldnt drag her back no matter what they tried the remainder of the opera passed without anyone dying except where the score required them to do so at some length there was a minor upset when a member of the chorus was almost brained by a sandbag dislodged from a gantry by the stagehands stationed there to prevent accidents there was more applause at the end christine got most of it and then the curtains closed and opened and closed a few times as christine took her bows agnes felt perhaps she took one more bow than the applause really justified perdita looking out through her eyes said of course she did and then they closed the curtains for the last time the audience went home from the wings and up in the flies the stagehands whistled their commands parts of the world vanished into the aerial darkness someone went round and put out most of the lights rising like a birthday cake the chandelier was winched into its loft so that the candles could be snuffed then there were the footsteps of the men leaving the loft within twenty minutes of the last handclap of applause the auditorium was empty and dark except for just a few lights there was the clank of a bucket walter plinge walked on to the stage if such a word could be employed for his mode of progress he moved like a puppet on elastic strings so that it seemed only coincidentally that his feet touched the ground very slowly and very conscientiously he began to mop the stage after a few minutes a shadow detached itself from the curtains and walked over to him walter looked down hello mister pussy cat he said greebo rubbed against his legs cats have an instinct for anyone daft enough to give them food and walter certainly was well qualified i shall go and find you some milk shall i mister cat greebo purred like a thunderstorm walking his strange walk advancing only by averages walter disappeared into the wings there were two dark figures sitting in the balcony sad said nanny hes got a good job in the warm and his mother keeps an eye on him said granny a lot of people fare worse not a big future for him though said nanny not when you think about it there was a couple of cold potatoes and half a herring for their supper said granny hardly a stick of furniture too shame mind you shes a little bit richer now granny conceded especially if she sells all those knives and boots she added to herself its a cruel world for old ladies said nanny matriarch of a vast extended tribe and undisputed tyrant of half the ramtops especially one as terrified as mrs phnge said granny well id be frightened too if i was old and had walter to think about i aint talking about that gytha i know about fear thats true said nanny most of the people you meet are full of fear mrs phnge is living in fear said granny appearing not to hear this her mind is flat with it she cant hardly think for the terror i could feel it coming off of her like mist why because of the ghost i dont know yet not all of it anyway but i will find out nanny fished in the recesses of her clothing fancy a drink she said there was a muffled clink from somewhere in her petticoats i got champagne brandy and port also some nibbles and biscuits gytha ogg i believe you are a thief said granny i aint said nanny and added with that grasp of advanced morality that comes naturally to a witch just because i occasionally technicly steal something that doesnt make me a thief i dont think thief lets get back to mrs palms all right said nanny but can we get something to eat first i dont mind the cooking but the grub there is a bit of an allday breakfast if you know what i mean there was a sound from the stage as they stood up walter had returned followed by a slightly fatter greebo oblivious to the watchers he continued to mop the stage first thing tomorrow said granny well go and see mr goatberger the almanack man again ive had time to think about what to do next and then were going to sort this out she glared at the innocent figure washing the stage arid said under her breath what is it you know walter plinge what is it youve seen wasnt it amazing said christine sitting up in bed her nightdress agnes had noted was white and extremely lacy yes indeed said agnes five curtain calls mr bucket says thats more than anyones ever had since dame gigli im sure i wont be able to sleep for the excitement so you just drink up that lovely hot milk drink ive done for us said agnes it took me ages to carry the saucepan up those stairs and the flowers said christine ignoring the mug agnes had placed beside her they started arriving right after the performance mr bucket said he said there was a soft knock at the door christine adjusted her dress come the door opened and walter plinge shuffled in hidden under the bouquets of flowers after a few steps he stumbled on his own feet plunged forward and dropped them then he stared at the two girls in mute embarrassment turned suddenly and walked into the door christine giggled sorry mumiss said walter thank you walter said agnes the door closed isnt he strange have you seen the way he stares at me do you think you could find some water for these perdita certainly christine its only seven flights of stairs and as a reward i shall drink this lovely drink you have made for me has it got spices in it oh yes spices said agnes its not like one of those potions your witches cook up is it er no said agnes after all everyone in lancre used fresh herbs er theres not going to be anything like enough vases for them all even if i use the guzunder the what the you know its goesunder the bed guzunder youre so funny there wont be anyway said agnes blushing hotly behind her eyes perdita committed murder then put in all the ones from the earls and knights and i shall see to the others tomorrow said christine picking up the drink agnes picked up the kettle and started towards the door perdita dear said christine the mug halfway to her lips agnes turned it did seem to me you were singing the teensiest bit loud dear im sure it must have been a little difficult for everyone to hear me sorry christine said agnes she walked down in darkness tonight there was a candle burning in a niche on every second landing without them the stairs would have been merely dark with them shadows crept arid leapt at every corner she reached the pump in the little alcove by the stage managers office and filled the kettle out on the stage someone began to sing it was peccadillos part of a duet of three hours earlier but sung without music and in a tenor voice of such tone and purity that the kettle dropped out of agness hand and spilled cold water over her feet she listened for a while and then realized that she was singing the soprano part under her breath the song came to an end she could hear far off the hollow sound of footsteps retreating in the distance she ran to the door to the stagepaused a moment and then opened it and went forward and out on to the huge dim emptiness the candles left burning were as much illumination as stars on a clear night there was no one there she walked into the centre of the stage and stopped and caught her breath at the shock she could feel the auditorium in front of her the huge empty space making the sound that velvet would make if it could snore it wasnt silence a stage is never silent it was the noise produced by a million other sounds that have never quite died awaythe thunder of applause the overtures the arias they poured down fragments of tunes lost chords snatches of song she stepped back and trod on someones foot agnes spun around andrй theres no someone crouched back sorry miss agnes breathed out walter sorry miss its all right you just startled me didnt see you miss walter was holding something to agness amazement the darker shape in the darkness was a cat flopped over walters arms like an old rug and purring happily it was like seeing someone poking their arm into a mincing machine to see what was jamming it thats greebo isnt it hes a happy cat hes full of milk walter whyre you in the middle of the stage in the dark when everyones gone home what were you doing miss it was the first time shed heard walter ask a question and hes sort of a janitor after all she told herself he can go anywhere i got lost she said ashamed at the lie i ill be going up to my room now er did you hear someone singing all the time miss i meant just now just now im talking to you miss oh gnight miss she walked through the soft warm gloom to the backstage door resisting at every step the urge to look round she collected the kettle and hurried up the stairs behind her on the stage walter carefully lowered greebo to the floor took off his beret and removed something white and papery from inside it what shall we listen to mister cat i know we shall listen to the overture to die flederleiv by j q bubbla cond vochua doinov greebo gave him the fatcheeked look of a cat prepared to put up with practically anything for food and walter sat down beside him and listened to the music coming out of the walls when agnes got back to the room christine was already fast asleep snoring the snore of those in herbal heaven the mug lay by the bed it wasnt a bad thing to do agnes reassured herself christine probably needed a good nights sleep it was practically a kindly act she turned her attention to the flowers there were quite a lot of roses and orchids most of them had cards attached many aristocratic men apparently appreciated good singing or at least good singing that appeared to come from a face like christines agnes arranged the flowers lancre fashion which was to hold the pot with one hand and the bouquet in the other and forcibly bring the two into conjunction the last bunch was the smallest and wrapped in red paper there was no card in fact there were no flowers someone had merely wrapped up half a dozen blackened and spindly rosestems and then for some reason sprayed them with scent it was musky and rather pleasant but a bad joke all the same she threw them in the bin with the rubbish blew out the candle and sat down to wait she wasnt certain for whom or what after a minute or two she was aware that there was a glow coming from the waste bin it was the barest fluorescence like a sick glowworm but it was there she crawled across the floor and peered in there were rosebuds on the dead sticks transparent as glass visible only by the glimmer on the edge of each petal they flickered like marsh lights agnes lifted them out carefully and fumbled in the darkness for the empty mug it wasnt the best of vases but it would have to do then she sat and watched the ghostly flowers until someone coughed she jerked her head up aware that shed fallen asleep madam sir the voice was melodious it suggested that at any minute it might break into song attend tomorrow you must sing the part of laura in il truccatore we have much to do one night is barely enough the aria in act one will occupy much of our time there was a brief passage of violin music your performance tonight was good but there are areas that we must build upon attend did you send the roses you like the roses they bloom only in darkness who are you was it you i heard singing just now there was silence for a moment yes then let us examine the role of laura in il truccatore the master of disguise also sometimes vulgarly known as the man with a thousand faces when the witches arrived at goatbergers offices next morning they found a very large troll sitting on the stairs it had a club across its knees and held up a shovelsized hand to prevent them going any further no ones allowed in it said mr goatberger is in a meetin how long is this meetin going to be said granny mr goatberger is a very elongated meeter granny gave the troll an appraising stare you been in publishin long she said since dis mornin said the troll proudly mr goatberger gave you the job yup come up quarry lane and picked me special forthe trolls brow creased as it tried to remember the unfamiliar wordsthe fast track inns fastmovin worlds publishin and what exactly is your job ead fitter souse me said nanny pushing forward id know that stratum anywhere youre from copperhead in lancre aint you so what were from lancre too yeah this is granny weatherwax you know the troll gave her a disbelieving grin and then its brow corrugated again and then it looked at granny she nodded the one you boys call aaoograha hoa you know said nanny she who must be avoided the troll looked at its club as if seriously considering the possibility of beating itself to death granny patted it on the lichenencrusted shoulder whats your name lad carborundum miss it mumbled one of its legs began to tremble well im sure youre going to make a good life for yourself here in the big city said granny yes why dont you go and start now said nanny the troll gave her a grateful look and fled without even bothering to open the door do they really call me that said granny er yes said nanny kicking herself its a mark of respect of course oh er ive always done my best to get along with trolls you know that oh yes how about the dwarfs said granny as someone might who had found a hitherto unsuspected boil and couldnt resist poking it have they got a name for me too lets go and see mr goatberger shall we said nanny brightly gytha er well i think its kezrek dbduz said nanny what does that mean er go around the other side of the mountain said nanny oh granny was uncharacteristically silent as they made their way up the stairs nanny didnt bother to knock she opened the door and said cooee mr goatberger its us again just like you said oh i shouldnt try to get out of the window like thatyoure three flights up and that bag of money is a bit dangerous if youre climbing around the man edged around the room so that his desk was between him and the witches wasnt there a troll downstairs he said its decided to break out of publishing said nanny she sat down and gave him a big smile i spect youve got some money for us mr goatberger realized that he was trapped his face contorted into a series of twisted expressions as he experimented with some replies then he smiled as widely as nanny and sat down opposite her of course things are very difficult at the moment he said in fact i cant recall a worse time he added with considerable honesty he looked at grannys face his grin stayed where it was but the rest of his face began to edge away people just dont seem to be buying books he said and the cost of the etchings well its wicked everyone i knows buys the almanack said granny i reckon everyone in lancre buys your almanack everyone in the whole ramtops buys the almanack even the dwarfs thats a lot of half dollars and gythas book seems to be doing very well well of course im glad its so popular but what with distribution paying the peddlers the wear and tear on your almanack will last a household all winter with care said granny providing no ones ill and the papers nice and thin my son jason buys two copies said nanny of course hes got a big family the privy door never stops swinging yes but you see the point is i dont actually have to pay you anything said mr goatberger trying to ignore this his smile had the face all to itself now you paid me to print it and i gave you your money back in fact i think our accounts department made a slight error in your favour but i wont his voice trailed away granny weatherwax was unfolding a sheet of paper these predictions for next year she said whered you get that i borrowed it you can have it back if you like well what about them theyre wrong what do you mean theyre wrong theyre predictions i dont see there being a rain of curry in klatch next may you dont get curry that early you know about the predictions business said goatberger you ive been printing predictions for years i dont do clever stuff for years ahead like you do granny admitted but im pretty accurate if you want a thirtysecond one indeed whats going to happen in thirty seconds granny told him goatberger roared with laughter oh yes thats a good one you should be writing them for us he said oh my word nothing like being ambitious eh thats better than the spontaneous combustion of the bishop of quirm and that didnt even happen in thirty seconds eh no no twentyone seconds now said granny mr bucket had arrived at the opera house early to see if anyone had died so far today he made it as far as his office without a single body dropping out of the shadows he really hadnt expected it to be like this hed liked opera it had all seemed so artistic hed watched hundreds of operas and practically no one had died except once during the ballet scene in la triviata when a ballerina had rather overenthusiastically been flung into the lap of an elderly gentleman in the front row of the stalls she hadnt been hurt but the old man had died in one incredibly happy instant someone knocked at the door mr bucket opened it about a quarter of an inch whos dead he said nno one mr bucket ive got your letters oh its you walter thank you he took the bundle and shut the door there were bills there were always bills the opera house practically runs itself theyd told him well yes but it practically ran on money he rummaged through the let there was an envelope with the opera house crest on it he looked at it like a man looks at a very fierce dog on a very thin leash it did nothing except lie there and look as gummed as an envelope can be finally he disembowelled it with the paperknife and then flung it down on the desk again as if it would bite when it did not do so he reached out hesitantly and withdrew the folded letter it read as follows my dear bucket i should be most grateful if christine sings the role of laura tonight i assure you she is more than capable the second violinist is a little slow i feel and the second act last night was frankly extremely wooden this really is not good enough my i extend my own welcome to senor basilica i congratulate you on his arrival wishing you the very best the opera ghost mr salzella salzella was eventually located he read the note you do not intend to accede to this he said she does sing superbly salzella you mean the nitt girl well yes you know what i mean but this is nothing less than blackmail is it hes not actually threatening anything you let her i mean them of course you let them sing last night and much good it did poor dr undershaft what do you advise then there was another series of disjointed knocks on the door come in walter said bucket and salzella together walter jerked in holding the coalscuttle ive been to see commander vimes of the city watch said salzella he said hell have some of his best men here tonight undercover i thought you said they were all incompetent salzella shrugged weve got to do this properly did you know dr undershaft was strangled before he was hung hanged said bucket without thinking men are hanged its dead meat thats hung indeed said salzella i appreciate the information well poor old undershaft was strangled apparently and then he was hung really salzella you do have a misplaced sense ive finished now mr bucket yes thank you walter you may go yes mr bucket walter closed the door behind him very conscientiously im afraid its working here said salzella if you dont find some way of dealing with are you all right mr bucket what bucket whod been staring at the closed door shook his head oh yes er walter what about him hes all right is he oh hes got his funny little ways hes harmless enough if thats what you mean some of the stagehands and musicians are a bit cruel to him you know sending him out for a tin of invisible paint or a bag of nailholes and so on he believes what hes told why oh i just wondered silly really i suppose he is technically no i meant oh it doesnt matter granny weatherwax and nanny ogg left goatbergers office and walked demurely down the street at least granny walked demurely nanny leaned somewhat every thirty seconds shed say how much was that again three thousand two hundred and seventy dollars and eightyseven pence said granny she was looking thoughtful i thought it was nice of him to look in all the ashtrays for all the odd coppers he could round up said nanny those he could reach anyway how much was that again three thousand two hundred and seventy dollars and eightyseven pence ive never had seventy dollars before said nanny i didnt say just seventy dollars i said yes i know but im working my way up to it gradual ill say this about money it really chafes i dont know why you have to keep your purse in your knicker leg said granny its the last place anybody would look nanny sighed how much did you say it was three thousand two hundred and seventy dollars and eightyseven pence im going to need a bigger tin youre going to need a bigger chimney i could certainly do with a bigger knicker leg she nudged granny youre going to have to be polite to me now im rich she said yes indeed said granny with a faraway look in her eyes dont think im not considering that she stopped nanny walked into her with a tinkle of lingerie the frontage of the opera house loomed over them weve got to get back in there granny said and into box eight crowbar said nanny firmly a no claw end should do it were not your nev said granny anyway breaking in wouldnt be the same thing weve got to have a right to be there cleaners said nanny we could be cleaners and no s not right me being a cleaner now in my position no we cant have that with you in your position granny glanced down at nanny as a coach pulled up outside the opera house o course she said artfulness dripping off her voice like toffee we could always buy box eight wouldnt work said nanny people were hurrying down the steps with the cuffadjusting sticky looks of welcoming committees everywhere theyre scared of selling it why not said granny theres people dying and the opera goes on that means someones prepared to sell his own grandmother if hed make enough money itd cost a fortune anyway said nanny she looked at grannys triumphant expression and groaned oh esme i was going to save that money for me old age she thought for a moment anyway it still wouldnt work i mean look at us we dont look like the right kind of people enrico basilica got out of the coach but we know the right kind of people said granny oh esme the shop bell tinkled in a refined tone as if it were embarrassed to do something as vulgar as ring it would have much preferred to give a polite cough this was ankhmorporks most prestigious dress shop and one way of telling was the apparent absence of anything so crass as merchandise the occasional carefully placed piece of expensive material merely hinted at the possibilities available this was not a shop where things were bought this was an emporium where you had a cup of coffee and a chat possibly as a result of that muted conversation four or five yards of exquisite fabric would change ownership in some ethereal way and yet nothing so crass as trade would have taken place shop yelled nanny a lady appeared from behind a curtain and observed the visitors quite possibly with her nose have you come to the right entrance she said madame dawning had been brought up to be polite to servants and trades people even when they were as scruffy as these two old crows my friend here wants a new dress said the dumpier of the two one of the nobby ones with a train and a padded bum in black said the thin one and we wants all the trimmings said the dumpy one little handbag onna string pair of glasses onna stick the whole thing i think perhaps that might be a leetle more than youre thinking of spending said madame dawning how much is a leetle said the dumpy one i mean that this is rather a select dress shop thats why were here we dont want rubbish my names nanny ogg and this here is lady esmerelda weatherwax madame dawning regarded lady esmerelda quizzically there was no doubt that the woman had a certain bearing and she stared like a duchess from lancre said nanny ogg and she could have a conservatory if she liked but she doesnt want one ermadame dawning decided to play along for a while what style were you considering something nobby said nanny ogg i perhaps would like a leetle more guidance than that perhaps you could show us some things said lady esmerelda sitting down its for the opera oh you patronize the opera lady esmerelda patronizes everything said nanny ogg stoutly madame dawning had a manner peculiar to her class and upbringing shed been raised to see the world in a certain way when it didnt act in that certain way she wobbled a bit but like a gyroscope eventually recovered and went on spinning just as if it had if civilization were to collapse totally and the survivors were reduced to eating cockroaches madame dawning would still use a napkin and look down on people who ate their cockroaches the wrong way round i will er show you some examples she said excuse me one moment she scuttled into the long workrooms behind the shop where there was considerably less gilt and leaned against the wall and summoned her chief seamstress mildred there are two very strange she stopped theyd followed her they were wandering down the aisle between the rows of dressmakers nodding at people and inspecting some of the dresses on the dummies she hurried back im sure youd prefer how much is this one said lady esmerelda fingering a creation intended for the dowager duchess of quirm i am afraid that one is not for sale how much would it be if it was for sale three hundred dollars i believe said madame dawning five hundred seems about right said lady esmerelda does it said nanny ogg oh it does does it the dress was black at least in theory it was black it was black in the same way that a starlings wing is black it was black silk with jet beads and sequins it was black on holiday it looks about my size well take it pay the woman gytha madames gyroscope precessed rapidly take it now five hundred dollars pay pay now cash see to it gytha oh all right nanny ogg turned away modestly and raised her skirt there was a series of rustlings and elasticated twangings and then she turned around holding a bag she counted out fifty rather warm tendollar pieces into madame dawnings unprotesting hand and now well go back into the shop and have a poke around for the other stuff said lady esmerelda i fancy ostrich feathers myself and one of those big cloaks the ladies wear and one of those fans edged with lace why dont we get some great big diamonds while were about it said nanny ogg sharply good idea madame dawning could hear them bickering as they ambled away up the aisle she looked down at the money in her hand she knew about old money which was somehow hallowed by the fact that people had hung on to it for years and she knew about new money which seemed to be being made by all these upstarts that were flooding into the city these days but under her powdered bosom she was an ankhmorpork shopkeeper and knew that the best kind of money was the sort that was in her hand rather than someone elses the best kind of money was mine not yours besides she was also enough of a snob to confuse rudeness withgood breeding in the same way that the really rich can never be mad so they can also never be rude she hurried after lady esmerelda and her rather strange friend salt of the earth she told herself she was in time to overhear a mysterious conversation im being punished aint i esme cant imagine what youre talking about gytha just cos i had my little moment i really dont follow you anyway you said you were at your wits end with thinking what youd do with the money yes but id have quite liked to have been at my wits end on a big comfy chase longyou somewhere with lots of big strong men buyin me chocolates and pressin their favourson me money dont buy happiness gytha i only wanted to rent it for a few weeks agnes rose late the music still ringing in her ears and dressed in a dream but she hung a bed sheet over the mirror first just in case there were half a dozen of the chorus dancers in the canteen sharing a stick of celery and giggling and there was andrй he was eating something absentmindedly while staring at a sheet of music occasionally hed wave his spoon in the air with a faraway look on his face and then put it down and make a few notes in midbeat he caught sight of agnes and grinned hello you look tired er yes youve missed all the excitement have i the watch have been here talking to everyone and asking lots of questions and writing things down very slowly what sort of questions well knowing the watch probably was it you what did it then theyre rather slow thinkers oh dear does that mean tonights performance is cancelled andrй laughed he had a rather pleasant laugh i dont think mr bucket could possibly cancel it he said even if people are dropping like flies out of the flies why not people have been queuing for tickets why he told her thats disgusting said agnes you mean theyre coming because it might be dangerous human nature im afraid of course some of them want to hear enrico basilica and well christine seems popular he gave her a sorrowful look i dont mind honestly lied agnes um how long have you worked here andrй er only a few months i used to teach music to the seriphs children in klatch um what do you think about the ghost he shrugged just some kind of madman i suppose um do you know if he sings i mean is good at singing i heard that he sends little critiques to the manager some of the girls say theyve heard someone singing in the night but theyre always saying silly things um are there any secret passages here he looked at her with his head on one side whove you been talking to sorry the girls say there are of course they say they see the ghost all the time and sometimes in two places at once why should they see him more perhaps he just likes looking at young ladies theyre always practising in odd corners besides theyre all halfcrazed with hunger anyway arent you interested in the ghost people have been killed well people are saying it might have been dr undershaft but he was killed he might have hanged himself hed been very depressed lately and hed always been a bit strange nervy its going to be a bit difficult without him though here ive brought you a stack of old programmes some of the notes may help since you havent been in the opera long agnes stared at them unseeing people were disappearing and the first thought that everyone had was that it was going to be inconvenient without them the show must go on everyone said that people said it all the time often they smiled when they said it but they were serious all the same under the smile no one ever said why but yesterday when the chorus had been arguing about the money everyone knew that they werent actually going to refuse to sing it was all a game the show went on shed heard all the stories shed heard about shows continuing while fire raged around the city while a dragon was roosting on the roof while there was rioting in the streets outside scenery collapsed the show went on leading tenor died then appeal to the audience for any student of music who knew the part and give him his big chance while his predecessors body cooled gently in the wings why it was only a performance for heavens sake it wasnt like something important but the show goes on everyone took this so much for granted that they didnt even think about it any more as though there were fog in their heads on the other hand someone was teaching her to sing at night a mysterious person sang songs on the stage when everyone had gone home she tried to think of that voice belonging to someone who killed people it didnt work maybe shed caught some of the fog and didnt want it to work what sort of person could have that feel for music and kill people shed been idly turning the pages of an old programme and a name caught her eye she quickly shuffled through the others beneath there it was again not in every performance and never in a major role but it was there generally it played an innkeeper or a servant walter plinge she said walter but he doesnt sing does he she held up a programme and pointed what oh no andrй laughed good heavens its a a kind of convenient name i suppose sometimes someone has to sing a very minor part perhaps a singer is in a role that theyd rather not be remembered in well here they just go down on the programme as walter plinge lots of theatres have a useful name like that like a n other its convenient for everyone but walter plinge well i suppose it started as a joke i mean can you imagine walter plinge on stage andrй grinned in that little beret he wears what does he think about it i dont think he minds its hard to tell isnt it there was a crash from the direction of the kitchen although it was really more of a crashendo the longdrawnout clatter that begins when a pile of plates begins to slip continues when someone tries to grab at them develops a desperate countertheme when the person realizes they dont have three hands and ends with the roinroinroin of the one miraculously intact plate spinning round and round on the floor they heard an irate female voice walter plinge sorry mrs clamp damn thing keeps holding on to the edge of the pan let go you wretched insect there was the sound of crockery being swept up and then a rubbery noise that could approximately be described as a spoing now wheres it gone dont know mrs clamp and whats that cat doing in here andrй turned back to agnes and flashed her a sad smile it is a little cruel i suppose he said the poor chap is a bit daft im not at all sure said agnes that ive met anyone here who isnt he grinned again i know he said i mean everyone acts as if its only the music that matters the plots dont make sense half the stories rely on people not recognizing their servants or wives because theyve got a tiny mask on large ladies play the part of consumptive girls no one can act properly no wonder everyone accepts me singing for christinethats practically normal compared to opera its an operatic kind of idea there should be a sign on the door saying leave your common sense here if it wasnt for the music the whole thing would be ridiculous she realized he was looking at her with an opera face of course thats it isnt it it is the show that matters isnt it she said its all show its not meant to be real said andrй its not like theatre no ones saying youve got to pretend this is a big battlefield and that guy in the cardboard crown is really a king the plots only there to fill in time before the next song he leaned forward and took her hand this must be wretched for you he said no male had ever touched agnes before except perhaps to push her over and steal her sweets she pulled her hand away i er better go and practise she said feeling the blush start you really picked up the role of iodine very well said andrй i er have a private tutor said agnes then hes really studied opera thats all i can say i think he has esme yes gytha its not that i m complaining or anything yes but why isnt it me whos being the posh opera patronizes because youre as common as muck gytha oh right nanny subjected this statement to some thought and couldnt see any point of inaccuracy that would sway a jury fair enough its not as though i like this shall i do madams feet said the manicurist she stared at grannys boots and wondered if it might be necessary to use a hammer i got to admit its a nice hairstyle said nanny madam has marvellous hair said the hairdresser what is the secret youve got to make sure theres no newts in the water said granny she looked at her reflection in the mirror over the washbasin and went to look away and then sneaked another glance her lips pursed hmm she said at the other end the manicurist had succeeded in getting grannys boots and socks off much to her amazement there was revealed instead of the corned and bunioned monstrosities shed been expecting a pair of perfect feet she didnt know where to start because there was nowhere to begin but this manicure was costing twenty dollars and in those circumstances you damn well find something to do nanny sat beside their pile of packages and tried to work everything out on a scrap of paper she didnt have grannys gift for numbers they tended to writhe under her gaze and add themselves up wrong esme i reckon weve spent probably moren a thousand dollars so far and thats not including hirin the coach and we havent paid mrs palm for the room you said nothing was too much trouble to help a lancre girl said granny but i didnt say nothing was too much money thought nanny and then scolded herself for thinking like that but she was definitely feeling a little lighter in the underwear regions there seemed to be a general consensus among the artisans of beauty that theyd done what they could granny swivelled the chair around what do you think she said nanny ogg stared shed seen many strange things in her life some of them twice shed seen elves and walking stones and the shoeing of a unicorn shed had a farmhouse dropped on her head but shed never seen granny weatherwax in rouge all her normal expletives of shock and surprise fused instantly and she found herself resorting to an ancient curse belonging to her grandmother well ill be mogadored she said madam has extremely good skin said the cosmetics lady i know said granny cant seem to do anything about it ill be mogadored said nanny again powder and paint said granny huh just another kind of mask oh well she gave the hairdresser a dreadful smile how much do we owe you she said er thirty dollars said the hairdresser that is give the w man thirty dollars and another twenty to make up for his trouble said granny clutching at her head fifty dollars you could buy a shop for gytha oh all right scuse me im just going to the bank she turned away demurely raised the hem of her skirt twangtwingtwongtwang and turned back with a handful of coins there you go my good wo sir she said sourly there was a coach waiting outside it was the best granny had been able to hire with nannys money a footman held open the door as nanny helped her friend aboard well go straight to mrs palms sos i can change said granny as they pulled away and then to the opera house we aint got much time are you all right never felt better granny patted her hair gytha ogg you wouldnt be a witch if you couldnt jump to conclusions right nanny nodded oh yes there was no shame in it sometimes there wasnt time to do anything else but take a flying leap sometimes you had to trust to experience and intuition and general awareness and take a running jump nanny herself could clear quite a tall conclusion from a standing start so ive no doubt at all that theres some kind of idea floating around in your mind about this ghost well sort of an idea yes a name perhaps nanny shifted uncomfortably and not only because of the moneybags under her skirt i got to admit something crossed my mind a kind of feeling i mean you never can tell granny nodded yes its all neat isnt it its a lie you said last night you saw the whole thing its still a lie like the lie about masks what lie about masks the way people say they hide faces they do hide faces said nanny ogg only the one on the outside no one took much notice of agnes the stage was being set for the new performance tonight the orchestra was rehearsing the ballerinas had been herded into their practiceroom in various other rooms people were singing at crosspurposes but no one seemed to want her to do anything im just a wandering voice she thought she climbed the stairs to her room and sat on the bed the curtains were still drawn and in the gloom the strange roses glowed she had rescued them from the bin because they were beautiful but in a way shed have been happier if they werent there then she could have believed shed imagined the whole thing there was no sound from christines room telling herself that it was really her room anyway and christine had just been allowed to borrow it agnes went in it was a mess christine had got up got dressed either that or a thorough but overenthusiastic burglar had gone through every drawer in the placeand gone the bouquets that agnes had put into whatever receptacles she could find last night were where she had left them the others were where she had left them too and they were already dying she caught herself wondering where she could find some jars and pots for them and hated herself for it it was as bad as saying poot you might as well paint welcome on yourself and lie down on the doorstep of the universe it was no fun at all having a wonderful personality oh and good hair and then she went and found pots for them anyway the mirror dominated the room it seemed to grow a little larger each time she looked at it all right she had to know didnt she heart pounding she felt around the edges of it there was a little raised area that might have looked like part of the frame but as her fingers moved across it there was a click and the mirror swung inwards a fraction of an inch when she pushed at it it moved she breathed out and stepped in its disgusting said salzella its pandering to the most depraved taste mr bucket shrugged its not as though were putting good chance of seeing someone throttled on stage on the posters he said but news has got around people like drama you mean the watch didnt want us to shut down no they just said we should mount guards like last night and theyd take steps steps to the nearest place of safety no doubt i dont like it any more than you do but its gone too far we need the watch now anyway thered be a riot if we closed ankhmorpork has always enjoyed excitement were completely sold out the show must go on oh yes said salzella nastily would you like me to slit a few throats in the second act just so no one feels disappointed of course not said bucket we dont want any deaths but the but hung in the air like the late dr undershaft salzella threw up his hands anyway i believe we are past the worst said mr bucket i hope so said salzella wheres senor basilica said bucket mrs plinge is showing him his dressingroom mrs plinge hasnt been murdered no no one has been found dead so far today said salzella that is good news yes and it must be oh at least ten past twelve said salzella with an irony that bucket quite failed to notice i will go and fetch him up so that we can have lunch shall i it must be a good half an hour since he had a snack bucket nodded after the director had gone he surreptitiously checked his desk drawers again there was no letter perhaps it was over perhaps it was true what they were saying about the late doctor someone knocked at the door four times only one person could achieve four knocks without any rhythm whatsoever come in walter walter plinge stumbled into the room theres a lady he said shes to see mr bucket nanny ogg poked her head around the door cooee she said its only me its mrs ogg isnt it said mr bucket there was something slightly worrying about the woman he didnt recall her name on the list of employees on the other hand she was clearly around the place she wasnt dead and she made a decent cup of tea so was it his worry if she wasnt getting paid good gracious im not the lady said nanny ogg im as common as muck me on the highest authority no shes waiting down in the foyer i thought id better nip round here and warn you warn me warn me about what i dont have any other appointments this morning who is this lady have you ever heard of lady esmerelda weatherwax no should i famous patron of the opera conservatories all over the place said nanny pots of money too really but im due to bucket looked out of the window there was a coach and four horses outside it had so much rococo ornamentation on it that it was surprising it ever managed to move well i he began again it is really very incon she aint the sort of person who likes to be kept waiting said nanny with absolute honesty and then because granny had been getting on her nerves all morning and the initial embarrassment at mrs palms still rankled and there was a streak of mischief in nanny a mile wide she added they say she was a famous courtesan in her younger days they say she didnt like to be kept waiting then either retired now of course so they say you know ive visited most of the major opera houses and ive never heard the name mused bucket ah i heard she likes to keep her donations secret said nanny mr buckets mental compass once again swung around to point due money youd better show her up he said i could perhaps give her a few minutes no one ever gave lady esmerelda less than half an hour said nanny and gave bucket a wink ill go and fetch her shall i she bustled away towing walter behind her mr bucket stared after her then after a moments thought he got up and checked the set of his moustache in the mirror over the fireplace he heard the door open and turned with his finest smile in place it faded only slightly at the sight of salzella ushering the impressive bulk of basilica in front of him the little manager and interpreter fussed along beside him like a tugboat ah senor basilica said bucket i trust the dressingrooms are to your satisfaction basilica gave him a blank smile while the interpreter spoke in brindisian and then replied senor basilica says they are fine but the larder isnt big enough he said haha said bucket and then stopped when no one else laughed in fact he said hurriedly senor basilica will im sure be very happy to hear that our kitchens have made a special effort to there was another knock at the door he hurried across and opened it granny weatherwax stood there but not for long she pushed him aside and swept into the room there was a choking noise from enrico basilica which one of you is bucket she demanded er me granny removed a glove and extended her hand so sorry she said ai am not used to important people opening their own doors ai am esmerelda weatherwax how charming ive heard so much about you lied bucket pray let me introduce you no doubt you know senor basilica of course said granny looking henry slugg in the eye im sure senor basilica recalls the many happy times weve had in other opera houses whose names i cant quite remember at the moment henry grimaced a smile and said something to the interpreter that is astonishing said the interpreter senor basilica has just said how fondly he recalls meeting you many times before at opera houses that have just slipped his mind at present henry kissed grannys hand and looked up at her with pleading in his eyes my word thought bucket that look hes giving her i wonder if they ever oh uh and this is mr salzella our director of music he said remembering himself honoured said salzella giving granny a firm handshake and looking her squarely in the eye she nodded and whats the first thing youd take out of a burning house mr salzella she enquired he smiled politely what would you like me to take madam she nodded thoughtfully and let go of his hand may i get you a drink said bucket a small sherry said granny salzella sidled up to bucket as he was pouring the drink who the hell is she apparently shes rolling in money whispered bucket and very keen on opera never heard of her well senor basilica has and thats good enough for me make yourself pleasant to them will you while i try to sort out lunch he pulled open the door and tripped over nanny ogg sorry said nanny standing up and giving him a cheerful grin these doorknobs are a bugger to polish arent they er mrs ogg ogg could you run along to the kitchens and tell mrs clamp there will be another one for lunch please right you are nanny bustled away bucket nodded approvingly what a reliable old lady he thought it wasnt exactly a secret when the room had been divided a space had been left between the walls at the far end it opened on to a staircase a perfectly ordinary staircase which even had some grubby daylight via a dirtencrusted window agnes was vaguely disappointed she had expected well a real secret passage perhaps with a few torches flickering secretly in rather valuable secret wroughtiron holders but the staircase had just been walled off from the rest of the place at some time it wasnt secretit had merely been forgotten there were cobwebs in the corners the cocoons of extinct flies hung down from the ceiling the air smelled of longdead birds but there was a clear track through the dust someone had used the stairs several times she hesitated between up and down and headed up that was no great journeyafter one more flight it ended at a trapdoor that wasnt even bolted she pushed at it and then blinked in the unaccustomed light wind caught at her hair a pigeon stared at her and flew away as she poked her head into the fresh air the door had opened out on to the opera houses roof just one more item in a forest of skylights and airshafts she went back inside and headed downwards and became aware as she did so of the voices the old stairs hadnt been totally forgotten someone had at least seen their usefulness as an airshaft voices filtered up there were scales distant music snatches of conversation as she went down she passed through layers of noise like a very carefully made sundae of sound greebo sat on top of the kitchen cupboard and watched the performance with interest use the ladle why dont you said a sceneshifter it wont reach walter yes mrs clamp give me that broom yes mrs clamp greebo looked up at the high ceiling to which was affixed a sort of thin tenpointed star in the middle of it was a pair of very frightened eyes plunge it into boiling water said mrs clamp thats what it said in the cookbook it never said watch out itll grip the sides of the pot and spring straight up in the air she flailed around with the broomhandle the squid shrank back and that pastas all gone wrong she muttered ive had it grilling for hours and its still hard as nails the wretched stuff cooee its only me said nanny ogg poking her head around the door and such was the all embracing nature of her personality that even those who didnt know who she was took this on trust having a bit of trouble are you she surveyed the scene including the ceiling there was a smell of burning pasta in the air ah she said thisd be the special lunch for senior basilica would it it was meant to be said the cook still making ineffectual swipes blasted thing wont come down though other pots were simmering on the long iron range nanny nodded towards them whats everyone else having she said mutton and clootie dumplings with slumpie said the cook ah good honest food said nanny speaking of walltowall suet oiled with lard and theres supposed to be jammy devils for pudding and ive been so tied up with this wretched thing i havent even made a start nanny carefully took the broom out of the cooks hands tell you what she said you make enough dumplings and slumpie for five people and ill help by knocking up a quick pudding how about that well thats a very handsome offer mrs ogg the jams in the jar by oh i wont bother about jam said nanny she looked at the spicerack grinned and then stepped behind a table for modesty twingtwangtwongtwang got any chocolate she said producing a slim volume ive got a recipe right here that might be fun she licked her thumb and opened the book at page chocolate delight with special secret sauce yes thought nanny that would be fun if people wanted to go around teaching people lessons other people should remember that those people knew a thing or two about people scraps of conversation floated out of the walls as agnes wound her secret way down the forgotten stairs it was thrilling no one was saying anything important there were no convenient guilty secrets there were just the sounds of people getting through the day but they were secret sounds it was wrong to listen of course agnes had been brought up in the knowledge that a lot of things were wrong it was wrong to listen at doors to look people directly in the eye to talk out of turn to answer back to put yourself forward but behind the walls she could be the perdita shed always wanted to be perdita didnt care about anything perdita got things done perdita could wear anything she wanted perdita x nitt mistress of the darkness magdalen of cool could listen in to other peoples lives and never ever have to have a wonderful personality agnes knew she should go back up to her room whatever lay in the increasingly shadowy depths was probably something she ought not to find perdita continued downwards agnes went along for the ride the preluncheon drinks were going quite well mr bucket thought everyone was making polite conversation and absolutely no one had been killed up to the present moment and it had been very gratifying to see the tears of gratitude in senor basilicas eyes when he was told that the cook was preparing a special brindisian meal just for him hed seemed quite overcome it was reassuring that he knew lady esmerelda there was something about the woman that left mr bucket terribly perplexed he was finding it a little difficult to converse with her as a conversational gambit hello i understand you have a lot of money can i have some please lacked he felt a certain subtlety so er madam he ventured what brings you to our er city i thought perhaps i could come and spend some money said granny got rather a lot of it you know keep havin to change banks cos they get filled up somewhere in buckets tortured brain part of his mind went whoopee and clicked its heels im sure if theres anything i can do he murmured as a matter of fact there is said granny i was thinking of a gong banged ah said mr bucket luncheon is served he extended his arm to granny who gave it an odd look before remembering who she was and taking it there was a small exclusive diningroom off his office it contained a table set for five and looking rather fetching in a waitresss lacy bonnet nanny ogg she bobbed a curtsey enrico basilica made a tiny strangling noise at the back of his throat scuse me theres been a bit of a problem said nanny whos dead said bucket oh no ones dead said nanny its the dinner its still alive and hangin on to the ceiling and the pastas all gone black see i said to mrs clamp i said it may be foreign but i dont reckon it should be crunchy this is terrible what a way to treat an honoured guest said bucket he turned to the interpreter please assure senor basilica that we will send out for fresh pasta straight away what were we having mrs ogg roast mutton with clootie dumplings said nanny behind the face of senor basilica the throat of henry slugg made another little growling sound and theres some nice slumpie with a knob of butter nanny went on bucket looked around puzzled is there a dog somewhere in here he said well i for one dont believe in pandering to singers said granny weatherwax fancy food indeed i never heard the like why not give him mutton with the rest of us oh lady esmerelda thats hardly a way to treat bucket began enricos elbow nudged his interpreter with the special nudge of a man who could see clootie dumplings vanishing into the long grass if he werent careful he rumbled out a very pointed sentence senor basilica says he would be more than happy to taste the indigenous food of ankhmorpork said the interpreter no we really cant bucket tried again in fact senor basilica insists that he tries the indigenous food of ankhmorpork said the interpreter s right si said basilica good said granny and give him some beer while youre about it she gave the tenors stomach a playful poke losing her finger down to the second joint why in a day or two i expect you could practically turn him into a native the wooden stairs gave way to stone perdita said hell have a vast cave somewhere under the opera house there will be hundreds of candles casting an exciting yet romantic light over the yes the lake and there will be a dinnertable shining with crystal glass and silverware and of course he will have yes a huge organ agnes blushed hotly in the darkness on which that is to say he will play in a virtuoso style many operatic classics agnes said itll be damp there will be rats another clootie dumpling senior said nanny ogg mmfmmfmmf take two while youre about it it was an education watching enrico basilica eat it wasnt as though he gobbled his food but he did eat continuously like a man who intends to go on doing it all day on industrial lines his napkin tucked neatly into his collar the fork was loaded while the current consignment was being thoroughly masticated so that the actual time between mouthfuls was as small as possible even nanny no stranger to a metabolism going for the burn was impressed enrico basilica ate like a man freed at last from the tyranny of tomatoes with everything ill order another mintsauce tanker shall i she said mr bucket turned to granny weatherwax you were saying that you might be inclined to patronize our opera house he murmured oh yes said granny is senor basilica going to sing tonight mmfmmf i hope so muttered salzella that or explode then i shall definitely want to be there said granny a little more lamb here my good woman yes maam said nanny ogg making a face at the back of grannys head er seats for tonight in fact are bucket began a box would do me said granny im not fussy in fact even the boxes are how about box eight ive heard as box eight is always empty buckets knife rattled on his plate er box eight box eight you see we dont i was thinking of donating a little something said granny but box eight you see although technically unsold is two thousand dollars was what i had in mind said granny oh dear me your waitress has let her dumplings go all over the place its so difficult to get reliable and polite staff these days aint it salzella and bucket stared at one another across the table then bucket said excuse me my lady i must just have a brief discussion with my director of music the two men hurried to the far end of the room where they began to argue in whispers two thousand dollars hissed nanny watching them it might not be enough said granny theyre both looking very red in the face yes but two thousand dollars its only money yes but its only my money not only your money nanny pointed out we witches have always held everything in common you know that said granny well yes said nanny and once again cut to the heart of the sociopolitical debate its easy to hold everything in common when no ones got anything why gytha ogg said granny i thought you despised riches right so id like to get the chance to despise them up close but i knows you gytha ogg moneyd spoil you id just like the chance to prove that it wouldnt thats all im saying hush theyre coming back mr bucket approached smiled uneasily and sat down er he began it has to be box eight does it only we could perhaps persuade someone in one of the other wouldnt hear of it said granny ive heard that theres no one ever seen in box eight er haha its laughable i know but there are some old theatrical traditions associated with box eight absolute rubbish of course but he left the but hanging there hopefully it froze in the face of grannys stare you see its haunted he mumbled oh lawks said nanny ogg vaguely remembering to stay in character another vat of slumpie senior basilica and how about another quart of beer mmfmmf said the tenor encouragingly taking time out from his eating to point a fork at his empty mug granny went on staring excuse me said bucket again he and salzella went into another huddle out of which came sounds like but two thousand dollars thats a lot of shoes bucket surfaced again his face was grey grannys stare could do that to people er because of the danger er which of course doesnt exist haha we that is the management feel it incumbent on us to insist that is politely request that if you do enter box eight you do so in company with a man he ducked slightly a man said granny for protection said bucket in a little voice although whod protect him we really couldnt say said salzella under his breath we thought perhaps one of the staff bucket mumbled ai am quate capable of finding my own man should the need arise said granny in a voice with snow on it buckets polite reply died in his throat when he saw just behind lady esmerelda mrs ogg grinning like a full moon anyone for pudding she said she held a big bowl on a tray there seemed to be a heat haze over it my word he said that looks delicious enrico basilica looked over the top of his food with the expression of a man who has had the amazing privilege of going to heaven while still alive mmmf it was damp and with the demise of mr pounder there were indeed rats the stone looked old too of course all stone was old agnes told herself but this had grown old as masonry ankhmorpork had been here for thousands of years where other cities were built on clay or rock or loam ankhmorpork was built on ankhmorpork people constructed new buildings on the remains of earlier ones knocking out a few doorways here and there to turn ancient bedrooms into cellars the stairs petered out on damp flagstones in almost total darkness perdita thought it looked romantic and gothic agnes thought it looked gloomy if someone used this place theyd need lights wouldnt they and a fumbling search confirmed it she found a candle and some matches tucked into a niche in the wall that was sobering for agnes and perdita together someone used this prosaic book of matches with a picture of a grinning troll on the cover and this piece of perfectly ordinary candle perdita would have preferred a flaming torch agnes didnt know what she would have preferred it was just that if a mysterious person came and sang in the walls and moved around the place like a ghost and possibly killed people well youd prefer a bit more style than a box of matches with a picture of a grinning troll on it that was the sort of thing a murderer would use she lit the candle and in two minds about it all went on into the dark chocolate delight with special secret sauce was a great success and heading down the little red lane as though hotwired more mr salzella said bucket this really is firstclass stuff isnt it i must congratulate mrs clamp there is a certain piquancy i must say said the director of music how about you senor basilica mmmf lady esmerelda i dont mind if i do said granny passing her plate across im sure i detect a hint of cinnamon said the interpreter a brown ring around his mouth indeed and possibly just a trace of nutmeg said mr bucket i thought cardamom said salzella creamy yet spicy said bucket his eyes unfocused slightly and curiously warming granny stopped chewing and looked down suspiciously at her plate then she sniffed at her spoon is it eris it just me or is it a trifle warm in here said bucket salzella had gripped the arms of his chair his forehead glistened do you think we could open a window he said i feel a little strange yes by all means said bucket salzella halfrose and then a preoccupied expression suffused his features he sat down suddenly no i rather believe ill just sit quietly for a moment he said oh dear said the interpreter there was a hint of vapour around his collar basilica tapped him politely on the shoulder grunted hopefully and made passithere motions in the direction of the halffinished dish of chocolate pudding mmmf he said oh dear said the interpreter mr bucket ran a finger around his collar sweat was beginning to roll down his face basilica gave up on his stricken colleague and reached across in a businesslike way to hook the dish with his fork er yes said bucket trying to keep his eyes away from granny yes indeed said salzella his voice coming from a long way away oh dear said the interpreter his eyes watering ai meu deus dio mio o goden dzuk ft aagorahaa senor basilica upended the rest of the special secret sauce on to his plate and carefully scraped out the dish with his spoon holding it upsidedown to reach the last little bit the weather has been a little cool of late bucket managed very cold in fact enrico held the saucedish up to the light and regarded it critically in case there was any drop hiding in a corner snow ice frost that sort of thing said salzella yes indeed coldness of all descriptions in fact yes yes said bucket gratefully and at a time like this i think it is very important to try to remember the names of say any number of boring and hopefully chilly things wind glaciers icicles not icicles oh said the interpreter and slumped forward into his plate his head hit a spoon which cartwheeled into the air and bounced off enricos head salzella started to whistle under his breath and pound the arm of his chair bucket blinked in front of him was the water jug the cold water jug he reached out oh oh oh dear me what can i say i seem to have spilled it all over myself he said through the rising clouds of steam what a butterfingers i am to be sure i shall ring for mrs ogg to bring us another one yes indeed said salzella and perhaps you would care to do it soon i am also feeling very accidentprone basilica still chewing lifted his interpreters head off the table and carefully tipped the mans unfinished pudding into his own plate in fact in fact in fact said salzella i think i shall just have a brisk have a nice coldif you would excuse me a minute he pushed back his chair and fled the room in a kind of crouching gait mr bucket glistened ill just ill just ill just be back quite shortly he said and scurried away there was silence broken only by the scrape of senor basilicas spoon and a sizzling noise from the interpreter then the tenor belched baritone whoops pardon my klatchian he said oh damn he appeared to notice the depleted table for the first time he shrugged and smiled hopefully at granny is there a cheeseboard do you think he said the door flew open and nanny ogg burst in holding a bucket of water in both hands all right all right thats she began and then stopped granny dabbed primly at the corners of her mouth with her napkin im sorry mrs ogg she said nanny looked at the empty dish in front of basilica or perhaps some fruit said the tenor a few nuts how much has he had she whispered best part of half said granny but i dont reckon its having any effect on account of not touching the sides nanny turned her attention to grannys plate how about you she said two helpings said granny with extra sauce gytha ogg may you be forgiven nanny looked at her with something like admiration in her eyes you aint even sweating she said granny picked up her water glass and held it at arms length after a few seconds the water began to boil all right youre getting really good ive got to admit it said nanny i reckon i should have to get up real early to put one over on you i reckon you should never go to sleep said granny sorry esme senor basilica at a loss to follow the conversation realized with reluctance that the meal was probably over absolutely superb he said i just loved that pudding mrs ogg i should just jolly well expect you did henry slugg said nanny henry carefully removed a clean handkerchief from his pocket put it over his face and leaned back in his chair the first snore occurred a few seconds later hes easy to have around isnt he said nanny eat sleep and sing you certainly know where you are with him ive found greebo by the way hes still following walter plinge around her expression became a little defiant say what you like young walters all right by me if greebo likes him granny sighed gytha greebo would like norris the eyeballeating maniac of quirm if he knew how to put food in a bowl and now she was lost shed done her best not to be as agnes had walked through each dank room shed thoughtfully taken note of details shed carefully remembered right and left turns and yet she was lost here and there were steps down to lower cellars but the waterlevel was so high that it was lapping at the first step and it stank the candle burned with a greenishblue edge to the flame somewhere said perdita there was the secret room if there wasnt a huge and glittering secret cavern what on earth was life for there had to be a secret room a room full of giant candles and enormous stalagmites but it certainly isnt here said agnes she felt a complete idiot shed gone through the mirror looking for well she wasnt quite prepared to admit what she might have been looking for but whatever it was it certainly wasnt this shed have to shout for help of course someone might hear but that was always a risk when you shouted for help she coughed er hello the water gurgled er help is there anyone there a rat ran over her foot oh yes she thought bitterly with perditas part of her brain if christine had come down here there probably would have been some great glistening cave and delicious danger the world saved up rats and smelly cellars for agnes because she had such a wonderful personality umanyone more rats scuttled across the floor there was a faint squeaking from the sidepassages hello she was lost in some cellars with a candle getting shorter by the second the air was foul the flagstones were slippery no one knew where she was she could die down here she could be eyes glowed in the darkness one was greenyellow the other pearly white a light appeared behind them something was coming along the passageway casting long shadows rats tumbled over themselves in their panic to get away agnes tried to press herself into the stone hello miss perdita x nitt a familiar shape juddered out of the darkness just behind greebo it was all knees and elbows it carried a sack over one shoulder and held a lantern in its other hand something fled from the darkness the terror leached out of it you dont want to be down here miss nitt with all the rats walter got to do mister pounders job now the poor man is passed away i am a person of all jobs no peas for the wicked but mister greebo just hits them with his paws and theyre off to rat heaven in a jiff walter repeated agnes out of sheer relief come for an explore have you these ole tunnels goes all the way to the river you have to keep your wits about you not to get lost down here want to come back with me it was impossible to be frightened of walter plinge walter attracted a number of emotions but terror wasnt among them er yes said agnes i got lost sorry greebo sat down and started to wash himself in what agnes considered to be a supercilious way if a cat could snigger he would be sniggering now ive got a full sack i have to take it to mister gimlets shop announced walter turning around and loping out of the cellar without bothering to see if she was following him we get a hapenny each which is not to be sneezed at the dwarfs think a rat is a good meal which only goes to show it would be a strange world if we were all alike it seemed a ridiculously short journey to the foot of some different stairs which had a wellused look to them have you ever seen the ghost walter said agnes as walter put his foot on the first step he didnt turn around it is wrong to tell lies er yes so i believe so when did you last see the ghost i last saw the ghost in the big room in the ballet school really what did he do walter paused for a moment and then the words came out all together he ran off he stamped up the stairs in a way that suggested very emphatically that the exchange was over greebo sneered at agnes and followed him the stairs went up just one flight and came out through a trapdoor backstage she had been lost only a door or two from the real world no one noticed her emerge but then no one noticed her at all they just assumed that shed be around when she was needed walter plinge had already loped off in something of a hurry agnes hesitated they probably wouldnt even notice she wasnt there right up to the point when christine opened her mouth he hadnt wanted to answer but walter plinge spoke when spoken to and she had a feeling that he wasnt able to lie telling lies would be being bad shed never seen the ballet school it wasnt far backstage but it was a world of its own the dancers issued from it every day like so many very thin and twittering sheep under the control of elderly women who looked as though they breakfasted on pickled limes it was only after shed timidly asked a few questions of the stagehands that shed realized that the girls had joined the ballet because theyd wanted to she had seen the dancers dressingroom where thirty girls washed and changed in a space rather smaller than buckets office it bore the same relationship to ballet as compost did to roses she looked around again still no one had paid any attention to her she headed for the school it was up a few steps along a foetid corridor lined with noticeboards and smelling of ancient grease a couple of girls fluttered past you never saw just one they went around in groups like mayflies she pushed open the door and stepped into the school reflections of reflections of reflections there were mirrors on every wall a few girls practising on the bars that lined the room looked up as she entered mirrors out in the passage she leaned against the wall and got her breath back shed never liked mirrors they always seemed to be laughing at her but didnt they say it was the mark of a witch not liking to get between two mirrors it sucked out your soul or something a witch would never get between two mirrors if she could help it but of course she very definitely wasnt a witch so she took a deep breath and went back into the room images of herself stretched away in every direction she managed a few steps then wheeled around and groped for the doorway again watched by the surprised dancers lack of sleep she told herself and general overexcitement anyway she didnt need to go right into the room now that she knew who the ghost was it was so obvious the ghost didnt require any mysterious nonexistent caves when all he needed to do was hide where everyone could see him mr bucket knocked at the door of salzellas office a muffled voice said come in there was no one in the office but there was another closed door in the far wall bucket knocked again and then rattled the door handle im in the bath said salzella are you decent im fully clothed if thats what you mean is there a pail of ice out there was it you who ordered it said bucket guiltily yes only i er i had it taken to my office so i could stick my feet in it your feet yes er i went for a brisk run around the city dont know why just felt like it well my boots caught fire on the second lap there was a sloshing noise and some sotto voce grumbling and then the door swung open revealing salzella in a purple dressinggown has senor basilica been safely tethered he said dripping on the floor hes going through the music with herr trubelmacher and hes all right he sent along to the kitchen for a snack salzella shook his head astonishing and theyve put the interpreter in a cupboard they dont seem to be able to get him unfolded bucket sat down carefully he was wearing carpet slippers and salzella prompted and what where did that dreadful woman go mrs ogg is showing her around well what else could i do two thousand dollars remember i am endeavouring to forget said salzella i promise never to talk about that lunch ever again if you dont either what lunch said bucket innocently well done she does seem to have an amazing effect though doesnt she i dont know who you are talking about i mean its not hard to see how she made her money good heavens man shes got a face like a hatchet they say that queen ezeriel of klatch had a squint but that didnt stop her having fourteen husbands and that was only the official score besides shes knocking on a bit i thought shed been dead for two hundred years im talking about lady esmerelda so am i at least try to be civil to her at the soiree before the performance tonight ill try the two thousand might be only the start i hope every time i open a drawer there are more bills we seem to owe money to everyone opera is expensive youre telling me whenever i try to make a start on the books something dreadful happens do you think i might just have a few hours without something awful happening in an opera house the voice was muffled by the halfdismantled mechanism of the organ all rightgive me middle c a hairy finger pressed a key it made a thudding noise and somewhere in the mechanism something else went woing blast its come off the peg hold on again the note rang out sweet and clear okay said the voice of the man hidden in the exposed entrails of the organ wait until i tighten the peg agnes stepped closer the hulking figure seated at the organ turned around and gave her a friendly grin which was much wider than the average grin its owner was covered in red hair and while shortchanged in the leg department had obviously been first in the queue when the arm counter opened and had also been given a special free offer of lip try andrй said agnes weakly the organist extracted himself from the mechanism he was holding a complicated wooden bar with springs on it oh hello he said er who is this said agnes backing away from the primeval organist oh this is the librarian i dont think he has a name hes the librarian at unseen university but much more importantly hes their organist and it turns out our organ is a johnson just like theirs hes given us some spare parts ook sorry lent us some spare parts he plays the organ in an amazingly prehensile way yes agnes relaxed the creature didnt seem about to attack oh she said well i suppose its natural because sometimes barrelorgan men came to our village and they often had a dear little mon there was a crashing chord the orangutan raised its other hand and waved a finger politely in front of agness face he doesnt like being called a monkey said andrй and he likes you how can you tell he doesnt usually go in for warnings she stepped back quickly and grabbed the boys arm can i have a word with you she said weve got only a few hours and id really like to get this its important he followed her into the wings behind them the librarian tapped a few keys on the halfrepaired keyboard and then ducked underneath i know who the ghost is whispered agnes andrй stared at her then he pulled her further into the shadows the ghost isnt anybody he said softly dont be silly its just the ghost i mean hes someone else when he takes his mask off who should i tell mr bucket and mr salzella who tell them about who walter plinge he stared at her again if you laugh ill ill kick you said agnes but walter isnt even i didnt believe it either but he said he saw the ghost in the ballet school and theres mirrors all over the walls and hed be quite tall if he stood up properly and he roams around in the cellars oh come on the other night i thought i heard him singing on the stage when everyone else had gone you saw him it was dark oh well andrй began dismissively but afterwards im certain i heard him talking to the cat talking normally i mean i mean like a normal person i mean and youve got to admit he is strange isnt he just the sort of person whod want to wear a mask to hide who he is she sagged look i can see you dont want to listen no no i think well i just thought id feel better if i told someone andrй smiled in the gloom i wouldnt mention it to anyone else though agnes looked down at her feet i suppose it does sound a bit farfetched andrй laid a hand on her arm perdita felt agnes draw herself back do you feel better he said i dont know i mean i dont know i mean i just cant imagine him hurting anyone i feel so stupid everyones on edge dont worry about it id hate you to think i was being silly ill keep an eye on walter if you like he smiled at her but id better get on with things he added he gave her another smile as fast and brief as summer lightning thank y he was already walking back to the organ this shop was a gentlemens outfitters its not for me said nanny ogg its for a friend hes six foot tall very broad shoulders inside leg oh yes she looked around the store might as well go all the way it was her money after all and a black coat long black tights shoes with them shiny buckles one of those top hats a big cloak with a red silk lining a bowtie a really posh black cane with a very nobby silver knob on it and a black eyepatch an eyepatch yes maybe with sequins or something on it since its the opera the tailor stared at nanny this is a little irregular he said why cant the gentleman come in himself he aint quite a gentleman yet but madam i meant that we have to get the size right nanny ogg looked around the shop tell you what she said you sell me something that looks about right and well adjust him to fit souse me she turned away demurely twingtwangtwong and turned back smoothing down her dress and holding a leather bag how muchll it be she said the tailor looked blankly at the bag im afraid we wont be able to have all that ready until at least next wednesday he said nanny ogg sighed she felt she was becoming familiar with one of the most fundamental laws of physics time equalled money therefore money equalled time i was sort of hoping to get it all a bit quicker than that she said jingling the bag up and down the tailor looked down his nose at her we are craftsmen madam how long did you think it should take how about ten minutes twelve minutes later she left the shop with a large packet under one arm a hatbox under the other and an ebony cane between her teeth granny was waiting outside got it all ess ill take the eyepatch shall i weve got to get a third witch said nanny trying to rearrange the parcels young agnes has got good strong arms you know if we was to drag her out of there by the scruff of her neck wed never hear the last of it said granny shell be a witch when she wants to be they headed for the opera houses stagedoor afternoon les said nanny cheerfully as they entered stopped itching now has it marvellous bit of ointment that was you gave me mrs ogg said the stagedoorkeeper his moustache bending into something that might have been a smile mrs les keeping well hows her sisters leg doing very well mrs ogg thank you for asking this is just esme weatherwax whos helping me with some stuff said nanny the doorkeeper nodded it was clear that any friend of mrs ogg was a friend of his no trouble at all mrs ogg as they passed through into the dusty network of corridors granny reflected not for the first time that nanny had a magic all of her own nanny didnt so much enter places as insinuate herself she had unconsciously taken a natural talent for liking people and developed it into an occult science granny weatherwax did not doubt that her friend already knew the names family histories birthdays and favourite topics of conversation of half the people here and probably also the vital wedge that would cause them to open up it might be talking about their children or a potion for their bad feet or one of nannys really filthy stories but nanny would be in and after twentyfour hours theyd have known her all their lives and theyd tell her things of their own free will nanny got on with people nanny could get a statue to cry on her shoulder and say what it really thought about pigeons it was a knack granny had never had the patience to acquire it just occasionally she wondered whether it might have been a good idea curtain up in an hour and a half said nanny i promised giselle id give her a hand whos giselle she does makeup you dont know how to do makeup i distempered our privy didnt i said nanny and i paint faces on eggs for the kiddies every soul cake tuesday got to do anything else have you said granny sarcastically open the curtains fill in for a ballet dancer whos been taken poorly i did say id help with the drinks at the swarray said nanny letting the irony slide off like water on a redhot stove well a lot of the staff have buggered off cos of the ghost its in the big foyer in half an hour i expect you ought to be there being a patronizer whats a swarray said granny suspiciously its a sort of posh party before the opera what do i have to do drink sherry and make polite conversation said nanny or conversation anyway i saw the grub being done for it theyve even got little cubes of cheese on sticks stuck in a grapefruit and you dont get much posher than that gytha ogg you aint done any special dishes have you no esme said nanny ogg meekly only youve got an imp of mischief in you been far too busy for anything like that said nanny granny nodded then wed better find greebo she said you sure about this esme said nanny we might have a lot to do tonight said granny maybe we could do with an extra pair of hands paws at the moment yes it was walter agnes knew it it wasnt knowledge in her mind exactly it was practically something she breathed she felt it as a tree feels the sun it all fitted he could go anywhere and no one took any notice of walter plinge in a way he was invisible because he was always there and if you were someone like walter plinge wouldnt you long to be someone as debonair and dashing as the ghost if you were someone like agnes nitt wouldnt you long to be someone as dark and mysterious as perdita x dream the traitor thought was there before she could choke it off she added hurriedly but ive never killed anyone because thats what id have to believe isnt it if hes the ghost then hes killed people all the same he does look odd and he talks as if the words are trying to escape a hand touched her shoulder she spun round its only me said christine oh dont you think this is a marvellous dress what this dress silly agnes looked her up and down oh yes very nice she said disinterest lying on her voice like rain on a midnight pavement you dont sound very impressed really perdita theres no need to be jealous im not jealous i was thinking shed only seen the ghost for a moment but he certainly hadnt moved like walter walter walked as though his body were being dragged along by his head but the certainty was as hard as marble now well you dont seem very impressed i must say im wondering if walter plinge is the ghost said agnes and immediately cursed herself or at least pooted she felt embarrassed enough about andrйs reaction christines eyes widened but hes a clown he walks odd and he talks odd said agnes but if he stood up straight christine laughed agnes felt herself getting angry and he practically told me he was you believed him did you christine made a little tutting sound that agnes considered quite offensive really you girls believe the strangest things what do you mean we girls oh you know the dancers are always saying theyve seen the ghost all over the place good grief do you think im some sort of impressionable idiot think for a minute before answering well of course i dont but huh agnes strode off into the wings concerned more with effect than direction the background noise of the stage faded behind her as she stepped into the scenery store it didnt lead anywhere except to a pair of big double doors opening to the world outside it was full of bits of castles balconies and romantic prison cells stacked any old how christine hurried up behind her i really didnt mean look not walter hes just a very odd oddjob man he does all kinds of jobs no one ever knows where he isthey all just assume hes around all right but you dont have to get so worked up there was the faintest of sounds behind them they turned the ghost bowed whos a good boy then nannys got a bowl of fish eggs for a good boy said nanny trying to see under the big dresser in the kitchen fish eggs said granny coldly i borrowed them from the stuff theyve done for the swarray said nanny borrowed said granny thats right come along greebo whos a good boy then borrowed you mean when the cats finished with them youre going to give them back its only a manner of speaking esme said nanny in a hurt little voice its not the same as stealing if you dont mean it come along boy heres some lovely fish eggs for you greebo pulled himself further into the shadows there was a little sigh from christine and she folded up into a faint but she managed agnes noticed sourly to collapse in a way that probably didnt hurt when she hit the ground and which showed off her dress to the best effect it was beginning to dawn on agnes that christine was remarkably clever in some specialized ways she looked back at the mask its all right she said her voice sounding hoarse even to her i know why youre doing it i really do no expression could cross that ivory face but the eyes flickered agnes swallowed the perdita part of her wanted to give in right now because that would be more exciting but she stood her ground you want to be something else and youre stuck with what you are said agnes i know all about that youre lucky all you have to do is put on a mask at least youre the right shape but why did you have to go and kill people why mr pounder couldnt have done you any harm but he poked around in odd places didnt he and he found something the ghost nodded slightly and then held out his ebony cane he grasped both ends and pulled so that a long thin sword slid out i know who you are agnes burst out as he stepped forward i i could probably help you it might not have been your fault she backed away i havent done anything to you you dont have to be afraid of me she backed away further as the figure advanced the eyes in the dark hollows of the mask glinted like tiny jewels im your friend dont you see please walter walter there was far off an answering sound that seemed as loud as thunder and as impossible in the circumstances as a chocolate kettle it was the clank of a bucket handle whats the matter miss perdita nitt the ghost hesitated there was the sound of footsteps irregular footsteps the ghost lowered the sword opened a door in a piece of scenery painted to represent a castle wall bowed ironically and slipped away walter rounded a corner he was an unlikely knight errant for one thing he had on evening dress obviously designed for someone of a different shape he was still wearing his beret he also wore an apron and was carrying a mop and bucket but no heroic lancewielding rescuer ever galloped over a drawbridge more happily he was practically surrounded by a golden glow walter whats the matter with miss christine she er she fainted said agnes er probably yes probably the excitement with the opera tonight yes probably the excitement because of the opera tonight walter gave her a slightly worried look yes he said and added patiently i know where theres a medicine box shall i get it christine groaned and fluttered her eyelashes where am i perdita gritted agness teeth where am i that didnt sound the sort of thing someone said when they woke up from a faint it sounded more like the sort of thing they said because theyd heard it was the sort of thing people said you fainted she said she looked hard at walter why were you in here walter got to mop out the stagehands privy miss nitt always having trouble ive been working on it for months but youre wearing evening dress yes then i got to be a waiter afterwards because were shorthanded and theres no one else to be a waiter when they have drinks and sausages on poles before the opera no one could have moved that fast true walter and the ghost hadnt both been in the room at the same time but shed heard his voice no one could have had time to duck around behind the piles of flats and turn up at the opposite side of the room in seconds unless they were some sort of wizard some of the girls did say the ghost could almost seem to be in two places at once perhaps there were other secret places like the old staircase perhaps he she stopped herself walter plinge wasnt the ghost then there was no sense in trying to find some excitable explanation to prove wrong right shed told christine well christine was giving her just a slightly bemused look as walter helped her up and shed told andrй but he hadnt seemed to believe her so probably that was all right which meant that the ghost was someone else shed been so certain youll enjoy it mother you really will taint for the likes of us henry i dont see why mr morecombe couldnt give you tickets to see nellie stamp at the music hall now thats what i call music proper tunes you can understand songs like she sits among the cabbages and leeks are not very cultural mother two figures wandered through the crowds heading for the opera house this was their conversation s a good laugh though and you dont have to hire suits seems daft to me havin to wear a special suit just to listen to music it enhances the experience said young henry who had read this somewhere i mean how does the music know said his mother now nellie stamp come along mother it was going to be one of those evenings he knew it henry lawsy did his best and given the starting point it wasnt a bad best he was a clerk in the firm of morecombe slant honeyplace a somewhat oldfashioned legal partnership one reason for its lessthanmodern approach was the fact that messrs morecombe and honeyplace were vampires and mr slant was a zombie the three partners were therefore technically dead although this did not prevent them putting in a proper days worknormally during the night in the case of mr morecombe and mr honeyplace from henrys point of view the hours were good and the job was not onerous but he chafed somewhat about his promotion prospects because clearly dead mens shoes were being fully occupied by dead men hed decided that the only way to succeed was to better himself by improving his mind which he tried to do at every opportunity it is probably a full description of henry lawsys mind that if you had given him a book called how to improve your mind in five minutes he would have read it with a stopwatch his progress through life was hampered by his tremendous sense of his own ignorance a disability which affects all too few people mr morecombe had given him two opera tickets as a reward for sorting out a particularly problematical tort hed invited his mother because she represented per cent of all the women he knew people tended to shake henrys hand cautiously in case it came off hed bought a book about the opera and read it carefully because hed heard that it was absolutely unheardof to go to an opera without knowing what it was about and the chance of finding out while you were actually watching it was remote the books reassuring weight was in his pocket right now all he needed to complete the evening was a less embarrassing parent can we get some peanuts before we go in said his mother mother they dont sell peanuts at the opera no peanuts whatre you supposed to do if you dont like the songs greebos suspicious eyes were two glows in the gloom poke him with a broomhandle suggested granny no said nanny with someone like greebo you have to use a little bit of kindness granny closed her eyes and waved a hand there was a yowl from under the kitchens dresser and a soundof frantic scrabbling then his claws scoring tracks in the floor greebo came out backwards fighting all the way mind you a lot of cruelty does the trick as well nanny conceded youve never been much of a cat person have you esme greebo would have hissed at granny except that even his cat brain was just bright enough to realize this was not the best move he could make give him his fish eggs granny said he might as well have them now as later greebo inspected the dish oh this was all right then they wanted to give him food granny nodded at nanny ogg they held out their hands palmup greebo was halfway through the caviar when he felt it happening wrrroowlllll he wailed and then the voice went deeper as his chest expanded and rose physically as his back legs lengthened under him his ears flattened against his head and then crept down the sides llllwwaaaa the jackets a fortyfourinch chest said nanny granny nodded aaaaoooo his face flattened his whiskers spread out greebos nose developed a life of its own oooooss sshit he certainly gets the hang of it quicker these days said nanny you put some clothes on right now my lad said granny who had shut her eyes not that this made much difference she had to admit later greebo fully clothed still managed to communicate the nakedness beneath the insouciant moustache the long sideburns and the tousled black hair combined with the welldeveloped muscles to give the impression of the more louche kind of buccaneer or a romantic poet whod given up on the opium and tried red meat instead he had a scar running across his face and a black patch now where it crossed the eye when he smiled he exuded an easy air of undistilled excitingly dangerous lasciviousness he could swagger while asleep greebo could in fact commit sexual harassment simply by sitting very quietly in the next room except as far as the witches were concerned to granny a cat was a damn cat whatever shape it was and nanny ogg always thought of him as mister fluffy she adjusted the bowtie and stood back critically what do you think she said he looks like an assassin but hell do said granny oh what a nasty thing to say greebo waved his arms experimentally and fumbled with the ebony cane fingers took a bit of getting used to but cat reflexes learned fast nanny waved a finger playfully under his nose he took a halfhearted swipe at it now you just stay with granny and do what she tells you like a good boy she said yess nanny said greebo reluctantly he managed to grip the stick properly and no fighting no nanny and no leaving bits of people on the doormat no nanny well have no trouble like we did with those robbers last month no nanny he looked depressed humans had no fun incredible complications surrounded the most basic activities and no turning back into a cat again until we say yess nanny play your cards right and there could be a kipper in this for you yess nanny whatre we going to call him said granny he cant just be greebo which ive always said was a damn silly name for a cat well he looks aristocratic nanny began he looks like a beautiful brainless bully granny corrected her aristocratic repeated nanny same thing we cant call him greebo anyway well think of something salzella leaned disconsolately against the marble banister of the foyers grand staircase and stared gloomily into his drink it had always seemed to him that one of the major flaws in the whole business of opera was the audience they were quite unsuitable the only ones worse than the ones who didnt know anything at all about music and whose idea of a sensible observation was i liked that bit near the end when her voice went wobbly were the ones who thought they did want a drink do you mister salzella theres lots you know walter plinge ambled by his black suit making him look like a very good class of scarecrow plinge you just say drink sir said the director of music and please take off that ridiculous beret my mum made it for me im sure she did but bucket sidled up to him i thought i told you to keep senor basilica away from the canapes he hissed im sorry i couldnt find a big enough crowbar said salzella waving away walter and his beret anyway isnt he supposed to be communing with his muse in his dressingroom the curtain goes up in twenty minutes he says he sings better on a full stomach then were in for a big treat tonight bucket turned and surveyed the scene its going well anyway he said i suppose so the watch are here you know in secret theyre mingling ah let me guess salzella looked around at the crowds there was indeed a very short man in a suit intended for a rather larger man this was especially the case with the opera cloak which actually trailed on the floor behind him to give the overall impression of a superhero who had spent too much time around the kryptonite he was wearing a deformed fur hat and trying surreptitiously to smoke a cigarette you mean that little man with the words watchman in disguise flashing on and off just above his head where i didnt see that salzella sighed its corporal nobby nobbs he said wearily the only known person to require an identity card to prove his species ive watched him mingle with three large sherries hes not the only one though said mr bucket theyre taking this seriously oh yes said salzella if we look over there for example we see sergeant detritus who is a toll and who is wearing what in the circumstances is actually a rather wellfitting suit it is therefore i feel something of a pity he has neglected to remove his helmet and these you understand the watch has chosen for their ability to blend well theyll certainly be useful if the ghost strikes again said bucket hopelessly the ghost would have to salzella stopped he blinked oh good grief he whispered what has she found bucket turned thats lady esmerelda oh greebo strolled in alongside her with the gentle swagger that makes women thoughtful and mens knuckles go white the buzz of conversation was momentarily hushed and then rose again to a slightly shriller buzz im impressed said salzella he certainly doesnt look like a gentleman said bucket look at the colour of that eye he set his face into what he hoped was a smile and bowed lady esmerelda he said how pleasant to see you again wont you introduce us to your guest this is lord gribeau said granny mr bucket the owner and mr salzella who seems to run the place haha said salzella gribeau snarled revealing longer incisors than any that bucket had seen outside a zoo and bucket had never seen such a greenishyellow eye the pupil was all wrong ahaha he said and may i order you something hell have milk said granny firmly i expect he has to keep up his strength said salzella granny spun around her expression would have etched steel anyone for a drink said nanny ogg appearing out of nowhere with a tray and adroitly stepping between them like a very small peacekeeping force got a bit of everything here including a glass of milk i see said bucket salzella looked from one witch to the other thats remarkably foresighted of you he said well you never know said nanny gribeau took the glass in both hands and lapped at it with his tongue then he looked at salzella what yourrr lookin aat neverrr seem miluk drun beforr never quitelike that i must admit nanny winked at granny weatherwax as she turned to scurry away granny caught her arm remember she whispered when we go into the box you keep an eye on mrs plinge mrs plinge knows something i aint sure whats going to happen but it is going to happen right said nanny she bustled off muttering under her breath oh yes do this do that drink here please maam nanny looked down good grief she said what are you the apparition in the fur hat winked at her im the count de nobbs it said and this here it added indicating a mobile wall is the count de tritus nanny glanced at the troll another count im sure theres unaccountably more counts here than i can count and what can i get you officers she said officers us said the count de nobbs what makes you think were watchmen hes got a helmet on nanny pointed out also hes got his badge pinned to his coat i told you to put it away nobby hissed he looked at nanny and smiled uneasily militry chic he said its just a fashion accessory actually we are gentlemen of means and have nothing to do with the city watch whatsoever well gentlemen would you like some wine not while we on duty yanks said the troll oh yes thank you very much count de tritus said nobby bitterly oh yes very undercover that is why dont you just wave your truncheon around where everyone can see it well if you tink itd help put it away the count de trituss eyebrows met with the effort of thought dat was irony den was it to a superior officer cant be a superior officer can you cos we aint watchmen look commander vimes explained it three times nanny ogg tactfully moved away it was bad enough watching them blow their cover without sucking at it as well this was a new world all right she was used to a life where the men wore the bright clothes and the women wore black it made it a lot easier to decide what to put on in the mornings but inside the opera house the rules of clothing were all in reverse just like the laws of common sense here the women dressed like frosted peacocks and the men looked like penguins so there were coppers here nanny ogg was basically a lawabiding person when she had no reason to break the law and therefore had that kind of persons attitude to lawenforcement officers which was one of deep and permanent distrust there was their approach to theft for example nanny had a witchs view of theft which was a lot more complicated than the attitude adopted by the law and if it came to it people who owned property worth stealing they tended to wield the huge blunt axe of the law in circumstances that required the delicate scalpel of common sense no thought nanny policemen with their great big boots were not required here on a night like this it would be a good idea to put a thumbtack under the ponderous feet of justice she ducked behind a gilt statue and fumbled in the recesses of her clothing while people nearby looked around in puzzlement at the erratic twanging of elastic she was sure she had one around somewhereshed packed it in case of emergencies there was the clink of a small bottle ah yes a moment later nanny ogg emerged decorously with two small glasses on her tray and headed purposefully for the watchmen fruit drink officers she said oh silly me what am i saying i didnt mean officers homemade fruit drink detritus sniffed suspiciously immediately clearing his sinuses whats in it he said apples said nanny ogg promptly well mainly apples under her hand a couple of spilt drops finished eating their way through the metal of the tray and dropped on to the carpet where they smoked the auditorium buzzed with the sound of operagoers settling down and mrs lawsy trying to find her shoes you really shouldnt have taken them off mother my feet are giving me gyp did you bring your knitting i think i mustve left it in the ladies oh mother henry lawsy marked his place in his book and raised his runny eyes heavenward and blinked right above hima long way above himwas a glittering circle of light his mother followed his gaze whats that then i think its a chandelier mother its a pretty big one whats holding it up im sure theyve got special ropes and things mother looks a bit dangerous to my mind im sure its absolutely safe mother what do you know about chandeliers im sure people wouldnt come into the opera house if there was any chance of a chandelier dropping on their heads mother said henry trying to read his book il truccatore the master of disguise il truccatore a mysterious nobleman causes scandal in the city when he woos highborn ladies while disguised as their husbands however laura the new bride of capriccio refuses to give in to his blandishments henry put a bookmark in the book took a smaller book from his pocket and carefully looked up blandishments he was moving in a world he wasnt quite sure of embarrassment lay waiting at every turn and he wasnt going to get caught out over a word henry lived his life in permanent dread of being asked questions later and with the help of his servant wingie he adopts a subterfuge the dictionary came out again for a moment culminating and again in the scene at the famous masked ball at the dukes palace but il truccatore has not reckoned with his old adversary the count de adversaryhenry sighed and reached for his pocket curtain up in five minutes salzella reviewed his troops they consisted of scenebuilders and painters and all those other employees who could be spared for the evening at the end of the line about fifty per cent of walter plinge had managed to stand to attention now you all know your positions said salzella and if you see anything anything at all you are to let me know at once do you understand mr salzella yes walter we mustnt interrupt the opera mr salzella salzella shook his head people will understand im sure show must go on mr salzella walter you will do what youre told someone raised a hand hes got a point though mr salzella salzella rolled his eyes just catch the ghost he said if we can do it without a lot of shouting thats good of course i dont want to stop the show he saw them relax a deep chord rolled out over the stage what the hell was that salzella strode behind the stage and was met by andrй looking excited whats going on we repaired it mr salzella only well he doesnt want to give up the seat the librarian nodded at the director of music salzella knew the orangutan and among the things he knew was that if the librarian wanted to sit somewhere then that was where he sat but he was a firstclass organist salzella had to admit his lunchtime recitals in the great hall of unseen university were extremely popular especially since the universitys organ had every single soundeffect that bloody stupid johnsons inverted genius had been able to contrive no one would have believed before a pair of simian hands had worked on the project that something like doinovs romantic prelude in g could be rescored for whoopee cushion and squashed rabbits theres the overtures said andrй and the ballroom scene at least get him a bowtie said salzella no one can see him mr salzella and he hasnt really got much of a neck we do have standards andrй yes mr salzella since you seem to have been relieved of employment this evening then perhaps you could help us apprehend the ghost certainly mr salzella fetch him a tie then and come with me a little later left to himself the librarian opened his copy of the score and placed it carefully on the stand he reached down under the seat and pulled out a large brown paper bag of peanuts he wasnt entirely sure why andrй having talked him into playing the organ this evening had told the other man that it was because he the librarian wouldnt budge in fact hed got some interesting cataloguing to do and had been looking forward to it instead he seemed to be here for the night although a pound of shelled peanuts was handsome pay by any apes standards the human mind was a deep and abiding mystery and the librarian was glad he didnt have one any more he inspected the bowtie as andrй had foreseen it presented certain problems to someone whod been behind the door when the necks were handed out granny weatherwax stopped in front of box eight and looked around mrs plinge wasnt visible she unlocked the door with what was probably the most expensive key in the world and you behave yourself she said yeess granny moaned greebo no going to the lavatory in the corners no granny granny glared at her escort even in a bowtie even with his fine moustaches waxed he was still a cat you just couldnt trust them to do anything except turn up for meals the inside of the box was rich red plush picked out with gilt decoration it was like a soft little private room there were a couple of fat pillars on either side supporting part of the weight of the balcony above she looked over the edge and noted the drop to the stalls below of course someone could probably climb in from one of the adjacent boxes but thatd be in full view of the audience and would be bound to cause some comment she peeked under the seats she stood on a chair and felt around the ceiling which had gilt stars on it she inspected the carpet minutely she smiled at what she saw shed been prepared to bet that she knew how the ghost got in and now she was certain greebo spat on his hand and tried ineffectually to groom his hair you sit quiet and eat your fish eggs said granny yeess granny and watch the opera its good for you yeess granny evenin mrs phnge said nanny cheerfully aint this excitin the buzz of the audience the air of expectation the blokes in the orchestra findin somewhere to hide the bottles and tryin to remember how to play all the exhilaration an drama of the operatic experience waitin to unfold oh hello mrs ogg said mrs plinge she was polishing glasses in her tiny bar certainly very packed said nanny she looked sidelong at the old woman every seat sold i heard this didnt achieve the expected reaction shall i give you a hand cleaning out box eight she went on oh i cleaned it out last week said mrs plinge she held a glass up to the light yes but i heard her ladyship is very particular said nanny very picky about things what ladyship mr bucket has sold box eight see said nanny she heard a faint tinkle of glass ah mrs plinge appeared at the doorway of her nook but he cant do that its his opera house said nanny watching mrs plinge carefully i suppose he thinks he can its the ghosts box operagoers were appearing along the corridor i shouldnt think hed mind just for one night said nanny ogg the show must go on eh are you all right mrs plinge i think id just better go and she began stepping forward no you have a good sit down and a rest said nanny pressing her back with gentle but irresistible force but i should go and and what mrs plinge said nanny the old woman went pale granny weatherwax could be nasty but then nastiness was always in the window you were aware that it might turn up on the menu sharpness from nanny ogg though was like being bitten by a big friendly dog it was all the worse for being unexpected i daresay you wanted to go and have a word with somebody did you mrs plinge said nanny softly someone who might be a little shocked to find his box full perhaps i reckon i could put a name to that someone mrs plinge now if the old womans hand came up holding a bottle of champagne and then came down hard in an effort to launch the ss gytha ogg on to the seas of unconsciousness the bottle bounced then mrs plinge leapt past and scuttled away her polished little black boots twinkling nanny ogg caught the doorframe and swayed a little while blue and purple fireworks went off behind her eyes but there was dwarf in the ogg ancestry and that meant a skull you could go mining with she stared muzzily at the bottle year of the insulted goat she mumbled s a good year then consciousness gained the upper hand she grinned as she galloped after the retreating figure in mrs plinges place shed have done exactly the same thing except a good deal harder agnes waited with the others for the curtain to go up she was one of the crowd of fifty or so townspeople who would hear enrico basilica sing of his success as a master of disguise it being a vital part of the entire process that while the chorus would listen to expositions of the plot and even sing along they would suffer an instant lapse of memory afterwards so that later unmaskings would come as a surprise for some reason without any word being spoken as many people as possible seemed to have acquired very broadbrimmed hats those who hadnt were taking every opportunity to glance upwards beyond the curtain herr trubelmacher launched the overture enrico who had been chewing a chicken leg carefully put the bone on a plate and nodded the waiting stagehand dashed off the opera had begun mrs plinge reached the bottom of the grand staircase and hung on to the banister panting the opera had started there was no one around and no sounds of pursuit either she straightened up and tried to get her breath back cooee mrs plinge nanny ogg waving the champagne bottle like a club was already travelling at speed when she hit the first turn in the banister but she leaned like a professional and kept her balance as she went into the straight and then tilted again for the next curve which left only the big gilt statue at the bottom it is the fate of all banisters worth sliding down that there is something nasty waiting at the far end but nanny oggs response was superb she swung a leg over as she hurtled downwards and pushed herself off her nailed boots leaving grooves in the marble as she spun to a halt in front of the old woman mrs plinge was lifted off her feet and carried into the shadows behind another statue you dont want to try and outrun me mrs plinge nanny whispered as she clamped a hand firmly over mrs plinges mouth you just want to wait here quietly with me and dont go thinking im nice im only nice compared to esme but so is practicly everyone mmf with one hand tightly around mrs plinges arm and another over her mouth nanny peered round the statue she could hear the singing far off nothing else happened after a while she started to fret perhaps hed taken fright perhaps mrs plinge had left him some sort of signal perhaps hed decided that the world was currently too dangerous for ghosts although nanny doubted he could ever decide that at this rate the first act would be over before a door opened somewhere a lanky figure in a black suit and a ridiculous beret crossed the foyer and went up the stairs at the top they saw it turn in the direction of the boxes and disappear ysee said nanny trying to get the stiffness out of her limbs the thing about esme is shes stupid mmf so she thinks that the most obvious way dysee for the ghost to get in and out of the box is through the door if you cant find a secret panel she reckons its because it aint there a secret panel that aint there is the best kind there is the reason bein no bugger can find it thats where you people all think too operatic see youre all cooped up in this place listening to daft plots what dont make sense and i reckon it does something to your minds people cant find a trapdoor so they say oh deary me what a hidden trapdoor it must be whereas a normal person eg me and esme wed say maybe there aint one then and the best way for the ghost to get around the place without being seen is for him to be seen and not noticed especially if hes got keys people dont notice walter they looks the other way she gently released her grip now i dont blame you mrs plinge cos id do the same for one of mine but youd have done better to trust esme right at the start shell help you if she can nanny let mrs plinge go but kept a grip on the champagne bottle just in case what if she cant said mrs plinge bitterly you think walter did those murders hes a good boy im sure thats the same as a no isnt it theyll put him in prison if he done them murders esme wont let that happen said nanny something sank into mrs plinges not very alert mind what do you mean she wont let that happen she said i mean said nanny that if you throw yourself on esmes mercy you better be damn sure you deserve to bounce oh mrs ogg now dont you worry about anything said nanny perhaps a little late under the circumstances it occurred to her that the immediate future might be a little bit easier on everyone if mrs plinge got some wellearned rest she fumbled in her clothing and produced a bottle halffull of some cloudy orange liquid ill just give you a sip of a little something to calm your nerves what is it its a sort of tonic said nanny she flicked the cork out with her thumb on the ceiling above her the paint crinkled its made from apples well mainly apples walter plinge stopped outside box eight and looked around then he removed his beret and pulled out the mask the beret went into his pocket he straightened up and it looked very much as though walter plinge with the mask on was several inches taller he took a key from his pocket and unlocked the door and the figure that stepped into the box did not move like walter plinge it moved as though every nerve and muscle were under full and athletic control the sounds of the opera filled the box the walls had been lined with red velvet and were hung with curtains the chairs were high and well padded the ghost slipped into one of them and settled down a figure leaned forward out of the other chair and said you carrnt havve my fisssh eggs the ghost leapt up the door clicked behind him granny stepped out from the curtains well well we meet again she said he backed away to the edge of the box i shouldnt think you could jump said granny its a long way down she focused her best stare on the white mask and now mister ghost he sprang back on to the edge of the box saluted granny flamboyantly and leapt upwards granny blinked up until now the stare had always worked too damn dark she muttered greebo the bowl of caviar flew out of his nervous fingers and caused a fortean experience somewhere in the stalls yess granny catch him and there could be a kipper in it for you greebo snarled happily this was more like it opera had begun to pall for him the moment he realized that no one was going to pour a bucket of cold water over the singers he understood chasing things besides he liked to play with his friends agnes saw the movement out of the corner of her eye a figure had jumped out of one of the boxes and was climbing up to the balcony then another figure clambered after it scrambling over the gilt cherubs singers faltered in midnote there was no mistaking the leading figure it was the ghost the librarian was aware that the orchestra had stopped playing somewhere on the other side of the backcloth the singers had stopped too there was a buzz of excited conversation and one or two cries the hairs all over his body began to prickle senses designed to protect his species in the depths of the rainforest had adjusted nicely to the conditions of a big city which was merely drier and had more carnivores he picked up the discarded bowtie and with great deliberation tied it around his forehead so that he looked like a really formal kamikaze warrior then he threw away the opera score and stared blankly into space for a moment he knew instinctively that some situations required musical accompaniment this organ lacked what he considered the most basic of facilities such as the thunder pedal a foot earthquake pipe and a complete keyboard of animal noises but he was certain there was something exciting that could be done in the bass register he stretched out his arms and cracked his knuckles this took some time and then he began to play the ghost danced along the edge of the balcony scattering hats and operaglasses the audience watched in astonishment and then began to clap they couldnt quite see how it fitted into the plot of the operabut this was an opera after all he reached the centre of the balcony trotted a little way up the aisle and then turned and ran down again at speed he reached the edge jumped jumped again soared out into the auditorium and landed on the chandelier which jingled and began to sway gently the audience stood up and applauded as he climbed through the jangling tiers towards the central cable then another shape clambered over the edge of the balcony and loped along in pursuit this was a stockier figure than the first man oneeyed broad in the shoulders and tapering at the waist he looked evil in an interesting kind of way like a pirate who really understood the words jolly roger he didnt even take a run but when he reached the closest part to the chandelier simply launched himself into space it was clear that he wasnt going to make it and then it wasnt clear how he did those watching through operaglasses swore later that the man thrust out an arm which merely seemed to graze the chandelier and yet was then somehow able to swivel his entire body in midair a couple of people swore even harder that just as the man reached out his fingernails appeared to grow by several inches the huge glass mountain swung ponderously on its rope and as it reached the end of the swing greebo swung out further like a trapeze artist there was an appreciative oo from the audience he twisted again the chandelier hesitated for a moment at the extremity of its arc and then swept back again as it jangled and creaked over the stalls the hanging figure swung upwards let go and did a backward somersault that dropped him in the middle of the crystals candles and prisms were scattered over the seats below and then with the audience clapping and cheering he scrambled up the rope after the fleeing ghost henry lawsy tried to move his arm but a fallen crystal had stapled the sleeve of his coat to his armrest it was a quandary he was pretty sure this wasnt supposed to happen but he wasnt certain around him he could hear people hissing questions was that part of the plot im sure it must have been oh yes yes it certainly was said someone further down the row authoritatively yes yes the famous chase scene indeed oh yes they did it in quirm you know ohyes yes of course im sure i heard about it i thought it was bloody good said mrs lawsy mother about time something interesting happened you shouldve told me idve put my glasses on nanny ogg pounded up the back stairs towards the fly loft somethings gone wrong she muttered under her breath as she took the stairs two at a time she reckons shes only got to stare at em and theyre toffee in her hands and then who has to sort it out afterwards eh go on guess the ancient wooden door at the top of the stairs gave way to nanny oggs boot with nanny oggs momentum behind it and cracked open on to a big shadowy space it was full of running figures legs flickered in the light of lanterns people were shouting a figure ran straight towards her nanny sprang into a crouch both thumbs on the cork of the badly shaken champagne bottle she held cradled under one arm this is a magnum she said and im not afraid to drink it the figure stopped oh its you mrs ogg nannys infallible memory for personal details threw up a card peter isnt it she said relaxing the one with the bad feet thats right mrs ogg the powder i give you is working is it theyre a lot better now mrs ogg so whats been happening mr salzella caught the ghost really now that nannys eyes hadmanaged to discern some order in the chaos she could see a cluster of people in the middle of the floor around the chandelier salzella was sitting on the planking his collar was torn and a sleeve had been ripped off his jacket but he had a triumphant look in his eyes he waved something in the air it was white it looked like a piece of a skull it was plinge he said i tell you it was walter plinge why are you all standing around get after him walter said one of the men doubtfully yes walter another man hurried up waving his lantern i saw the ghost heading up to the roof and there was some big oneeyed bastard going after him like a scalded cat thats wrong thought nanny something wrong here to the roof shouted salzella hadnt we better get the flaming torches first flaming torches are not compulsory pitchforks and scythes thats only for vampires how about just one torch get up there now understand the curtains closed there was a smattering of applause which was barely audible above the chatter from the audience the chorus turned to one another was that supposed to happen dust rained down stagehands were scampering across the gantries far above shouts echoed among the ropes and dusty backdrops a stagehand ran across the stage holding a flaming torch here whats going on said a tenor theyve got the ghost hes heading for the roof its walter plinge what walter our walter plinge yes the stagehand ran on in a trail of sparks leaving the yeast of rumour to ferment in the ready dough that was the chorus walter surely not weeelll hes a bit odd isnt he but only this morning he said to me its a nice day mr sidney just like that normal as anything well normal for walter as a matter of fact its always worried me the way his eyes move as though they dont talk to each other and hes always around the place yes but hes the odd job man no argument about that its not walter said agnes they looked at her thats who he said theyre chasing dear i dont know who theyre chasing but walters not the ghost fancy anyone thinking walters the ghost said agnes hotly he wouldnt hurt a fly anyway ive seen hes always struck me as a bit slimy though and they say he goes down into the cellars a lot what for i ask myself lets face it fairs fair hes crazy he doesnt act crazy said agnes well he always looks as though hes about to you must admit im going to see whats happening anyone coming agnes gave up it was a horrible thing to learn but there are times when evidence gets trampled and the hunt is on a hatch flew open the ghost clambered out looked down and slammed the hatch shut there was a yowl from below then he danced across the leads until he reached the gargoyleencrusted parapet black and silver in the moonlight the wind caught at his cloak as he ran along the very edge of the roof and dropped down again near another door and a gargoyle was suddenly no longer a gargoyle but a figure that reached down suddenly and twitched off his mask it was like cutting strings good evening walter said granny as he sagged to his knees hello missus weatherwax mistress granny corrected him now stand up there was a growl further along the roof and then a thump bits of trapdoor rose for a moment against the moonlight its nice up here aint it said granny theres fresh air and stars i thought up or down but theres only rats down below in another swift movement she grabbed walters chin and tilted it just as greebo pulled himself on to the roof with prolonged murder in his heart how does your mind work walter plinge if your house was on fire whats the first thing youd try to take out greebo stalked along the rooftop growling he liked rooftops in general and some of his fondest memories involved them but a trapdoor had just been slammed on his head and he was looking for anything he could disembowel then he recognized the shape of walter plinge as someone who had given him food and standing right next to him the much more unwelcome shape of granny weatherwax who had once caught him digging in her garden and had kicked him in the cucumbers walter said something greebo didnt take much notice of it granny weatherwax said well done a good answer greebo greebo nudged walter heavily in the back want milluk right noaow purr purr granny thrust the mask at the cat in the distance people were running up stairs and shouting you put this on and you stay down real low walter plinge one man in a mask is pretty much like another after all and when they chase you greebo give them a run for their money do it right and there could be yurr i knoaow said greebo despondently taking the mask it was turning out to be a long and busy evening for a kipper someone poked their head out of the stricken trapdoor the light glinted off greebos mask and it had to be said even by granny that he made a good ghost for one thing his morphogenic field was trying to reassert itself his claws could no longer even remotely be thought of as fingernails he spat at the pursuit as they poured up the steps arched his back dramatically on the very edge of the roof and stepped off one storey down he thrust out an arm caught a windowsill and landed on the head of a gargoyle which said oh fank oo ver mush in a reproachful voice the pursuers looked down at him some of them had managed to get hold of flaming torches because sometimes convention is too strong to be lightly denied greebo snarled defiance and dropped again springing from sill to drainpipe to balcony and pausing every now and again for another dramatic pose and another snarl at the pursuers wed better get after him corporal de nobbs said one of them who was staggering along behind wed better get after him by carefully going back down the stairs you mean cos somethin i drank dont want to stay drunk much more runnin and ill be droppin a custard im tellin you the other members of the posse also seemed to be reaching the conclusion that there was no extended future in chasing a man down the sheer wall of a building as one mob they turned and shouting and waving their torches in the air headed back to the stairs the parting crowd revealed nanny ogg holding a pitchfork in one hand and a torch in the other and thrusting them both in the air while muttering rhubarb rhubarb granny walked over and tapped her on the shoulder theyve gone gytha rhuba oh hello esme said nanny lowering the implements of righteous retribution i was just tagging along to see it didnt get out of hand was that greebo i saw just then yes awww bless him said nanny he looked a bit bothered though i hope he doesnt happen to anybody wheres your broomstick said granny its in the cleaners cupboard backstage then ill borrow it and keep an eye on things said granny hey hes my cat i ought to be looking after him nanny began granny stepped aside revealing a huddled shape sitting hugging its knees you look after walter plinge she said its something youd be better at than me hello mrs ogg said walter mournfully nanny looked at him for a moment so he is the yes you mean he really did do the mur what do you think said granny well if it comes to it i think he didnt said nanny can i have a word in your ear esme i dont reckon i should say this in front of young walter the witches bent their heads together there was a brief whispered conversation everything is simple when you know the answer said granny ill be back soon she hurried off nanny heard her shoes clattering on the stairs nanny looked down at walter again and held out her hand up you get walter yes mrs ogg i expect wed better find somewhere for you to lie low eh i know a hidden place mrs ogg you do do you walter lurched across the roof towards another trapdoor and pointed to it proudly that said nanny that doesnt look very hidden tome walter walter gave it a puzzled look and then grinned in the way a scientist might after hed solved a particularly difficult equation its hidden where everyone can see it mrs ogg nanny gave him a sharp look but there was nothing but a slightly glazed innocence in walters eyes he lifted up the trapdoor and pointed politely downwards you go down the ladder first so i will not see your drawers very kind of you said nanny it was the first time anyone had ever said anything like that to her the man waited patiently until she had reached the bottom of the ladder and then climbed laboriously down after her this is just an old staircase isnt it said nanny prodding at the darkness with her torch yes it goes all the way down except at the bottom where it goes all the way up anyone else know about it the ghost mrs ogg said walter climbing down oh yes said nanny slowly and wheres the ghost now walter he ran away she held up the torch there was still nothing to be read in walters expression what does the ghost do here walter he watches over the opera thats very kind of him im sure nanny started downwards and as the shadows danced around her she heard walter say you know she asked me a very silly question mrs ogg it was a silly question any fool knows the answer oh yes said nanny peering at the walls about houses on fire i expect yes what would i take out of our house if it was on fire i expect you were a good boy and said youd take your mum said nanny no my mum would take herself nanny ran her hands over the nearest wall doors had been nailed shut when the staircase had been abandoned someone walking up and down here with a keen pair of ears could hear a lot of things what would you take out then walter she said the fire nanny stared unseeing at the wall and then her face slowly broke into a grin youre daft walter plinge she said daft as a broom mrs ogg said walter cheerfully but you aint insane she thought youre daft but youre sane thats what esme would say and theres worser things greebo pounded along broadway he was suddenly not feeling very well muscles were twitching in odd ways a tingling at the base of his spine indicated that his tail wanted to grow and his ears definitely wanted to creep up the sides of his head which is always embarrassing when it happens in company in this case the company was about a hundred yards behind and apparently intent on moving his ears quite a long way from their current position embarrassment or not it was gaining too greebo normally had a famous turn of speed but not when his knees were trying to reverse direction every few seconds his normal plan when pursued was to jump on to the waterbutt behind nanny oggs cottage and rake the pursuer across the nose with his claws when it came around the corner since this would now involve a fivehundredmile dash an alternative had to be sought there was a coach waiting outside one of the houses he lurched over to it pulled himself up grabbed the reins and briefly turned his attention to the driver get orffl greebos teeth shone in the moonlight the coachman with great presence of mind and urgent absence of body somersaulted backwards into the night the horses reared and tried to break into a gallop from a standing start animals are less capable of being fooled than are humans they knew that what they had behind them was a very large cat and the fact that it was manshaped didnt make them any happier the coach lumbered off greebo looked over his twitching shoulder at the torch lit crowd and waved a paw derisively the effect pleased him so much that he clambered on to the roof of the swaying coach and continued to jeer it is a catlike attribute to spit defiance at the enemy from a place of safety in the circumstances it would have been better if catlike attributes had included the ability to steer a wheel hit the parapet of the brass bridge and scraped along it the iron rim kicking up sparks the shock knocked greebo from his perch in midgesture he landed on his feet in the middle of the road while the terrified horses continued on with the coach rocking dangerously from side to side the pursuers stopped whats he doing now hes just standing there theres only one of him and theres lots of us right we could easily overpower him good idea on the count of three well all rush him right one two threepause you didnt run well nor did you yes but i was the one saying one two three remember what he did to mr pounder yes well i never liked the man all that much greebo snarled ticklish things were happening to his body he threw his head back and roared look at worst hed only be able to get one or two of us oh thats good is it here whys he twisting around like that maybe he hurt himself falling off the coach lets gethim the mob closed in greebo struggling against a morphogenic field swinging wildly between species punched the first man in the face with a hand and clawed the shirt off another man with something more like a giant paw oh shiiiooooo twenty hands grabbed him and then in the melee and the darkness twenty hands were holding just cloth and emptiness vengeful boots connected with nothing more than air clubs that had been swung at a snarling face whirled through empty space and returned to hit their owner on the ear ooooaaawwwwl quite unnoticed in the scrum a flateared bullet of grey fur shot out from between the scuffling legs the kicking and punching stopped only when it became apparent that all the mob was attacking was itself and since the iq of a mob is the iq of its most stupid member divided by the number of mobsters it was never very clear to anyone what had happened obviously theyd closed in on the ghost and he certainly couldnt have escaped all that was left was a mask and some torn clothing so the mob reasoned he must have ended up in the river and good riddance too happy in the knowledge of a job well done they adjourned to the nearest pub this left sergeant count de tritus and corporal the count de nobby nobbs who lurched to the middle of the bridge and regarded the few scraps of cloth commander vimes isntisnt isnt goin to like dis said detritus you know he likes prisoners to be alive yeah but this one wouldve been hung anyway said nobby who was trying to stand upright this way was just a bit more democratic a great saving in terms of rope not to mention wear and tear on locks and keys detritus scratched his head shouldnt there be some blood he ventured nobby gave him a sour look he couldntve got away he said so dont go asking questions like that only if humans is hit hard enough they leaks all over der place said detritus nobby sighed that was the calibre of people you got in the watch these days they had to make a mystery of things in days gone by when it had been just the old gang and an unofficial policy of lazy fair theyd have said a heartfelt well done lads to the vigilantes and turned in early but now old vimes had been promoted to commander he seemed to be enrolling people who asked questions all the time it was even affecting detritus considered by other trolls to be as dim as a dead glowworm detritus reached down and picked up an eye patch what dyou think then said nobby scornfully you think he turned into a bat and flew away ha i do not tink that cos it is in consist ent with modern policing said detritus well i think said nobby that when you have ruled out the impossible what is left however improbable aint worth hanging around on a cold night wonderin about when you could be getting on the outside of a big drink come on i want to try a leg of the elephant that bit me was dat irony that was metaphor detritus uneasy in what was technically his mind prodded at the torn pieces of clothing something brushed against his leg it was a cat it had tattered ears one good eye and a face like a fist with fur on it hello little cat said detritus the cat stretched and grinned gerrt lorssst coppuurrrr detritus blinked there are no such things as troll cats and detritus had never seen a cat before hed arrived in ankhmorpork and discovered that they were very very hard to eat and hed never heard of them talking on the other hand he was very much aware of his reputation as the most stupid person in the city and he wasnt going to draw attention to a talking cat if it were going to turn out that everybody except him knew that they talked all the time in the gutter a few feet away there was something white he picked it up carefully it looked like the mask the ghost had worn this was probably a clue he waved it urgently hey nobby thank you something dipped through the darkness snatched the mask from the trolls hand and soared into the night corporal nobbs turned around yes he said er how big are birds normally oh blimey i dunno some are small some are big who cares detritus sucked his finger oh no reason he said i am far too smart to be taken in by perfecly normal tings something squelched underfoot its pretty damp down here walter said nanny and the air was stale and heavy and seemed to be squeezing the light from the torch there was a dark edge to the flame not far now mrs ogg keys jingled in the darkness and some hinges creaked i found this mrs ogg its the ghosts secret cave secret cave eh you got to shut your eyes you got to shut your eyes said walter urgently nanny did so but to her shame kept a grip on the torch just in case she said and is the ghost in there walter no there was the rattle of a matchbox and some scuffling and then you can open them now mrs ogg nanny did so colour and light blurred and then swam into focus first in her eyes and then eventually in her brain oh my she murmured oh my my there were candles the big flat ones used to illuminate the stage floating in shallow bowls the light they gave was soft and it rippled over the room like the soul of water it glinted off the beak of a huge swan it glittered in the eye of a vast sagging dragon nanny ogg turned slowly her experience of opera had not been a lengthy one but witches pick things up quickly and there was the winged helmet worn by hildabrun in the ring of the nibelungingung and here was the striped pole from the barber of pseudopolis and there was the pantomime horse with the humorous trapdoor from the enchanted piccolo and here here was opera all piled in a heap once the eye had taken it all in it had time to notice the peeling paint and rotting plaster and the general air of gentle mouldering the decrepit props and threadbare costumes had been dumped in here because people didnt want them anywhere else but someone did want them here after the eye had seen the ruin then there was time for it to see the little patches of recent repair the careful areas of fresh paint there was something like a desk in the tiny area of floor not occupied by the props and then nanny realized that it had a keyboard and a stool and there were neat piles of paper on top of it walter was watching her with a big proud grin nanny ambled over to the thing its a harmonium aint it a tiny organ thats right mrs ogg nanny picked up one of the sheaves of paper her lips moved as she read the meticulous copperplate writing an opera about cats she said never heard of an opera about cats she thought for a moment and then added to herself but why not its a damn good idea the lives of cats are just like operas when you come to think about it she leafed through the other piles guys and trolls hubwards side story miserable les whos he seven dwarfs for seven other dwarfs whatre all these walter she sat down on the stool and pressed a few of the cracked yellow keys which moved with an audible creak there were a couple of large pedals under the harmonium you pedalled these and that worked the bellows and these spongy keys produced something which was to organ music what poot was to cursing so this was where wal where the ghost sat thought nanny down under the stage among the discarded wreckage of old performances down under the huge windowless room where night after night music and songs and rampant emotion echoed back and forth and never escaped or entirely died away the ghost worked down here with a mind as open as a well and it filled up with opera opera went in at the ears and something else came out of the mind nanny pumped the pedals a few times air hissed from inefficient seams she tried a few notes they were reedy but she considered sometimes the old lie was true and size really did not matter it really was what you did with it that counted walter watched her expectantly she took down another wad of paper and peered at the first page but walter leaned over and snatched at the script that ones not finished mrs ogg the opera house was still in uproar half the audience had gone outside and the other half was hanging around in case further interesting events were going to transpire the orchestra was in a huddle in the pit preparing its request for a special being upset by a ghost allowance the curtains were closed some of the chorus had stayed on stage others had hurried off to take part in the chase the air had the excited electric feel it gets when normal civilized life is temporarily shortcircuited agnes bounced frantically from rumour to rumour the ghost had been caught and it was walter plinge the ghost had been caught by walter plinge the ghost had been caught by someone else the ghost had escaped the ghost was dead there were arguments breaking out everywhere i still cant believe it was walter i mean good grief walter what about the show we cant just stop you never stop the show not even if someone dies oh we have stopped when people died yes but only as long as it took to get the body offstage agnes stepped back into the wings and trod on something sorry she said automatically it was only my foot said granny weatherwax so how is life in the big city agnes nitt agnes turned oh hello granny she mumbled and im not agnes here thank you she added a shade more defiantly its a good job is it bein someone elses voice im doing what i want to do said agnes she drew herself up to her full width and you cant stop me but you aint part of it are you said granny conversationally you try but you always find yourself watchin yourself watchin people eh never quite believin anything thinkin the wrong thoughts shut up ah thought so i have no intention of becoming a witch thank you very much now dont go getting upset just because you know its going to happen a witch youre going to be because a witch you are and if you turn your back on him now then i dont know whats going to happen to walter plinge hes not dead no agnes hesitated i knew he was the ghost she began but then i saw he couldnt be ah said granny believed the evidence of your own eyes did you in a place like this one of the stagehands just told me they chased him up on to the roof and then down into the street and beat him to death oh well said granny youll never get anywhere if you believe what you hear what do you know what do you mean what do i know dont try cleverness on me miss agnes looked at grannys expression and knew when to fold i know hes the ghost she said right but i can see that he isnt yes and i know im pretty sure he doesnt mean any harm good well done walter might not know his right from his left but he does know his right from his wrong granny rubbed her hands together well were already home and looking for a clean towel eh what you havent solved anything course we have we know that it wasnt walter what done the murders so now we just have to find out who it was easy wheres walter now nannys got him somewhere shes all by herself i told you shes got walter i meant well hes a bit strange only where it shows agnes sighed and started to say that it wasnt her problem and realized it was useless even to try the knowledge sat like a smug intruder in her mind whatever it was it was her problem all right she said ill help you if i can because im here but afterwards thats it afterwards youll leave me alone promise certainly well all right then agnes stopped oh no she said that was too easy i dont trust you dont trust me said granny youre saying you dont trust me yes i dont youll find a way to wriggle around it i never wriggle said granny its nanny ogg who thinks we ought to have a third witch i reckon lifes difficult enough without some girl cluttering up the place just because she thinks she looks good in a pointy hat there was a pause then agnes said im not falling for that one either its where you say im too stupid to be a witch and i say oh no im not and you end up winning again id rather be someone elses voice than some old witch with no friends and having everyone frightened of me and being nothing more than just a bit cleverer than other people and not doing any real magic at all granny put her head on one side seems to me youre so sharp you might cut yourself she said all right when its all over ill let you go your own way i wont stop you now show me the way to mr buckets office nanny smiled her jollywrinkledoldapple smile now you just hand it over walter she said no harm in letting me see it is there not old nanny cant see it till its finished well now said nanny hating herself for dropping the atom bomb im sure your main wouldnt want to hear that youve been a bad boy would she expressions floated over walters waxen features as he struggled with several ideas at once finally without a word he thrust the bundle at her his arms trembling with tension theres a good boy said nanny she glanced at the first few pages and then moved them nearer to the light hmm she treadled the harmonium for a while and played a few notes with her left hand they represented most of the musical notes she knew how to read it was a very simple little theme such as might be picked out on the keyboard with one finger hey her lips moved as she read the narrative well now walter she said isnt this a sort of opera about a ghost who lives in an opera house she turned a page very smart and debonair he is hes got a secret cave i see she played another short riff catchy music too she read on occasionally saying things like well well and lawks every now and again shed give walter an appraising look i wonder why the ghost wrote this walter she said after a while quiet sort of chap aint he put it all into his music walter stared at his feet theres going to be a lot of trouble mrs ogg oh me and granny will sort it all out said nanny its wrong to tell lies said walter probably said nanny whod never let it worry her up to now it wouldnt be right for our mum to lose her job mrs ogg it wouldnt be right no the feeling drifted over nanny that walter was trying to put across some sort of message er what sort of lies would it be wrong to tell walter walters eyes bulged lies about things you see mrs ogg even if you did see them nanny thought it was probably time to present the oggish point of view its all right to tell lies if you dont think lies she said he said our mum would lose her job and id be locked up if i said mrs ogg did he which he was he the ghost mrs ogg i reckon granny ought to have a good look at you walter said nanny i reckon your minds all tangled up like a ball of string whats been dropped she pedalled the harmonium thoughtfully was it the ghost that wrote all this music walter its wrong to tell lies about the room with the sacks in it mrs ogg ah thought nanny thatd be down here would it he said i wasnt to tell anyone who did the ghost mrs ogg but youre nanny began and then tried another way ah but i aint anyone she said anyway if you was to go to this room with the sacks and i was to follow you that wouldnt be telling anyone would it it wouldnt be your fault if some ole woman followed you would it walters face was an agony of indecision but erratic though his thinking might have been it was no match for nanny oggs meretricious duplicity he was up against a mind that regarded truth as a reference point but certainly not as a shackle nanny ogg could think her way through a corkscrew in a tornado without touching the sides anyway its all right if its me she added for good measure in fact he probly meant to say except for mrs ogg only he forgot slowly walter reached out and picked up a candle without saying a word he walked out of the door and into the damp darkness of the cellars nanny ogg followed him her boots making squelching noises in the mud it didnt seem like much of a distance as far as nanny could work out they were no longer under the opera house but it was hard to be sure their shadows danced around them and they walked through other rooms even more dark and dripping than the ones theyd been in walter stopped in front of a pile of timber that glistened with rot and pulled a few of the spongy planks aside there were some sacks neatly piled nanny kicked one and it broke in the flickering candlelight all that she could really see were sparkles of light as the cascade poured out but there was no mistaking the gentle metallic scraping of lots of money lots and lots of money enough money to suggest very clearly that it belonged to either a thief or a publisher and there didnt seem to be any books around whats this walter its the ghosts money mrs ogg there was a square hole in the opposite corner of the room water glinted a few inches below beside the hole were half a dozen containers of various sortsold biscuit tins broken bowls and the like there was a stick or possibly a dead shrub in each one and those walter what are those rose bushes mrs ogg down here but nothing could gr nanny stopped she squelched over to the pots theyd been filled with muck scraped from the floor the dead stems glistened with slime nothing could grow down here of course there was no light everything that grew needed something else to feed on andshe moved the candle closer and sniffed the fragrance yes it was subtle but it was there roses in darkness well my word walter plinge she said always one for the surprises you are books were piled on mr buckets desk what youre doing is wrong granny weatherwax said agnes from the doorway granny glanced up wrong as living other peoples lives for them she said s matter of fact theres something even worse than that which is living other peoples lives for yourself that kind of wrong agnes said nothing granny weatherwax couldnt know granny turned back to the books anyway this only looks wrong appearances is deceivin you just pay attention to watching the corridor madam she riffled through the bits of torn envelope and scribbled notes that seemed to be the opera houses equivalent of proper accounts it was a mess in fact it was more than a mess it was far too much of a mess to be a real mess because a real mess has occasional bits of coherence bits of what might be called random order rather it was the kind of erratic mess that suggested that someone had set out to be messy take the account books they were full of tiny rows and columns but someone hadnt thought it worthwhile to invest in lined paper and had handwriting that wandered a bit there were forty rows on the lefthand side but only thirtysix by the time they reached the other side of the page it was hard to spot because of the way your eyes watered what are you doing said agnes tearing her gaze away from the corridor amazin said granny some things is entered twice and i reckon theres a page here where someones added the month and taken away the time of day i thought you didnt like books said agnes i dont said granny turning a page they can look you right in the face and still lie how many fiddle players are there in the band i think there are nine violinists in the orchestra the correction appeared to pass unnoticed well theres a thing said granny without moving her head seems that twelve of em are drawing wages but three of em is over the page so you mightnt notice she looked up and rubbed her hands happily unless youve got a good memory that is she ran a skinny finger down another erratic column whats a flying ratchet i dont know says here repairs to flying ratchet new springs for rotation cog assembly and making good hundred and sixty dollars and sixtythree pence hah she licked her finger and tried another page even nanny aint this bad at numbers she said to be this bad at numbers youve got to be good hah no wonder this place never makes any money you might as well try to fill a sieve agnes darted into the room theres someone coming granny got up and blew out the lamp you get behind the curtains she commanded whatre you going to do oh ill just have to make myself inconspicuous agnes hurried across to the big window and turned to look at granny who was standing by the fireplace the old witch faded she didnt disappear she merely slid into the background an arm gradually became part of the mantelpiece a fold of her dress was a piece of shadow an elbow became the top of the chair behind her her face became one with a vase of faded flowers she was still there like the old woman in the puzzle picture they sometimes printed in the almanack where you could see the old woman or the young girl but not both at once because one was made of the shadows of the other granny weatherwax was standing by the fireplace but you could see her only if you knew she was there agnes blinked and there were just the shadows the chair and the fire the door opened she ducked behind the curtains feeling as conspicuous as a strawberry in a stew certain that the sound of her heart would give her away the door shut carefully with barely a click footsteps crossed the floor a wooden scraping noise might have been a chair being moved slightly a scratch and a hiss were the sound of a match striking a clink was the glass of the lamp being lifted all noise ceased agnes crouched every muscle suddenly screaming with the strain the lamp hadnt been litshed have seen the light around the curtain someone out there was making no noise someone out there was suddenly suspicious a floorboard squeaked verrrry slowwwly as someone shifted their weight she felt as if she was going to scream or burst with the effort of silence the handle of the window behind her a mere point of pressure a moment ago was trying seriously to become part of her life her mouth was so dry that she knew itd creak like a hinge if she dared to swallow it couldnt be anyone who had a right to be here people who had a right to be in places walked around noisily the handle was getting really personal try to think of something else the curtain moved someone was standing on the other side of it if her throat werent so arid she might be able to scream she could feel the presence through the cloth any moment now someone was going to twitch the curtain aside she leapt or as close to a leap as was feasibleit was a kind of vertical lumber billowing the curtain aside colliding with a slim body behind it and ending on the floor in a tangle of limbs and ripping velvet she gulped air and pressed down on the squirming bundle below her ill scream she said and if i do your eardrums will come down your nose the writhing stopped perdifa said a muffled voice above her the curtainrail sagged at one end and the brass rings one at a time spun towards the floor nanny went back to the sacks each one bulged with round hard shapes that clinked gently under her questing finger this is a lot of money walter she said carefully yes mrs ogg nanny lost track of money fairly easily although this didnt mean the subject didnt interest her it was just that beyond a certain point it became dreamlike all she could be sure of was that the amount in front of her would make anyones drawers drop i suppose she said that if i was to ask you how itd got here youd say it was the ghost yes like the roses yes mrs ogg she gave him a worried look youll be all right down here will you she said youll sit quiet i reckon i need to talk to some people wheres my mum mrs ogg shes having a nice sleep walter walter seemed satisfied with this youll sit quiet in your in that room will you yes mrs ogg theres a good boy she glanced at the moneybags again money was trouble agnes sat back andrй raised himself on his elbows and pulled the curtain off his face what the hell were you doing there he said i was what do you mean what was i doing there you were creeping around you were hiding behind the curtain said andrй getting to his feet and fumbling for the matches again next time you blow out a lamp remember itll still be warm we were on important business the lamp glowed andrй turned we he said agnes nodded and looked across at granny the witch hadnt moved although it took a deliberate effort of will to focus on her among the shapes and shadows andrй picked up the lamp and stepped forward the shadows shifted well he said agnes strode across the room and waved a hand in the air there was the chair back there was the vase there was nothing else but she was there a ghost eh said andrй sarcastically agnes backed away there is something about the light of a lamp held lower than someones face the shadows are wrong they fall into unfortunate places teeth seem more prominent agnes came to realize that she was alone in a room in suspicious circumstances with a man whose face suddenly looked a lot more unpleasant than it had before i suggest he said that you get back to the stage right now yes that would be the very best thing you could do and dont meddle in things that dont concern you youve done too much as it is the fear hadnt drained out of agnes but it had found a space in which to metamorphose into anger i dont have to put up with that for all i know you might be the ghost really i was told that walter plinge was the ghost said andrй how many people did you tell and now it turns out that hes dead no hes not it was out before she could stop it shed said it merely to wipe the sneer off his face this happened but the expression that replaced it was no improvement a floorboard creaked they both turned there was a hatstand in the corner next to a bookcase there were a few coats and scarves hanging from it it was surely only the way that the shadows fell that made it look from this angle like an old woman or damn floors said granny fading into the foreground she stepped away from the coats as agnes said later it wasnt as though shed been invisible shed simply become part of the scenery until she put herself forward again she was there but not there she didnt stand out at all she was as unnoticeable as the very best of butlers how did you get in said andrй i looked all round the room seein is believin said granny calmly of course the trouble is that believin is also seein and theres been too much of that round here lately now i know you aint the ghost so what are you to be sneaking around in places where you shouldnt be i could ask you the same quest me im a witch and im pretty good at it shes er from lancre where i come from agnes mumbled trying to look at her feet oh not the one who wrote the book said andrй ive heard people talking about no im much worse than her understand she is mumbled agnes andrй gave granny a long look like a man weighing up his chances he must have decided that they were bobbing along the ceiling i hang around in dark places looking for trouble he said really theres a nasty name for people like that snapped granny yes said andrй its policeman nanny ogg climbed out of the cellars rubbing her chin thoughtfully musicians and singers were still milling around uncertain about what was going to happen next the ghost had had the decency to be chased and killed during the interval in theory that meant there was no reason why there shouldnt be a third act as soon as herr trubelmacher had scoured the nearby pubs and dragged the orchestra back the show must go on yes she thought it has to go on its like the buildup to a thunderstorm no its more like making love yes that was a far more oggish metaphor you put everything youve got into it so sooner or later theres a point where its got to go on because you cant imagine stopping the stage manager could dock a couple of dollars from their wages and theyd still go on and everyone knew it and they would still go on she reached a ladder and climbed slowly into the flies she hadnt been certain she needed to be certain now the fly loft was empty she walked carefully along the catwalk until she was over the auditorium the buzz of the audience came through the ceiling beneath her slightly muffled light shone up at the point where the thick cable for the chandelier disappeared into the hole she stepped out over the creaking trapdoor and peered down terrific heat almost frizzled her hair a few yards below her hundreds of candles were burning dreadful if that lot fell down she said quietly i spect this placed go up like a haystack she let her gaze travel up and upthe cable to the point at just about waistheight where it was halfcut through youd never see it if you werent expecting to find it then her gaze dropped again and moved across the gloomy dusty floor until it found something halfhidden in the dust behind her a shadow among the shadows rose to its feet balanced itself carefully and started to run i knows about policemen said granny theyve got big helmets and big feet and you can see them a mile off theres a couple lurching around backstage anyone can see theyre policemen you dont look like one she turned the badge over and over in her hands i aint happy with the idea of secret policemen she said why do you need secret policemen because said andrй sometimes you have secret criminals granny almost smiled thats a fact she said she peered at the small engraving on the back of the badge says here cable street particulars there arent many of us said andrй weve only just started commander vimes said that since we cant do anything about the thieves guild and the assassins guild wed better look for other crimes hidden crimes that need watchmen with different skills and i can play the piano quite well what kind of skills have that troll and that dwarf got said granny seems to me the only thing theyre really good at is standing around looking obvious and stupihah yes right and they didnt even need much training said andrй commander vimes says theyre the most obvious policemen anyone could think of incidentally corporal nobbs has got some papers to prove hes a human being forged i dont think so granny weatherwax put her head on one side if your house was on fire whats the first thing youd take out of it oh granny agnes began hmm who set fire to it said andrй youre a policeman right enough granny handed him his badge you come to arrest poor walter she said i know he didnt murder dr undershaft i was watching him he was trying to unblock the privies all afternoon ive had proof that walter isnt the ghost said agnes i was almost sure it was salzella said andrй i know he creeps off to the cellars sometimes and im sure hes stealing money but the ghost has been seen when salzella is perfectly visible so now i think think think said granny someone thinking around here at last howd you recognize the ghost mister policeman well hes got a mask on really now say it again and listen to what you say good grief you can recognize him because hes got a mask on you recognize him because you dont know who he is life isnt neat whoever said theres only one ghost the figure ran through the shadows of the fly loft cloak billowing around it nanny ogg was outlined against the light peering down she said without turning her head hello mr ghost come back for your saw have you then she darted around behind the cable until she faced the shadow millions of people knows im up here you wouldnt hurt a little old lady would you oh dear me poor old heart she keeled over backwards hitting the floor hard enough to make the cable swing the figure hesitated then it took a length of thin rope from a pocket and advanced cautiously towards the fallen witch it knelt down wound an end of the rope around each hand and leaned forward nannys knee came up sharply feels a lot better now mister she said as he reared backwards she scrambled up again and grabbed the saw come back to finish it eh she said waving the implement in the air wonder how youd blame that on walter make you happy would it the whole place burning down the figure moving awkwardly backed away as she advanced then it turned lurched along the wobbling catwalk and disappeared into the gloom nanny pounded after him and saw the figure climbing down a ladder she looked around quickly grabbed a rope to slide after him and heard a pulley somewhere above start to clatter she descended skirts billowing around her when she was about halfway down a bunch of sandbags went upwards past her in a hurry as she rattled onwards she saw between her boots someone struggling with the trapdoor to the cellars she landed a few feet away still holding the rope mr salzella nanny stuck two fingers in her mouth and let out a whistle that could have melted earwax she let go of the rope salzella glanced up at her as he raised the trapdoor and then saw the shape dropping out of the roof one hundred and eighty pounds of sandbag hit the door slamming it shut watch out said nanny cheerfully bucket waited nervously in the wings unnecessarily nervously of course the ghost was dead there couldnt be anything to worry about people said theyd seen him killed although they were bucket had to admit a bit hazy on the actual details nothing to worry about not a thing nothing whatsoever in any way everything was absolutely nothing to worry about in any way he ran a finger around the inside of his collar it hadnt been such a bad life in wholesale cheese the most you had to worry about was ogle of poor old reg plentys trouser buttons in the farmhouse nutty and the time young weevins minced his thumb in the stirring machine and it was only by luck they happened to be doing strawberry yoghurt at the time a figure loomed up beside him he clutched at a curtain for support and then turned to see with relief the majestic and reassuring stomach of enrico basilica the tenor looked magnificent in a huge cockerel costume complete with giant beak wattles and comb ah senor bucket burbled very impressive may i say si said a muffed voice from somewhere behind the beak as other members of the company hurried past on to the stage may i say how sorry i am about all that business earlier i can assure you that it doesnt happen every night ahahah si probably just high spirits ahaha the beak turned towards him bucket backed away si yes well im glad youre so understanding temperamental he thought as the tenor strode on to the stage and the overture to act three drifted to its close theyre like that the real artistes nerves stretched like rubber bands i expect its just like waiting for the cheese really you can get really edgy waiting to see whether youve got half a ton of best bluevein or just a vat full of pig food its probably like that when youve got an aria working its way up whered he go whered he go what oh mrs ogg the old woman waved a saw in front of his face it was not in mr buckets current state of mental tension a helpful gesture he was suddenly surrounded by other figures equally conducive to multiple exclamation marks perdita why arent you on stage oh lady esmerelda i didnt see you there of course if you want to come backstage you only have to wheres salzella said andrй bucket looked around vaguely he was here a few minutes ago that is he said pulling himself together mr salzella is probably attending to his duties somewhere which young man is more than i can say for i demand you stop the show now said andrй oh you do do you and by what authority may i ask hes been sawing through the rope said nanny andrй pulled out a badge this bucket looked closely ankhmorpork guild of musicians member z andrй glared at him then at the badge and started to pat his pockets urgently no blast i know i had the other one a moment ago look youve got to clear the theatre weve got to search it and that means dont stop the show said granny i wont stop the show said bucket cos i reckon hed like to see the show stopped the show must go on eh isnt that what you believe could he have got out of the building i sent corporal nobbs to the stagedoor and sergeant detritus is in the foyer said andrй when it comes to standing in doorways theyre among the best excuse me whats happening said bucket he could be anywhere said agnes therere hundreds of hidingplaces who said bucket how about these cellars everyone talks about said granny where theres only one entrance said andrй hes not stupid he cant get into the cellars said nanny he ran off probably in a cupboard somewhere by now no hell stay where theres crowds said granny thats what id do what said bucket could he have got into the audience from here said nanny who said bucket granny jerked a thumb towards the stage hes somewhere on there i can feel him then well wait until he comes off eighty people coming off stage all at once said agnes dont you know what its like when the curtain goes down and we dont want to stop the show granny mused no we dont want to stop the show said bucket grasping at a familiar idea as it swept by on a tide of incomprehensibility or give people their money back in any fashion whatsoever what are we talking about does anyone know the show must go on murmured granny weatherwax still staring out of the wings things have to end right this is an opera house they should end operatically nanny ogg hopped up and down excitedly oo i know what youre thinking esme she squeaked oo yes can we just sos i can say i done it eh can we go on lets henry lawsy peered closely at his opera notes he had not of course fully understood the events of the first two acts but knew that this was perfectly ok because one would have to be quite naive to expect good sense as well as good songs anyway it would all be explained in the last act which was the masked ball in the dukes palace it would almost certainly turn out that the woman one of the men had been rather daringly courting would be his own wife but so cunningly disguised by a very small mask that her husband wouldnt have spotted that she wore the same clothes and had the same hairstyle someones serving man would turn out to be someone elses daughter in disguise someone would die of something that didnt prevent them from singing about it for several minutes and the plot would be resolved by some coincidences which in real life would be as likely as a cardboard hammer he didnt know any of this for a fact he was making a calculated guess in the meantime act three opened with the traditional ballet this time apparently a country dance by the maidens of the court henry was aware of muffled laughter around him this was because if you ran an eye at headheight along the row of ballerinas as they tripped arm in arm on to the stage there was an apparent gap this was only filled if the gaze went downwards a foot or two to a small fat ballerina in a huge grin an overstretched tutu long white drawers and boots henry stared they were big boots they moved back and forth at an astonishing speed the satin slippers of the other dancers twinkled as they drifted across the floor but the boots flashed and clattered like a tap dancer afraid of falling into the sink the pirouettes were novel too while the other dancers whirled like snowflakes the little fat one spun like a top and moved across the floor like one too bits of her anatomy trying to achieve local orbit around henry members of the audience were whispering to one another oh yes he heard someone declare they tried this in pseudopolis his mother nudged him this supposed to happen er i dont think so s bloody good though a good laugh as the fat ballerina collided with a donkey in evening dress she staggered and grabbed at his mask which came off herr trubelmacher the conductor froze in horror and astonishment around him the orchestra rattled to a standstill except for the tuba player oombahoombahoombah who had memorized his score years ago and never took much interest in current affairs two figures rose up right in front of trubelmacher a hand grabbed his baton sorry sir said andrй but the show must go on yes he handed the stick to the other figure there you are he said and dont let them stop ook the librarian carefully lifted herr trubelmacher aside with one hand licked the baton thoughtfully and then focused his gaze on the tuba player oombahoombahhhh oom om the tuba player tapped a trombonist on the shoulder hey frank theres a monkey where old troublemaker should be shutupshutupshutup satisfied the orangutan raised his arms the orchestra looked up and then looked up a bit more no conductor in musical history not even the one who once fried and ate the piccoloplayers liver on a cymbal for one wrong note too many not even the one who skewered three troublesome violinists on his baton not even the one who made really hurtful sarcastic remarks in a loud voice was ever the focus of such reverential attention on stage nanny ogg took advantage of the hush to pull the head off a frog madam sorry thought you might be someone else the long arms dropped the orchestra in one huge muddled chord slammed back into life the dancers after a moments confusion during which nanny ogg took the opportunity to decapitate a clown and a phoenix tried to continue the chorus watched in bemusement christine felt a tap on her shoulder and turned to see agnes perdita where have you been she hissed its nearly time for my duet with enrico youve got to help hissed agnes but down in her soul perdita said enrico eh its senor basilica to everyone else help you what said christine take everyones masks off christines forehead wrinkled beautifully thats not supposed to happen until the end of the opera is it er its all been changed said agnes urgently she turned to a nobleman in a zebra mask and tugged it desperately the singer underneath glared at her sorry she whispered i thought you were someone else were not supposed to take them off until the end its been changed has it no one told me a shortnecked giraffe next to him leaned sideways whats that the big unmasking scene is now apparently no one told me yes but when does anyone ever tell us anything were only the chorus here why is old troublemaker wearing a monkey mask nanny ogg pirouetted past cannoned into an elephant in evening dress and beheaded him by the trunk she whispered were looking for the ghost see but the ghost is dead isnt he hard things to kill ghosts said nanny the whisper spread outwards from that point there is nothing like a chorus for rumour people who would not believe a high priest if he said the sky was blue and was able to produce signed affidavits to this effect from his whitehaired old mother and three vestal virgins would trust just about anything whispered darkly behind their hand by a complete stranger in a pub a cockatoo spun around and pulled the mask off a parrot bucket sobbed this was worse than the day the buttermilk exploded this was worse than the flash heat wave that had led a whole warehouse full of lancre extra strong to riot the opera had turned into a pantomime the audience was laughing about the only character still with a mask on was senor basilica who was watching the struggling chorus with as much aloof amazement as his own mask could convey and this amazingly enough was quite a lot oh no moaned bucket well never live it down hell never come back itll be all over the opera circuit and no one will ever want to come here ever again ever again wha mumbled a voice behind him bucket turned oh senor basilica he said didnt see you there i was just thinking i do hope you dont think this is typical senor basilica stared through him swaying slightly from side to side he was wearing a torn shirt summon he said im sorry summon summon hit me onna head said the tenor wanna glassa water pliss but youre just about to sing arent you said bucket he grabbed the stunned man by the collar to pull him closer but this simply meant that he dragged himself off the floor bringing his shoes about level with basilicas knees tell me youre out there on the stage please even in his stunned state enrico basilica aka henry slugg recognized what might be called the essential dichotomy of the statement he stuck to what he knew summon bashed me inna corridor he volunteered thats not you out there basilica blinked heavily m not me youre going to sing the famous duet in a moment another thought staggered through basilicas abused skull m i he said s good ll look forwa to that neer had a chance to hear me befo he gave a happy little sigh and fell fulllength backwards bucket leaned against a pillar for support then his brow furrowed and in the best traditions of the extended doubletake he stared at the fallen tenor and counted to one on his fingers then he turned towards the stage and counted to two he could feel a fourth exclamation mark coming on any time now the enrico basilica on stage turned his mask this way and that stage right bucket was whispering to a group of stagehands stage left andrй the secret pianist was waiting a large troll loomed next to him the fat red singer walked to centrestage as the prelude to the duet began the audience settled down again fun and games among the chorus was all very wellit might even be in the plotbut this was what theyd paid for this was what it was all about agnes stared at him as christine walked towards him now she could see he wasnt right oh he was fat in a pillowupyourshirt sort of way but he didnt move like basilica basilica moved lightly on his feet as fat men often do giving the effect of a barely tethered balloon she glanced at nanny who was also watching him carefully she couldnt see granny weatherwax anywhere that probably meant she was really close the expectancy of the audience dragged at them all ears opened like petals the fourth wall of the stage the big black sucking darkness outside was a well of silence begging to be filled up christine was walking towards him quite unconcerned christine would walk into a dragons mouth if it had a sign on it saying totally harmless i promise you at least if it was printed in large easytounderstand letters no one seemed to want to do anything it was a famous duet and a beautiful one agnes ought to know shed been singing it all last night christine took the false basilicas hand and as the opening bars of the duet began opened her mouth stop right there agnes put everything she could into it the chandelier tinkled the orchestra went silent in a skid of wheezes and twangs in a fading of chords and a dying of echoes the show stopped walter plinge sat in the candlelit gloom under the stage his hands resting on his lap it was not often that walter plinge had nothing to do but when he did have nothing to do he did nothing he liked it down here it was familiar the sounds of the opera filtered through they were muffled but that didnt matter walter knew all the words every note of music every step of every dance he needed the actual performances only in the same way that a clock needs its tiny little escapement mechanism it kept him ticking nicely mrs plinge had taught him to read using the old programmes thats how he knew he was part of it all but he knew that anyway hed cut what teeth he had on a helmet with horns on it the first bed he could remember was the very same trampoline used by dame gigli in the infamous bouncing gigli incident walter plinge lived opera he breathed its songs painted its scenery lit its fires washed its floors and shined its shoes opera filled up places in walter plinge that might otherwise have been empty and now the show had stopped but all the energy all the raw pentup emotion that is dammed up behind a showall the screaming the fears the hopes the desiresflew on like a body hurled from the wreckage the terrible momentum smashed into walter plinge like a tidal wave hitting a teacup it propelled him out of his chair and flung him against the crumbling scenery he slid down and rolled into a twitching heap on the floor clapping his hands over his ears to shut out the sudden unnatural silence a shape stepped out of the shadows granny weatherwax had never heard of psychiatry and would have had no truck with it even if she had there are some arts too black even for a witch she practised headologypractised in fact until she was very good at it and though there may be some superficial similarities between a psychiatrist and a headologist there is a huge practical difference a psychiatrist dealing with a man who fears he is being followed by a large and terrible monster will endeavour to convince him that monsters dont exist granny weatherwax would simply give him a chair to stand on and a very heavy stick stand up walter plinge she said walter stood up staring straight ahead of him its stopped its stopped its bad luck to stop the show he said hoarsely someone better start it again said granny you cant stop the show its the show yes someone better start it again walter plinge walter didnt appear to notice her he pawed aimlessly through his stack of music and ran his hands through the drifts of old programmes one hand touched the keyboard of the harmonium and played a few neurotic notes wrong to stop show must go on mr salzella is trying to stop the show isnt he walter walters head shot up he stared straight ahead of him you havent seen anything walter plinge he said in a voice so like salzellas that even granny raised an eyebrow and if you tell lies you will be locked up and ill see to it that theres big trouble for your mother granny nodded he found out about the ghost didnt he she said the ghost who comes out when he has a mask on doesnt he walter plinge and the man thought i can use that and when its time for the ghost to be caught well there is a ghost that can be caught and the best thing is that everyone will believe it theyll feel bad about themselves maybe but theyll believe it even walter plinge wont be certain cos his minds all tangled up granny took a deep breath its tangled but it aint twisted there was a sigh well matters will have to resolve themselves theres nothing else for it she removed her hat and fished around in the point i dont mind tellin you this walter she said because you wont understand and you wont remember there was a wicked ole witch once called black aliss she was an unholy terror theres never been one worse or more powerful until now because i could spit in her eye and steal her teeth see because she didnt know right from wrong so she got all twisted up and that was the end of her the trouble is you see that if you do know right from wrong you cant choose wrong you just cant do it and live so if i was a bad witch i could make mister salzellas muscles turn against his bones and break them where he stood if i was bad i could do things inside his head change the shape he thinks he is and hed be down on whatd been his knees and begging to be turned into a frog if i was bad i could leave him with a mind like a scrambled egg listening to colours and hearing smells if i was bad oh yes there was another sigh deeper and more heartfelt but i cant do none of that stuff that wouldnt be right she gave a deprecating little chuckle and if nanny ogg had been listening she would have resolved as follows that no maddened cackle from black aliss of infamous memory no evil little giggle from some crazed vampyre whose morals were worse than his spelling no sidesplitting guffaw from the most inventive torturer was quite so unnerving as a happy little chuckle from a granny weatherwax about to do whats best from the point of her hat granny withdrew a paperthin mask it was a simple facesmooth white basic there were semicircular holes for the eyes it was neither happy nor sad she turned it over in her hands walter seemed to stop breathing simple thing aint it said granny looks beautiful but its really just a simple bit of stuff just like any other mask wizards could poke at this for a year and still say there was nothing magic about it eh which just shows how much they know walter plinge she tossed it to him he caught it hungrily and pulled it over his face then he stood up in one flowing movement moving like a dancer i dont know what you are when youre behind the mask said granny but ghost is just another word for spirit and spirit is just another word for soul off you go walter plinge the masked figure did not move i meant off you go ghost the show must go on the mask nodded and darted away granny slapped her hands together like the crack of doom right lets do some good she said to the universe at large everyone was looking at her this was a moment in time a little point between the past and future when a second could stretch out and out agnes felt the blush begin it was heading for her face like the revenge of the volcano god when it got there she knew it would be all over for her youll apologize perdita jeered shut up shouted agnes she strode forward before the echo had had time to come back from the further ends of the auditorium and wrenched at the red mask the entire chorus came in on cue this was opera after all the show had stopped but opera continued salzella he grabbed agnes clamping his hand over her mouth his other hand flew to his belt and drew his sword it wasnt a stage prop the blade hissed through the air as he spun to face the chorus oh dear oh dear oh dear he said how extremely operatic of me and now i fear i shall have to take this poor girl hostage its the appropriate thing to do isnt it he looked around triumphantly the audience watched in fascinated silence isnt anyone going to say you wont get away with this he said you wont get away with this said andrй from the wings you have the place surrounded i have no doubt said salzella brightly yes we have the place surrounded christine screamed and fainted salzella smiled even more brightly ah now theres someone operatic he said but you see i am going to get away with it because i dont think operatically myself and this young lady here are going to go down to the cellars where i may possibly leave her unharmed i doubt very much that you have the cellars surrounded even i dont know everywhere they go and believe me my knowledge is really rather extensive he paused agnes tried to break free but his grip tightened around her neck by now he said someone should have said but why salzella honestly do i have to do everything around here bucket realized he had his mouth open thats what i was going to say he said ah good well in that case i should say something like because i wanted to because i rather like money you see but more than that he took a deep breathi really hate opera i dont want to get needlessly excited about this but opera i am afraid really is dreadful and i have had enough so while i have the stage let me tell you what a wretched selfadoring totally unrealistic worthless artform it is what a terrible waste of fine music what a there was a whirr off on one side of the stage the skirts of costumes began to flap dust flew up andrй looked around beside him the wind machine had started up the handle was turning by itself salzella turned to see what everyone was staring at the ghost had dropped lightly on to the stage his opera cloak billowed around him operatically he bowed slightly and drew his sword but youre dea salzella began oh yes a ghost of a ghost totally unbelievable and an offence against common sense in the best operatic tradition this was really too much to hope for he thrust agnes away and nodded happily thats what opera does to a man he said it rots the brain you see and i doubt whether he had too much of that to begin with it drives people mad mad dyou hear me mad ahem they act irrationally dont you think ive watched you over the years its like a hothouse for insanity dyou hear me insanity he and the ghost began to circle one another you dont know what it has been like i assure you being the only sane man in this madhouse you believe anything youd prefer to believe a ghost can be in two places at once than that there might simply be two people even pounder thought he could blackmail me poking around in places that he shouldnt well of course i had to kill him for his own good this place sends even rat catchers mad and undershaft well why couldnt he have forgotten his glasses like he usually did eh he lashed out with his sword the ghost parried and now ill fight your ghost he said moving forward in a flurry of strokes and youll notice that our ghost here doesnt actually know how to fence because he only knows stagefencing you see where the whole point of course is simply to hit the other fellows sword with a suitably impressive metallic noise so that you can die very dramatically merely because hes carefully thrust his sword under your armpit the ghost was forced to retreat under the onslaught until he fell backwards over the unconscious body of christine see said salzella thats what comes of believing in opera he reached down quickly and tugged the mask off walter plinges face really walter you are a bad boy sorry mr salzella look how everyones staring sorry mr salzella the mask crumpled in salzellas fingers he let the fragments tumble to the floor then he pulled walter to his feet see company this is your luck this is your ghost without his mask hes just an idiot who can hardly tie his shoelaces ahahaha ahem its all your fault walter plinge yes mr salzella no salzella looked around no one would believe walter plinge even walter plinge gets confused about the things walter plinge sees even his mother was afraid he might have murdered people people could accept just about anything of a walter plinge there was a steady tapping noise the trapdoor opened beside salzella a pointy hat appeared slowly followed by the rest of granny weatherwax with her arms folded she glared at salzella as the floor clicked into place her foot stopped tapping on the boards well well he said lady esmerelda eh im stoppin bein a lady mr salzella he glanced up at the pointy hat so you are a witch instead yes indeed a bad witch no doubt worse but this said salzella is a sword everyone knows witches cant magic iron and steel get out of my way the sword hissed down granny thrust out her hand there was a blur of flesh and steel and she held the sword by the blade tell you what mr salzella she said levelly it ought to be walter plinge who finishes this eh its him you harmed apart from the ones you murdered o course you didnt need to do that but you wore a mask didnt you theres a kind of magic in masks masks conceal one face but they reveal another the one that only comes out in darkness i bet you could do just what you liked behind a mask salzella blinked at her he pulled on his sword tugged hard on a sharp blade held in an unprotected hand there was a groan from several members of the chorus granny grinned her knuckles whitened as she redoubled her grip she turned her head towards walter plinge put your mask on walter everyone looked down at the crumpled cardboard on the stage dont have one any more mistress weatherwax granny followed his gaze oh deary deary me she said well i can see we shall have to do something about that look at me walter he did as he was told grannys eyes halfclosed you trust perdita dont you walter yes mistress weatherwax thats good because shes got a new mask for you walter plinge a magic one its just like your old one dyou see only you wear it under your skin and you dont have to take it off and no one but you will ever need to know its there got it perdita but i agnes began got it er oh yes here it is yes ive got it in my hand she waved an empty hand vaguely youre holding it the wrong way up my girl oh sorry well give it to him then er yes agnes advanced on walter now you take it walter said granny still gripping the sword yes mistress weatherwax he reached out towards agnes as he did so she was sure that just for a moment there was a faint pressure on her fingertips well put it on walter looked uncertain you do believe theres a mask there dont you walter granny demanded perditas sensible and she knows an invisible mask when she sees one he nodded slowly and raised his hands to his face and agnes was sure that hed somehow come into focus almost certainly nothing had happened that could be measured with any kind of instrument any more than you could weigh an idea or sell good fortune by the yard but walter stood up smiling faintly good said granny she stared at salzella i reckon you two should fight again she said but it cant be said im unfair i expect youve got a ghost mask somewhere mrs ogg saw you waving it see and shes not as gormless as she looks thank you said a fat ballerina so she thought how could people still say afterwards that theyd seen the ghost cos thats how you recognize the ghost by his mask so theres two masks under her gaze telling himself that he could resist any time he wanted to salzella reached into his jacket and produced his own mask put it on then she let go of the sword then who you are can fight who he is down in the pit the percussionist stared as his sticks rose and began a drum roll are you doing that gytha said granny weatherwax i thought you were its opera then the show must go on walter plinge raised his sword the masked salzella glanced from him to granny and then lunged the swords met it was agnes realized stagefighting the swords clashed and rattled as the fighters danced back and forth across the stage walter wasnt trying to hit salzella every thrust was parried every opportunity to strike back as the director of music grew more angry was ignored this isnt fighting salzella shouted standing back this is walter thrust salzella staggered away until he cannoned into nanny ogg he lurched sideways then he staggered forward dropped on to one knee got unsteadily to his feet again and staggered into the centre of the stage whatever happens he gasped wrenching off his mask it cant be worse than a season of opera i dont mind where im going so long as there are no fat men pretending to be thin boys and no huge long songs which everyone says are so beautiful just because they dont understand what the hell theyre actually about ah ahargh he slumped to the floor but walter didnt agnes began shut up said nanny ogg out of the corner of her mouth but he hasnt bucket began incidentally another thing i cant stand about opera said salzella rising to his feet and reeling crabwise towards the curtains are the plots they make no sense and no one ever says so and the quality of the acting its nonexistent everyone stands around watching the person whos singing ye gods its going to be a relief to put that behind ah argh he slumped to the floor is that it said nanny shouldnt think so said granny weatherwax as for the people who attend opera said salzella struggling upright again and staggering sideways i think i just possibly hate them even worse theyre so ignorant theres hardly a one of them out there who knows the first thing about music they go on about tunes they spend all day endeavouring to be sensible human beings and then they walk in here and they leave their intelligence on a nail by the door then why didnt you just leave snapped agnes if youd stolen all this money why didnt you just go away somewhere if you hated it so much salzella stared at her while swaying back and forth his mouth opened and shut once or twice as if he were trying out unfamiliar words leave he managed leave leave the opera argh argh argh he hit the floor again andrй prodded the fallen director is he dead yet he said how can he be dead said agnes good grief cant anyone see that you know what really gets me down said salzella rising to his knees is the way that in opera everyone takes such a long time to argh argh argh he keeled over the company waited for a while the audience held its collective breath nanny ogg poked him with a boot yep thats about it looks like hes gone down for the last curtain call she said but walter didnt stab him said agnes why wont anyone listen look the sword isnt even sticking in him its just tucked between his body and his arm for heavens sake yes said nanny i spose really its a shame he dint notice that she scratched at her shoulder here these ballet dresses really tickle but hes dead got a bit overexcited perhaps said nanny fidgeting with a strap overexcited frantic you know these artistic types well you are one of course hes really dead said bucket seems to be said granny one of the best operatic deaths ever i wouldnt mind betting thats terrible bucket grabbed the former salzella by the collar and hauled him upright wheres my money come on out with it tell me what youve done with my money i dont hear you hes not saying anything thats on account of being dead said granny not talkative the deceased as a rule well youre a witch cant you do that thing with the cards and the glasses well yes we could have a poker game said nanny good idea the money is in the cellars said granny walterll show you walter plinge clicked his heels certainly he said i would be glad to bucket stared it was walter plinges voice and it was coming out of walter plinges face but both face and voice were different subtly different the voice had lost the uncertain frightened edge the lopsided look had gone from the face good grief bucket murmured and let go of salzellas coat there was a thump and since youre going to be needing a new director of music said granny you could do worse than look to walter here walter he knows everything there is to know about opera said granny and everything about the opera house too you should see the music hes written said nanny walter musical director said bucket stuff you can really hum yes i think you might be surprised said granny theres one with lots of sailors dancin around singin about how theres no women this is walter isnt it and then some bloke called les whos miserable all the time oh this is walter said granny the same person and theres one hah with all cats all leapin around all singin that was fun nanny burbled cant imagine how he thought up that one bucket scratched his chin he was feeling light headed enough as it was and hes trustworthy said granny and hes honest and he knows all about the opera house as i said and where everything is that was enough for mr bucket want to be director of music walter he said thank you mr bucket said walter plinge i should like that very much but what about cleaning the privies sorry i wont have to stop doing them will i ive just got them working right oh right really mr buckets eyes crossed for a moment well fine you can sing while youre doing it if you like he added generously and i wont even cut your pay ill ill raise it six no seven shiny dollars walter rubbed his face thoughtfully mr bucket yes walter i think you paid mr salzella forty shiny dollars bucket turned to granny is he some kind of monster you just listen to the stuff hes been writin said nanny amazin songs not even in foreign will you just look at this stuffscuse me she turned her back on the audience twingtwangtwong and twirled round again with a wad of music paper in her hands i know good music when i sees it she said handing it to bucket and pointing excitedly at extracts its got blobs and curly bits all over it see you have been writing this music said bucket to walter which is unaccountably warm indeed mr bucket in my time theres a lovely song here said nanny dont cry for me genua its very sad that reminds me id better go and see if mrs plinge has come rou has woken up i may have overdone it a bit on the stumble she ambled off twitching at bits of her costume and nudged a fascinated ballerina this balleting doesnt half make you sweat dont you find excuse me theres something i didnt quite believe said andrй he took salzellas sword and tested the blade carefully ow he shouted sharp is it said agnes yes andrй sucked his thumb she caught it in her hand shes a witch said agnes but it was steel i thought no one could magic steel everyone knows that i wouldnt be too impressed if i was you said agnes sourly it was probably just some kind of trick andrй turned to granny your hand isnt even scratched how did you her stare held him in its sapphire vice for a moment when he turned away he looked vaguely puzzled like a man who cant remember where hes just put something down i hope he didnt hurt christine he mumbled why isnt anyone seeing to her probably because she makes sure she screams and faints before anything happens said perdita through agnes andrй set off across the stage agnes trailed after him a couple of dancers were kneeling down next to christine itd be terrible if anything happened to her said andrй oh yes everyone says shes showing such promise walter stepped up beside him yes we should get her somewhere he said his voice was clipped and precise agnes felt the bottom start to drop out of her world yes but you know it was me doing the singing oh yes yes of course said andrй awkwardly butwell this is opera you know walter took her hand but it was me you taught she said desperately then you were very good said walter i suspect she will never be quite that good even with many months of my tuition but perdita have you ever heard of the words star quality is it the same as talent snapped agnes it is rarer she stared at him his face however it was controlled now was quite handsome in the glare of the footlights she pulled her hand free i liked you better when you were walter plinge she said agnes turned away and felt granny weatherwaxs gaze on her she was sure it was a mocking gaze er we ought to get christine into mr buckets office andrй said this seemed to break some sort of spell yes indeed said bucket and we cant leave mr salzella corpsing on stage either you two youd better take him backstage the rest of you well it was nearly over anyway er thats it the opera is over walter plinge nanny ogg entered supporting mrs plinge walters mother fixed him with a beady gaze have you been a bad boy mr bucket walked over to her and patted her hand i think youd better come along to my office too he said he handed the sheaf of music to andrй who opened it at random andrй gave it a glance and then stared hey this is good he said is it andrй looked at another page good heavens what what said bucket ive just never i mean even i can see tumti tum tumtumyes mr bucket you do know this isnt opera theres music and yes dancing and singing all right but its not opera not opera at all a long way from opera how far you dont mean bucket hesitated savouring the idea you dont mean that its just possible that you put music in and you get money out andrй hummed a few bars this could very well be the case mr bucket bucket beamed he put one arm around andrй and the other around walter good he said this calls for a very lar for a mediumsized mm drink one by one or in groups the singers and dancers left the stage and the witches and agnes were left alone is that it said agnes not quite yet said granny someone staggered on to the stage a kindly hand had bandaged enrico basilicas head and presumably another kindly hand had given him the plate of spaghetti he was holding mild concussion still seemed to have him in its grip he blinked at the witches and then spoke like a man whod lost his hold on immediate events and so was clinging hard to more ancient considerations summon give me some ghetti he said thats nice said nanny hah ghetti is fine for them as likes it but not me hah yes he turned and peered muzzily at the darkness of the audience you know what im goin to do you know what im goin to do now im sayin goodbye to enrico basilica oh yes hes chewed his last tentacle im goin to go right out now and have eight pints of turbots really odd yes and probably a sausage in a bun and then im goin down to the music hall to hear nellie stamp sing a winkles no use if you dont have a pinand if i sing again here its goin to be under the proud old name of henry slugg do you hear there was a shriek from somewhere in the audience henry slugg er yes i thought it was you youve grown a beard and stuffed a haystack down your trousers but i thought under that little mask thats my henry that was henry slugg shaded his eyes from the footlights glare angeline oh no said agnes wearily this sort of thing does not happen happens in the theatre all the time said nanny ogg it certainly does said granny its only a mercy he doesnt have a longlost twin brother there was the sound of much scuffling in the audience someone was climbing along a row dragging someone else mother came a voice from the gloom what do you think you are doing you just come with me young henry mother we cant go up on the stage henry slugg frisbeed the plate into the wings clambered down from the stage and heaved himself over the edge of the orchestra pit assisted by a couple of violinists they met at the first row of seats agnes could just hear their voices i meant to come back you know that i wanted to wait but what with one thing and another especially one thing come here young henry mother what is happening son you know i always said your father was mr lawsy the eel juggler yes of please both of you come back to my dressing room i can see weve got such a lot to talk about oh yes a lot agnes watched them go the audience who could spot opera even if it wasnt being sung applauded all right she said and now is it the end nearly said granny did you do something to everyones heads no but i felt like smacking a few said nanny but no one said thank you or anything often the case said granny too busy thinking about the next performance said nanny the show must go on she added thats thats madness its opera i noticed that even mr buckets caught it too said nanny and that young andrй has been rescued from being a policeman if im any judge but what about me oh them as makes the endings dont get them said granny she brushed an invisible speck of dust off her shoulder i expect wed better be gettin along gytha she said turning her back on agnes early start tomorrow nanny walked forward shading her eyes as she stared out into the dark maw of the auditorium the audience havent gone you know she said theyre still sitting out there granny joined her and peered into the gloom i cant imagine why she said he did say the operas over they turned and looked at agnes who was standing in the centre of the stage and glowering at nothing feeling a bit angry said nanny only to be expected yes feeling that everythings happened for other people and not for you yes but said granny weatherwax look at it like this whats christine got to look forward to shell just become a singer stuck in a little world oh maybe shell be good enough to get a little fame but one day the voicell crack and thats the end of her life you have got a choice you can either be on the stage just a performer just going through the lines or you can be outside it and know how the script works where the scenery hangs and where the trapdoors are isnt that better no the infuriating thing about nanny ogg and granny weatherwax agnes thought later was the way they sometimes acted in tandem without exchanging a word of course there were plenty of other thingsthe way they never thought that meddling was meddling if they did it the way they automatically assumed that everyone elses business was their own the way they went through life in a straight line the way in fact that they arrived in any situation and immediately started to change it compared to that acting on unspoken agreement was a mere minor annoyance but it was here and up close they walked towards her and each laid a hand on her shoulder feeling angry said granny yes i should let it out then if i was you said nanny agnes shut her eyes clenched her fists opened her mouth and screamed it started low plaster dust drifted down from the ceiling the prisms on the chandelier chimed gently as they shook it rose passing quickly through the mysterious pitch at fourteen cycles per second where the human spirit begins to feel distinctly uncomfortable about the universe and the place in it of the bowels small items around the opera house vibrated off shelves and smashed on the floor the note climbed rang like a bell climbed again in the pit all the violin strings snapped one by one as the tone rose the crystal prisms shook in the chandelier in the bar champagne corks fired a salvo ice jingled and shattered in its bucket a line of wineglasses joined in the chorus blurred around the rims and then exploded like hazardous thistledown with attitude there were harmonics and echoes that caused strange effects in the dressingrooms the no greasepaint melted mirrors cracked filling the ballet school with a million fractured images dust rose insects fell in the stones of the opera house tiny particles of quartz danced briefly then there was silence broken by the occasional thud and tinkle nanny grinned ah she said now the operas over salzella opened his eyes the stage was empty and dark and nevertheless brilliantly lit that is a huge shadowless light was streaming from some unseen source and yet apart from salzella himself there was nothing for it to illuminate footsteps sounded in the distance their owner took some time to arrive but when he stepped into the liquid air around salzella he seemed to burst into flame he wore red a red suit with red lace a red cloak red shoes with ruby buckles and a broadbrimmed red hat with a huge red feather he even walked with a long red stick bedecked with red ribbons but for someone who had taken such meticulous trouble with his costume hed been remiss in the matter of his mask it was a crude one of a skull such as might be bought in any theatrical shopsalzella could even see the string where did everyone go salzella demanded unpleasant recent memories were beginning to bubble up in his mind he couldnt quite recall them clearly at the moment but the taste of them was bad the figure said nothing wheres the orchestra what happened to the audience there was a barely perceptible shrug from the tall red figure salzella began to notice other details what he had thought was the stage seemed slightly gritty underfoot the ceiling above him was a long way away perhaps as far away as anything could be and was filled with cold hard points of light i asked you a question three questions in fact the words turned up on the inside of salzellas ears with no suggestion that they had had to travel like normal sound you didnt answer me some things you have to work out for yourself and this is one of them believe me who are you youre not a member of the cast i know that take off that mask as you wish i do like to get into the spirit of the thing the figure removed its mask and now take off that other mask said salzella as the frozen fingers of dread rose through him death touched a secret spring on the stick a blade shot out so thin that it was transparent its edge glittering blue as air molecules were sliced into their component atoms ah he said raising the scythe there i think you have me it was dark in the cellars but nanny ogg had walked alone in the strange caverns under lancre and through the nighttime forests with granny weatherwax darkness held no fears for an ogg she struck a match greebo people had been tramping to and fro for hours the darkness wasnt private any more it had taken quite a lot of people to carry all the money for a start up until the end of the opera there had been something mysterious about these cellars now they were just well damp underground rooms something that had lived here had moved on her foot rattled a piece of pottery she grunted as she went down on one knee spilt mud and shards of broken pot littered the floor here and there unrooted and snapped were some unheeded pieces of dead twig only some kind of fool would have stuck bits of wood in pots of mud far underground and expected anything to happen nanny picked one up and sniffed it tentatively it smelled of mud and nothing else shed have liked to haveknown how it had been done just professional interest of course and she knew she never would now walter was a busy man now up in the light and for something to begin other things had to end we all wears a mask of one sort or another she said to the damp air no sense in upsetting things now eh the coach didnt leave until seven oclock in the morning by lancre standards that was practically midday the witches got there early i was hoping to shop for a few souvenirs said nanny stamping her feet on the cobbles to keep warm for the kiddies no time said granny weatherwax not that it would have made any difference on account of me not having any money to buy em with nanny went on not my fault if you fritter your money away said granny i dont recall having a single chance to frit moneys only useful for the things it can do well yes i couldve done with having some new boots for a start nanny jiggled up and down a bit and whistled around her tooth nice of mrs palm to let us stay there gratis she said yes o course i helped out playin the piano and tellin jokes an added bonus said granny nodding an of course there was all those little nibbles i prepared with the special party dip yes indeed said granny pokerfaced mrs palm was saying only this morning that shes thinking of retiring next year nanny looked up and down the street again i spect young agnesll be turning up any minute now she said i really couldnt say said granny haughtily not as though theres much for her here after all granny sniffed thats up to her im sure everyone was very impressed i reckon when you caught that sword in your hand granny sighed hah yes i expect they were they didnt think clearly did they peoplere just lazy they never think maybe she had something in her hand a bit of metal or something they dont think for a minute it was just a trick they dont think theres always a perfectly good explanation if you look for it they probably think it was some kind of magic yeah but you didnt have anything in your hand did you thats not the point i might have done granny looked up and down the square besides you cant magic iron thats very true not iron now someone like ole black aliss they could make their skin tougher than steel but thats just an ole legend i expect she could do it all right said granny but you cant go round messin with cause and effect thats what sent her mad come the finish she thought she could put herself outside of things like cause and effect well you cant you grab a sharp sword by the blade you get hurt worldd be a terrible place if people forgot that you werent hurt not my fault i didnt have time nanny blew on her hands one good thing though she said its a blessing the chandelier never came down i was worried about that soon as i saw it looks too dramatic for its own good i thought first thing id smash if i was a loony yes havent been able to find greebo since last night good he always turns up though unfortunately there was a clatter as the coach swung around the corner it stopped then the coachman tugged on the reins and it did a uturn and disappeared again esme said nanny after a while yes theres a man and two horses peering at us around the corner she raised her voice come on i know youre there seven oclock this coach is supposed to leave did you get the tickets esme me ah said nanny uncertainly so we havent got eighty dollars for the tickets then whatve you got stuffed up your elastic said granny as the coach advanced cautiously nothin that is legal tender for travellin purposes i fear then no we cant afford tickets nanny sighed oh well ill just have to use charm its going to be a long walk said granny the coach pulled up nanny looked up at the driver and smiled innocently good morning my good sir he gave her a slightly frightened but mainly suspicious look is it we are desirous of travelling to lancre but unfortunately we find ourselves a bit embarrassed in the knicker department you are but we are witches and could probly pay for our travel by eg curing any embarrassing little ailments you may have the coachman frowned i aint carrying you for nothing old crone and i havent got any embarrassing little ailments granny stepped forward how many would you like she said rain rolled over the plains it wasnt an impressive ramtops thunderstorm but a lazy persistent lowcloud rain like a fat fog it had been following them all day the witches had the coach to themselves several people had opened the door while it had been waiting to leave but for some reason had suddenly decided that todays travel plans didnt include a coach ride making good time said nanny opening the curtains and peering out of the window i expect the drivers in a hurry yes i spect he is shut the window though its getting wet in here rightyho nanny grabbed the strap and then suddenly poked her head out into the rain stop stop tell the man to stop the coach dewed to a halt in a sheet of mud nanny threw open the door i dont know trying to walk home and in this weather too youll catch your death rain and fog rolled in through the open doorway then a bedraggled shape pulled itself over the sill and slunk under the seats leaving small puddles behind it tryin to be independent said nanny bless im the coach got under way again granny stared out at the endless darkening fields and the relentless drizzle and saw another figure toiling along in the mud by the road that would eventually reach lancre as the coach swept past it drenched the walker in thin slurry yes indeed being independents a fine ambition she said drawing the curtains the trees were bare when granny weatherwax got back to her cottage twigs and seeds had blown in under the door soot had fallen down the chimney her home always somewhat organic had grown a little closer to its roots in the clay there were things to do so she did them there were leaves to be swept and the woodpile to be built up under the eaves the windsock behind the beehives tattered by autumn storms needed to be darned hay had to be got in for the goats apples had to be stored in the loft the walls could do with another coat of whitewash but there was something that had to be done first itd make the other jobs a bit more difficult but there was no help for that you couldnt magic iron and you couldnt grab a sword without being hurt if that wasnt true the worldd be all over the place granny made herself some tea and then boiled up the kettle again she took a handful of herbs out of a box on the dresser and dropped them in a bowl with the steaming water she took a length of clean bandage out of a drawer and set it carefully on the table beside the bowl she threaded an extremely sharp needle and laid needle and thread beside the bandage she scooped a fingerful of greenish ointment out of a small tin and smeared it on a square of lint that seemed to be it she sat down and rested her arm on the table palmup well she said to no one in particular i reckon ive got time now the privy had to be moved it was a job granny preferred to do for herself there was something incredibly satisfying in digging a very deep hole it was uncomplicated you knew where you were with a hole in the ground dirt didnt get strange ideas or believe that people were honest because they had a steady gaze and a firm handshake it just lay there waiting for you to move it and after youd done it you could sit there in the lovely warm knowledge that itd be months before you had to do it again it was while she was at the bottom of the hole that a shadow fell across it afternoon perdita she said without looking up she lifted another shovelful to headheight and flung it over the edge come home for a visit have you she said she rammed the shovel into the clay at the bottom of the hole again winced and forced it down with her foot thought you were doing very well in the opera she went on course im not an expert in these things good to see young people seeking their fortune in the big city though she looked up with a bright friendly smile i see youve lost a bit of weight too innocence hung from her words like loops of toffee ive been taking exercise said agnes exercise is a fine thing certainly said granny getting back to her digging though they do say you can have too much of it when are you going back i havent decided weeelll it doesnt pay to be always planning dont tie yourself down the whole time ive always said that staying with your ma are you yes said agnes ah only magrats old cottage is still empty youd be doing everyone a favour if you aired it out a bit you know as long as youre here agnes said nothing she couldnt think of anything to say funny ole thing said granny hacking around a particularly troublesome tree root i wouldnt tell everyone but i was only thinking the other day about when i was younger and called myself endemonidia you did when granny rubbed her forehead with her bandaged hand leaving a clayred smudge oh for about three four hours she said some names dont have the stayin power never pick yourself a name you cant scrub the floor in she threw her shovel out of the hole give me a hand up will you agnes did so granny brushed the dirt and leafmould off her apron and tried to stamp the clay off her boots time for a cup of tea eh she said my you are looking well its the fresh air too much stuffy air in that opera house i thought agnes tried in vain to detect anything in granny weatherwaxs eyes other than transparent honesty and goodwill yes i thought so too she said er youve hurt your hand itll heal a lot of things do she shouldered her shovel and headed towards the cottage and then halfway up the path turned and looked back this is just me askin you understand in a kind neighbourly way takin an interest sort of thing wouldnt be human if i didnt agnes sighed yes you got much to do with your evenins these days there was just enough rebellion left in agnes to put a sarcastic edge on her voice oh are you offering to teach me something teach no said granny aint got the patience for teaching but i might let you learn when shall we three meet again we havent met once yet o course we have ive personly known you for at least i mean we three havent met you know officially all right when shall we three meet were already here all right when shall just shut up and get out the marshmallows agnes give nanny the marshmallows yes granny and mind you dont burn mine granny sat back it was a clear night although clouds mounting towards the hub promised snow soon a few sparks flew up towards the stars she looked around proudly isnt this nice she said the end the people of lancre thought that marriage was a very serious step that ought to be done properly so they practised quite a lot not that she sat looking out of the window shed been watching the fire when she picked up the approach of jarge weaver but that wasnt the point or at least dying for a chocolate er that is to say they went to bed at the same time as the chickens went to bed and got up at the same time as the cows got up loosely worded sayings can really cause misunderstandings distillation of alcohol was illegal in lancre on the other hand king verence had long ago given up any idea of stopping a witch doing something she wanted to do so merely required nanny ogg to keep her still somewhere it wasnt obvious she thoroughly approved of the prohibition since this gave her an unchallenged market for her own product known wherever men fell backwards into a ditch as suicider strictly speaking this means being chased by photographers anxious to get a picture of you with your vest off without regret since she hadnt found any use for it bergholt stuttley johnson was ankhmorporks most famous or rather most notorious inventor he was renowned for never letting his numberblindness his lack of any skill whatsoever or his complete

attention to the world of music particularly large organs and mechanical orchestras examples of his handiwork still occasionally come to light in sales auctions and quite frequently wreckage it was central to nanny oggs soul that she never considered herself an old woman while of course availing herself of every advantage that other peoples perceptions of her as such would bring
