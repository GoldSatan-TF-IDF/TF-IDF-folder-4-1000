prologue ethan climbed out of his dreams and rolled out of bed it was still dark but he habitually started his day before night yielded to dawn it suited him the quiet the simple routine the hard work that would follow hed never forgotten to be grateful that hed been able to make this choice and have this life though the people responsible for giving him both the choice and the life were dead for ethan the pretty house on the water still echoed with their voices he would often find himself glancing up from his lone breakfast in the kitchen expecting to see his mother shuffle in yawning her red hair a wild tangle from sleep her eyes half blind with it and though shed been gone nearly seven years there was a comfort in that homey morning image it was more painful to think of the man who had become his father raymond quinns death was still too fresh after a mere three months for there to be comfort and the circumstances surrounding it were both ugly and unexplained his death had come in a singlecar accident in broad daylight on a dry road on a march day that had only hinted of spring the car was traveling fast with its driver unable or unwilling to control it on a curve tests had proven that there had been no physical reason for ray to crash into the telephone pole but there was evidence of an emotional reason and that lay heavy on ethans heart ethan thought of it as he readied himself for the day giving his hair still damp from the shower a cursory swipe with his comb which did nothing to tame the thick waves of sunbleached brown he shaved in the foggy mirror his quiet blue eyes sober as he scraped lather and a nights worth of beard from a tanned bony face that held secrets he rarely chose to share there was a scar that rode along the left of his jawline courtesy of his oldest brother and patiently stitched up by his mother it had been fortunate ethan thought as he rubbed a thumb absently over the faded line that their mother had been a doctor one of her three sons was usually in need of first aid ray and stella had taken them in three halfgrown boys all wild all damaged all strangers and had made them a family then months before his death ray had taken in another seth delauter belonged to them now ethan never questioned it others did he knew there was talk buzzing through the little town of st christophers that seth was not just another of ray quinns strays but his illegitimate son a child conceived with another woman while his wife was still alive a younger woman ethan could ignore the talk but it was impossible to ignore the fact that tenyearold seth looked at you with ray quinns eyes there were shadows in those eyes that ethan also recognized the wounded recognized the wounded he knew that seths life before ray had taken him on had been a nightmare hed lived through one himself the kid was safe now ethan thought as he pulled on baggy cotton pants and a faded work shirt he was a quinn now even if the legalities hadnt been completely worked out they had phillip to deal with that ethan figured his detailmad brother would handle that end of things with the lawyer and he knew that cameron the eldest of the quinn boys had managed to form a tenuous bond with seth fumbled his way to it ethan thought with a half smile it had been like watching two angry tomcats spit and claw now that cam had married the pretty social worker things might just settle down some ethan preferred a settled life they had battles yet with the insurance company refusing to honor rays policy because there was suspicion of suicide ethans stomach clutched and he took a moment to will himself relaxed again his father would never have killed himself the mighty quinn had always faced his problems and had taught his sons to do the same but it was a cloud over the family that refused to blow away there were others too the sudden appearance in st christophers of seths mother and her accusations of sexual molestation made to the dean of the college where ray had taught english literature that hadnt held thered been too many lies too many shifts in her story but there was no denying that his father had been shaken there was no denying that shortly after gloria delauter had left st chris again ray had gone away too and hed returned with the boy then there was the letter found in the car after rays accident an obvious blackmail threat from the delauter woman there was the fact that ray had given her money a great deal of money now she had disappeared again ethan wanted her to stay gone but he knew the talk wouldnt stop until all the answers were clear nothing he could do about it ethan reminded himself he stepped out into the hall gave a quick knock on the door opposite his seths groan was followed by a sleepy mutter then an annoyed curse ethan kept going heading downstairs he had no doubt that seth would bitch again about getting up so early but with cam and anna in italy on their honeymoon and phillip in baltimore until the weekend it was ethans job to get the boy up to get him headed over to a friends house to stay until it was time to leave for school crabbing season was in full swing and a watermans day started before the sun so until cam and anna returned so did seths the house was silent and dark but he moved through it easily he had a house of his own now but part of the deal in gaining guardianship of seth had been for the three brothers to live under the same roof and share the responsibilities ethan didnt mind responsibilities but he missed his little house his privacy and the ease of what had been his life he flicked on the lights in the kitchen it had been seths turn to clean it up after dinner the evening before and ethan noted that hed done a halfassed job ignoring the cluttered and sticky surface of the table he moved directly to the stove simon his dog stretched lazily out of his curl his tail thumped on the floor ethan set the coffee to brew greeting the retriever with an absent scratch on the head the dream was coming back to him now the one hed been caught in just before waking he and his father out on the workboat checking crab pots just the two of them the sun had been blinding bright and hot the water mirrorclear and still it had been so vivid he thought now even the smells of water and fish and sweat his fathers voice so well remembered had carried over the sounds of engine and gulls i knew youd look after seth the three of you you didnt have to die to test that out there was resentment in ethans tone an underlying anger he hadnt allowed himself to admit while awake it wasnt what i had in mind either ray said lightly culling crabs from the pot under the float that ethan had gaffed his thick orange fishermans gloves glowed in the sun you can trust me on that you got some good steamers here and plenty of sooks ethan glanced at the wire pot full of crabs automatically noting size and number but it wasnt the catch that mattered not here not now you want me to trust you but you dont explain ray glanced back tipping up the brightred cap he wore over his dramatic silver mane the wind tugged at his hair teased the caricature of john steinbeck gracing his loose tshirt into rippling over his broad chest the great american writer held a sign claiming he would work for food but he didnt look too happy about it in contrast ray quinn glowed with health and energy ruddy cheeks where deep creases only seemed to celebrate a full and contented mood of a vigorous man in his sixties with years yet to live youve got to find your own way your own answers ray smiled at ethan out of brilliantly blue eyes and ethan could see the creases deepen around them it means more that way im proud of you ethan felt his throat burn his heart squeeze routinely he rebaited the pot then watched the orange floats bob on the water for what for being just for being ethan i shouldve come around more i shouldnt have left you alone so much thats a crock now rays voice was both irritated and impatient i wasnt some old invalid its going to piss me off if you think that way blame yourself for not looking after me for christs sake same way you wanted to blame cam for going off to live in europe and even phillip for going off to baltimore healthy birds leave the nest your mother and i raised healthy birds before ethan could speak ray raised a hand it was such a typical gesture the professor making a point and refusing interruption that ethan had to smile you missed them thats why you wanted to be mad at them they left you stayed and you missed having them around well youve got them back now dont you looks that way and youve got yourself a pretty sisterinlaw the beginnings of a boatbuilding business and this√¢ ray gestured to take in the water the bobbing floats the tall glossily wet eelgrass on the verge where a lone egret stood like a marble pillar and inside you youve got something seth needs patience maybe too much of it in some areas whats that supposed to mean ray sighed gustily theres something you dont have ethan that you need youve been waiting around and making excuses to yourself and doing not a damn thing to get it you dont make a move soon youre going to lose it again what ethan shrugged and maneuvered the boat to the next float ive got everything i need and what i want dont ask yourself what ask yourself who ray clucked his tongue then gave his son a quick shoulder shake wake up ethan and he had awakened with the odd sensation of that big familiar hand on his shoulder but he thought as he brooded over his first cup of coffee he still didnt have the answers chapter one contents prev next got us some nice peelers here capn jim bodine culled crabs from the pot tossing the marketable catch in the tank he didnt mind the snapping claws and had the scars on his thick hands to prove it he wore the traditional gloves of his profession but as any waterman could tell you they wore out quick and if there was a hole in them by god a crab would find it he worked steadily his legs braced wide for balance on the rocking boat his dark eyes squinting in a face weathered with age and sun and living he might have been taken for fifty or eighty and jim didnt much care which end you stuck him in he always called ethan capn and rarely said more than one declarative sentence at a time ethan altered course toward the next pot his right hand nudging the steering stick that most waterman used rather than a wheel at the same time he operated the throttle and gear levels with his left there were constant small adjustments to be made with every foot of progress up the line of traps the chesapeake bay could be generous when she chose but she liked to be tricky and make you work for her bounty ethan knew the bay as well as he knew himself often he thought he knew it better the fickle moods and movements of the continents largest estuary for two hundred miles it flowed from north to south yet it measured only four miles across where it brushed by annapolis and thirty at the mouth of the potomac river st christophers sat snug on marylands southern eastern shore depending on its generosity cursing it for its caprices ethans waters his home waters were edged with marshland strung with flatland rivers with sharp shoulders that shimmered through thickets of gum and oak it was a world of tidal creeks and sudden shallows where wild celery and widgeongrass rooted it had become his world with its changing seasons sudden storms and always always the sounds and scents of the water timing it he grabbed his gaffing pole and in a practiced motion as smooth as a dance hooked the pot line and drew it into the pot puller in seconds the pot rose out of the water streaming with weed and pieces of old bait and crowded with crabs he saw the brightred pincers of the fullgrown females or sooks and the scowling eyes of the jimmies right smart of crabs was all jim had to say as he went to work heaving the pot aboard as if it weighed ounces rather than pounds the water was rough today and ethan could smell a storm coming in he worked the controls with his knees when he needed his hands for other tasks and eyed the clouds beginning to boil together in the far western sky time enough he judged to move down the line of traps in the gut of the bay and see how many more crabs had crawled into the pots he knew jim was hurting some for cash and he needed all he could come by himself to keep afloat the fledgling boatbuilding business he and his brothers had started time enough he thought again as jim rebaited a pot with thawing fish parts and tossed it overboard in leapfrog fashion ethan gaffed the next buoy ethans sleek chesapeake bay retriever simon stood front paws on the gunwale tongue lolling like his master he was rarely happier than when out on the water they worked in tandem and in near silence communicating with grunts shrugs and the occasional oath the work was a comfort since the crabs were plentiful there were years when they werent years when it seemed the winter had killed them off or the waters would never warm up enough to tempt them to swim in those years the watermen suffered unless they had another source of income ethan intended to have one building boats the first boat by quinn was nearly finished and a little beauty it was ethan thought cameron had a second client on the line some rich guy from cams racing days so they would start another before long ethan never doubted that his brother would reel the money in theyd do it he told himself however doubtful and full of complaints phillip was he glanced up at the sun gauged the time and the clouds sailing slowly steadily eastward well take them in jim theyd been eight hours on the water a short day but jim didnt complain he knew it wasnt so much the oncoming storm that had ethan piloting the boat back up the gut boys home from school by now he said yeah and though seth was selfsufficient enough to stay home alone for a time in the afternoon ethan didnt like to tempt fate a boy of ten and with seths temperament was a magnet for trouble when cam returned from europe in a couple of weeks they would juggle seth between them but for now the boy was ethans responsibility the water in the bay kicked turning gunmetal gray now to mirror the sky but neither men nor dog worried about the rocky ride as the boat crept up the steep fronts of the waves then slid back down into the troughs simon stood at the bow now head lifted his ears blowing back in the wind grinning his doggie grin ethan had built the workboat himself and he knew she would do as confident as the dog jim moved to the protection of the awning and cupping his hands lit a cigarette the waterfront of st chris was alive with tourists the early days of june lured them out of the city tempted them to drive from the suburbs of dc and baltimore he imagined they thought of the little town of st christophers as quaint with its narrow streets and clapboard houses and tiny shops they liked to watch the crab pickers fingers fly and eat the flaky crab cakes or tell their friends theyd had a bowl of shecrab soup they stayed in the bedandbreakfasts st chris was the proud home of no less than four and they spent their money in the restaurants and gift shops ethan didnt mind them during the times when the bay was stingy tourism kept the town alive and he thought there would come a time when some of those same tourists might decide that having a handbuilt wooden sailboat was their hearts desire the wind picked up as ethan moored at the dock jim jumped nimbly out to secure lines his short legs and squat body giving him the look of a leaping frog wearing white rubber boots and a greasesmeared gimme cap at ethans careless hand signal simon plopped his butt down and stayed in the boat while the men worked to unload the days catch and the wind made the boats sunfaded green awning dance ethan watched pete monroe walk toward them his irongray hair crushed under a battered billed hat his stocky body outfitted in baggy khakis and a red checked shirt good catch today ethan ethan smiled he liked mr monroe well enough though the man had a bonedeep stingy streak he ran monroes crab house with a tightly closed fist but as far as ethan could tell every mans son who ran a picking plant complained about profits ethan pushed his own cap back scratched the nape of his neck where sweat and damp hair tickled good enough youre in early today storms coming monroe nodded already his crab pickers who had been working under the shade of striped awnings were preparing to move inside rain would drive the tourists inside as well he knew to drink coffee or eat ice cream sundaes since he was half owner of the bayside eats he didnt mind looks like you got about seventy bushels there ethan let his smile widen some might have said there was a hint of the pirate in the look ethan wouldnt have been insulted but hed have been surprised closer to ninety id say he knew the market price to the penny but understood they would as always negotiate he took out his negotiating cigar lit it and got to work the first fat drops of rain began to fall as he motored toward home he figured hed gotten a fair price for his crabs his eightyseven bushels of crabs if the rest of the summer was as good he was going to consider dropping another hundred pots next year maybe hiring on a parttime crew oystering on the bay wasnt what it had been not since parasites had killed off so many that made the winters hard a few good crabbing seasons were what he needed to dump the lions share of the profits into the new business and to help pay the lawyers fee his mouth tightened at that thought as he rode out the swells toward home they shouldnt need a damn lawyer they shouldnt have to pay some slicksuited talker to clear their fathers good name it wouldnt stop the whispers around town anyway those would only stop when people found something juicier to chew on than ray quinns life and death and the boy ethan mused staring out over the water that trembled under the steady pelting of rain there were some who liked to whisper about the boy who looked back at them with ray quinns darkblue eyes he didnt mind for himself as far as ethan was concerned people could wag their tongues about him until they fell out of their flapping mouths but he minded deeply that anyone would speak a dark word about the man hed loved with every beat of his heart so he would work his fingers numb to pay the lawyer and he would do whatever it took to guard the child thunder shook the sky booming off the water like cannon fire the light went dim as dusk and those dark clouds burst wide to pour out solid sheets of rain still he didnt hurry as he docked at his home pier a little more wet to his mind wouldnt kill him as if in agreement with the sentiment simon leaped out to swim to shore while ethan secured the lines he gathered up his lunch pail and with his watermans boots thwacking wetly against the dock headed for home he removed the boots on the back porch his mother had scalded his skin often enough in his youth about tracking mud for the habit to stick to the man still he didnt think anything of letting the wet dog nose in the door ahead of him until he saw the gleaming floor and counters shit was all he could think as he studied the pawprints and heard simons happy bark of greeting there was a squeal more barking then laughter youre soaking wet the female voice was low and smooth and amused it was also very firm and made ethan wince with guilt out simon out you go you just dry off on the front porch there was another squeal baby giggles and the accompanying laughter of a young boy the gangs all here ethan thought rubbing rain from his hair the minute he heard footsteps heading in his direction he made a beeline for the broom closet and a mop he didnt often move fast but he could when he had to oh ethan grace monroe stood with her hands on her narrow hips looking from him to the pawprints on her justwaxed floor ill get it sorry he could see that the mop was still damp and decided it was best not to look at her directly wasnt thinking he muttered filling a bucket at the sink didnt know you were coming by today oh so you let wet dogs run through the house and dirty up the floors when im not coming by he jerked a shoulder floor was dirty when i left this morning didnt figure a little wet would hurt it any then he relaxed a little it always seemed to take him a few minutes to relax around grace these days but if id known you were here to skin me over it id have left him on the porch he was grinning when he turned and she let out a sigh oh give me the mop ill do it nope my dog my mess i heard aubrey absently grace leaned on the doorjamb she was tired but that wasnt unusual she had put in eight hours that day too and she would put in another four at shineys pub that night serving drinks some nights when she crawled into bed she would have sworn she heard her feet crying seths minding her for me i had to switch my days mrs lynley called this morning and asked if id shift doing her house till tomorrow because her motherinlaw called her from dc and invited herself down to dinner mrs lynley claims her motherinlaw is a woman who looks at a speck of dust like its a sin against god and man i didnt think youd mind if i did yall today instead of tomorrow you fit us in whenever you can manage it grace and were grateful he was watching her from under his lashes as he mopped hed always thought she was a pretty thing like a palomino all gold and longlegged she chopped her hair off short as a boys but he liked the way it sat on her head like a shiny cap with fringes she was as thin as one of those milliondollar models but he knew graces long lean form wasnt for fashion shed been a gangling skinny kid as he recalled shed have been about seven or eight when hed first come to st chris and the quinns he supposed she was twentycouple now and skinny wasnt exactly the word for her anymore she was like a willow slip he thought very nearly flushing she smiled at him and her mermaidgreen eyes warmed faint dimples flirting in her cheeks for reasons she couldnt name she found it entertaining to see such a healthy male specimen wielding a mop did you have a good day ethan good enough he did a thorough job with the floor he was a thorough man then he went to the sink again to rinse bucket and mop sold a mess of crabs to your daddy at the mention of her father graces smile dimmed a little there was distance between them had been since shed become pregnant with aubrey and had married jack casey the man her father had called that noaccount grease monkey from upstate her father had turned out to be right about jack the man had left her high and dry a month before aubrey was born and hed taken her savings her car and most of her selfrespect with him but shed gotten through it grace reminded herself and she was doing just fine she would keep right on doing fine on her own without a single penny from her family if she had to work herself to death to do it she heard aubrey laugh again a long rolling gut laugh and her resentment vanished she had everything that mattered it was all tied up in a brighteyed curlyheaded little angel just in the next room ill make you up some dinner before i go ethan turned back took another look at her she was getting some sun and it looked good on her warmed her skin she had a long face that went with the long body though the chin tended to be stubborn a man could take a glance and he would see a long cool blonde a pretty body a face that made you want to look just a little longer and if you did youd see shadows under the big green eyes and weariness around the soft mouth you dont have to do that grace you ought to go on home and relax a while youre on at shineys tonight arent you ive got time and i promised seth sloppy joes it wont take me long she shifted as ethan continued to stare at her shed long ago accepted that those long thoughtful looks from him would stir her blood just another of lifes little problems she supposed what she demanded and rubbed a hand over her cheek as if expecting to find a smudge nothing well if youre going to cook you ought to hang around and help us eat it id like that she relaxed again and moved forward to take the bucket and mop from him and put them away herself aubrey loves being here with you and seth why dont you go on in with them ive got some laundry to finish up then ill start dinner ill give you a hand no you wont it was another point of pride for her they paid her she did the work all the work go on in the front room and be sure to ask seth about the math test he got back today howd he do another a she winked and shooed ethan away seth had such a sharp brain she thought as she headed into the laundry room off the kitchen if shed had a better head for figures for practical matters when shed been younger she wouldnt have dreamed her way through school shed have learned a skill a real one not just serving drinks and tending house or picking crabs shed have had a career to fall back on when she found herself alone and pregnant with all her hopes of running off to new york to be a dancer dashed like glass on brick it had been a silly dream anyway she told herself unloading the dryer and shifting the wet clothes from the washer into it pie in the sky her mama would say but the fact was growing up there had only been two things shed wanted the dance and ethan quinn shed never gotten either she sighed a little holding the warm smooth sheet she took from the basket to her cheek ethans sheet shed taken it off his bed that day shed been able to smell him on it then and maybe for just a minute or two shed let herself dream a little of what it might have been like if hed wanted her if she had slept with him on those sheets in his house but dreaming didnt get the work done or pay the rent or buy the things her little girl needed briskly she began to fold the sheets laying them neatly on the rumbling dryer there was no shame in earning her keep by cleaning houses or serving drinks she was good at both in any case she was useful and she was needed that was good enough she certainly hadnt been useful or needed by the man she was married to so briefly if theyd loved each other really loved each other it would have been different for her it had been a desperate need to belong to someone to be wanted and desired as a woman for jack√¢ grace shook her head she honestly didnt know what she had been for jack an attraction she supposed that had resulted in conception she knew he believed hed done the honorable thing by taking her to the courthouse and standing with her in front of the justice of the peace on that chilly fall day and exchanging vows he had never mistreated her he had never gotten mean drunk and knocked her around the way she knew some men did wives they didnt want he didnt go sniffing after other women at least not that she knew about but shed seen as aubrey grew inside her and her belly rounded shed seen the look of panic come into his eyes then one day he was simply gone without a word the worst of it was grace thought now shed been relieved if jack had done anything for her it was to force her to grow up to take charge and what hed given her was worth more than the stars she put the folded laundry in a basket hitched the basket on her hip and walked into the front room there was her treasure her curly blond hair bouncing her pretty rosycheeked face alight with joy as she sat on ethans lap and babbled at him at two aubrey monroe resembled a botticelli angel all rose and gilt with brightgreen eyes and dimples denting her cheeks little kitten teeth and longfingered hands though he could decipher only half her chatter ethan nodded soberly and what did foolish do then he asked as he figured out she was telling him some story about seths puppy licked my face her eyes laughing she took both hands and ran them up over her cheeks all over grinning she cupped her hands on ethans face and fell into a game she liked to play with him ouch she giggled rubbed his face again beard obliging he skimmed his knuckles over her smooth cheek then jerked his hand back ouch youve got one too no you no he pulled her close and planted noisy kisses on her cheeks while she wriggled in delight you screaming with laughter now she wiggled away and dived for the boy sprawled on the floor seth beard she covered his cheek with sloppy kisses manhood demanded that he wince jeez aub give me a break to distract her he picked up one of her toy cars and ran it lightly down her arm youre a racetrack her eyes beamed with the thrill of a new game snatching the car she ran it not quite so gently over any part of seth she could reach ethan only grinned you started it pal he told seth when aubrey walked over seths thigh to reach his other shoulder its better than getting slobbered on seth claimed but his arm came up to keep aubrey from tumbling to the floor for a few moments grace simply stood and watched the man relaxed in the big wing chair and grinning down at the children the children themselves their heads close one delicate and covered with gold curls the other with a shaggy mop shades and shades deeper the little lost boy she thought and her heart went out to him as it had from the first day shed seen him hed found his way home her precious girl when aubrey had been only a fluttering in her womb grace had promised to cherish to protect and to enjoy her she would always have a home and the man who had once been a lost boy who had slipped into her girlish dreams years before and had never really slipped out again he had made a home the rain drummed on the roof the television was a low unimportant murmur dogs slept on the front porch and the moist wind blew through the screen door and she yearned where she knew she had no business yearning to set down the basket of laundry to go over and climb into ethans lap to be welcomed there even expected there to close her eyes for just a little while and be part of it all instead she retreated finding herself unable to step into that quiet lazy ease she went back to the kitchen where the overhead lights were bright and just a little hard there she set the basket on the table and began to gather what she needed to make dinner when ethan came in a few moments later to hunt up a beer she had meat browning potatoes frying in peanut oil and a salad under way smells great he stood awkwardly for a minute he wasnt used to having someone cook for him not for years and then not a woman his father had been at home in the kitchen but his mother√¢ theyd always joked that whenever she cooked they needed all her medical skills to survive the meal itll be ready in half an hour or so i hope you dont mind eating early ive got to get aubrey home and bathed and then change for work i never mind eating especially when im not doing the cooking and the fact is i want to get to the boatyard for a couple hours tonight oh she looked back blowing at her bangs you should have told me id have hurried things up this pace works for me he took a pull from the bottle you want a drink or something no im fine i was going to use that salad dressing phillip made up it looks so much prettier than the storebought the rain was letting up petering out into slow drizzling drops with watery sunlight struggling to break through grace glanced toward the window she was always hoping to see a rainbow annas flowers are doing well she commented the rains good for them saves me from dragging out the hose shed have my head if they died on her while shes gone wouldnt blame her she worked so hard getting them planted before the wedding grace worked quickly competently as she spoke draining crisp potatoes adding more to the sizzling oil it was such a beautiful wedding she went on as she mixed sauce for the meat in a bowl came off all right we got lucky with the weather oh it couldnt have rained that day it would have been a sin she could see it all again so clearly the green of the grass in the backyard the sparkling of water the flowers anna had planted glowing with color and the ones shed bought spilling out of pots and bowls alongside the white runner that the bride had walked down to meet her groom a white dress billowing the thin veil only accentuating the dark deliriously happy eyes chairs had been filled with friends and family annas grandparents had both wept and cam roughandtumble cameron quinn had looked at his bride as if hed just been given the keys to heaven a backyard wedding grace thought now sweet simple romantic perfect shes the most beautiful woman ive ever seen grace said it with a sigh that was only lightly touched with envy so dark and exotic she suits cam they looked like movie stars all polished and glossy she smiled to herself as she stirred spicy sauce into the meat when you and phillip played that waltz for their first dance it was the most romantic thing ive ever seen she sighed again as she finished putting the salad together and now theyre in rome i can hardly imagine it they called yesterday morning to catch me before i left they said theyre having a good time she laughed at that a rippling smoky sound that seemed to cruise along his skin honeymooning in rome it would be hard not to she started to scoop out more potatoes and swore lightly as oil popped and splattered on the side of her hand damn even as she was lifting the slight burn to her mouth to soothe it ethan leaped forward and grabbed her hand did it get you he saw the pinkening skin and pulled her to the sink run some cold water on it its nothing its just a little burn happens all the time it wouldnt if you were more careful his brows were knitted his hand gripping her fingers firmly to keep her hand under the stream of water does it hurt no she couldnt feel anything but his hand on her fingers and her own heart thundering in her chest knowing shed make a fool of herself any moment she tried to pull free its nothing ethan dont fuss you need some salve on it he started to reach up into the cupboard to find some and his head lifted his eyes met hers he stood there the water running both of their hands trapped under the chilly fall of it he tried never to stand quite so close to her not so close that he could see those little gold dust flecks in her eyes because he would start to think about them to wonder about them then hed have to remind himself that this was grace the girl hed watched grow up the woman who was aubreys mother a neighbor who considered him a trusted friend you need to take better care of yourself his voice was rough as the words worked their way through a throat that had gone dustdry she smelled of lemons im fine she was dying somewhere between giddy pleasure and utter despair he was holding her hand as if it were as fragile as spun glass and he was frowning at her as if she were slightly less sensible than her twoyearold daughter the potatoes are going to burn ethan oh well mortified because hed been thinking just for a second that her mouth might taste as soft as it looked he jerked back fumbling now for the tube of salve his heart was jumping and he hated the sensation he preferred things calm and easy put some of this on it anyway he laid it on the counter and backed up ill√¢ get the kids washed up for dinner he scooped up the laundry basket on his way and was gone with deliberate movements grace shut the water off then turned and rescued her fries satisfied with the progress of the meal she picked up the salve and smoothed a little on the reddened splotch on her hand before tidily replacing the tube in the cupboard then she leaned on the sink looked out the window but she couldnt find a rainbow in the sky chapter two contents prev next there was nothing like a saturday unless it was the saturday leading up to the last week of school and into summer vacation that of course was all the saturdays of your life rolled into one big shiny ball saturday meant spending the day out on the workboat with ethan and jim instead of in a classroom it meant hard work and hot sun and cold drinks man stuff with his eyes shaded under the bill of his orioles cap and the really cool sunglasses hed bought on a trip to the mall seth shot out the gaff to drag in the next marker buoy his young muscles bunched under his xfiles tshirt which assured him that the truth was out there he watched jim work tilt the pot and unhook the oystercanlid stopper to the bait box on the bottom of the pot shake out the old bait seth noted and see the seagulls dive and scream like maniacs cool now get a good solid hold on that pot turn it over and shake it like crazy so the crabs in the upstairs section fall out into the washtub waiting for them seth figured he could do all that if he really wanted to he wasnt afraid of a bunch of stupid crabs just because they looked like big mutant bugs from venus and had claws that tended to snap and pinch instead his job was to rebait the pot with a couple handfuls of disgusting fish parts do the stopper check to make sure there were no snags in the line eyeball the distance between markers and if everything looked good toss the pot overboard splash then he got to toss out the gaff for the next buoy he knew how to tell the sooks from the jimmies now jim said the girl crabs painted their fingernails because their pincers were red it was wild the way the patterns on the underbellies looked like sex parts anybody could see that the guy crabs had this long t shape there that looked just like a dick jim had shown him a couple of crabs mating too he called them doublers and that was just too much the guy crab just climbed aboard the girl tucked her under him and swam around like that for days seth figured they had to like it ethan had said the crabs were married and when seth had snickered he lifted a brow seth had found himself intrigued enough to go to the school library and read up on crabs and he thought he understood sort of what ethan meant the guy protected the girl by keeping her under him because she could only mate when she was in her last molt and her shell was soft so she was vulnerable even after theyd done it he kept carrying her like that until her shell was hard again and she was only going to mate once so it was like getting married he thought of how cam and miss spinelli anna he reminded himself he got to call her anna now had gotten married lots of the women got all leaky and the guys laughed and joked everybody made such a big deal out of it with flowers and music and tons of food he didnt get it it seemed to him getting married just meant you got to have sex whenever you wanted and nobody got snotty about it but it had been cool hed never been to anything like it even though cam had dragged him out to the mall and made him try on suits it was mostly okay maybe sometimes he worried about how it was going to change things just when he was getting used to the way things were there was going to be a woman in the house now he liked anna okay shed played square with him even though she was a social worker but she was still a female like his mother seth clamped down on that thought if he thought about his mother if he thought about the life hed had with her the men the drugs the dirty little rooms it would spoil the day he hadnt had enough sunny days in his ten years to risk ruining one you taking a nap there seth ethans mild voice snapped seth back to the moment he blinked saw the sun glinting off the water the orange floats bobbing just thinking seth muttered and quickly pulled in another buoy me i dont do much thinking jim set the trap on the gunwale and began culling crabs his leathered face creased in grins gives you brain fever shit seth said leaning over to study the catch that ones starting to molt jim grunted held up a crab with a shell cracking along the back this busterll be somebodys softshell sandwich by tomorrow he winked at seth as he tossed the crab into the tank maybe mine foolish who was still young enough to deserve the name sniffed at the trap inciting a quick and ugly crab riot as claws snapped the pup leaped back with a yelp that there dog jim shook with laughter he dont have to worry about no brain fever even when theyd taken the days catch to the waterfront emptied the tank and dropped jim off the day wasnt over ethan stepped back from the controls weve got to go into the boatyard you want to take her in though seths eyes were shielded by the dark sunglasses ethan imagined that their expression matched the boys dropped jaw it only amused him when seth jerked a shoulder as if such things were an everyday occurrence sure no problem with sweaty palms seth took the helm ethan stood by hands casually tucked in his back pockets eyes alert there was plenty of water traffic a pretty weekend afternoon drew the recreational sailors to the bay but they didnt have far to go and the kid had to learn sometime you couldnt live in st chris and not know how to pilot a workboat a little to starboard he told seth see that skiff there sunday sailor and hes going to cut right across your bow if you keep this heading seth narrowed his eyes studied the boat and the people on deck he snorted thats because hes paying more attention to that girl in the bikini than to the wind well she looks fine in the bikini i dont see whats the big deal about breasts to his credit ethan didnt laugh out loud but nodded soberly i guess part of thats because we dont have them i sure dont want any give it a couple of years ethan murmured under the cover of the engine noise and the thought of that made him wince what the hell were they going to do when the kid hit puberty somebody was going to have to talk to him about√¢ things he knew seth already had too much sexual knowledge but it was all the dark and sticky sort the same sort he himself had known about at much too early an age one of them was going to have to explain how things should be could be and before too much more time passed he hoped to hell it wasnt going to have to be him he caught sight of the boatyard the old brick building the spanking new dock he and his brothers had built pride rippled through him maybe it didnt look like much with its pitted bricks and patched roof but they were making something out of it the windows were dusty but they were new and unbroken cut back on the throttle take her in slow absently ethan put a hand over seths on the controls he felt the boy stiffen then relax he still had a problem with being touched unexpectedly ethan noted but it was passing thats the way just a bit more to starboard when the boat bumped gently against the pilings ethan jumped onto the pier to secure lines nice job at his nod simon all but quivering with anticipation leaped overboard yipping frantically foolish clambered onto the gunwale hesitated then followed hand me up the cooler seth grunting only a little seth hefted it maybe i could pilot the boat sometime when were crabbing maybe ethan waited for the boy to scramble safely onto the pier before heading to the rear cargo doors of the building they were already open wide and the soulstirring sound of ray charles flowed out through them ethan set the cooler down just inside the doors and put his hands on his hips the hull was finished cam had put in dogs hours to get that much done before he left for his honeymoon theyd planked it rabbeting the edges so that they would lap yet remain smooth at the seams the two of them had completed the steambent framing using pencil lines as guides and walking each frame carefully into place with slow steady pressure the hull was solid there would be no splits in a quinn boats planking the design was primarily ethans with a few adjustments here and there of cams the hull was an arcbottom expensive to construct but with the virtues of stability and speed ethan knew his client hed designed the shape of the bow with this in mind and had decided on a cruiser bow attractive and again good for speed buoyant the stern was a counterdesign of moderate length providing an overhang that would make the boats length greater than her waterline length it was a sleek appealing look ethan understood that his client was every bit as concerned with appearance as he was with basic seaworthiness hed used seth for grunt labor when it was time to coat the interior with the fiftyfifty mix of hot linseed oil and turpentine it was sweaty work guaranteed to cause a few burns despite caution and gloves still the boy had held up fine from where he stood ethan could study the sheerline the outline at the top edge of the hull hed gone with a flattened sheerline to ensure a roomier drier craft with good headroom below his client liked to take friends and family out for a sail the man had insisted on teak though ethan had told him pine or cedar would have done the job well enough for hull planking the man had money to spend on his hobby ethan thought now and money to spend on status but he had to admit the teak looked wonderful his brother phillip was working on the decking stripped to the waist in defense against the heat and humidity his dark bronze hair protected by a black cap without team name or emblem and worn bill to the back he was screwing the deck planks into place every few seconds the hard highpitched buzz of the electric driver competed with ray charless creamy tenor hows it going ethan called over the din phillips head came up his martyredangels face was damp with sweat his goldenbrown eyes annoyed hed just been reminding himself that he was an advertising executive for gods sake not a carpenter its hotter than a summer in hell in here and its only june weve got to get some fans in here you got anything cold or at least wet in that cooler i ran out of liquids an hour ago turn on the tap in the john and you get water ethan said mildly as he bent to take a cold soft drink from the cooler its a new technology christ knows whats in that tap water phillip caught the can ethan tossed him and grimaced at the label at least they tell you what chemicals they load in here sorry we drank all the evian you know how jim is about his designer water cant get enough of it screw you phillip said but without heat he glugged the chilly pepsi then raised a brow when ethan came up to inspect his work nice job gee thanks boss can i have a raise sure double what youre getting now seths the math whiz whats zip times zip seth double zip seth said with a quick grin his fingers itched to try out the electric screwdriver so far nobody would let him touch it or any of the other power tools well now i can afford that cruise to tahiti why dont you grab a shower unless you object to washing with tap water too i can take over here it was tempting phillip was grimy sweaty and miserably hot he would cheerfully have killed three strangers for one cold glass of pouillyfuisse but he knew ethan had been up since before dawn and had already put in what any normal person would consider a full day i can handle a couple more hours fine it was exactly the response ethan had expected phillip tended to bitch but he never let you down i think we can get this deck knocked out before we call it a day can i no ethan and phillip said together anticipating seths question why the hell not he demanded im not stupid i wont shoot anybody with a stupid screw or anything because we like to play with it phillip smiled and were bigger than you here he reached into his back pocket pulled out his wallet and found a five go on down to crawfords and get me some bottled water if you dont whine about it you can get some ice cream with the change seth didnt whine but he did mutter about being used like a slave as he called his dog and headed out we ought to show him how to use the tools when we have more time ethan commented hes got good hands yeah but i wanted him out i didnt have the chance to tell you last night the detective tracked gloria delauter as far as nags head shes heading south then he lifted his gaze to phillips he pin her yet no she moves around a lot and shes using cash a lot of cash his mouth tightened shes got plenty to toss around since dad paid her a bundle for seth doesnt look like shes interested in coming back here id say shes got as much interest in that kid as a rabid alley cat has in a dead kitten his own mother had been the same phillip remembered when shed been around at all he had never met gloria delauter but he knew her despised her if we dont find her phillip added rolling the cold can over his forehead were never going to get to the truth about dad or seth ethan nodded he knew phillip was on a mission here and knew he was most likely right but he wondered much too often for comfort what they would do when they had the truth ethans plans after a fourteenhour workday were to take an endless shower and drink a cold beer he did both simultaneously theyd gotten takeout subs for dinner and he had his on the back porch alone in the soft quiet of early twilight inside seth and phillip were arguing over which video to watch first arnold schwarzenegger was doing battle with kevin costner ethan had already placed his bets on arnold they had an unspoken agreement that phillip would take responsibility for seth on saturday nights it gave ethan a choice for the evening he could go in and join them as he sometimes did for these movie fests he could go up and settle in with a book as he often preferred to do he could go out as he rarely did before his father had died so suddenly and life had changed for all of them ethan had lived in his own little house with his own quiet routine he still missed it though he tried not to resent the young couple who were now renting it from him they loved the coziness of it and told him so often the small rooms with their tall windows the little covered porch the shady privacy of the trees that sheltered it and the gentle lap of water against shore he loved it too with cam married and anna moving in he might have been able to slip out again but the rental money was needed now and more important hed given his word he would live here until all the legal battles were waged and won and seth was permanently theirs he rocked listening to the night birds begin to call and must have dozed because the dream came and came clearly you always were more of a loner than the others ray commented he sat on the porch rail turned slightly so he could look out to the water if he chose his hair was shiny as a silver coin in the half light blowing free in the steady breeze always liked to go off by yourself to think your thoughts and work out your troubles i knew i could always come to you or mom i just liked to have a handle on things first how about now ray shifted to face ethan directly i dont know maybe i havent gotten a good handle on it yet seths settling in hes easier with us the first few weeks i kept expecting him to rabbit off losing you hurt him almost as much as it did us maybe just as much because hed just started to believe things were okay for him it was bad the way he had to live before i brought him here still it wasnt as bad as what youd faced ethan and you got through almost didnt ethan took out one of his cigars took his time lighting it sometimes it still comes back on me pain and shame and the sweaty fear of knowing whats going to happen he shrugged it off seths a little younger than i was i think hes already shed some of it as long as he doesnt have to deal with his mother again hell have to deal with her eventually but he wont be alone thats the difference youll all stand by him you always stood by each other ray smiled his big wide face creasing everywhere at once what are you doing sitting out here alone on a saturday night ethan i swear boy you worry me had a long day when i was your age i put in long days and longer nights you just turned thirty for christs sake porch sitting on a warm saturday night in june is for old men go on take a drive see where you end up he winked i bet we both know where thats likely to be the sudden blare of automatic gunfire and screams made ethan jerk in his chair he blinked and stared hard at the porch rail there was no one there of course there was no one there he told himself with a quick shake hed nodded off for a minute that was all and the movie action in the living room had wakened him but when he glanced down he saw the glowing cigar in his hand baffled he simply stared at it had he actually taken it out of his pocket and lit it in his sleep that was ridiculous absurd he must have done it before hed drifted off the habit so automatic that his mind just didnt register the moves still why had he fallen asleep when he didnt feel the least bit tired in fact he felt restless and edgy and too alert he rose rubbing the back of his neck stretching his legs on a pacing journey up and down the porch he should just go in and settle down with the movie some popcorn and another beer even as he reached for the screen door he swore he wasnt in the mood for saturday night at the movies he would just take a drive and see where he ended up graces feet were numb all the way to the ankles the cursed high heels that were part of her cocktail waitress uniform were killers it wasnt so bad on a weekday evening when you had time now and then to step out of them or even sit for a few minutes but shineys pub always hopped on saturday night and so did she she carted her tray of empty glasses and full ashtrays to the bar efficiently unloading as she called out her order to the bartender two house whites two drafts a gin and tonic and a club soda with lime she had to pitch her voice over the crowd noise and what was loosely called music from the threepiece band shiney had hired the music was always lousy at the pub because shiney wouldnt shell out the money for decent musicians but no one seemed to care the stingy dance floor was bumper to bumper with dancers and the band took this as a sign to boost the volume graces head was ringing like steel bells and her back was beginning to throb in time with the bass her order complete she carried the tray through the narrow spaces between tables and hoped that the group of young tourists in trendy clothes would be decent tippers she served them with a smile nodded at the signal to run a tab and followed the hail to the next table her break was still ten minutes away it might as well have been ten years hey there grade hows it going curtis bobbie shed gone to school with them in the dim distant past now they worked for her father packing seafood usual yeah a couple of drafts curtis gave grace his usual a quick pat on her bowclad butt shed learned not to worry about it from him it was a harmless enough gesture even a show of affectionate support some of the outlanders who dropped in had hands a great deal less harmless hows that pretty girl of yours grace smiled understanding that this was one of the reasons she tolerated his pats he always asked about aubrey getting prettier every day she saw another hand pop up from a nearby table ill get you those beers in just a minute she was carting a tray full of mugs bowls of beer nuts and glasses when ethan walked in she nearly bobbled it he never came into the pub on saturday night sometimes he dropped in for a quiet beer midweek but never when the place was crowded and noisy he should have looked the same as every second man in the place his jeans were faded but clean a plain white tshirt tucked into them his work boots ancient and scuffed but he didnt look the same as other men and never had to grace maybe it was the lean and rangy body that moved as easily as a dancer through the narrow spaces innate grace she mused the kind that cant be taught and still so blatantly male he always looked as though he was walking the deck of a ship it could have been his face so bony and rugged and somewhere just at the edges of handsome or the eyes always so clear and thoughtful so serious that it seemed to take them a few seconds to catch up whenever his mouth curved she served her drinks pocketed money took more orders and watched out of the corner of her eye as he squeezed into a standing spot at the bar directly beside the order station she forgot all about her muchdesired break three drafts bottle of mich stoli rocks absently she brushed at her bangs and smiled hi ethan busy tonight summer saturday do you want a table no this is fine the bartender was busy with another order which gave her some breathing room steves got his hands full but hell work his way down here im not in any hurry as a rule he tried not to think about how she looked in the buttskimming skirt those endless legs in black fishnet the narrow feet in skinny heels but tonight he was in a mood and so he let himself think just at that moment he could have explained to seth just what the big deal was about breasts graces were small and high and a soft portion of the curve showed over the lowcut bodice of her blouse suddenly he desperately wanted a beer you get a chance to sit down at all she didnt answer for a moment her mind had gone glassblank at the way those quiet thoughtful eyes had skimmed over her i ah√¢ yes its nearly time for my break her hands felt clumsy as she gathered up her order i like to go outside get away from the noise struggling to act normally she rolled her eyes toward the band and was rewarded with ethans slow grin do they ever get worse than this oh yeah these guys are a real step up she was nearly relaxed again as she lifted the tray and headed off to serve he watched her while he sipped the beer steve had pulled for him watched the way her legs moved the way the foolish and incredibly sexy bow swayed with her hips and the way she bent her knees balancing the tray lifting drinks from it onto a table he watched eyes narrowing as curtis once again gave her a friendly pat his eyes narrowed further when a stranger in a faded jim morrison tshirt grabbed her hand tugging her closer he saw grace flash a smile give a shake of her head ethan was already pushing away from the bar not entirely sure what he intended to do when the man released her when grace came back to set down her tray it was ethan who grabbed her hand take your break what i to her shock he was pulling her steadily through the room ethan i really need to take your break he said again and shoved the door open the air outside was clean and fresh the night warm and breezy the minute the door closed behind them the noise shut down to a muffled echoing roar and the stink of smoke sweat and beer became a memory i dont think you should be working here she gaped at him the statement itself was odd enough but to hear him deliver it in a tone that was obviously annoyed was baffling excuse me you heard me grace he shoved his hands in his pockets because he didnt know what to do with them left free they might have grabbed her again its not right its not right she repeated at sea youre a mother for gods sake what are you doing serving drinks wearing that outfit getting hit on that guy in there practically had his face down your blouse oh he did not torn between amusement and exasperation she shook her head for heavens sake ethan he was just being typical and harmless curtis had his hand on your ass amusement was veering toward annoyance i know where his hand was and if it worried me id have knocked it off ethan took a breath hed started this wisely or not and he was going to finish it you shouldnt be working half naked in some bar or knocking anybodys hand off your ass you should be home with aubrey her eyes went from mildly irritated to blazing fury oh is that right is that your considered opinion well thank you so much for sharing it with me and for your information if i wasnt working and im damn well not half naked i wouldnt have a home youve got a job he said stubbornly cleaning houses thats right i clean houses i serve drinks and now and then i pick crabs thats how amazingly skilled and versatile i am i also pay rent insurance medical bills utilities and a babysitter i buy food i buy clothes gas i take care of myself and my daughter i dont need you coming around here telling me its not right im just saying i hear what youre saying her heels were throbbing and every ache in her overtaxed body was making itself known worse much worse was the hard prick of embarrassment that he would look down on her for what she did to survive i serve cocktails and let men look at my legs maybe theyll tip better if they like them and if they tip better i can buy my little girl something that makes her smile so they can look all they damn well please and i wish to god i had the kind of body that filled out this stupid outfit because then id earn more he had to pause before speaking to gather his thoughts her face was flushed with anger but her eyes were so tired it broke his heart youre selling yourself short grace he said quietly i know exactly how much im worth ethan her chin angled right down to the last penny now my breaks over she spun on her miserably throbbing heels and stalked back into the noise and the smokeclogged air chapter three contents prev next need bunny too okay baby well get your bunny it was grace thought always an expedition they were only going as far as the sandbox in the backyard but aubrey never failed to demand that all her stuffed pals accompany her grace had solved this logistical problem with an enormous shopping bag inside it were a bear two dogs a fish and a very tattered cat the bunny joined them though graces eyes were gritty from lack of sleep she grinned broadly as aubrey tried to heft the bag herself ill carry them honey no me it was grace thought aubreys favorite phrase her baby liked to do things herself even when it would be simpler to let someone else do the job wonder where she gets that from grace mused and laughed at both of them okay lets get the crew outside she opened the screen door it squeaked badly reminding her that she needed to oil the hinges and waited while aubrey dragged the bag over the threshold and onto the tiny back porch grace had livened up the porch by painting it a soft blue and adding clay pots filled with pink and white geraniums in her mind the little rental house was temporary but she didnt want it to feel temporary she wanted it to feel like home at least until she saved enough money for a down payment on a place of their own inside the room sizes were on the stingy side but shed solved that and helped her bank balance by keeping furniture to a minimum most of what she had were yard sale bargains but shed painted refinished recovered and turned each piece into her own it was vital to grace to have her own the house had ancient plumbing a roof that leaked water after a hard rain and windows that leaked air but it had two bedrooms which had been essential shed wanted her daughter to have a room of her own a bright cheerful room she had seen to that papering the walls herself painting the trim adding fussy curtains it was already breaking her heart knowing that it was about time to dismantle aubreys crib and replace it with a youth bed be careful on the steps grace warned and aubrey started down both tiny tennis shoes planting themselves firmly on each of the steps on the descent the minute she hit bottom she began to run dragging her bag behind her and squealing in anticipation she loved the sandbox it made grace proud to watch aubrey make her traditional beeline for it grace had built it herself using scrap lumber that she meticulously sanded smooth and painted a bright crayola red in it were the pails and shovels and big plastic cars but she knew aubrey would touch none of them until shed set out her pets one day grace promised herself aubrey would have a real puppy and a playroom so that she could have friends visit and spend long rainy afternoons grace crouched down as aubrey placed her toys carefully in the white sand you sit right in here and play while i mow the lawn promise okay aubrey beamed up at her dimples winking you play in a little while she stroked aubreys curls she could never get enough of touching this miracle that had come from her before rising she looked around mothers eyes scanning for any danger the yard was fenced and she had installed a childproof lock on the gate herself aubrey tended to be curious a flowering vine rambled along the fence that bordered her house and the cutters and would have it buried in bloom by summers end no one was stirring next door she noted too early on a sunday morning for her neighbors to be doing more than lazing about and thinking of breakfast julie cutter the eldest daughter of the house was her muchtreasured babysitter she noted that julies mother irene had spent some time in her garden the day before not a single weed dared show its head in irene cutters flowers or in her vegetable patch with some embarrassment grace glanced toward the rear of her yard where she and aubrey had planted some tomatoes and beans and carrots plenty of weeds there she thought with a sigh shed have to deal with that after cutting the lawn god only knew why shed thought she would have time to tend a garden but it had been such fun to dig the dirt and plant the seeds with her little girl just as it would be such fun to step into the sandbox and build castles and make up games no you dont grace ordered herself and rose the lawn was nearly anklehigh it might have been rented grass but it was hers now and her responsibility no one was going to say that grace monroe couldnt tend her own she kept the ancient secondhand lawn mower under an equally ancient drop cloth as usual she checked the gas level first casting another glance over her shoulder to be certain aubrey was still tucked in the sandbox gripping the starter cord with both hands she yanked and got a wheezing cough in response come on dont mess with me this morning shed lost count of the times shed fiddled and repaired and banged on the old machine rolling her protesting shoulders she yanked again then a third time before letting the cord snap back and pressing her fingers to her eyes wouldnt you just know it giving you trouble her head jerked around after their argument the night before ethan was the last person grace expected to see standing in her backyard it didnt please her particularly since shed told herself she could and would stay mad at him worse she knew how she looked old gray shorts and a tshirt that had seen too many washings not a stitch of makeup and her hair uncombed damn it shed dressed for yard work not for company i can handle it she yanked again her foot clad in a sneaker with a hole in the toe planted on the side of the machine it nearly caught very nearly let it rest a minute youre just going to flood it this time the cord snapped back with a dangerous hiss i know how to start my own lawn mower i imagine you do when youre not mad he walked over as he spoke all lean and easy male in faded jeans and a work shirt rolled up to his elbows he had come around back when she didnt answer her door and he knew hed stood watching her a little longer than was strictly polite she had such a pretty way of moving he had decided sometime during the restless night that he had better find a way to make amends and hed spent a good part of his morning trying to figure how to do so then hed seen her all those long slim limbs the sun was turning pale gold the sunny hair the narrow hands and hed just wanted to watch for a bit im not mad she said in an impatient hiss that proved her statement a lie he only looked into her eyes listen grace eeeethan with a shriek of pure pleasure aubrey scrambled out of the sandbox and ran to him fullout arms extended face lit up with joy he caught her swung her up and around hey there aubrey come play well im kiss she puckered her little lips with such energy that he had to laugh and give them a friendly peck okay she wiggled down and ran back to her sandbox look grace im sorry if i was out of line last night the fact that her heart had melted when he held her daughter only made her more determined to stand firm if he shifted his feet clearly uncomfortable i just meant that his explanation was interrupted as aubrey raced back with her beloved stuffed dogs kiss she stated very firmly and held them up to ethan he obliged waiting until she raced away again what i meant was i think you said what you meant ethan she was going to be stubborn he thought with an inward sigh well she always had been i didnt say it very well i get tangled up with words most of the time i hate to see you working so hard he paused patient when aubrey came back demanding a kiss for her bear i worry about you some thats all grace angled her head why why the question threw him he bent to kiss the stuffed bunny that aubrey batted against his leg well i√¢because because im a woman she suggested because im a single parent because my father considers that i smeared the family name by not only having to get married but getting myself divorced no he took a step closer to her absently kissing the cat that aubrey held up to him because ive known you more than half my life and that makes you part of it and because maybe youre too stubborn or too proud to see when somebody just wants to see things go a little easier for you she started to tell him she appreciated that felt herself begin to soften then he ruined it and because i didnt like seeing men paw at you paw at me her back went up her chin went out men were not pawing at me ethan and if they do i know what to do about it dont get all riled up again he scratched his chin struggled not to sigh he didnt see the point in arguing with a woman you could never win i came over here to tell you i was sorry and so maybe i could kiss aubrey demanded and began to climb up his leg instinctively ethan pulled her up into his arms and kissed her cheek i was going to say no kiss mama bouncing in his arms aubrey pushed at his lips to make them pucker kiss mama aubrey mortified grace reached for her daughter only to have aubrey cling to ethans shirt like a small golden burr leave ethan be now changing tactics aubrey laid her head on ethans shoulder and smiled sweetly one arm clinging like a vine around his neck as grace tugged at her kiss mama she crooned and batted her eyes at ethan if grace had laughed instead of looking so embarrassed and just a little nervous ethan thought he could have brushed his lips over her brow and settled the matter but her cheeks had gone pink it was so endearing she wouldnt meet his eyes and her breath was unsteady he watched her bite her bottom lip and decided he might as well settle the matter another way entirely he laid a hand on graces shoulder with aubrey caught between them thisll be easier he murmured and touched his lips lightly to hers it wasnt easier it rocked her heart it could barely be considered a kiss was over almost before it began it was nothing more than a quiet brush of lips an instant of taste and texture and a whiff of promise that made her long desperately impossibly in all the years hed known her he had never touched his mouth to hers now with just this fleeting sampling he wondered why hed waited so long and worried that the wondering would change everything aubrey clapped her hands in glee but he barely heard it graces eyes were on his now that misty swimming green and their faces were close close enough that he only had to ease forward a fraction if he wanted to taste again to linger this time he thought as her lips parted on a trembling breath no me aubrey planted her small soft mouth on her mothers cheek then ethans come play grace jerked back like a puppet whose strings had been rudely yanked the silky pink cloud that had begun to fog her brain evaporated soon honey moving quickly now she plucked aubrey out of ethans arms and set her on her feet go on and build me a castle for us to live in she gave aubrey a gentle pat on the rump and sent her off at a run then she cleared her throat youre awfully good to her ethan i appreciate it he decided the best place for his hands under the circumstances was his pockets he wasnt sure what to do about the itchy feeling in them shes a sweetheart deliberately he turned to watch aubrey in her red sandbox and a handful she needed to get her feet back under her grace told herself and to do what needed to be done next why dont we just forget last night ethan im sure you meant it all for the best realitys just not always what wed choose or what wed like it to be he turned back slowly and those quiet eyes of his focused on her face what do you want it to be grace what i want is for aubrey to have a home and a family i think im pretty close to that he shook his head no what do you want for grace besides her she looked over at her daughter and smiled i dont even remember anymore right now i want my lawn mowed and my vegetables weeded i appreciate you coming by like this she turned away and prepared to give the starter cord another yank ill be by the house tomorrow she went very still when his hand closed over hers ill cut the grass i can do it she couldnt even start the damn lawn mower he thought but was wise enough not to mention it i didnt say you couldnt i said id do it she couldnt turn around couldnt risk what it would do to her system to be that close again face to face you have chores of your own grace are we going to stand here all day arguing over whos going to cut this grass i could have it done twice over by the time we finish and you could be saving your string beans from being choked out by those weeds i was going to get to them her voice was thin they were both bent over all but spooned together the flash of sheer animal lust that streaked through the familiar yearning for him staggered her get to them now he murmured it willing her to move if she didnt and very quickly he might not be able to hold himself back from putting his hands on her and putting them on her in places they had no business being all right she shifted away moving sideways while her heart knocked at her ribs in short rabbit punches i appreciate it thanks she bit her lip hard because she was going to babble determined to be normal she turned and smiled a little its probably the carburetor again ive got some tools saying nothing ethan grabbed the cord with one hand and yanked it hard twice the engine caught with a dyspeptic roar it ought to do he said mildly when he saw her mouth thin in frustration yeah it ought to struggling not to be annoyed she strode quickly to her vegetable patch and bent over ethan thought as he began to cut the first swath bent over in those thin cotton shorts in a way that forced him to take several long careful breaths she didnt have a clue he decided what it had done to his usually welldisciplined hormones to have her trim little butt snugged back against him what it did to the usually moderate temperature of his blood to have all that long bare leg brushing against his she might be a mother a fact that he reminded himself of often to keep dark and dangerous thoughts at bay but as far as he was concerned she was nearly as innocent and unaware as shed been at fourteen when hed first begun to have those dark and dangerous thoughts about her hed stopped himself from acting on them for gods sake shed just been a kid and a man with his past had no right to touch anyone so unspoiled instead hed been her friend and had found contentment in that hed thought he could continue to be her friend and only her friend but just lately those thoughts had been striking him more often and with more force they were becoming very tricky to control they both had enough complications in their lives he reminded himself he was just going to mow her lawn maybe help her pull some weeds if there was time hed offer to take them into town for some ice cream cones aubrey was partial to strawberry then he had to go down to the boatyard and get to work and since it was his turn to cook he had to figure out that little nuisance but mother or not he thought as grace leaned over to tug out a stubborn dandelion she had a pair of amazing legs grace knew she shouldnt have let herself be persuaded to go into town even for a quick ice cream cone it meant adjusting her days schedule changing into something less disreputable than her gardening clothes and spending more time in ethans company when she was feeling a bit too aware of her needs but aubrey loved these small trips and treats so it was impossible to say no it was only a mile into st chris but they went from quiet neighborhood to busy waterfront the gift and souvenir shops would stay open seven days a week now to take advantage of the summer tourist season couples and families strolled by with shopping bags filled with memories to take home the sky was brilliantly blue and the bay reflected it inviting boats to cruise along its surface a couple of sunday sailors had tangled the lines of their little sunfish letting the sails flop but they appeared to be having the time of their lives despite that small mishap grace could smell fish frying candy melting the coconut sweetness of sunblock and always always the moist fragrance of the water shed grown up on this waterfront watching boats sailing them she ran free along the docks in and out of the shops she learned to pick crabs at her mothers knee gaining the speed and skill needed to separate out the meat that precious commodity that would be packaged and shipped all over the world work hadnt been a stranger but shed always been free her family had lived well if not luxuriously her father didnt believe in spoiling his women with too much pampering still hed been kind and loving even though set in his ways and hed never made her feel that he was disappointed that he had only a daughter instead of sons to carry his name in the end shed disappointed him anyway grace swung aubrey up on her hip and nuzzled her busy today she commented seems to get more crowded every summer but ethan shrugged it off they needed the summer crowds to survive the winters i heard binghams going to expand the restaurant fancy it up too to bring more people in yearround well hes got that chef from up north now and got himself reviewed in the washington post magazine she jiggled aubrey on her hip the egret rest is the only linentablecloth restaurant around here spiffing it up should be good for the town we always went there for dinner on special occasions she set aubrey down trying not to remember that she hadnt seen the inside of the restaurant in over three years she held aubreys hand and let her daughter tug her relentlessly toward crawfords this was another standard of st chris crawfords was for ice cream and cold drinks and takeout submarine sandwiches since it was noon the shop was doing a brisk business grace ordered herself not to spoil things by mentioning that they should be eating sandwiches instead of ice cream hey there grace ethan hello pretty aubrey liz crawford beamed at them even as she skillfully built a coldcut sub shed gone to school with ethan and had dated him for a short careless time that they both remembered with fondness now she was the sturdy frecklefaced mother of two married to junior crawford as he was known to distinguish him from his father senior junior skinny as a scarecrow whistled between his teeth as he rang up sales and sent them a quick salute busy day ethan said dodging an elbow from a customer at the counter tell me liz rolled her eyes deftly wrapped the sub in white paper and handed it along with three others over the counter yall want a sub ice cream aubrey said definitely berry well you go on down and tell mother crawford what you have in mind oh ethan seth was in here shortly ago with danny and will i swear those kids grow like weeds in high summer loaded up on subs and soda pop said they were working down to your boatyard he felt a faint flicker of guilt knowing that phillip was not only working but riding herd on three young boys ill be heading down there myself soon ethan if you dont have time for this√¢ grace began ive got time to eat an ice cream cone with a pretty girl so saying he lifted aubrey up and let her press her nose to the glassfronted counter that held the buckets of handdipped choices liz took the next order and spared a wigglingeyebrow glance toward her husband that spoke volumes ethan quinn and grace monroe it stated clearly well well what do you think of that they took their cones outside where the breeze was warm off the water and wandered away from the crowds to find one of the small iron benches the city fathers had campaigned for armed with a fistful of napkins grace set aubrey on her lap i remember when youd come here and know the name of every face youd see grace murmured mother crawford would be behind the counter reading a paperback novel she felt a wet drip from aubreys ice cream plop on her leg below the hem of her shorts and wiped it up eat around the edges honey before it melts away youd always get strawberry ice cream too hmm as i recall ethan said surprised that the image was so clear in his mind you had a preference for strawberry and grape nehi i guess i did graces sunglasses slipped down her nose as she bent to mop up more drips everything was simple if you had yourself a strawberry cone and a grape nehi some things stay simple because her hands were full ethan nudged graces glasses back up and thought he caught a flicker of something in her eyes behind the shaded lenses some dont he looked out to the water as he applied himself to his own cone a better idea he decided than watching grace take those long slow licks from hers we used to come down here on sundays now and then he remembered all of us piling into the car and riding into town for ice cream or a sub or just to see what was up mom and dad liked to sit under one of the umbrella tables at the diner and drink lemonade i still miss them she said quietly i know you do that winter i caught pneumonia i remember my mother and yours it seemed every time i woke up one or the other of them was right there dr quinn was the kindest woman i ever knew my mama she broke off shook her head what i dont want to make you sad you wont finish it my mother goes to the cemetery every year in the spring and puts flowers on your mothers grave i go with her i didnt realize until the first time we went how much my mother loved her i wondered who put them there its nice knowing whats being said√¢ what some people are saying about my father would have got her irish up shed have scalded more than a few tongues by now thats not your way ethan you have to tend to that business your own way they would both want us to do whats best for seth that would come first you are doing whats best for him every time i see him he looks lighter there was such a heaviness over him when he first came here professor quinn was working his way through that but he had such troubles of his own you know how troubled he was ethan yeah and the guilt weighed like a stone dead center in his heart i know now i have made you sad she shifted toward him so that their knees bumped whatever troubled him it was never you you were one strong steady light in his life anyone could see that if id asked more questions√¢ he began its not your way she said again and forgetting her hand was sticky touched it to his cheek you knew he would talk to you when he was ready when he could then it was too late no it never is her fingers skimmed lightly over his cheek theres always a chance i dont think i could get from one day to the next if i didnt believe theres always a chance dont worry she said softly he felt something move inside him as he reached up to cover her hand with his something shifting and opening then aubrey let out a wild squeal of joy grandpa graces hand jerked then dropped like a stone all the warmth that had flowed out of her chilled her shoulders went straight and stiff as she turned forward again and watched her father walk toward them theres my dollbaby come see grandpa grace let her daughter go watched her race and be caught her father didnt wince or shy away from the sticky hands or smeared lips he laughed and hugged and smacked his lips when kissed lavishly mmm strawberry gimme more he made munching noises on aubreys neck until she screamed with delight then he hitched her easily on his hip and crossed the slight distance to his daughter and no longer smiled grace ethan taking a sunday stroll graces throat was dry and her eyes burned ethan offered to buy us some ice cream well thats nice youre wearing some of it now ethan commented hoping to ease some of the rippling tension that moved in the air pete glanced down to his shirt where aubrey had transferred some of her favored strawberries clothes wash dont often see you around the waterfront on a sunday ethan since you started building that boat taking an hour before i get started on it today hulls finished decks nearly good thats good he nodded meaning it then shifted his gaze to grace your mothers in the diner shell want to see her granddaughter all right i ill take her over he interrupted you can go on home when youre ready to and your motherll bring her on by your place in an hour or two shed have preferred he slap her than speak to her in that polite and distant tone but she nodded as aubrey was already babbling about grandma bye bye mama bye ethan aubrey called over petes shoulder and blew noisy kisses im sorry grace knowing it was inadequate ethan took her hand and found it stiff and cold it doesnt matter it cant matter and he loves aubrey just dotes on her thats what counts its not fair to you your fathers a good man grace but he hasnt been fair to you i let him down she rose quickly wiping her hands on the napkins shed balled up and thats that its nothing more than his pride butting up against yours maybe but my prides important to me she tossed the napkins into a trash container and told herself that was the end of it ive got to get back home ethan theres a million things i should be doing and if ive got a couple hours free id better do them he didnt push but was surprised how strongly he wanted to he hated being nudged and nagged to talk about private matters himself ill drive you home no id like to walk really like to walk thanks for the help she managed a smile that looked almost natural and the ice cream ill be by the house tomorrow make sure you tell seth his laundry goes in the hamper not on the floor she walked away her long legs eating up the ground she made certain she was well away before she allowed her steps to slow before she rubbed a hand over the heart that ached no matter how firmly she ordered it not to there were only two men in her life she had ever really loved it seemed neither of them could want her as she needed them to want her chapter four contents prev next ethan didnt mind music when he worked the fact was his taste in music was both broad and eclectic another gift of the quinns the house had often been filled with it his mother had played a fine piano with as much enthusiasm for the works of chopin as for those of scott joplin his fathers musical talent had been the violin and it was that instrument ethan had gravitated to he enjoyed the varying moods of it and its portability still he found music a waste of sound whenever he was concentrating on a job as he usually didnt hear it after ten minutes anyway silence suited him best during those times but seth liked the radio in the boatyard up and up loud so to keep peace ethan simply tuned out the headpunching rock and roll the hull of the boat had been caulked and filled a laborintensive and timeconsuming task seth had been a lot of help there ethan admitted giving him an extra pair of hands and feet when he needed them though christ knew the boy could complain about the job as much as phillip did ethan tuned that out as well to stay sane he hoped to finish leveling off the decking before phillip arrived for the weekend planing first on one diagonal then across the next at a right angle with any luck he could get some solid work done that week and the next on the cabin and cockpit seth bitched about being on sanding detail but he did a decent job of it ethan only had to tell him to go back and hit portions of the hull planking again a couple of times he didnt mind the boys questions either though he had a million of them once he started whats that piece over there for the bulkhead for the cockpit whyd you cut it out already because we want to get rid of all the dust before we varnish and seal whats all this other shit ethan paused in his own work looking down from his position to where seth frowned at a stack of precut lumber you got the sides and cabin ends the toerail and dropboards it seems like an awful lot of pieces for one stupid boat theres going to be a lot more how come this guy doesnt just buy a boat thats already built good thing for us he isnt the clients deep pockets ethan mused were giving boats by quinn its foundation because he liked the other boat i built for him and so he can tell all his bigshot friends he had a boat designed and handbuilt for him seth changed his sandpaper and applied himself again he didnt mind the work really and he liked the smells of wood and varnish and that linseed oil too but he just didnt get it its taking forever to put it together been at it less than three months lots of people spend a year even longer to build a wooden boat seths jaw dropped a year jesus ethan the loud and very normal whine made ethans mouth twitch relax this isnt going to take us that long once cam gets back and can put in full days on it well move along and once schools out you can pick up a lot of the grunt work school is out hmm today was it now seth grinned wide and bright freedom its a done deal today pausing in his work ethan frowned i thought you had a couple days yet nope hed lost track of things somewhere ethan supposed and it wasnt seths style not yet anyway to volunteer information did you get a report card yeah i passed lets see how ethan set his tools down brushed his hands on his jeans where is it seth shrugged his shoulders and kept sanding its in my backpack over there no big deal lets see it ethan repeated seth did what ethan considered his usual dance rolling his eyes shrugging his shoulders adding a longsuffering sigh oddly enough he didnt end with an oath as he was prone to he walked over to where hed dumped his backpack and riffled through it ethan leaned down over the port side to take the paper seth held up noting the mutinous expression on seths face he expected the news would be grim his stomach did a quick clench and roll the required lecture ethan thought with an inner sigh was going to be damned uncomfortable for both of them ethan studied the thin computergenerated sheet pushing back his cap to scratch his head all as seth jerked a shoulder again stuffed his hands in his pockets yeah so ive never seen a report card with all as before even phillip used to have some bs and maybe a c tossed in embarrassment and the fear of being called egghead or something equally hideous rose swiftly its no big deal he held up a hand for the report card but ethan shook his head the hell its not but he saw seths scowl and thought he understood it it was always hard to be different from the pack you got a good brain and you ought to be proud of it its just there its not like knowing how to pilot a boat or anything you got a good brain and you use it youll figure out how to do most anything ethan folded the paper carefully and tucked it in his pocket damn if he wasnt going to show it off some seems to me we ought to go get a pizza or something puzzled seth narrowed his eyes you packed those lame sandwiches for dinner not good enough now the first time a quinn gets straight as ought to rate at least a pizza he saw seths mouth open and shut watched the staggered delight leap into his eyes before he lowered them sure thatd be cool can you hold off another hour no problem seth grabbed his sandpaper and began to work furiously and blindly his eyes were dazzled his heart in his throat it happened whenever one of them referred to him as a quinn he knew his name was delauter still he had to put it at the top of every stupid paper he did for school didnt he but hearing ethan call him a quinn made that little beam of hope that ray had first ignited in him months before shine just a little brighter he was going to stay he was going to be one of them he was never going back into hell again it made it worth being called down to moorefields office that day the vice principal had reeled him in an hour before freedom it had made his stomach jitter as it always did but shed sat him down and told him she was proud of his progress man how mortifying okay so maybe he hadnt punched anybody in the face in the last couple months and hed been handing in his stupid homework assignments every dumb day because somebody was always nagging him about them phillip was the worst nag in that particular area it was like the guy was a homework cop or something seth thought now and yeah hed been raising his hand in class now and then just for the hell of it but to have moorefield single him out that way had been so√¢ bleech he decided hed almost wished shed hauled his butt in to give him another dose of inschool suspension but if a bunch of dopey as made a guy like ethan happy it was okay ethan was absolutely cool in seths estimation he worked outside all day and his hands had scars and really thick calluses seth figured you could practically pound nails into ethans hands without him even feeling it they were so hard and tough he owned two boats that hed built himself and he knew everything about the bay and sailing and didnt make a big deal about it a couple of months back seth had watched high noon on tv even though it had been in lame black and white and there hadnt even been any blood or explosions hed thought then that ethan was just like that gary cooper guy he didnt say a lot so you mostly listened when he did and he just did what needed to be done without a lot of show ethan would have faced down the bad guys too because it was right seth had mulled it over for a while and had decided thats what a hero was somebody who just did what was right ethan would have been stunned and mortally embarrassed if hed been able to read seths thoughts but the boy was an expert at keeping them to himself on that level he and ethan were as close as twins it might have crossed ethans mind that village pizza was only a short block from shineys pub where grace would be starting her shift but he didnt mention it couldnt take the boy into a bar anyway ethan mused as they headed into the bright lights and noise of the local restaurant and seth was bound to complain loudly if ethan asked him to wait in the car for just a couple minutes while he poked his head in likely grace would complain too if she caught on that he was checking on her it was best to let it go and concentrate on the matters at hand he tucked his hands into his back pockets and studied the menu posted on the wall behind the counter what do you want on it you can forget the mushrooms theyre gross were of a mind there ethan murmured pepperoni and hot sausage seth sneered but he spoiled it by bouncing a little in his sneakers if you can handle it i can take it if you can hey justin he said with a smile of greeting for the boy behind the counter well take a large pepperoni and hot sausage and a couple of jumbo pepsis you got it here or to go ethan scanned the dozen tables and booths offered and noted that he wasnt the only one whod thought to celebrate the last day of school with pizza go nab that last booth back there seth well take it here justin have a seat well bring the drinks out seth had dumped his backpack on the bench and was tapping his hands on the table in time to the blast of hootie and the blowfish from the juke im going to go kick some video ass he told ethan when ethan reached back for his wallet seth shook his head i got money not tonight you dont ethan said mildly and pulled out some bills its your party get some change cool seth snagged the bills and raced off to get quarters as ethan slid into the booth he wondered why so many people thought a couple hours in a noisy room was high entertainment a huddle of kids was already trying to kick some video ass at the trio of machines along the back wall the juke had switched to clint black and that country boy was wailing the toddler in the booth behind him was having a fullblown tantrum and a group of teenage girls were giggling at a decibel level that would have made simons ears bleed what a way to spend a pretty summer night then he saw liz crawford and junior with their two little girls at a nearby booth one of the girls that must be stacy ethan thought was talking quickly making wide gestures while the rest of the family howled with laughter they made a unit he mused their own little island in the midst of the jittery lights and noise he supposed thats what family was an island knowing you could go there made all the difference still the tug of envy surprised him made him shift uncomfortably on the hard seat of the booth and scowl into space hed made his mind up about having a family years before and he didnt care for this sharp pull of longing why ethan you look fierce he glanced up as the drinks were set on the table in front of him straight into the flirtatious eyes of linda brewster she was a looker no question about it the tight black jeans and scoopnecked black tshirt hugged her welldeveloped body like a coat of fresh paint on a classic chevy after her divorce was final one week ago monday shed treated herself to a manicure and a new hairdo her coraltipped nails skimmed through her newly bobbed streaky blond hair as she smiled down at ethan shed had her eye on him for a time now after all she had separated from that useless tom brewster more than a year before and a woman had to look to the future ethan quinn would be hot in bed she decided she had instincts about these things those big hands of his would be mighty thorough she was sure and attentive oh yes she liked his looks too just a little tough and weathered and that slow sexy smile of his√¢ when you managed to drag one out of him just made her want to lick her lips in anticipation he had that quiet way about him linda knew what they said about still waters and she was just dying to see just how deep ethan quinns ran ethan was well aware where her eye had wandered and he was keeping his peeled as well for running room women like linda scared the hell out of him hi linda didnt know you were working here or hed have avoided village pizza like the plague just helping my father out for a couple of weeks she was flat broke and her father the owner of village pizza had told her hed be damned if she was going to sponge off him and her mother she should get her sassy butt to work havent seen you around lately ive been around he wished shed move along her perfume gave him the jitters i heard you and your brothers rented that old barn of claremonts and are building boats ive been meaning to come down and take a look not much to see where the hell was seth when he needed him ethan wondered a little desperately how long could those damn quarters last id like to see it anyway she skimmed those slicktipped nails down his arm gave a low purr as she felt the ridge of muscle i can slip out of here for a while why dont you run me down there and show me whats what his mind blanked for a moment he was only human and she was running her tongue over her top lip in a way designed to draw a mans eyes and tickle his glands not that he was interested not a bit but it had been a long time since hed had a woman moaning under him and he had a feeling linda would be a champion moaner copped top score seth plopped into the booth flushed with victory and grabbed his pepsi he slurped some up man whats keeping that pizza im starved ethan felt his blood start to run again and nearly sighed with relief itll be along well despite annoyance at the interruption linda smiled brilliantly at seth this must be the new addition whats your name honey i cant quite recollect im seth and he sized her up quickly bimbo was his first and last thought hed seen plenty of them in his short life whore you im linda an old friend of ethans my daddy owns the place cool so maybe you could tell them to put a fire under that pizza before we die of old age here seth the word and ethans quiet look were all it took for the boy to close his mouth your daddy still makes the best pizza on the shore ethan said with an easier smile you be sure to tell him i will and you give me a call ethan she wiggled her left hand im a free woman these days she wandered away hips swinging like a welloiled metronome she smells like the place at the mall where they sell all that girl stuff seth wrinkled his nose he hadnt liked her because hed seen just a shadow of his mother in her eyes she just wants to get in your pants shut up seth its true seth said with a shrug but happily let the subject drop when linda came back bearing pizza yall enjoy now she told them leaning over the table just a little farther than necessary in case ethan had missed the view the first time around seth snagged a piece and bit in knowing it was going to scorch the roof of his mouth the flavors exploded making the burn more than worth it grace makes pizza from scratch he said around a mouthful its even better than this ethan only grunted the thought of grace after hed entertained however unwillingly a brief and sweaty fantasy about linda brewster made him twitchy yeah we ought to see if shed make it for us one of the days she comes to clean and stuff she comes tomorrow right yeah ethan took a piece annoyed that most of his appetite had deserted him i suppose maybe shed make one up before she goes youre having pizza tonight so seth polished off the first piece with the speed and precision of a jackal you could like compare grace ought to open a diner or something so she wouldnt have to work all those different jobs shes always working she wants to buy a house she does yeah seth licked the side of his hand where sauce dripped just a little one but it has to have a yard so aubrey can run around and have a dog and stuff she tell you all that sure i asked how come she was busting her butt cleaning all those houses and working down at the pub and she said that was mostly why and if she doesnt make enough she and aubrey wont have a place of their own by the time aub starts kindergarten i guess even a little house costs big bucks right it costs ethan said quietly he remembered how satisfied how proud hed been when hed bought his own place on the water what it had meant to him to know hed succeeded at what he did it takes time to save up grace wants to have the house by the time aubrey starts school after that she says how she has to start saving for college he snorted and decided he could force down a third piece hell aubreys just a baby its a million years till college told her that too he added because it pleased him for people to know he and grace had conversations she just laughed and said five minutes ago aubrey had gotten her first tooth i didnt get it she meant kids grow up fast since it didnt look as though his appetite would be coming back ethan closed the top on the pizza and took out bills to pay for it lets take this back to the boatyard since you dont have school in the morning we can put in a couple more hours he put in more than a couple once he got started he couldnt seem to stop it cleared his mind kept it from wandering wondering worrying the boat was definite a tangible task with a foreseeable end he knew what he was doing here just as he knew what he was doing out on the bay there werent so many shadow areas of maybes or what ifs ethan continued to work even when seth curled up on a drop cloth and fell asleep the sound of tools running didnt appear to disturb him though ethan wondered how anyone could sleep with the best part of a large sausageandpepperoni pizza in his stomach he started work on the ends and corner posts for the cabin and cockpit coaming while the night wind blew lazily through the open cargo doors hed turned the radio off so that now the only music was the water the gentle notes of it sliding against the shore he worked slowly carefully though he was well able to visualize the completed project cam he decided would handle most of the interior work he was the most skilled of the three of them at finish carpentry phillip could handle the roughins he was better at sheer manual labor than he liked to admit if they could keep up the pace ethan calculated that they could have the boat trimmed and under sail in another two months he would leave figuring the profits and percentages to phillip the money would feed the lawyers the boatyard and their own bellies why hadnt grace ever told him she wanted to buy a house ethan frowned thoughtfully as he chose a galvanized bolt wasnt that a pretty big step to be discussing with a tenyearold boy then again he admitted seth had asked he himself had only told her she shouldnt be working herself so hard he hadnt asked why she insisted on it she ought to make things up with her father he thought again if the two of them would just bend that stiffnecked monroe pride for five minutes they could come to terms shed gotten pregnant and there was no doubt in ethans mind that jack casey had taken advantage of a young naive girl and should be shot for it but that was over and done his family had never held grudges small or large theyd fought certainly and he and his brothers had often fought physically but when it was done it was over it was true enough that hed harbored some seeds of resentment because cam had raced off to europe and phillip had moved to baltimore it had happened so fast after their mother died and hed still been raw everything had changed before he could blink and hed stewed over that but even with that he would never have turned his back on either of them if theyd needed him and he knew they wouldnt have turned their backs on him it seemed to him the most foolish and wasteful thing imaginable that grace wouldnt ask for help and her father wouldnt offer it he glanced at the big round clock nailed to the wall over the front doors phillips idea ethan remembered with a half grin hed figured theyd need to know how much time they were putting in but as far as ethan knew phillip was the only one who bothered to mark down the time it was nearly one which meant grace would be finishing up at the pub in about an hour it wouldnt hurt to load seth in the truck and do a quick swing by shineys just to√¢ check on things even as he started to rise he heard the boy whimper in his sleep pizzas finally getting to him ethan thought with a shake of the head but he supposed childhood wouldnt be complete without its quota of bellyaches he climbed down rolling his shoulders to work out the kinks as he approached the sleeping boy he crouched beside seth laid a hand on his shoulders and gave a gentle shake and the boy came up swinging the bunched fist caught ethan squarely on the mouth and knocked his head back the shock more than the quick and bright pain had him swearing he blocked the next blow then took seths arm firmly hold it get your hands off me wild desperate and still caught in the sticky grip of the dream seth flailed at the air get your fucking hands off me understanding came quickly it was the look in seths eyes stark terror and vicious fury hed once felt both himself along with a shuddering helplessness he let go lifted both of his hands palms out you were dreaming he said it quietly without inflection and listened to seths ragged breathing echo on the air you fell asleep seth kept his fists bunched he didnt remember falling asleep he remembered curling up listening to ethan work and the next thing he knew he was back in one of those dark rooms where the smells were sour and too human and the noises from the next room were too loud and too animal and one of the faceless men who used his mothers bed had crept out and put hands on him again but it was ethan who was watching him patiently with too much knowledge in his serious eyes seths stomach twisted not only at what had been but that ethan should now know because he couldnt think of words or excuses seth simply closed his eyes it was that which tilted the scales for ethan the surrender to helplessness the slide into shame hed left this wound alone but now it seemed he would need to treat it after all you dont have to be afraid of what was im not afraid of anything seths eyes snapped open the anger in them was adult and bitter but his voice jerked like the child he was im not afraid of some stupid dream you dont have to be ashamed of it either because he was hideously seth sprang to his feet his fists were bunched again ready im not ashamed of anything and you dont know a damn thing about it i know every damn thing about it because he did he hated to speak of it but despite the defiant stance the boy was trembling and ethan knew just how alone he felt speaking of it was the only thing left for him to do the right thing to do i know what dreams did to me how i had them for a long time after that part of things was over for me and still had them now and again he thought but there was no need to tell the boy he might have to face a lifetime of flashing back and overcoming i know what it does to your guts bullshit the tears were burning the backs of seths eyes humiliating him all the more nothings wrong with me i got the hell out didnt i i got away from her didnt i im not going back either no matter what no youre not going back ethan agreed no matter what i dont care what you or anybody thinks about what went on back then and youre not tricking me into saying things about it by pretending you know you dont have to say anything about it ethan told him and i dont have to pretend he picked up the cap seths blow had knocked off his head ran it absently through his hands before putting it back on but the casual gesture did nothing to ease the tight slick ball of tension in his gut my mother was a whore my biological mother and she was a junkie with a taste for heroin he kept his gaze on seths and his voice matteroffact i was younger than you when she sold me the first time to a man who liked young boys seths breathing quickened as he took a step back no was all he could think ethan quinn was everything strong and solid and√¢ normal youre lying people mostly lie to brag or to get out of some stupid thing theyve done i dont see the point in either and less in lying about this ethan took his cap off again because it suddenly felt too tight on his head once twice he raked his hand through his hair as if to ease the weight she sold me to men to pay for her habit the first time i fought it didnt stop it but i fought the second time i fought and a few times more after that then i didnt bother fighting because it just made it worse ethans gaze stayed level on the boys in the harsh overhead lights seths eyes were dark and not as calm as they had been when ethan had begun to speak seths chest hurt until he remembered to breathe again howd you stand it i stopped caring ethan shrugged his shoulders i stopped being if you know what i mean there wasnt anybody i could go to for help or i didnt know there was she moved around a lot to keep the social workers off her tail seths lips felt dry and tight he rubbed the back of his hand over them violently you never knew where youre going to wake up in the morning yeah you never knew but all the places looked the same they all smelled the same but you got away you got out yeah i got out one night after her john had finished with both of us there was√¢ some trouble screams blood curses pain i dont remember everything exactly but the cops came i must have been in a pretty bad way because they took me to the hospital and figured things out quick enough i ended up in the system might have stayed there but the doctor who treated me was stella quinn they took you they took me and saying that just that soothed the sickness in ethans gut they didnt just change my life they saved it i had the dreams for a long time after the sweaty ones where you wake up trying to breathe sure youre back in it and even when you realize youre not youre cold for a while seth knuckled the tears away but he didnt feel ashamed of them now i always got away sometimes they put their hands on me but i got away none of them ever√¢ good for you i still wanted to kill them and her i wanted to i know i didnt want to tell anybody i think ray knew and cam sort of knows i didnt want anybody to think i√¢ to look at me and think√¢ he couldnt express it the shame of having anyone look at him and see what had happened and what could have happened in those dark smelly rooms why did you tell me because you need to know it doesnt make you less of a man ethan waited knowing that seth would decide whether he accepted the truth of that what seth saw was a man tall strong selfpossessed with big callused hands and quiet eyes one of the weights that hung on his heart lifted i guess i do and he smiled a little your mouths bleeding ethan dabbed at it with the back of his hand and knew theyd crossed a thin and shaky line you got a good right jab i never saw it coming he held out a hand testing and ruffled seths sleeptumbled hair the boys smile stayed in place lets clean up ethan said and go home chapter five contents prev next grace had a morning full of chores the first load of laundry went in at sevenfifteen while the coffee was brewing and her eyes were still mostly shut she watered her porch plants and the little pots of herbs on her kitchen windowsill and yawned hugely as the coffee began to scent the air and give her hope she washed the glasses and bowls julie had used the night before while babysitting she closed the open bag of potato chips tucked it into its place in the cupboard then wiped the crumbs from the counter where julie had had her snack while talking on the phone julie cutter wasnt known for her neatness but she loved aubrey at precisely seventhirty and after half a cup of coffee aubrey woke reliable as the sunrise grace thought heading out of the tiny galley kitchen toward the bedroom off the living room rain or shine weekday or weekend aubreys internal clock buzzed away at seventhirty every morning grace could have left her in the crib and finished her coffee but she looked forward to this moment every day aubrey stood at the side of the crib her sunbeam curls tangled from sleep her cheeks still flushed with it grace could still remember the first time shed come in and seen aubrey standing her wobbly legs rocking her face glowing with success and surprise now aubreys legs seemed so sturdy she lifted one then the other in a kind of joyful march she laughed out loud when grace came into the room mama mama hi my mama hello my baby grace leaned over the side for the first nuzzle and sighed she knew how lucky she was there couldnt have been a child on the planet with a sunnier nature than her little girl hows my aubrey up out you bet gotta pee gotta pee aubrey agreed and giggled when grace lifted her out of the crib the toilet training was coming along grace decided checking aubreys overnight diaper as they headed into the bathroom it had its hits and its misses aubrey hit it this time and grace launched into the lavish praise over bodily functions that only a parent with a toddler could understand teeth and hair were brushed in the closetsize bathroom grace had brightened up with mintgreen walls and awningstriped curtains then the breakfast routine began aubrey wanted cold cereal with bananas but no milk she plopped her hand over the bowl when grace started to pour it on shaking her head vigorously no mama no cup please okay milk in a cup grace filled one set it on the highchair tray beside the bowl eat up now weve got lots to do today do what lets see grace made herself a piece of toast while she went through the projected day we have to finish the laundry then we promised mrs west wed wash her windows today a threehour job grace estimated then we have to go to the market aubrey gasped in pleasure miss lucy yes youll see miss lucy lucy wilson was one of aubreys favorite people the supermarket cashier always had a smile and a lollipop for aubrey after we put the groceries away were going to the quinns seth milk dribbled out of her grin well honey i dont know for certain that hell be there today he may be out on the boat with ethan or over at his friends house seth aubrey said again very definitely and her mouth puckered up into a stubborn pout well see grace mopped up the spills ethan maybe doggies foolish for sure she kissed the top of aubreys head and gave herself the luxury of a second cup of coffee at eightfifteen grace was armed with a stack of newspapers and a spray bottle that contained a mix of vinegar and ammonia aubrey was entertaining herself on the grass with her mattel see n say every few seconds a cow mooed or a pig oinked and aubrey never failed to echo the sound by the time aubrey had switched her affections to her building blocks grace had finished cleaning and polishing the outside of the windows on the front and side of the cottage and was right on schedule she would have stayed on schedule if mrs west hadnt come out with tall glasses of iced tea and a desire to chat i dont know how to thank you for seeing to this for me grace mrs west the grandmother of many had brought aubrey her drink in a bright plastic cup with ducks on the side im happy to do it mrs west just cant do like i used to with my arthritis and i do like my windows to shine she smiled deepening the wrinkles on her weatherscored face and you do make them shine my granddaughter layla said how shed wash them for me but i tell you the truth and shame the devil grace that girls a scatterbrain shed like as not start the job and end up sleeping in the vegetable patch dont know whats to become of that girl grace laughed and scrubbed at the next window shes only fifteen her minds on boys and clothes and music tell me mrs west nodded so vigorously that her second chin wobbled with the movement why at her age i could pick a crab clean faster than you could blink earned my keep and kept my mind on my work till the work was done she winked then i thought about boys she let out a hearty laugh before smiling at aubrey thats one pretty little lamb you got yourself there grade the light of my life good as gold too why my carlys youngest boy luke hes not still for two minutes running and spends every waking hour looking for trouble just last week i caught him climbing up my parlor curtains like a house cat still the memory made her chuckle hes a terror that luke is aubrey has her moments too cant believe it not with that angel face youre going to have to beat the boys off with a stick to keep them from sniffing around that sweetheart one of these days pretty as a picture already seen her holding hands with one grace bobbled her spray bottle and looked around quickly to make certain her little girl hadnt grown up while she wasnt looking aubrey mrs west laughed again walking on the waterfront with that quinn boy the new one oh seth the sense of relief was so ridiculous grace set the bottle down and picked up her glass to drink aubreys got a crush on him goodlooking boy my young matt goes to school with him told me how seth came to sock that little bully robert a few weeks back couldnt help but feel it was about time somebody did how they doing over at the quinns the question was her main purpose for coming out but mrs west believed in leading up to matters just fine mrs west rolled her eyes this pump needed more priming that girl cam up and married sure is a beauty shell have to have quick hands too to keep that one in line always was wild i think anna can handle him went off to some foreign place to honeymoon didnt they rome seth showed me a postcard they sent its beautiful always puts me in mind of that movie with audrey hepburn and gregory peck where shes a princess dont make movies like that anymore roman holiday grace smiled wistfully she had a weakness for the classic and romantic thats the one grace looked a bit like audrey hepburn mrs west mused coloring was wrong of course with grace being blond as a viking but she had the big eyes and the cool pretty face lord knew she was skinny enough never been anyplace foreign which included in mrs wests mind twothirds of the united states they coming back soon a couple days hmm well that house needs a woman no question cant imagine what its like over there four males in one house must smell like a gym sock half the time dont know a man on this earth who can manage to pee and hit the toilet with the whole stream grace laughed and went back to her windows they arent so bad the fact is cam was keeping the house pretty well before they hired me to take over but the only one of them who remembers to empty the pockets before tossing his pants at the hamper is phillip if thats the worst of it its not bad i expect cams wifell take over the house once they get back graces hand tightened on her wad of newspaper as her heart did a quick hitch i√¢ she works fulltime in princess anne most likely shell take over mrs west said again a woman likes her house kept her way best thing for the boy i expect having a woman there fulltime dont know what ray was thinking of this time around i swear a goodhearted man he was but once stella passed√¢ shifted his moorings id say a man his age taking on a boy thataway no matter what was what not that i believe one word of the nasty gossip you hear now and then nancy claremont is the worst flapping her lips every chance she gets mrs west waited a beat hoping that grace would flap hers but grace was frowning intently at the window you know if that insurance inspectors coming around again no grace said quietly i dont i hope not dont see how it makes a matter where the boy came from as far as the insurance company goes even if ray did suicide himself and im not saying its so they cant prove it can they because√¢ she paused dramatically as she did whenever she made the argument they werent there she said the last on a note of triumph just as she had when shed made the same statement to nancy professor quinn wouldnt have killed himself grace murmured course not but it did make for such interesting talk but the boy she broke off her ears pricking up there goes my telephone you just let yourself in when you want to do the inside grace she said as she hurried off grace said nothing kept working steadily but her mind was whirling it shamed her that she couldnt concentrate on professor quinn she could think only of herself and of what might happen would anna come back from rome and want to take over the house would grace lose her job there and the extra money that went with it worse much worse would she lose those opportunities to see ethan once or twice a week to share a meal now and then shed gotten used to even dependent on being a part of his life even a peripheral part she realized and as pathetic as it was she loved folding his clothes smoothing the sheets on his bed she even allowed herself to believe that he would think of her when he found one of her little notes around the house or slipped between freshly laundered sheets at night was she going to lose that too and lose the pleasure of seeing him coming in from his boat or scooping aubrey up when she demanded a kiss or glancing over at her and giving her that slow smile was all of that going to be only pictures she tucked away in her mind now her days would go on and on without even that to look forward to and her nights would go on and on alone she squeezed her eyes tight struggling with despair then opened them again when aubrey tugged at the hem of her shorts mama miss lucy soon honey because she needed to grace lifted aubrey into her arms for a fierce hug it was nearly one by the time grace finished putting away the groceries and fixing aubreys lunch she was only half an hour behind and she thought she could make that up without too much trouble it just meant moving a little quicker and keeping her mind on her work no more projecting she ordered herself as she strapped aubrey into the car seat no more foolishness seth seth seth aubrey chanted bouncing madly well see grace climbed behind the wheel put the key in the ignition and turned it the response was a wheeze and a thump oh no you dont no you dont i dont have time for this a little panicked she turned the key again pumped the gas pedal and sighed with relief when the engine caught thats more like it she muttered as she backed out of the short driveway here we go aubrey here we go five minutes later midway between her house and the quinns the old sedan coughed again shuddered then belched out steam from under the hood dammit dammit aubrey echoed joyfully grace only pressed the heels of her hands to her eyes it was the radiator she was sure of it last month it had been the fan belt and before that the brake pads resigned she eased to the side of the road and got out to open the hood smoke billowed made her cough and step away resolutely she swallowed back the knot of despair in her throat maybe it wouldnt be anything major it could just be some belt again and if it wasnt she sighed hugely she would have to decide if it was better to pump more money into this wreck or to worry her beleagured budget into buying another wreck either way there was nothing to be done about it now she opened the passengerside door and unbuckled aubrey the cars sick again honey awww yeah so were going to leave it right here alone aubreys concern over inanimate objects made grace smile again not for long im going to call the car man to come take care of it make it feel all better i hope so now were going to walk to seths house okay delighted by the change of routine aubrey set out at a scramble a quarter of a mile later grace was carrying her but it was a pretty day she reminded herself and walking gave her a chance to look and really see honeysuckle was tangling along the fence that bordered a tidy field of soybeans and the scent was lovely she picked off a blossom for aubrey by the time they skirted the marsh that edged quinn land her arms were aching they stopped to study a turtle sunning on the side of the road to let aubrey giggle over the way its head retreated into its shell when she reached out to touch can you walk for a while now baby tired with her eyes pleading aubrey lifted her arms up okay up you come nearly there it was past nap time grace thought aubrey wanted her nap directly after lunch every day she would sleep for two hours almost to the minute then wake up ready to roll aubreys head was already a snoozing weight on graces shoulder when she climbed the porch and slipped into the house once she had her daughter tucked onto the couch she hurried upstairs to strip beds gather and sort laundry with the first load in she made a quick call to the mechanic who did his best to keep her ailing car alive she rushed upstairs again remaking the beds with fresh sheets to save herself steps she kept cleaning supplies on each floor grace tackled the bathroom first scrubbing and rinsing in a flurry until chrome and tile sparkled it would be she realized her last full hit on the quinn place before cam and anna returned but shed already decided sometime during the mile walk from her brokendown car to carve out a couple of hours for a quick polish the day they were expected home she had pride in her work didnt she and certainly another woman would notice the tidiness the clean corners the few extra touches she tried to add a professional woman like anna a woman with a demanding career would see wouldnt she that grace was needed here she raced downstairs again to check on aubrey to drag wet clothes out of the washer into a basket and put the second load in she would make sure there were fresh flowers in the master bedroom when the newlyweds returned and shed put out the good fingertip towels she would leave a note for phillip to pick up some fruit so she could arrange it prettily in the bowl on the kitchen table shed make time to pastewax the hardwood floors and wash and iron the curtains she hung clothes on the line quickly without any of her usual enjoyment in the task still the simple routine began to calm her everything would be all right somehow she caught herself swaying and shook her head to clear it fatigue had come quickly like a punch to the jaw if she had bothered to calculate the time shed been on her feet and moving that day she would have counted seven hours on a short five hours sleep the night before what she did calculate was that she had another twelve to go and she needed a break ten minutes she promised herself and as she sometimes did on long days stretched out right in the grass by the clothes that waved on the line a tenminute nap would recharge her system and still give her time to scrub down the kitchen before aubrey woke up ethan drove home from the waterfront hed cut his day on the water short letting jim and his son take the workboat out again to check the pots in the pocomoke seth was off with danny and will and ethan figured on grabbing himself a quick if delayed lunch then spending the next several hours at the boatyard he wanted to finish the cockpit maybe get the roof of the cabin started the more he managed to do the less time it would be before cam could get into the finish and fancy work he slowed down when he saw graces car on the side of the road then pulled over quickly he only shook his head when he looked under the open hood damn thing was held together with spit and prayers he decided she shouldnt be driving something so unreliable just what if he thought sourly the goddamn thing had decided to break down when shed been coming home from the pub in the middle of the night he took a closer look and hissed through his teeth the radiator was a dead loss and if she was entertaining the idea of replacing it hed just have to talk her out of it he would find her a decent secondhand car fix it up for her or ask cam who knew engines like midas knew gold to tune it up he wasnt having her driving around in a wreck like this and with the baby too he caught himself took a couple steps back it wasnt any of his business the hell it wasnt he thought with an uncharacteristic flash of temper she was a friend wasnt she he had a right to help out a friend especially one who needed some looking after and god knew whether or not grace did that she needed some looking after he got back in his truck and drove home with a scowl on his face hed nearly slammed the screen door before he saw aubrey curled up on the couch the scowl didnt have a chance he eased the door shut and walked quietly over to her her hand was bunched into a fist on the cushion unable to resist he took it gently and marveled at those tiny perfect fingers she had a bow around one of her curls a little ribbon of blue lace that he imagined grace had tied on that morning it was lopsided now and only sweeter for it he couldnt help hoping that she woke before he had to head out again but now he needed to find aubreys mother and discuss reliable transportation he cocked his head decided it was too quiet for her to be upstairs doing whatever it was she did up there he walked into the kitchen and noted that the signs of a hurried breakfast were still in evidence she hadnt gotten to that yet but the washing machine was humming and he caught a glimpse of clothes flapping in the breeze on the line outside the minute he stepped to the door he saw her and hit full panic he didnt know what he thought only that she was lying on the grass terrible images of illness and injury crowded into his head as he rushed outside he was barely one full stride away from her when he realized she wasnt unconscious she was sleeping curled up much as her daughter was inside one fist bunched near her cheek her breathing slow and deep and even he gave in to his weakened knees and sat down beside her waited for his heartbeat to return to something approaching normal he sat listening to the clothes flap on the line to the water lick the eelgrass and to the birds chatter while he wondered what the hell he was going to do with her in the end he simply sighed rose then bending down gathered her up into his arms she stirred in them snuggled made his blood run a little too fast for comfort ethan she murmured turning her face into the curve of his neck and inciting the bright fantasy of rolling over that sunwarmed grass with her ethan she said again skimming her fingers along his shoulder and making him hard as iron then again ethan only this time in a squeak of shock as she jerked her head up and stared at him her eyes were dazed with sleep and bright with surprise her mouth made a soft o that was gloriously tempting then color flooded her cheeks what what is it she managed over a stomachchurning combination of arousal and embarrassment youre going to take a nap you ought to have as much sense as aubrey and take it inside out of the sun he knew his voice was rough he couldnt do anything about it desire had him by the throat with gleefully nipping claws i was just scared ten years off me when i saw you lying there i thought youd fainted or something i only stretched out for a minute aubrey was sleeping so aubrey i need to check on aubrey i just did shes fine youd have shown more sense if youd stretched out on the couch with her i dont come here to sleep you were sleeping just for a minute you need more than a minute no i dont its just that things got complicated today and my brain got tired it almost amused him he stopped in the kitchen still holding her and looked into her eyes your brain got tired yeah it nearly shut off entirely now i needed to rest my mind a minute thats all put me down ethan he wasnt ready to not quite yet i saw your car about a mile down the road from here i called dave and told him hes going to get to it as soon as he can you walked from there to here carting aubrey no my chauffeur drove us in put me down ethan before she exploded well you can give your chauffeur the rest of the day off ill drive you home when aubrey wakes up i can get myself home ive barely started on the house now i need to get back to it youre not walking two and a half miles ill call julie shell run down and pick us up you must have work to do yourself im√¢ behind schedule she said desperately now i cant catch up if you dont put me down he considered her theres not much to you the shimmer of need wavered into annoyance if youre going to tell me im skinny i wouldnt say skinny youve got fine bones thats all and smooth soft flesh to cover them he set her on her feet before he forgot he intended to look after her you dont have to worry with the house today i do i need to do my job her nerves were a jittery mess the way he was looking at her made her want to take one flying leap back into his arms and also made her want to hightail it out the back door like a rabbit shed never experienced such a dramatic tugofwar on her system and could only stand her ground i can do it quicker if you arent underfoot ill get out of your way as soon as you call julie and see if shell come by and get you he reached up and brushed some dandelion fluff out of her hair okay she turned punched in numbers on the kitchen phone maybe it would be best she thought wildly as the phone started to ring if anna didnt want her around after she got home it seemed she couldnt be with ethan for ten minutes anymore without getting jumpy if it kept up she was bound to do something to embarrass them both chapter six contents prev next ethan didnt mind putting in long hours on the boat at night especially when he could work alone it hadnt taken much persuasion for him to agree to let seth camp out with the other boys in their backyard it gave ethan an evening alone a rarity now and time to work without having to tune in to questions and comments not that the boy wasnt entertaining ethan mused the fact was he was firmly attached to seth accepting seth into his life had been natural because ray had asked it of him but the affection the appreciation and the loyalty had grown and solidified until it simply was but that didnt mean the kid couldnt wear down his energies ethan kept it to handwork tonight even if you felt awake and alert at midnight the odds were youd be a bit sluggish and he didnt want to risk losing a finger to the power tools in any case it was soothing to work in the quiet to handsand edges and planes until you felt them go smooth they would be ready to seal the hull before the week was out and he could start seth on sanding the rubrails if cam dived right in on dealing with belowdecks and if seth didnt bitch too much about working with putty and caulk and varnish over the next week or two theyd do well enough he checked his watch saw that time was getting away from him and began to put away his tools he swept up since seth wasnt there to wield the broom by quarter after one he was parked outside of the pub he didnt intend to go inside anymore than he intended to let grace walk the mile and a half home when she clocked out so he settled back switched on his dome light and passed the time reading his dogeared copy of cannery row inside it was last call the only thing that would have made grace happier would have been if dave had told her that all she needed to get her car up and running was some used chewing gum and a rubber band instead hed told her it would cost the equivalent of three years worth of both and then shed be lucky if the old bucket ran another five thousand miles it was something she would have to worry about later at the moment she had her hands full dealing with an overly insistent customer who was stopping off in st chris on his way down to savannah and was sure grace would like to be his form of entertainment for the night i got me a hotel room he winked at her when she stooped to serve his final drink of the night and its got a big bed and twentyfourhour room service we could have us a hell of a party honey pie i dont do a lot of partying but thanks he grabbed her hand pulled it just enough to throw off her balance so she had to grip his shoulder or tumble into his lap then nows your chance he had dark eyes and he aimed them leeringly at her breasts i got a real fondness for longlegged blondes always treat them special he was tiresome grace thought as he breathed one more beer into her face but she had handled worse i appreciate that but im going to finish up my shift and go home your place is fine with me mister bob you just call me bob baby she had to yank to get free mister im just not interested of course she was he thought sending her a smile he knew was dazzling hed paid two grand to get his teeth bonded hadnt he the hardtoget routine always turns me on grace decided he wasnt worth even a single disgusted sigh were closing in fifteen youre going to need to settle your tab okay okay dont get bitchy he smiled widely and pulled out a money clip thick with bills he always salted it with a couple of twenties on the outside then filled it with singles you figure what i owe then well√¢ negotiate your tip sometimes grace decided it was best to keep your mouth firmly shut what wanted to come out was vicious enough to get her fired so she walked away and took her empties to the bar he giving you trouble grace she smiled weakly at steve it was just the two of them working now the other waitress had clocked out at midnight claiming a migraine since shed been pale as a ghost grace had shooed her out and agreed to cover hes just another of those gifts to womankind nothing to worry about if hes not gone by closing ill wait until youre locked in your car and headed home she made a noncommittal humming noise she hadnt mentioned her lack of transportation because she knew steve would insist on driving her home he lived twenty minutes away in the opposite direction and had a pregnant wife waiting for him she cashed out tables cleared them and noted with relief that her problem customer finally rose to leave he paid his bar bill with cash leaving on the table though hed managed to monopolize most of her time and attention for the past three hours grace was too tired to be annoyed at the pitiful tip it didnt take long for the pub to empty the crowd had been mostly college students out for a couple of beers and conversation on a weekday night by her calculations theyd turned about ten tables no more than twice since her shift had started at seven her tips for the evening werent going to make much of a dent in the new car she would have to buy it was so quiet they both jumped like rabbits when the phone rang even while grace laughed at their reaction the blood drained out of steves face mollie was all he said as he leaped on the phone he answered it with a stuttering is it time grace stepped forward wondering if she was strong enough to catch him if he keeled over when he began nodding rapidly she felt her smile spread wide okay you you call the doctor right everythings ready to go how far apart√¢ oh god oh god im on my way dont move dont do anything dont worry he dropped the phone off the hook then froze shes mollie my wife yes i know who mollie is we went to school together from kindergarten on grace laughed then because he looked so dear and so terrified she cupped his face in her hands and kissed him go but you drive careful babies take their time coming theyll wait for you were having a baby he said slowly as if testing each word me and mollie i know and its just wonderful you tell her im going to come see her and the baby of course if you just stand there like somebody glued your feet to the floor guess shell have to drive herself to the hospital god i have to go he knocked over a chair on his way to the door keys where are the keys your car keys are in your pocket bar keys are behind the bar ill lock up daddy he stopped tossed one huge electrifying grin over his shoulder wow and was gone grace was still chuckling as she picked up the chair and replaced it upside down on the table she thought of the night when she had gone into labor with aubrey oh shed been so afraid so excited she had indeed driven herself to the hospital thered been no husband there to panic with her thered been no one to sit with her to tell her to breathe to hold her hand when the pain and aloneness had been at its worst she weakened and let the nurse call her mother of course her mother came and stayed with her and saw aubrey into the world they cried together and laughed together and it had made it all right again her father hadnt come not then not later her mother had made excuses tried to smooth it over but grace had understood she was not to be forgiven others had come julie and her parents friends and neighbors ethan and professor quinn theyd brought her flowers pink and white daisies and rosebuds she had pressed one of each in aubreys baby book it made her smile to remember so when the door behind her opened she turned with a chuckle steve if you dont get going shell√¢ grace trailed off experiencing more annoyance than fear when she saw the man step inside were closed she said firmly i know honey pie i figured youd find a way to hang back and wait for me im not waiting for you why the hell hadnt she locked the door behind steve i said were closed youll have to leave you want to play it that way fine he sauntered over leaned on the bar hed been working out regularly for months now and knew the stance showed off his welltoned muscles why dont you fix us both a drink and well talk about that tip her patience dried up you already gave me a tip now ill give you one if youre not out that door in ten seconds im calling the cops instead of spending the night on your big hotel bed youll spend it in a cell i got something else in mind he grabbed her shoved her back against the bar and ground himself against her see you had it in mind too i saw the way youve been eyeing me ive been waiting all night for some action she couldnt get her knee up to ram it against what he was so proudly pushing against her she couldnt get her hands free to shove or scratch panic started as a tickle in her throat then spread like a hot flood when he shot a hand under her skirt she was preparing to bite scream and spit when he was suddenly airborne all she could do was stay pressed against the bar and stare at ethan you all right he said it so quietly that her head bobbed up and down in automatic response but his eyes werent quiet there was rage in them so primal and primitive that she shuddered go on out and wait in the truck i he then she squealed it would embarrass her to remember it later but it was the only sound that came out of her tight throat when the man rushed at ethan like a battering ram head lowered fists clenched she watched staggered as ethan simply pivoted jabbed once twice and flicked the man off like a fly then he bent grabbed the man by the shirtfront and hauled him up on his rubbery legs you dont want to be here his voice was steel with dangerously sharp edges because if i see you here after the next two minutes im going to kill you and unless you got family or close personal friends nobodys going to give a damn he tossed him away with what seemed to grace no more than a twist of the wrist and the man crashed into a table then ethan turned his back as if the guy didnt exist but none of the stony fury had faded from his face when he looked at grace i told you to go wait in the truck i have to i need to she pressed a hand between her breasts and pushed up as if to shove the words clear neither of them looked as the man scrambled up and stumbled out the door i have to lock up shiney shiney can go to hell since it didnt appear that she was going to move ethan grabbed her hand and hauled her to the door he ought to be horsewhipped for letting a lone woman lock up this place at night steve he i saw that sonofabitch go flying out of here like a bomb was ticking ethan intended to have a nice long talk with steve as well soon he promised himself grimly as he pushed grace into the truck mollie she called shes in labor i told him to go you would damn idiot woman the statement delivered with such bubbling fury stopped the trembling that had just begun cut off the babbling gratitude shed been about to express hed saved her was all shed been able to think like a knight in a fairy tale but the thin romantic mist that had been shimmering over her stillreeling brain evaporated im certainly not an idiot you sure as hell are he whipped the truck out of the lot spitting gravel and knocking grace back against her seat his rare but formidable temper was in full swing and there was no stopping it until it had blown itself out that man was the idiot she shot back i was just doing my job doing your job damn near got you raped the son of a bitch had his hand under your skirt she could still feel it the way it had groped at her nausea bubbled up to her throat and was ruthlessly swallowed down im aware of that things like that dont happen at shineys it just did happen at shineys it doesnt draw that kind of clientele usually he wasnt local he was he was there ethan swung into her drive hit the brakes then shut the engine off with a hard flick of the wrist and so were you mopping up some bar in the middle of the goddamn night by yourself and what were you going to do when you were done walk almost two damn miles i could have gotten a ride except except youre too stiffnecked to ask for one he finished youd rather limp home in those milehigh heels than ask a favor she had sneakers in her bag but decided it wouldnt help to mention it her bag she remembered which was back at the unlocked pub now she would have to go back first thing in the morning get her things and lock up before the boss checked well thank you very much for your opinion of my failings and the lecture and the damn ride home she shoved at the door only to have ethan grab her arm and yank her back where the hell do you think youre going im going home im going to soak my stiffneck and my idiotbrain and go to bed i havent finished ive finished she jerked free and jumped out if it hadnt been for the blasted heels she might have made it but he was out the opposite door and blocking her way before shed taken three strides i have nothing more to say her voice was cold and dismissive her chin was high good you can just listen if you wont quit at the pub which is just what you should do youre going to take some basic precautions reliable transportation comes first dont you tell me what i have to do shut up she did but only because she was stunned speechless shed never in all the years shed known him seen ethan like this in the moonlight she could see that the fury in his eyes hadnt dimmed a bit his face was like stone the shadows flittering over it making it seem harsh even dangerous well see that you get a car you can trust he continued in that same edgy tone and you wont be closing on your own again when you finish your shift i want somebody walking you out to your car and waiting until you lock it and drive off thats just ridiculous he stepped forward though he didnt touch her didnt lift a hand she backed up a pace her heart began to pound too fast and too loud in her head whats ridiculous is you thinking you can handle every damn thing by yourself and im tired of it she sputtered hating herself youre tired of it yeah and its going to stop i cant do much about your working yourself half to death but i can do something about the rest you dont make arrangements at the pub to see youre safe i will youre going to stop asking for trouble asking for it outrage gushed through her in such a boiling wave she was surprised that the top of her head didnt simply blow off i wasnt asking for anything that bastard wouldnt take no for an answer no matter how many times i said it thats just what im talking about you dont know what youre talking about she said in a furious whisper i handled him and i would have kept handling him if how there was red around the edges of his vision he could still see the way shed been pressed up against the bar her eyes wide and frightened her face had been ghostpale her eyes huge and sheened like glass if he hadnt come in√¢ and because the thought of what could have been scraped raw at the center of his brain his already slippery control shattered just how he demanded in one quick move yanking her hard against him go ahead show me she twisted shoved and her pulse began to race stop it you think telling him to stop once hes got your scents going to make a difference lemons and fear once he feels the way you fit subtle curves and long lines he knew there was no one to stop him that he could do anything he wanted everything inside her was in a mindless rush her heart her blood her head i wouldnt i would have stopped him stop me he meant it a part of him wanted desperately for her to stop him to do or say something that would hold the wildness in check but his mouth was on hers rough and needy swallowing her gasps inciting more and reveling in her fast hard trembles when she moaned when her lips yielded parted answered his he lost his mind he dragged her onto the grass rolled with her atop her the thick bolt hed kept locked on his desires exploded open and what poured out was reckless greed and primal lust he ravaged her mouth with the singleminded hunger of a starving wolf swamped with needs so long buried she arched against him straining center to center core to core her system stuttered with shocked pleasure then roared into full raging life pumping heat strangled moans quivering delights this was not the ethan she knew or the one shed dreamed would finally touch her there was no gentleness no care but she gave herself to him thrilled at the sensation of being swept away she wrapped long limbs around him to bind him closer let her fingers dive into his hair grip there and shivered with the dark delight of knowing he was stronger he feasted on her mouth her throat while he tugged at the low snug bodice he was desperate for flesh the feel of it the taste of it her flesh her flavor her breast was small and firm the skin smooth as satin against his wide hard palm her heart jackhammered under it she whimpered stunned at the sensation of that rough hand cupping her kneading her churning an echoing tug between her legs where muscles had gone liquid and lax and sighed his name she might have shot him the sound of her voice the hitch of her breath the shivers on her skin slapped him back cold and hard he rolled away onto his back and struggled to find his breath his sanity his decency they were in her front yard for gods sake her baby was sleeping inside the house hed nearly very nearly done worse than the man in the pub hed very nearly betrayed trust friendship and vulnerability this beast inside of him was precisely the reason hed sworn never to touch her now by loosing it hed broken his vow and ruined everything im sorry a pitiful phrase he thought but he didnt have any other words god grace im sorry her blood was still flowing hot and that wonderful terrifying need aroused to screaming she shifted reached out to touch his face ethan theres no excuse he said quickly sitting up so she wasnt touching him tempting him i lost my temper and i stopped thinking straight lost your temper she stayed where she was sprawled on the grass that now seemed too cold her face lifted to the moon that now shone too bright so you were just mad she said dully i was mad but thats no excuse for hurting you you didnt hurt me she could still feel his hands on her the rough insistent press of them but the sensation then the sensation now wasnt one of pain he thought he could handle it now looking at her touching her she would need it he imagined he couldnt have lived with himself if she was afraid of him the last thing i want to do is hurt you as gentle as a doting parent he tidied her clothes when she didnt cringe he stroked a hand over her tousled hair i only want whats best for you she didnt cringe but she did suddenly and sharply slap his hand aside dont treat me like a child a few minutes ago you were treating me like a woman easy enough thered been nothing easy about it he thought grimly and i was wrong then we were both wrong she sat up brushing briskly at her clothes it wasnt onesided ethan you know that i didnt try to make you stop because i didnt want you to stop that was your idea he was baffled and abruptly nervous for christs sake grace we were rolling around in your front yard thats not what stopped you with a quiet sigh she brought her knees up wrapped her arms around them the gesture so purely innocent contrasted sharply with the tiny skirt and fishnet stockings and made his stomach muscles tie themselves into hot slippery knots again youd have stopped anyway wherever it happened maybe because you remembered it was me but its harder for me to think that you dont want me now so youre going to have to tell me you dont if you want things to go back to the way they were before they belong back where they were before thats not an answer ethan im sorry to press you about it but i think i deserve one it was hard brutal for her to ask but the taste of him still lingered on her lips if you dont think about me that way and this was just temper pushing you to teach me a lesson then you have to say so straight out it was temper accepting the fresh bruise to her heart she nodded well then it worked that doesnt make it right what i just did makes me too close to that bastard in the bar tonight i didnt want him to touch me she drew in a long breath held it let it out slowly but he didnt speak didnt speak she thought but moved back he might not have shifted an inch but hed moved away from her in the way that counted most im grateful to you for being there tonight she started to rise but he was on his feet ahead of her offering a hand she took it determined not to embarrass either of them any further i was afraid and i dont know if i could have handled it on my own youre a good friend ethan and i appreciate you wanting to help he slid his hands into his pockets where they would be safe i talked to dave about another car hes got a line on a couple decent used ones since screaming would accomplish nothing she had to laugh you dont waste any time all right ill talk to him about it tomorrow she glanced toward the house where the front porch light gleamed do you want to come in i could put some ice on your knuckles he had a jaw like a pillow theyre fine you need to get to bed yeah alone she thought to toss and turn and wish im going to come by on saturday for a couple hours just to spruce things up before cam and anna get home thatd be nice wed appreciate it well good night she turned walked across the grass toward the house he waited he told himself he just wanted to see her safely inside before he left but he knew it was a lie that it was cowardice hed needed the distance before he could finish answering her question grace she closed her eyes briefly all she wanted now was to get inside crawl into bed and indulge in a good long cry she hadnt let herself have a serious jag in years but she turned back made her lips curve yes i think about you that way he saw even with the distance the way her eyes widened darkened the way her pretty smile slid away so that she only stared i dont want to i tell myself not to but i think about you that way now go on inside he told her gently ethan go on its late she managed to turn the knob to step inside shut the door behind her but she turned quickly to the window to watch him get back in his truck and drive away it was late she thought with a shiver that she recognized as hope but maybe it wasnt too late chapter seven contents prev next i appreciate you helping me out mama helping you out carol monroe tsktsked the thought away as she knelt to tie the laces on aubreys pink sneaker taking this cube of sugar home with me for the afternoon is pure pleasure she gave aubrey a chuck under the chin were going to have us a time arent we honey aubrey grinned knowing her ground toys we got toys gramma dollbabies you bet we do and i might just have a surprise for you when we get there aubreys eyes grew huge and bright she sucked in her breath to let out a sharp squeal of delight as she jumped down from the chair to race through the house in her own version of a victory dance oh mama not another doll you spoil her cant carol said firmly giving her knee a push to help herself straighten besides its my privilege as a granny since aubrey was occupied running and shouting carol took a moment to study her daughter not sleeping enough as usual she decided noting the shadows smudged under graces eyes not eating enough to feed a bird either though shed brought over graces favorite homemade peanut butter cookies to try to put some flesh on her girls delicate bones a child not yet twentythree ought to paint her face a little put some curl in her hair and go out kicking up her heels a night or two instead of working herself into the ground since carol had said as much a dozen times or more and had been ignored on the subject a dozen times or more she tried a different tack you got to quit that night work gracie it doesnt agree with you im fine good hard works necessary for living and admirable but a persons got to mix in some pleasure and fun or they dry right up because she was weary of hearing the same song however the notes might vary grace turned and scrubbed at her already spotless kitchen counter i like working at the pub it gives me a chance to see people talk to them even if it was just to ask them if theyd like another round the pays good if youre low on cash im fine grace set her teeth shed have suffered the torments of hell before she would admit that her budget was strained to breaking and that solving her transportation problems was going to mean robbing peter to pay paul for the next several months the extra money comes in handy and im good at waitressing i know you are you could work down at the cafe have day hours patiently grace rinsed out her dishcloth and hung it over the divider of the double sink to dry mama you know that isnt possible daddy doesnt want me working for him he never said that besides you help out with picking crabs when were shorthanded i help you out grace specified as she turned and im happy to do it when i can but we both know i cant work at the cafe her daughter was as stubborn as two mules pulling in opposite directions carol thought it was what made her her fathers daughter you know you could soften him up if you tried i dont want to soften him up he made it plain how he feels about me let it be mama she murmured when she saw her mother preparing to protest i dont want to argue with you and i dont want to put you in the position ever again of having to defend one of us against the other its not right carol threw up her hands she loved them both husband and daughter but shed be damned if she could understand them no one can talk to either of you once you get that look on your face dont know why i waste breath trying grace smiled me either grace stepped close bent down and kissed her mothers cheek carol was six inches shorter than graces five feet eight thanks mama carol softened as she always did and combed a hand through her short curly hair it had once been as blond by nature as her daughters and granddaughters but nature being what it was she now gave it a quiet boost with miss clairol her cheeks were round and rosy her skin surprisingly smooth given her love of the sun but then she didnt neglect it there wasnt a single night she climbed into bed without carefully applying a layer of oil of olay being female wasnt just an act of fate in carol monroes mind it was a duty she prided herself that though she was coming uncomfortably close to her fortyfifth birthday she still managed to resemble the china doll her husband had once called her theyd been courting then and hed taken some trouble to be poetic he usually forgot such things these days but he was a good man she thought a good provider a faithful husband and a fair man in business his problem she knew was a soft heart too easily bruised grace had bruised it badly simply by not being the perfect daughter hed expected her to be these thoughts came and went as she helped grace gather up what aubrey would need for an afternoon visit seemed to her children needed so much more these days time was she would stick grace on her hip toss a few diapers into a bag and off theyd go now her baby was grown with a baby of her own grace was a good mother carol thought smiling a bit as aubrey and grace selected just which stuffed animal should have the privilege of a visit to grandmas the fact was carol had to admit grace was better at the job than she had been herself the girl listened weighed considered and maybe that was best she herself had simply done decided demanded grace was so biddable as a child shed never thought twice about what unspoken needs had lived inside her and the guilt stayed with her because she had known of graces dream to study dance instead of taking it seriously carol passed it off as childish nonsense she hadnt helped her baby there hadnt encouraged hadnt believed the ballet lessons had simply been a natural activity for a girl child as far as carol had been concerned if shed had a son shed have seen to it that he played in the little league it was√¢ just the way things were done she thought now girls had tutus and boys had ball gloves why did it have to be more complicated than that but grace had been more complicated carol admitted and she hadnt seen it or hadnt wanted to see when grace came to her at eighteen and told her she had her summer job money saved that she wanted to go to new york to study dance and begged for help with the expenses shed told her not to be foolish young girls just out of high school didnt go haring off to new york city of all places on gods earth on their own dreams of ballerinas were supposed to slide into dreams of brides and wedding gowns but grace had been dead set on following her dream and had gone to her father and asked that the money theyd put aside for her college fund be used to pay tuition to a dance school in new york pete had refused of course maybe hed been a little harsh about it but hed meant it for the best he was just being sensible just looking out for his little girl and carol had agreed wholeheartedly at the time but then carol watched as her daughter had worked tirelessly saved every penny month after month shed been bound and determined to go and seeing it carol had tried to nudge her husband into letting her he hadnt budged and neither had grace she was barely nineteen when that slicktalking jack casey came around and that was that she couldnt regret it not when aubrey had come from it but she could regret that the pregnancy the hasty marriage and hastier divorce had driven a thicker wedge between father and daughter but what was couldnt be changed she told herself and took aubreys hand to lead her to the car youre sure this car dave has for you runs all right dave says it does well he ought to know he was a good mechanic carol thought even if he had been the one to hire jack casey you know you could borrow mine for a while give yourself more chance to shop around this one will be fine she hadnt even laid eyes on the secondhand sedan dave had picked out for her were going to do the paperwork on monday then ill have wheels again after securing aubrey in the car seat grace slipped in while her mother took the wheel go go go go fast gramma aubrey demanded carol flushed when grace cocked a brow youve been speeding again havent you i know these roads like the back of my hand and i havent had a single ticket in my life because the cops cant catch you with a laugh grace strapped herself in when do the newly weds get home not only did carol want to know she preferred to have the conversation veer away from her notoriously heavy foot i think theyre due in about eight tonight i just want to give the house a buff maybe put something on for dinner in case theyre hungry when they get here i imagine cams wifell appreciate it what a beautiful bride she was ive never seen lovelier where she managed to get that dress when the boy gave her so little time to plan a wedding i dont know seth said she went to dc for it and the veil was her grandmothers thats fine i have my wedding veil put aside i always imagined how pretty it would look on you on your wedding day she stopped and could cheerfully have bitten her tongue it would have looked a little out of place in the county courthouse carol sighed as she pulled into the quinns driveway well youll wear it next time ill never get married again im not good at it while her mother gaped at the statement grace climbed quickly out of the car then leaned in the window and kissed aubrey soundly you be a good girl you hear and dont let grandma feed you too much candy gramma has chocolate dont i know it bye baby bye mama thanks grace√¢ what could she say you ah you just call when youre done here and ill come by and pick you up well see dont let her run you ragged grace added and hurried up the steps she knew shed timed it well everyone would be at the boatyard working she was determined not to feel awkward about what had happened the night before last but she did she felt miserably awkward and she wanted time to settle before she had to face ethan again this was a home that always felt warm and welcoming caring for it soothed her because she knew that a large part of her motivation for working on it that afternoon was selfserving she put more effort into the job the results would be the same wouldnt they she thought guiltily as she ran the old buffer over the hardwood floors to make the wax gleam anna would come home to a spotless house with the scents of fresh flowers polish and potpourri perfuming the air a woman shouldnt have to come home from her honeymoon to dust and clutter and god knew the quinn men generated plenty of both she was needed here damn it all she was doing was proving it she spent extra time in the master bedroom fussing with the flowers shed begged off irene then changing the position of the vase half a dozen times before she cursed herself anna would put them where she wanted them to be anyway she reminded herself and would probably change everything else while she was at it more than likely she would want new everything grace decided as she pressed the curtains shed washed until not the tiniest wrinkle showed in the thin summer sheers anna was citybred and probably wouldnt care for the worn furniture and country touches before you knew it shed have things decked out in leather and glass and all dr quinns pretty things would be packed up in some box in the attic and replaced with pieces of sculpture nobody could understand her jaw tightened as she rehung the curtains gave them a quick fluff cover the lovely old floors with some fancy walltowall carpet and paint the walls some hot color that made the eyes sting resentment bubbled as she marched into the bathroom to put a bunch of early rosebuds in a shallow bowl anybody with any sense could see the place only needed a little care a bit more color here and there if she had any say in it√¢ she stopped herself realizing that her fists were clenched and her face reflected in the mirror over the sink was bright with fury oh grace what is wrong with you she shook her head nearly laughed at herself in the first place you dont have any say and in the second you dont know that shes going to change a single thing it was just that she could grace admitted and once you changed one thing nothing was quite the same again isnt that what had happened between her and ethan something had changed and now she was both afraid and hopeful that things wouldnt be quite the same he thought of her she mused and sighed at her own reflection and what did he think she wasnt a beauty and shed never filled out enough to be sexy now and then she knew she caught a mans eye but she never held it she wasnt smart or particularly clever had neither stimulating conversation nor flirtatious ways jack had once told her she had stability and hed convinced them both for a while that that was what he wanted but stability wasnt the sort of trait that attracted a man maybe if her cheekbones were higher or her dimples deeper or if her lashes were thicker and darker maybe if that flirty curl hadnt skipped a generation and left her hair straight as a pin what did ethan think when he looked at her she wished she had the courage to ask him she looked and saw the ordinary when she had danced she hadnt felt ordinary shed felt beautiful and special and deserving of her name dreamily she dipped into a pile settling crotch on heels then lifting again shed have sworn her body sighed in pleasure indulging herself she flowed into an old wellremembered movement ending on a slow pirouette ethan she squeaked it out color flooding her cheeks when she saw him in the doorway i didnt mean to startle you but i didnt want to interrupt oh well mortified she snatched up her cleaning rag twisted it in her hands i was just√¢ finishing up in here you always were a pretty dancer hed promised himself he would put things back the way theyd been between them so he smiled at her as he would a friend you always dance around the bathroom after you clean it doesnt everyone she did her best to answer his smile but the heat continued to sting her cheeks i thought id be done before yall got back i guess the floors took longer than i figured on they look nice foolish already had a slide surprised you didnt hear it i was daydreaming i thought id then she managed to clear her brain and get a good look at him he was filthy covered with sweat and grime and god knew what youre not thinking of taking a shower in here ethan lifted a brow it crossed my mind no you cant he shifted back because shed taken a step forward he had a good idea just how he smelled at the moment that was reason enough to keep his distance but worse she looked so fresh and pretty hed taken a solemn vow not to touch her again and he meant to keep it why because i dont have time to clean it up again after you or the bath downstairs either i still have to fry the chicken i thought id make that and a bowl of potato salad so you wouldnt have to worry about heating anything up when cam and anna get home i have to deal with the kitchen after so i just dont have time ethan ive been known to mop up a bathroom after ive used one its not the same you just cant use it flustered he took off his cap dragged a hand through his hair well then thats a problem because weve got three men here who need to scrape off a few layers of dirt theres a bay right outside your door but here she opened the cabinet under the sink for a fresh bar of soap damned if shed have them use the pretty guest soaps she set out in a dish ill get you towels and some fresh clothes but go on now ethan and tell the others what i said she shoved the soap into his hand youre already scattering dust everywhere he scowled at the soap then at her youd think the royal family was dropping by for a visit damn it grace im not stripping down to my skin and jumping off the dock oh like youve never done it before not with a female around ive seen naked men a time or two and im going to be too busy to take polaroids of you and your brothers ethan ive just spent the best part of my day getting this house to shine youre not spreading your dirt around disgusted because in his experience arguing with a womans madeup mind was as painful and fruitless as banging your head against a brick wall he shoved the soap in his pocket ill get the damn towels no you wont your hands are filthy ill bring them out muttering to himself he went downstairs phillips reaction to the bathing arrangements was a shrug seths was pure glee he darted outside calling for the dogs to follow and sent shoes socks shirt scattering as he raced for the dock hell probably never want to take a regular bath again phillip commented he sat on the dock to remove his shoes ethan remained standing he wasnt taking off a blessed thing until grace delivered the towels and clothes and was back in the house what are you doing he demanded when phillip pulled his sweatstained tshirt over his head im taking off my shirt well put it back on grace is coming out phillip glanced up saw that his brother was perfectly serious and laughed get a grip ethan even the sight of my amazing and manly chest isnt likely to send her over the edge to prove it he rose and shot grace a grin as she crossed the lawn i heard something about fried chicken he called out im about to get to it when she reached the dock she set the towels and clean clothes in neat piles then she straightened smiling out to where seth and the dogs splashed she imagined theyd scared every bird and fish away for two miles this arrangement suits them just fine why dont you take a dip with us phillip suggested and swore he heard ethans jaw crack you can scrub my back she laughed and picked up the clothes that had already been discarded its been a while since ive gone skinnydipping and as appealing as it sounds ive got too much to do to play right now you give me the rest of your clothes ill get them washed before i go appreciate it but when phillip reached for his belt buckle ethan jabbed an elbow into his ribs you can wash them later if youre set on it go in the house hes shy phillip wiggled his brows im not grace only laughed again but she headed back to the house to give them privacy you shouldnt tease her that way ethan muttered ive been teasing her that way for years phillip peeled himself out of his workstained jeans delighted to be rid of them now its different why phillip started to slip out of his silk boxers then caught the look in ethans eye oh well well why didnt you say so i got nothing to say because grace was in the house now and he couldnt imagine her pressing her nose to the window he pulled off his shirt its her voice that always got me huh that throaty sound phillip continued pleased to be able to rile ethan about something low and smooth and sexy gritting his teeth ethan pried off his work boots maybe you shouldnt listen so hard what can i do can i help it if i have perfect hearing perfect eyesight too he added judging the distance between them and as far as i can see theres nothing wrong with the rest of her either her mouths particularly attractive full shapely unpainted looks tasty to me ethan took two slow breaths as he tugged off his jeans are you trying to irritate me im giving it my best shot ethan stood gauged his man you want to go in headfirst or feetfirst pleased phillip grinned i was going to ask you the same thing both waited a beat then charged grappled and with seths rousing cheers ringing wrestled each other into the water oh my grace thought with her nose pressed up against the window oh my if shed ever seen two more impressive examples of the male form she couldnt say when shed only intended to sneak a quick glance really just one innocent little peek but then ethan had peeled off his shirt and√¢ well damn it she wasnt a saint and what harm did it do to anyone just to look he was just so beautiful inside and out and god if she could get her hands on him again for just five minutes she thought she could die a happy woman maybe she could since he wasnt indifferent the way shed always assumed he was thered been nothing indifferent in the way his mouth had crashed down on hers or the way his hands had rashed over her stop she ordered herself and stepped back from the window the only thing she was going to accomplish this way was to get herself all worked up she knew how to channel her more intimate needs and that was to work until they passed away again but if her mind wasnt completely on her chicken who could blame her she had the potatoes cooling for the salad and the chicken frying when phillip came back in gone was the image of the sweaty laborer in its place was the smooth the gilded the casually sophisticated he winked at her smells like heaven in here i made extra so you can have it for lunch tomorrow you just put those clothes in the laundry room and ill see to them in a minute i dont know what wed do without you around here she bit her lip and hoped everyone felt the same is ethan still in the water no he and seth are doing something to the boat phillip went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of wine wheres aubrey today with my mother in fact she just called and wants to keep her a little longer i guess one of these days im going to have to give in and let her stay overnight she glanced down blankly at the glass of cool golden wine he offered her oh thanks what she knew about wine wouldnt fill a thimble but she sipped because it was expected then her brows lifted this isnt anything like what they serve down at the pub i wouldnt think so he considered what they called the house white down at shineys one shaky step up from horse piss how are things going there fine she gave serious attention to her chicken wondering if ethan had mentioned the incident unlikely she decided when phillip didnt press she relaxed again and let phillip entertain her while she worked he was always full of stories she mused of easy even careless conversation she knew he was smart and successful and had slipped into city living like a duck in water but he never made her feel inadequate or silly and in a cozy way he made her feel just a little more feminine than she had before hed come into the room that was why graces eyes were laughing and her mouth prettily curved when ethan came in phillip sat sipping wine while she put the finishing touches on the meal oh youre making that up i swear phillip held up a hand in oath and grinned as ethan came in the client wants the goose to be the spokesperson so were writing dialogue goose creek jeans fine feathers for everyday living thats the silliest thing i ever heard hey phillip toasted her watch them sell ive got a few phone calls to make he rose deliberately rounding the table to kiss her and make ethan seethe thanks for feeding us darling he strolled out whistling can you imagine making a living writing words for a goose amused grace shook her head as she tucked the bowl of potato salad into the refrigerator everythings done so you can eat when youre hungry your clothes are in the dryer you dont want to leave them sitting in there after its done or theyll be wrinkled she moved around tidying the kitchen as she spoke id wait and fold them for you but im running a bit behind ill drive you home id appreciate it im dealing with the car on monday but until then√¢ she lifted her shoulders and saw with one last glance that she had nothing left to do still she eyed every nook and corner as she walked through the house to the front door how are you getting to work ethan demanded when they were in his truck julies taking me shineys taking me home himself she cleared her throat when i explained what happened the other night he was upset not mad at me but really upset it had happened he was set to skin steve but under the circumstances they had a boy by the way eight and a half pounds theyre calling him jeremy i heard was ethans only comment now she drew a bolstering breath about what happened ethan i mean afterward ive got something to say about that hed worked it out carefully word by word i shouldnt have been mad at you you were scared and i spent more time yelling at you than making sure you were all right i knew you werent really mad at me it was just ive got to finish this he said but waited until hed turned into her driveway i had no business touching you that way id promised myself i never would i wanted you to though the quiet words caused his stomach to clench he shook his head its not going to happen again ive got reasons grace good ones you dont know and you wouldnt understand i cant understand if you dont tell me what they are he wasnt going to tell her what hed done or what had been done to him and what he was afraid still lurked inside him ready to spring out if he didnt keep that cage locked theyre my reasons he shifted to look at her because it was only right to say what he had to say facing her i could have hurt you and i nearly did thats not going to happen again im not afraid of you she reached out to touch to stroke his cheek but he grabbed her hand and held her off youre never going to have to be you matter to me he gave her hand a quick squeeze then released it you always have im not a child anymore and i wont break if you touch me i want you to touch me full shapely unpainted lips phillips words echoed in his head and now ethan knew god help him exactly how tasty they were i know you think you do and thats why were going to try to forget that the other night happened im not going to forget it she murmured and the way she looked at him her eyes soft and full of need made his head swim its not going to happen again so you stay clear of me for a while desperation tinged his voice as he leaned across and shoved open her door i mean it grace you just stay clear of me for a while ive got enough to worry about all right ethan she wouldnt beg if thats what you want thats exactly what i want this time he didnt wait until she was in the house but backed out of the drive the minute she closed the trucks door for the first time in more years than he could count he thought seriously about getting blind drunk chapter eight contents prev next seth kept watch for them his excuse for being in the front yard as the shadows grew long was the dogs not that it was an excuse exactly he thought he was trying to teach foolish not just to chase the battered wellchewed tennis ball but to bring it back the way simon did the trouble was that foolish would race back to you with the ball then expect you to play tugofwar for it not that seth minded he had a supply of balls and sticks and an old hunk of rope that ethan had given him he could toss and tug as long as the dogs were willing to run which was as far as he could tell just about forever but while he played with the dogs he kept his ears tuned for the sound of an approaching car he knew they were on their way home because cam had called from the plane which was just about the coolest thing seth could think of he couldnt wait to tell danny and will how hed talked to cam while cam had been flying over the atlantic ocean hed already looked up italy in the atlas and found rome had traced his finger back and forth back and forth across that wide ocean from rome to the chesapeake bay to the little smudge on marylands eastern shore that was st christophers for a little while hed been afraid they wouldnt come back he imagined cam calling and saying theyd decided to stay over there so he could race again he knew cam had lived all over the place racing boats and cars and motorcycles ray had told him all about it and there was a thick scrapbook in the den that was filled with all kinds of newspaper and magazine pictures and articles about how many races cam had won and how many women hed fooled around with and he knew that cam had won this bigdeal race in his hydrofoil which seth wished he could ride in just once right before ray had run into the telephone pole and died phillip had finally tracked him down in monte carlo seth had found that place in the atlas too and it didnt look all that much bigger than st chris but they had a palace there and fancy casinos and even a prince cam had come home in time to see ray die seth knew he hadnt planned to stay very long but he had stayed after theyd had sort of a fight hed told seth he wasnt going anywhere that they were stuck with each other and he was staying put still that was before hed gotten married and everything before hed gone back to italy before seth had started to worry that both cam and anna would forget about him and the promises theyd made but they hadnt they were coming back he didnt want them to know he was waiting for them or that he was excited that they would be home any minute but he was he couldnt understand why he was all pumped up about it theyd only been gone a couple of weeks and cam was a pain in the ass most of the time anyway and once anna was living there everybody would say how he had to watch his language because there was a woman in the house a part of him worried that anna would change things even though she was his caseworker she might get tired of having a kid around she had the power to send him away more power now he thought because she was doing it with cam all the time he reminded himself that shed played it straight with him from the minute shed pulled him out of class and sat down with him in the school cafeteria to talk but working on a case and living in the same house with that case was different wasnt it and maybe just maybe shed played straight with him shed been nice to him because shed liked having cam poke at her shed wanted to get married to him now that she was she wouldnt have to be nice anymore she could even write in one of her reports that hed be better off somewhere else well he was going to watch and he was going to see he could still run if things got sticky though the idea of running made his stomach hurt in a way it had never done before he wanted to be here he wanted to run in the yard throwing sticks to the dogs to crawl out of bed when it was still dark and eat breakfast with ethan and go out on the water crabbing to work in the boatyard or go down to dannys and wills to eat real food whenever he was hungry and sleep in a bed that didnt smell like somebody elses sweat ray had promised him all of that and though seth had never trusted anyone hed trusted ray maybe ray had been his father maybe he hadnt but seth knew hed paid gloria a lot of money he thought of her as gloria now and not as his mother it helped to add more distance now ray was dead but hed made each of his sons promise to keep seth in the house by the water seth figured they probably hadnt liked the idea but theyd promised anyway hed discovered that the quinns kept their word it was a new and wonderful concept to him a promise kept if they broke it now he knew it would hurt more than anything had hurt him before so he waited and when he heard the car the notquitetamed roar of the corvette his stomach jittered with excitement and nerves simon woofed twice in greeting but foolish set up a din of wild halfterrified barking when the sleek white car pulled into the drive both dogs raced toward it tails waving like flags seth stuck hands that had gone sweaty into his pockets and strolled over casually hi anna shot him a brilliant smile seth could see why cam had gone for her all right he himself had sketched her face a number of times in secret he liked to draw above all else his fledgling artists eye appreciated the sheer beauty of that face the dark almondshaped eyes the clear palegold skin the full mouth and the exotic hint of cheekbones her hair was windblown a dark curling mass her wedding ring set glinted diamonds and gold as she stepped out of the car and caught him unprepared in a laughing bonecrushing hug what a terrific welcome party though the embrace had surprised him into wanting to linger there he wiggled free i was just out fooling with the dogs he looked over at cam shrugged hey hey kid lean and dark and just a little dangerous to the eye cam unfolded his length from the lowriding car his grin was quicker than ethans sharper than phillips just in time to help me unload yeah sure seth glanced up noted the small mountain of luggage strapped to the roof of the car you didnt take all that crap with you we picked up some italian crap while we were there i couldnt stop myself anna said with a laugh we had to buy another suitcase two cam corrected ones just a tote it doesnt count okay cam popped the trunk pulled out a generous darkgreen suitcase you carry the one that doesnt count putting your bride to work already phillip crossed to the car waded through the dogs ill take that anna he said and kissed her with an enthusiasm that had seth rolling his eyes at cam turn her loose phil ethan said mildly id hate for cam to have to kill you before he even gets in the house welcome home he added and smiled when anna turned to give him as enthusiastic a kiss as phillip had given her its good to be home the tote it turned out contained gifts which anna immediately began to dispense along with stories of each one seth only stared down at the brightblueandwhite soccer shirt shed given him no one had ever gone on a trip and brought him back a present the fact was if he thought about it he could count the gifts hed been given something for nothing on the fingers of one hand soccers big over in europe anna told him they call it football but its not like our football she dug deeper then pulled out an oversized book with a glossy cover and i thought you might like this its not as good as seeing the paintings it really grabs you by the throat to see them in person but youll get the idea the book was filled with paintings glorious colors and shapes that dazzled his eyes an art book shed remembered that he liked to draw and had thought of him its cool he muttered it because he couldnt trust his voice she wanted to buy everyone shoes cam commented i had to stop her so i only bought myself a half a dozen pair i thought it was four she smiled six i snuck two by you phillip i stumbled across maglis i could have wept armani she sighed lustily oh yeah now im going to cry you can sob over fashion later cam told them im starving grace was here seth wanted to try on his shirt right away but thought it would be too lame she cleaned everything made us wash up in the bay and she fried chicken grace made fried chicken and potato salad theres no place like home cam murmured and headed for the kitchen seth waited a few seconds then followed i guess i could eat another piece he said casually get in line cam pulled the platter and bowl out of the fridge dont they give you stuff to eat on the plane that was then this is now cam heaped a plate with food then leaned back against the counter the kid looked tanned and healthy he noted the eyes were still wary but his face had lost that rabbitabouttorun look he wondered if it would surprise seth as much as it had himself to know hed missed the smartmouthed brat so hows it been going okay schools done and ive been helping ethan out on the boat a lot pays me slaves wages there and at the boatyard annas going to want to know what you got on your report card as seth muttered around a mouthful of drumstick and cam choked all yeah so what shes going to love that want to make more points with her seth jerked a shoulder again narrowing his eyes as he considered what he would be asked to do to please the woman of the house maybe put the soccer shirt on it took her damn near half an hour to pick out the right one major points if you wear it the same night she gives it to you yeah as easy as that seth thought and relaxed into a grin i guess i can give her a thrill he really liked his shirt anna said as she meticulously tucked away the contents of one suitcase and the book im so glad we thought of the book yeah he liked them cam figured the next day even next year was soon enough to unpack besides he liked stretching out on the bed and watching her watching his wife he thought with an odd little thrill fuss around the room he didnt freeze up when i hugged him thats a good sign and his interaction with ethan and phillip is easier more natural than it was even a couple of weeks ago he was anxious to see you again hes feeling a little threatened by me i change the dynamics around here just at the point where he was getting used to how things worked so hes waiting and hes watching for whatll happen next but thats good it means he considers this his home im the intruder miz spinelli she turned her head arched a brow thats mrs quinn to you buster why dont you turn off the social worker until monday cant she slipped one of her new shoes out of its bag and nearly cooed at it in delight the social worker is very pleased with the status of this particular case and mrs quinn the brandnew sisterinlaw is determined to win seths trust and maybe even his affection she slipped the shoe back into the bag and wondered how long she should wait before asking cam to customize their closet she knew just what she had in mind and he was good with his hands considering she studied him very very good with his hands i suppose i could finish unpacking tomorrow he smiled slowly i suppose you could i feel guilty about it grace has this place so spotless why dont you come over here well work on that guilt why dont i she tossed the shoe over her shoulder and with a laugh jumped him shes coming along cam studied the boat it was barely seven in the morning but his internal clock was still set to rome since hed awakened early he hadnt seen the point in letting his brothers sleep the day away so the quinns stood under the hard bright lights of the boatyard contemplating the job at hand seth mimicked their stance hands in pockets legs spread and braced face sober it would be the first time the four of them had worked on the boat together he was wildly thrilled i figured you could start belowdecks ethan began phillip estimates four hundred hours to finish the cabin cam snorted i can do it in less doing it right phillip put in is more important than doing it fast i can do it fast and right the clientll have this baby under sail and the galley stocked with champagne and caviar in less than four hundred hours ethan nodded since cam had come through with another client who wanted a sport fishing boat he dearly hoped that was true then lets get to work and work kept his mind off things his mind had no business being on the brain had to be focused to use the lathe if you were fond of your hands ethan turned the wood slowly carefully forming the mast ear protectors turned the hum of the motor and the hot rock blasting from the radio into a muffled echo he imagined there was conversation going on behind him too and the occasional ripe curse he could smell the sweet scent of wood the sting of epoxy the stench of tar used to coat bolts years ago the three of them had built his workboat she wasnt fancy and he couldnt claim she had a pretty face but she was sound and she was game theyd built his skipjack as well because hed been determined to dredge oysters in the traditional craft now the oysters were nearly gone and his boat joined the other handful in the bay pulling in extra money during the summer by giving tours he rented it to jims brother during tourist season because it helped them both and was the practical thing to do but it bothered him some to see the fine old vessel used that way just as it bothered him some to know other people lived and slept in the house that was his but when push came to shove money mattered seths laugh snuck through his ear protectors and reminded him why it mattered now more than ever when his hands cramped from the work he turned off the lathe to give them a rest noise filled his ears when he took off the protectors he could hear the pounding of cams hammer echoing from belowdecks seth was coating the centerboard with rustoleum so the steel plate gleamed with wet phillip had the nastier job of soaking the inside of the centerboard case with creosote it was good oldgrowth red cedar which should discourage any marine borers but theyd decided not to take chances a boat by quinn was built to last he felt a stir of pride watching them and could almost imagine his father standing beside him big hands fisted on his hips a wide grin on his face it makes a picture ray said the kind your mother and i loved to study we had plenty of them put aside to take out and look over again once you all grew up and went off your own ways we never really had the chance because she left first i still miss her i know you do she was the glue that kept us all together but she did a good job of it ethan youre still stuck i guess id have died without her without you without them no ray laid a hand on ethans shoulder shook his head you were always strong heart and mind you came out the other side of hell as much because of whats inside you as what we did you should remember that more often just look at seth he handles things differently than you did but hes got a lot of the same qualities inside him he cares deeper than he wants to he thinks deeper than he lets on and his wants go deeper than hell admit even to himself i see you in him it was the first time ethan had allowed himself to say it even to himself i dont know how to feel about it funny i see each one of you in him the eye of the beholder ethan then he gave ethan a quick slap on the back thats a damn fine boat coming along there your mother would have gotten a kick out of this quinns build to last ethan murmured whore you talking to seth demanded ethan blinked felt his head go light filled with thoughts thin as strands of cotton what he pushed a hand up his forehead into his hair knocking his cap back what man you look weird seth cocked his head fascinated how come youre standing here talking to yourself i was√¢ asleep on my feet he wondered thinking he said just thinking out loud suddenly the noise and smells seemed to roar into his dizzy brain i need some air he muttered and hurried out through the cargo doors weird seth said again he started to say something to phillip then was distracted as anna came through the front door carrying an enormous hamper anybody interested in lunch yeah always interested seth made a beeline did you bring the chicken whats left of it she told him and ham sandwiches thick as bricks theres a cooler of iced tea in the car why dont you go haul it in my hero phillip said wiping his hands on his jeans before relieving her of the hamper hey cam theres a gorgeous woman out here with food the hammering stopped instantly seconds later cams head popped up through the cabin roof my woman i get first dibs on the food theres plenty to go around grace isnt the only one who can put meals together for a bunch of hungry men though her fried chickens a gift from the gods shes got a way with it phillip agreed he set the hamper down on a makeshift table fashioned of a sheet of plywood laid over two sawhorses she cooked for ethan regularly when you two were away he dug out a ham sandwich i get the feeling somethings happening there happening where cam wanted to know as he jumped down to explore the hamper with ethan and grace no shit mmm the first bite made phillip close his eyes in pleasure he might have preferred french cuisine served on fine china but he could appreciate a wellbuilt sandwich balanced on a paper plate my deathless observation skills have homed in on certain signs he watches her when shes not looking she watches him when hes not looking and i got some interesting gossip from marsha tuttle she works down at the pub with grace he explained to anna shineys adding a security system and has a new policy that none of the waitresses are to close up alone did something happen anna asked yeah he looked over to be certain seth hadnt come back in a few nights ago some bastard came in after closing grace was alone he put his hands on her and according to marsha would have done more but it just so happened ethan was outside interesting coincidence if you ask me when were talking of our earlytobed earlytorise brother anyway he put some dents in the guy he took another healthy bite cam thought of slender fineboned grace thought of anna i hope they were nice deep dents i think we can assume the guy didnt walk off whistling of course in typical ethan style he doesnt mention it so i have to hear it from marsha over the fresh produce at the market friday night was grace hurt anna knew all too well what it was to be trapped to be helpless to be faced with what a certain kind of man would do to a woman or a child no must have shaken her up but shes like ethan there never mentioned it but there were several long silent looks between them yesterday and after ethan ran her home he came back sizzling remembering phillip chuckled to himself which for ethan is saying something got himself a couple of beers and went out in the sloop for an hour grace and ethan cam considered it theyd fit he saw seth come in and decided to give the topic a rest where is ethan anyway he went outside with a grunt seth set the cooler down and nodded toward the cargo doors he said he needed some air and i guess he did he was standing there talking to himself thrilled with the bounty seth dived into the hamper he was like carrying on a conversation with someone who wasnt there he looked weird the back of cams neck prickled still he moved casually dumping food on a plate i could use some air myself ill just take him a sandwich he saw ethan standing out on the end of the pier staring out at the water the shore of st chris with all its pretty houses and yards was on either side but ethan looked straight out over the light chop to the horizon anna brought some food out ethan folded up his thoughts and glanced down at the plate nice of her you hit lucky with her cam dont i know it what he was about to do made him a little nervous but after all he was a man who lived for risks i still remember the first day i saw her i was pissed off at the world dad was hardly buried and everything i wanted seemed to be somewhere else the kid had given me plenty of grief that morning and it occurred to me that the next part of my life wasnt going to be racing it wasnt going to be europe it was going to be right here you gave up the most coming back here it seemed like it at the time then anna spinelli walked across the yard while i was fixing the back steps she gave me my second jolt of the day since the food was there and cam seemed inclined to talk ethan took the plate and sat on the edge of the dock an egret flew by silent as a ghost a face like hers is bound to give a man a jolt yeah and i was already feeling a little edgy not an hour before id had this conversation with dad he was sitting in the back porch rocker ethan nodded he always liked sitting there i dont mean i remembered him sitting there i mean i saw him there just like im seeing you now slowly ethan turned his head looked into cams eyes you saw him sitting in the rocker on the porch talked to him too he talked to me cam shrugged gazed out over the water so i figure im hallucinating its the stress the worry maybe the anger ive got things to say to him questions i want answered so my mind puts him there only thats not what it was ethan stepped carefully onto boggy ground what do you figure it was he was there that first time and the others other times yeah the last was the morning before the wedding he said it would be the last because id figured out what i needed to figure out for now cam rubbed his hands over his face i had to let him go again it was a little easier i didnt get all the questions answered but i guess the ones that mattered most were he sighed feeling better and helped himself to one of the chips on ethans plate now youll either tell me im crazy or that you know what im talking about thoughtfully ethan tore one of the sandwiches in half handed a share to cam when you follow the water you get to know theres more to things than you can see or touch mermaids and serpents he smiled a little sailors know about them whether theyve ever seen them or not i dont think youre crazy are you going to tell me the rest ive had some dreams i thought they were dreams he corrected himself but lately ive had a couple when i was awake i guess i have questions too but i have a hard time pushing somebody into answers its good to hear his voice to see his face we didnt have enough time to really say goodbye before he died maybe thats part of it its not all of it no but i dont know what he wants me to do that im not doing i imagine hell stick around until you figure it out cam bit into the sandwich and felt amazingly content so what does he think of the boat he thinks its a damn fine boat hes right ethan studied his sandwich are we going to tell phil about this nope but i cant wait until it happens to him what do you bet hell think about heading to some fancy shrink hell want one with lots of initials after his name and an office on the right side of town her name ethan corrected and began to smile hell want a goodlooking female if hes going to lie down on a couch its a pretty day he added suddenly appreciating the warm breeze and the flash of sun youve got another ten minutes to enjoy it cam told him then your ass goes back to work yeah your wife makes a damn good sandwich he angled his head how do you think shed do at sanding wood cam considered liked the image lets go talk her into letting us find out chapter nine contents prev next anna was thrilled to have the afternoon off she loved her job had both affection and respect for the people she worked with she believed absolutely in the function and the goals of social work and she had the satisfaction of knowing she made a difference she helped people the young single mother with nowhere to turn the unwanted child the displaced elderly person inside her burned a deep and bright desire to help them find their way she knew what it was to be lost to be desperate and what one person who offered a hand who refused to snatch that hand back even when it was slapped or snapped at could change and because she had been determined to help seth delauter shed found cam a new life a new home new beginnings sometimes she thought rewards came back to you a hundredfold everything shed ever wanted even when she hadnt known she wanted it was tied up in that lovely old house on the water a white house with blue trim rockers on the porch flowers in the yard she remembered the first day shed seen it shed traveled along this same road with the radio blaring of course the top had been up then so the wind wouldnt tug her hair free of its pins that had been a business call and anna had been determined to be all business the house had charmed her the simplicity of it the stability then she walked around the pretty twostory house by the water and saw an angry uncooperative and sexy man repairing the back porch steps nothing had been quite the same for her since thank god it was her house now she thought with a smug grin as she drove fast along the road flanked by wide flat fields her house in the country with the garden shed imagined√¢and the angry uncooperative sexy man he was hers too and so much more than shed ever imagined she drove along that long straight road with warren zevon howling about werewolves in london but this time she didnt care if the wind tugged at her once tidily pinned hair she was going home so the top was down and her mood was light she had work to do but the reports she needed to complete could be done on her laptop at home while her red sauce simmered on the stove she decided theyd have linguini to remind cam of their honeymoon not that this particular event seemed to be over even if they were back on the shore rather than in rome she wondered if this wild and wicked passion they had for each other would ever ease and hoped not laughing at herself she zipped into the drive and nearly rammed her pretty little convertible into the rear of a dull gray sedan with a rusted bumper once her heart had bumped back down into its proper place she puzzled over it it certainly wasnt cams kind of car she decided he might like to tinker with engines but he preferred the fast and the sleek body to go around them this aged and sturdy body looked anything but fast phillip she let out a snort the fastidious phillip quinn wouldnt have placed his italianloafershod foot on the worn floorboard of such a vehicle ethan then but she found herself frowning pickups and jeeps were ethans style not compact sedans that had fenders still painted with gray primer they were being robbed she thought with a jolt that turned her heartbeat into a jackhammer in broad daylight no one ever thought to lock the doors around here and the house was sheltered from its neighbors by trees and the marsh someone was inside picking through their things right now eyes narrowed she slammed out of the car they werent getting away with it it was her house now damn it and her things and if any halfbaked burglar thought he could√¢ she trailed off as she looked into the sedan and saw the big pink rabbit and the car seat a house burglar with a toddler in tow grace she realized with a sigh it was one of grace monroes cleaning days city girl she chided herself put the city instincts away youre in another place now feeling monumentally foolish she returned to her own car and hefted her briefcase and the bag of fresh produce shed picked up on the way home as she stepped onto the porch she heard the monotonous hum of the vacuum underscored by the bright tinkle of a commercial on tv good domestic sounds anna thought and she was more than delighted that she wasnt the one running the vacuum grace nearly dropped the wand when anna came through the door obviously flustered she stepped back tripping the foot switch to turn the machine off im sorry i thought id be finished before anyone got home im early though her arms were full anna crouched in front of the chair where aubrey sat manically scribbling purple crayon on a picture of an elephant in her coloring book thats beautiful its a phant its a terrific phant prettiest phant ive seen all day because aubreys nose just seemed to demand it anna gave it a quick kiss im nearly done nerves danced down graces spine anna looked so professional in her business suit the fact that her hair was tumbling out of its pins only made her seem√¢ professionally sexy grace decided i finished upstairs and in the kitchen i didnt know√¢ i wasnt sure what youd like but i made up a casserole scalloped potatoes and ham its in the freezer sounds great im cooking tonight anna rose and jiggled her bag cheerfully she nearly stepped out of her shoes but then stopped herself it didnt seem right to start cluttering things up when grace was still in the middle of cleaning shed wait until later but i wont get off early tomorrow she continued so itll come in handy well i√¢ grace knew she was a little sweaty a little grimy and she felt miserably outclassed by annas crisp blouse and tailored suit and oh those shoes she thought doing her best not to make her survey obvious they were so pretty so classic and the leather looked soft enough to sleep on her toes curled in shame inside her frayed white sneakers the laundrys nearly done too theres a load of towels in the dryer i didnt know where you wanted me to put your things so i folded everything and left it on the bed in your room i appreciate it catching up after a couple of weeks away takes forever anna caught herself before she squirmed shed never had a housekeeper in her life and she wasnt quite sure of the proper procedure i should put these away you want something cold to drink no thanks no i should finish up and get out of your way curious anna thought grace had never seemed cool or nervous before though they didnt know each other well anna had felt they were friendly one way or the other she decided they had to come to terms id really like to talk to you if you have the time oh grace ran her hand up and down the metal wand of the vacuum sure aubrey im going in the kitchen with mrs quinn me too aubrey scrambled up and raced ahead by the time her mother caught up she was sprawled on the floor intently creating a purple giraffe thats her color this week grace commented automatically she went to the refrigerator and took out the pitcher of lemonade shed made she tends to settle on one until she wears the crayon down to a nub then she picks another her hand froze on the glass shed been about to take from a cupboard im sorry she said stiffly i wasnt thinking anna set her bag down about what making myself at home in your kitchen aha anna thought there was the problem two women one house they were both a little uneasy about the situation she took a plump tomato from the bag examined it then set it on the counter next year she was going to try to grow her own you know what i liked about this house from the first time i stepped into the kitchen its the kind of place where its easy to make yourself at home i wouldnt want that to change she continued to unload her bag setting carefully chosen vegetables on the counter grace had to bite her tongue to keep from mentioning that ethan didnt care for mushrooms when anna set a bag of them beside the peppers its your home now grace said slowly youll want to tend to it your own way thats true and i am thinking of making some changes would you mind pouring that lemonade it looks wonderful here it comes grace thought changes she poured two glasses then took the plastic cup from the counter to fill for aubrey here honey now dont spill arent you going to ask me what changes anna wondered its not my place when did we get to have places anna demanded with just enough annoyance to put graces back up i work for you for the time being anyway if youre about to tell me youre quitting youre really going to spoil my day i dont care how much progress women have made if im alone in this house with four men ill end up doing ninety percent of the housework maybe not at first she continued pacing now but thats just how itll end up it wont matter that i have a fulltime job on top of it either cam hates housework and hell do anything he can to get out of it ethans neat enough but he has a habit of making himself scarce and seth well hes ten so that says it all phillip only lives here on weekends and hell make the argument that he didnt make the mess in the first place she whirled back are you telling me youre quitting it was the first time grace had seen anna under full steam and she was both impressed and baffled i thought you just said you were going to make some changes and you were going to let me go im thinking about getting some new pillows and having the sofa recovered anna said impatiently not losing the person i already realize im going to depend on for my sanity around here do you think i didnt know who made sure i didnt come home to a houseful of dishes and laundry and dust do i look like an idiot to you no i√¢ the beginnings of a smile flirted at graces mouth i worked my tail off so youd notice okay anna let out a breath why dont we sit down and start over thatd be good im sorry for for all the nasty things i let myself think about you over the last few days she smiled fully as she sat down i forgot how much i liked you im outnumbered around here grace i could sure use another woman i dont know exactly how these things are done and since im the outsider here youre not an outsider grace all but gaped in shock youre cams wife and youve been a part of his life of all their lives a great deal longer she turned her hands palms up smiled lets get this one thing out of the way so we can forget it whatever youve been doing around here works just fine for me i appreciate knowing youre doing it so i can concentrate on my marriage on seth and on my job are we clear there yeah and since my instincts tell me youre a kind understanding person im going to confess that i need you a lot more than you need me and throw myself on your mercy the quick easy laugh made shallow dimples flicker in graces cheeks i dont think theres anything you couldnt do maybe not but i swear to god i dont want to be wonder woman dont leave me alone with all these men grace nibbled on her lip for a moment if youre going to have the living room sofa redone youll need new curtains i was thinking priscillas they beamed at each other in perfect accord mama gotta pee oh grace sprang up and scooped a frantically dancing aubrey into her arms well be right back anna had a good chuckle then rose stripped off her jacket and prepared to start her sauce this kind of cooking the familiar the dependable relaxed her and since she had no doubt that it would earn her points with the quinn men when they got home she intended to enjoy herself it pleased her as well that shed cemented a basis of friendship with grace she wanted that benefit of small towns and country living the neighbors one of the reasons shed been restless during her time in dc was the lack of connection with the people who lived and worked around her when shed moved to princess anne shed found something of the oldneighborhood ease shed grown up with in her grandparents wellestablished section of pittsburgh and now she thought she had the opportunity to become good friends with a woman she admired and believed she would enjoy when grace and aubrey came back into the room she smiled you hear stories about toilet training being a nightmare for everyone involved there are hits and misses grace gave aubrey a quick squeeze before setting her down aubreys such a good girl arent you sweetie i didnt wet my pants i get a nickel for the piggy bank when anna roared with laughter grace winced goodnaturedly and bribery works im all for it i should finish up are you in a hurry not really cautious grace glanced at the kitchen clock by her judgment ethan shouldnt be back for at least an hour maybe you could keep me company while i put this sauce together i suppose i could it had been√¢ she couldnt remember how long it had been since shed just sat in the kitchen with another woman the simplicity of it nearly made her sigh theres a show that aubrey likes to watch thats just coming on is it all right if i settle her down with it i can do the rest of the vacuuming when its over great anna slid her tomatoes into the pot to let them simmer and soften ive never made spaghetti sauce from scratch grace said when she came back in i mean all the way from fresh tomatoes takes more time but its worth it grace i hope you dont mind but i heard what happened the other night at the bar where you work surprise made grace blink and forget to memorize the ingredients anna had set out ethan told you no you have to pull on ethans tongue to get him to tell anything anna wiped her hands on the bib apron shed put on i dont want to pry but i have some experience with sexual assault i want you to know you can talk to me if you need to it wasnt as bad as it could have been if ethan hadnt been there√¢ she trailed off discovered that thinking about it still made her cold inside well he was i should have been more careful anna had a quick flash of a dark road the bite of gravel against her back as she was shoved to the ground its a mistake to blame yourself oh i dont not that way i didnt deserve what he tried to do i didnt encourage him the fact is i made it clear i wasnt interested in him or his hotel bed but i should have locked up after steve left i wasnt thinking and that was careless im glad you werent hurt i could have been i cant afford to be careless she glanced to the doorway where the bright music and aubreys brighter laughter came through ive got too much at stake single parentings hard i see the problems that can come out of it all the time youre brilliant at it now it wasnt surprise but shock no one had ever called her brilliant at anything i just√¢ do yes anna smiled my mother died when i was eleven but before that she was a single parent when i look back and remember i see that she was brilliant at it too she just did i hope im half as good at just doing as both of you when i have a child are you and cam planning on it im good at planning anna said with a laugh i want to give just being married a little time but yes i want children she looked out the window to where the flowers shed planted were blooming this is a wonderful place to raise kids you knew ray and stella quinn oh yes they were wonderful people i still miss them i wish id known them theyd have liked you do you think theyd have liked you for yourself grace told her and theyd have loved what youve done for the family you helped bring them back together i think they got a little lost for a while after dr quinn died maybe they all had to go their own way just like they had to come back ethan stayed hes rooted here in the water like eelgrass but he drifted too and spent too much time alone his house is around the bend that the river takes away from the waterfront ive never seen it its tucked away grace murmured he likes his privacy sometimes on a quiet night if i went walking when i was carrying aubrey i could hear him play his music just catch the notes on the air if the wind was right it sounded lonely lovely and lonely eyes that were dazzled by love saw some things with perfect clarity how long have you been in love with him seems like all my life grace murmured then caught herself i didnt mean to say that too late you havent told him no at even the thought of it graces heart clutched in panic i shouldnt be talking about this hed hate it itd embarrass him well hes not here is he amused and delighted anna beamed i think its terrific its not its awful its just awful horrified she pressed a hand to her mouth to hold back a sudden and unexpected rush of tears i ruined it ruined everything and now he doesnt even want to be around me oh grace flooded with sympathy anna abandoned her chopping to wrap her arms tight around graces stiff form then nudged her toward a chair i cant believe that its true he told me to stay away her voice hitched mortifying her im sorry i dont know whats got into me i never cry then its time you broke tradition anna tore off a couple of sheets of paper towels and offered them go ahead youll feel better i feel so stupid with the dam broken grace sobbed into the paper towels theres nothing to feel stupid about there is there is i made it so we cant even be friends anymore how did you do that anna asked gently i was pushing myself at him i guess i thought after the night he kissed me√¢ he kissed you anna repeated and immediately began to feel better he was mad grace pressed her face into the towel breathing deep until she could regain some control it was after what happened at the pub ive never seen him like that ive known him most of my life and never knew he could be like that id have been scared if i hadnt known him the way he tossed that man aside like he was a bag of feathers and he had this look in his eyes that made them hard and different and√¢ she sighed and admitted the worst exciting oh its horrible to think that are you kidding anna reached over and squeezed her hand i wasnt even there and im excited with a watery laugh grace mopped at her face i dont know what came over me but he was yelling at me it got my back up and we had a fight when he took me home he was saying that i should quit my job and talking to me like id lost every working brain cell in my head typical male reaction thats right abruptly angry all over again grace nodded it was just typical and i never would have expected that from him then we were rolling around on the grass you were absolutely delighted anna grinned he was kissing me and i was kissing him back and it was wonderful all my life id wondered how it would be and then there it was and it was better than anything id ever imagined then he stopped and said he was sorry anna closed her eyes oh ethan you idiot he told me to go inside but just before i did he said he thought about me that he didnt want to but he did so i hoped that things would start to change id say theyd changed already yes but not the way id hoped the day you and cam came back i was here when he got home and it seemed like maybe√¢ but he took me back to my house he told me hed thought it through and he wasnt going to touch me again and i was to steer clear of him for a while she let out a long breath so i am anna waited a moment then shook her head oh grace you idiot when grace frowned anna leaned across the table obviously the man wants you and it scares the hell out of him you have the power here why arent you using it the power what power the power to get what you want if what you want is ethan quinn you just need to get him alone and seduce him grace snorted seduce him me seduce ethan i couldnt do that why couldnt you because i√¢ there had to be a simple and logical reason i dont know i dont think id be good at it i bet youd be great at it and im going to help you you are absolutely anna rose to fuss with her sauce and to think whens your next night off tomorrow good thats just enough time id keep aubrey for you overnight but that might make it too obvious and wed better be subtle is there someone youd trust with her my mothers been wanting to take her overnight but i couldnt perfect you might feel inhibited with the baby in the house ill figure out how to get him over there she turned around studied grace cool classic looks she mused big sad eyes the man was already a goner youll want to wear something simple but feminine considering she tapped a fingertip against her teeth pastel would be best a fragile color soft green or pink because her head was starting to spin grace put a hand to it youre going too fast well someone has to at this rate you and ethan will still be circling each other when youre sixty no jewelry she added just the bare minimum of makeup wear your usual scent too hes used to it itll say something to him anna it doesnt matter what i wear if he doesnt want to be there of course it matters as a woman who had a longterm love affair with clothes she was very nearly shocked at the suggestion men dont think they notice what a woman wears unless its next to nothing but they do subconsciously and it helps click the mood or the image lips pursed she added fresh basil to the sauce and got out a skillet for saut√©ing onions and garlic im going to try to get him over there close to sunset you should light some candles put on music the quinns like their music what would i say to him i can only take you so far here grace anna said dryly and im betting youll figure it out when the time comes she was far from convinced of that while new scents began to romance the air grace worried her lip it feels like id be tricking him and your point would be grace chuckled and gave up i have a pink dress i bought it for steves wedding a couple years ago anna glanced over her shoulder how does it look on you well√¢ graces lips curved slowly steves best man hit on me before they cut the cake sounds like a deal i still dont grace stopped as her mothers ear caught the tinkling music from the living room thats the end of aubreys show i have to finish up in there she rose quickly panicked at the thought of ethan coming home before she was gone surely everything she felt must show on her face anna i appreciate what youre trying to do but i just dont think its going to work ethan knows his own mind then it wont hurt him to come around to your house and see you in a pink dress will it grace blew out a breath does cam ever win an argument with you on the rare occasion but never when im at my best grace edged toward the door knowing that aubreys sitandbehave time was nearly up im glad you came home early today anna tapped her wooden spoon on the lip of her pot me too chapter ten contents prev next the following day as sunset approached grace wasnt certain she was glad at all her nerves were stretched so tight she could feel them straining and bubbling under her skin her stomach continually jumped in quick little rabbit hops and her head was beginning to throb in a sharp insistent rhythm it would be just perfect she thought in disgust if anna managed to get ethan over and she simply pitched forward ill and babbling at his feet that would be seductive she should never have agreed to this foolishness she told herself as she paced through her little house yet again anna had thought so quickly made up her mind so fast and put everything in motion so smoothly that shed been swept along before she could calculate the pitfalls what in the world would she say to him if he came which he probably wouldnt she thought caught between relief and despair he probably wouldnt even come and then shed have sent her baby away for the night for nothing it was too quiet there was nothing but the earlyevening breeze rustling through the trees for company if aubrey had been there where she belonged theyd have been reading her bedtime story now she would have been all scrubbed and powdered and curled up under graces arm in the rocker snuggly and sleepy when she heard her own sigh grace pressed her lips tightly together and marched to the small stereo system on the yellow pine shelves in the living room she selected cds from her collection an indulgence that she refused to feel guilty over and let the house fill with the weeping and romantic notes of mozart she walked to the window to watch the sun drop lower in the sky the light was going soft slipping away shade by shade in the ornamental plum that graced the cutters front yard a lone whippoorwill began to sing to the twilight she wished she could laugh at herself silly grace monroe standing by the window in her pink dress waiting for a star to wish on but she lowered her forehead to the glass closed her eyes and reminded herself that she was too old for wishes anna thought she would have done very well in the espionage game she had kept her plans locked tight behind closed lips no matter how desperately shed wanted to spill out everything to cam she had to remind herself that he was after all a man and he was ethans brother which was another strike against him this was a woman thing she thought she was very subtle about keeping her eye on ethan as well he wasnt going to escape somewhere directly after dinner as was his habit nor would he have a clue that his sisterinlaw was keeping him on a short rein the ice cream idea had been a brainstorm shed picked up a gallon on the way home and now had all three of her men as she liked to think of them settled on the back porch downing bowls of rocky road timing and execution she told herself and rubbed her hands together before she stepped out on the porch its going to be a warm night its hard to believe its nearly july already she wandered to the porch rail to lean over and scan her flower beds coming right along she thought with a sense of righteous satisfaction i thought we could have a backyard picnic on the fourth they have fireworks on the waterfront ethan put in every year half hour after sunset you can see them from right here on the porch really that would be perfect wouldnt it be fun seth you could have your friends over and wed cook burgers and dogs thatd be cool he was already down to scraping his bowl and calculating how to finesse seconds have to dig out the horseshoes cam decided do we still have them ethan yeah theyre around and music anna shifted just enough to rub her husbands knee the three of you could play you dont play together nearly often enough to suit me ill have to make a list youll have to tell me who we should invite and the food food she thought she feigned flustered irritation very well as she pushed away from the porch rail how could i have forgotten i promised grace to trade her my recipe for tortellini for hers for fried chicken she dashed inside to retrieve the index card that shed neatly written the recipe on something shed never done before in her life then dashed back out again all apologetic smiles ethan would you run this over to her he stared at the little white card if he hadnt been sitting down his hands would have jumped into his pockets what i promised id get her this today and it completely slipped my mind id run it over myself but i still have a report to finish im just dying to try out that fried chicken she went on quickly pushing the recipe card into his hand then all but dragging him to his feet its kind of late oh its not even nine oclock dont give him time to think she warned herself dont give him a chance to pick out the flaws she pulled him into the house used smiles and fluttering lashes to move him along i really appreciate it im so scatterbrained these days i feel like im chasing my own tail half the time tell her im sorry i didnt get it to her sooner and to be sure to let me know how it turns out once she tries it thanks so much ethan she added rising up to give him a quick affectionate peck on the cheek i love having brothers well√¢ he was baffled closing in on miserable but the way she said that the way she smiled when she did left him helpless ill be right back i dont think so anna thought with a wisely controlled chuckle as she cheerily waved him off the second his truck was out of sight she dusted her palms together mission accomplished just what the hell was that cam demanded making her jolt with surprise i dont know what you mean she would have sailed past him and into the house but he stepped out blocked her path oh yeah you know what i mean intrigued he angled his head she was trying to look innocent he decided but couldnt pull it off too much pure glee in her eyes exchanging recipes anna so what she lifted a shoulder im a very good cook no argument there but youre not the recipeemergency type and if youd been so hellbent on giving one to grace youd have picked up the phone which is something you didnt give ethan a chance to point out since you were so busy batting your lashes at him and cooing like some emptyheaded twit twit which youre not he continued slowly backing her up until she was trapped against the porch rail at all shrewd savvy sharp he laid his hands on either side of her hips to cage her thats what you are it was she supposed a fine compliment thank you cameron now i really should get to that report uhuh whyd you con ethan into going over to graces she shook back her hair aimed a bland look dead into his eyes id think a shrewd savvy sharp guy like you ought to be able to figure that out his brows drew together youre trying to get something going between them something is going between them but your brother is slower than a lame turtle hes slower than a lame turtle with bifocals but thats ethan dont you think they should muddle through this on their own all they need is five minutes alone and thats all i did work it out so theyd have a few minutes alone besides she slipped her arms up and around his neck we deliriously happy women want everyone else to be deliriously happy too he cocked a brow do you think im going to fall for that she smiled then leaned over to nip his bottom lip yeah youre right he murmured and let her convince him ethan sat in his truck for a full five minutes recipes that was the dumbest damn thing hed ever heard of hed always thought anna was a sensible woman but here she was sending him off to deliver recipes for christs sake and he wasnt ready to see grace just yet not that his mind wasnt made up about her but√¢ even a rational man had certain weaknesses still he didnt see how he was going to get out of it as he was already here hed make it quick she was probably putting the baby to bed so hed just get it done and get out of her way like a man condemned he dragged himself out of the truck and to her front door through the screen he could see the flickering lights of candles he shifted his feet and noticed that music was playing something with weeping strings and soaring piano hed never felt more ridiculous in his life than he did standing there on graces front porch holding a recipe for a pasta dish while music slid around the warm summer night he knocked on the wood frame not too loudly as he worried about waking aubrey he gave serious thought to sticking the card in the door and hightailing it but he knew that would be cowardice plain and simple and anna would want to know why he hadnt brought her the instructions for graces fried chicken when he saw her he wished to god almighty hed taken the cowards way she walked out from the kitchen at the back of the house it was a tiny place had always made ethan think of a dollhouse so she didnt have far to travel to him it seemed he watched her walk through that music that light for hours she wore pale fragile pink that skimmed down to her ankles with a row of tiny pearl buttons from the hollow of her throat to the hem that flowed around her bare feet he had rarely seen her in a dress but now he was too thunderstruck by the sight of her to question why she was wearing it all he could think was she looked like a rose long and slim and just ready to bloom and his tongue tangled up in his mouth ethan her hand trembled lightly as she reached down opened the screen maybe she hadnt needed a star to wish on after all for here he was standing close and watching her i was√¢ her scent familiar as his own seemed to wrap around his brain anna sent you she asked me to bring this by mystified grace took the card he held out at the sight of the recipe she had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing her nerves backed off just enough that her eyes smiled when she lifted them to his that was nice of her you got hers her what the one she wants the chicken thing oh yes back in the kitchen come on in while i get it what chicken thing she wondered nearly giddy from suppressed laughter that she knew would come out well on the hysterical side the um casserole right no she had such a tiny waist he thought such narrow feet fried oh thats right im so scatterbrained lately its going around he mumbled he decided it was safer to look anywhere but at her he noted the pair of fat white candles burning on the counter you blow a fuse excuse me whats wrong with your lights nothing she could feel the heat rise into her cheeks she didnt have a recipe for fried chicken written down anywhere why would she you just did the same as you always did when it came time to make it i like candlelight sometimes it goes with the music he only granted wishing she would hurry up so he could get the hell away you already put aubrey to bed shes spending the night with my mother his eyes which had been steadfastly studying her ceiling shot down and met hers shes not here no its her first overnight ive already called over there twice she smiled a little and her fingers reached up to fiddle with the top button of her dress in a way that made ethans mouth water i know shes only a few miles away and as safe as shed be in her own crib but i couldnt help it the house feels so different without her here dangerous was the word hed have used the pretty little dollhouse was suddenly as deadly as a minefield there wasnt any little girl innocently sleeping in the next room they were alone with music sobbing and candles flickering and grace was wearing a palepink dress that just begged to have those little white buttons undone one by one by one the tips of his fingers began to itch im glad you stopped by holding tight to her courage she took a step forward and tried to remember that she had the power i was feeling a little blue he took a step back more than his fingertips was itching now i said id be back directly you could stay for√¢ coffee or whatever coffee if his system got any more wired than it was at that moment it would have jumped right through his skin to dance the hornpipe i dont think√¢ ethan i cant steer clear of you the way you asked me st chris is too small and our lives are too tangled up together she could feel the pulse in her throat pounding against her skin in hard insistent little knocks and i dont want to i dont want to steer clear of you ethan i said i had my reasons and he could think of what they were if shed just stop looking at him with those big green eyes im just watching out for you grace i dont need you to watch out for me were all grown up both of us were alone both of us she stepped closer she could smell his afterwork shower on him but under it as always was the scent of the bay i dont want to be alone tonight he edged back if he hadnt known her better hed have sworn she was stalking him ive made up my mind on this but damn it it wasnt his mind working overtime it was his loins just stay back grace it seems like ive been staying back forever i want to move forward ethan whatever that means im tired of staying back or standing still if you dont want me ill live with that but if you do√¢ she moved closer lifted a hand to lay it on his heart and discovered that his heart was pounding if you do then why wont you take me he backed hard into the counter stop it you dont know what youre doing here of course i know what im doing she snapped it out suddenly furious with the pair of them im just not doing a good job of it since youd rather climb up my kitchen wall than lay a finger on me what do you think id do shatter into a million pieces im a grown woman ethan ive been married ive had a child i know what im asking you and i know what i want i know youre a grown woman ive got eyes then use them and look at me how could he do otherwise why had he ever believed he could there standing in shadow and light was everything he yearned for im looking at you grace with my back to the wall he thought and my heart in my throat heres a woman who wants you ethan one who needs you she saw his eyes change at that sharpen darken focus on an unsteady breath she stepped back maybe im what you want what you need he was afraid she was and that telling himself he could and would do without had been an exercise in futility she was so lovely all rose and gold in the candlelight her eyes so clear and honest i know you are he said at length but that wasnt supposed to change anything do you have to think all the time its getting hard to he murmured right at the moment then dont lets both stop thinking even as the blood pounded in her brain she kept her gaze locked on his and lifted her hands trembling hands to the top button of her dress he watched her unfasten it staggered at how that single simple gesture that tiny inch of exposed skin could electrify him he felt his lungs clog his blood sizzle and his needs all the longdenied needs beg for release stop grace he said it gently dont do that her hands fell back to her sides in defeat and she shut her eyes let me do it her eyes blinked open stared stunned at his sober gaze as he stepped to her she took in one shaky breath and held it ive always wanted to he murmured and slipped the next tiny button free oh the breath she held came out in a hitch and a sob ethan youre so pretty she was already trembling he lowered his head to brush a kiss over her lips and soothe so soft ive got rough hands watching her he skimmed his knuckles down her cheek over her throat but i wont hurt you i know i know you wont youre shaking he undid another button then another i cant help it i dont mind patiently he eased the buttons free to her waist i guess i knew deep down if i walked in here tonight i wouldnt be able to walk away again ive been wishing youd walk in here ive been wishing it a long time so have i the buttons were so tiny his fingers so big her skin where the dress parted where the edge of his thumb slid up was so soft and warm you tell me if i do something you dont like or if i dont do something you want the sound she made was part moan part laugh im not going to be able to talk in a minute i cant get my breath but i wish youd kiss me i was getting to it he nibbled gently teasingly because he hadnt taken his time the first time hed tasted her now he would linger sample find a rhythm that suited them both when her sigh filled his mouth it was sweet he loosened more buttons and let the long deepening kiss spin out touched her nowhere else not yet only mouth against mouth with flavors mixed when she swayed he lifted his head looked into her eyes clouded now heavy and aware i want to see you slowly inch by inch he slipped the dress from her shoulders they were sunkissed strong gracefully curved hed always thought she had the prettiest shoulders and now he indulged himself by tasting them the hum in her throat told him she was both surprised and pleased by the attention he had a great deal more to give her shed never been touched this way as if she were something rare and precious what that touch stirred in her was so new and warm her skin seemed to soften and sensitize under the brush of his lips the blood beneath to go thick and lazy she only sighed as her dress slid down to pool at her feet when he eased back again she could only stare up at him in wonder her lashes fluttered her pulse skipped when he stroked his fingers lightly over the swell of her breast above her simple cotton bra she had to bite her lip to hold back the groan when he flicked open the hook when he gently cupped her breast in his palms do you want me to stop oh god her head fell back and this time the groan escaped his workingmans thumbs were skimming slowly rhythmically over her nipples no hold on to me grace he spoke quietly and when her hands came to his shoulders and gripped he brought his mouth to hers again drawing more this time asking more until she went limp then he lifted her into his arms he waited until her eyes opened again im taking you grace thank god ethan he had to smile when she pressed her face into the curve of his shoulder ill protect you for a moment as he carried her off she thought of dragons and black knights then the more practical meaning got through i take the pill its all right i havent been with anybody since jack hed known that in his heart but hearing it only added to his steadily rising need shed lighted candles in the bedroom as well slim tapers there that lanced up out of tiny white shells the white of her iron headboard glowed in the soft light white daisies sprang out of a clear glass vase on the small table beside the bed she thought he would lay her down but instead he sat cradling her holding her drugging her with those slow endless kisses until her pulse beat thickly grew sluggish then his hands began to move everywhere he touched a small fire fanned into flame callused hands slipping sliding over her skin long roughedged fingers stroking pressing there oh yes just there the daylong stubble of beard rubbed the sensitive curve of her breasts as his tongue circled then flicked and always always his mouth coming back to hers for one more just one more endless mindreeling kiss she tugged at his shirt hoping to give back some of the pleasure some of the magic found the scars and the muscle and the man his torso was lean his shoulders broad the flesh warm under her seeking fingers the breeze whispered through the open window the call of the whippoorwill chasing after it and the sound no longer seemed so lonely he eased her back settled her head on the pillow then bent to pull off his boots palegold candlelight swayed against shadows the color of smoke both shades shimmered over her he watched as her hand snuck up to cover her breast and he paused long enough to take it and kiss the knuckles i wish you wouldnt he murmured youre such a pleasure to look at she hadnt thought shed feel shy knew it was foolish but she had to order herself to let her hand fall onto the bed when he slipped out of his jeans she had to struggle with her breathing all over again no fairytale knight had ever been built more magnificently or borne scars more heroically desperate with love she held out her arms in welcome he slipped into them careful not to press his full weight onto her she was fragile he reminded himself so slim and so much more innocent than she believed as the rising moon slanted its first light through the window he began to show her sighs and murmurs long slow caresses quiet sips and tastes his hands aroused devastated but never hurried hers explored admired and forgot to hesitate he found where she was most sensitive the underside of her breast the back of her knee the sweet shallow seductive valley between her thigh and her center so focused on her was he that his own rising need took him by surprise flashing once hard and strong and dragging out his moan when he took her breast into his mouth she arched shuddering at the edgier demand and the rhythm changed with his breath growing ragged he lifted his head his eyes intent on her face his hand slid between her thighs pressed there against the heat found her already wet i want to see you go over he played his fingers over her in her as her breath quickened pleasure panic excitement all raced over her face he watched her climb closer closer with her breath tearing then releasing on a strangled cry as she peaked she tried to shake her head to clear it but the delicious dizziness continued to spin the familiar room revolved hazed so that only his face was clear was real she felt drunk and dazed and unspeakably aroused this finally this was love as shed dreamed it would be her skin quivered as he slid slowly up her body his mouth laying a warm damp trail please it wasnt enough even this wasnt enough she craved the mating the union the final intimacy ethan she opened for him arched now his hands cupped her face his lips covered her lips now he murmured against them and filled her their long groaning sighs blended that first endless shudder of pleasure as he buried himself inside her rocked them both when they began to move they moved together smoothly silkily as if theyd only been waiting desire was fluid its current steady they rode it thrilling to the pace to the deep resonant pleasure of each long slow stroke grace swirled close to the edge felt the orgasm build slide through her system like velvet ribbon so that she rose up farther up wallowed in the glow then floated down into weightless wonder he pressed his face into her hair and let himself follow he was so quiet it worried her he held her but he would have known shed need him to still he didnt speak and the longer the silence stretched the more she feared what he would say when he broke it so she broke it first dont tell me youre sorry i dont think i could stand it if you told me you were sorry i wasnt going to i promised myself id never touch you like this but im not sorry i did she rested her head on his shoulder just under his chin will you touch me like this again right this minute because she caught the lazy amusement in his voice she relaxed and smiled i know better than to rush you on anything she lifted her head because it was vital that she know will you ethan will you be with me again he traced a finger through her hair i dont see talking either one of us out of it after tonight if you started to id have to try to seduce you again yeah a smile crept over his face then maybe i should start talking thrilled she rolled over him and hugged hard id be better at it the next time too because i wouldnt be so damned nervous nerves didnt seem to get in your way i nearly swallowed my tongue when you walked to the door in that pink dress he started to nuzzle her hair stopped narrowed his eyes what were you doing wearing a dress to sit around at home i dont know√¢ i just was she turned her head ran kisses along his throat hold on knowing just how quickly she could distract him he took her shoulders and lifted her up a pretty dress candlelight√¢ its almost like you were expecting me to come along im always hoping you will she said and tried to kiss him again sending me off with a recipe for christs sake in a smooth and easy move he plopped her on her butt beside him then sat up you and anna got your heads together on this didnt you set me up what a ridiculous thing to say she tried for indignant but could only manage guilty i dont know where you get these ideas you never could lie worth spit firmly he took her chin in one hand holding it until her eyes shifted to his it took me a while to figure it but ive got it now dont i she was only trying to help she knew i was upset about the way things were between us youve got a right to be mad but dont take it out on her she was only did i say i was mad he interrupted no but√¢ she trailed off drew in a careful breath youre not mad im grateful his grin was slow and wicked but maybe you ought to try to seduce me again just in case chapter eleven contents prev next in the dark while an owl still hooted ethan shifted easing out from under the arm grace had wrapped around his chest in response she snuggled closer the gesture made him smile are you getting up she asked in a voice that was muffled against his shoulder ive got to its after five already he could smell rain on the air hear it coming in the rising wind im going to get a shower you go back to sleep she made a sound that he took for assent and burrowed into the pillow he moved lightly through the dark though he had to check himself a couple of times on the way to the bathroom he didnt know her house as well as his own he waited until he was inside before turning on the light so the backwash of it wouldnt spill into the hall and disturb her the room was scaled to match the rest of the house so small he could have stood in the center and touched each side wall with his hands the tiles were white the walls above them papered in a thin candy stripe he knew shed hung the paper herself she rented from stuart claremont and the man wasnt known for his generosity or his sense of decor he had to grin at the orangebilled rubber duck nested on the side of the tub one sniff at the soap made him realize why grace always smelled faintly of lemons while he appreciated the fragrance on her he hoped sincerely that jim wouldnt notice the citrus scent on him he ducked his head under what he thought of as a pisstrickle of spray she needed a new showerhead he decided and as he rubbed a hand over his face noted that he needed a shave both would have to wait but it was likely that now that things had changed between them she would let him take care of a few things around the house for her shed always been so blessed stubborn about accepting help it seemed to him that even a proud woman like grace would be less stiff about taking help from a lover than a friend thats what they were now ethan reflected no matter how many promises hed made to himself it wouldnt end with one night neither one of them was built that way and it had as much to do with heart as it did with loins theyd taken the step and that step involved commitment thats what worried him most he would never be able to marry her have children with her she would want more children she was too fine a mother had too much love to give not to want them aubrey deserved brothers or sisters there wasnt any point in thinking about it he reminded himself things were the way things were and right now he had a right and a need to live in the moment they would love each other as much as they could for as long as they could that would be enough it took him barely five minutes to discover that graces hot water heater was as small as the rest of the house even the miserly trickle of water turned cool then cold before hed managed to rinse away all the lather cheap bastard he muttered thinking of claremont he switched off the spray and wrapped one of the brightpink towels around his waist he intended to go back and dress in the dark but when he opened the door he could see the light from the kitchen and hear graces still sleephusky voice singing about finding love just in the nick of time while the first drops of rain pattered against the windows he stepped into the scent of bacon frying and coffee brewing and the sight of grace wrapped in a short cotton robe the color of spring leaves his heart gave such a hard bounce of joy he was surprised it didnt simply leap out of his throat and land quivering in her hands he moved quick and quiet so that when he wrapped his arms around her pressed his lips to the top of her head she jolted in surprise i told you to go back to sleep she leaned back against him closing her eyes and absorbing the lovely thrill of a kitchen embrace i wanted to fix you breakfast you dont have to do things like that he turned her around i dont expect things like that you need your rest i wanted to do it his hair was dripping his chest gleaming with wet the sparkling gush of lust both delighted and shocked her todays special i appreciate it he bent intending to give her one soft morning kiss but it deepened lengthened until she was on her toes straining against him he had to pull himself back block off the rushing need to tug off the robe and take her the bacons going to burn he murmured and this time pressed his lips to her forehead id better get dressed she turned the bacon briskly to give him time to cross the room anna had been right she thought about having power ethan yeah ive got an awful lot of need for you stored up she glanced over her shoulder and her smile was smug i hope you dont mind the blood danced gleefully out of his head she wasnt just flirting she was challenging he had a feeling she knew shed already won the only safe answer he could think of was a grunt before he retreated to the bedroom he wanted her grace did a quick dance and spin theyd made love three times three beautiful glorious times during the night had slept wrapped around each other and he still wanted her it was the most beautiful morning of her life it rained all day the water was rough as the tongue of a shrew and just as likely to lash ethan fought to keep the boat on course and was glad he hadnt let the boy come with them he and jim had worked in worse but he imagined seth would have spent a good portion of the day hung over the rail but foul weather couldnt spoil his mood he whistled even as rain slapped his face and the boat pitched under him like a rodeo bronc jim eyed him sideways a few times hed worked with ethan long enough to know the boy was the friendly goodnatured sort but a whistling fool he wasnt he smiled to himself as he hauled up another pot looked like the boy did something more energetic than reading in bed last night if you asked him about time too if you asked him by his reckoning ethan quinn was round about thirty years of age a man should oughta be settled down with a wife and kids by that time of life a waterman was better off going home to a hot meal and a warm bed a good woman helped you through gave you direction cheered you up when the bay got stingy as god knew it could he wondered who this particular woman might be not that he stuck his nose in other peoples business he minded his own and expected his neighbors to do the same but a man had a right to a little curiosity about things he pondered on how to bring the subject around when an underthelimit shecrab found a tiny hole in his glove and snapped before he could toss her back little bitch he said with a wince but without much heat she get you yeah jim watched her splash back into the waves ill be back for you before the seasons over looks like you need new gloves there jim the wifes picking me up some today he shoved the thawing alewives they used for bait into the trap sure helps matters to know you got a woman to do for you some uhhuh ethan shoved the steering stick with one hand picked up the gaff with the other and timed the chop and the distance a man spends the day working on the water its a comfort to know his womans waiting for him a little surprised that they were having a conversation ethan nodded i suppose well just finish up this line jim then head in jim culled the next pot let the silence settle between them a few gulls were having what jim thought of as a pissing match overhead screaming and diving and threatening each other over loose fish parts you know me and bess well be married thirty years come next spring is that so steadies a man a woman does you wait too long to marry up though you get set in your ways i guess youd be around thirty now wouldnt you capn thats right dont want to get set in your ways ill keep that in mind ethan told him and shot out the gaff jim merely sighed and gave up when ethan wandered into the boatyard cam was at the skill saw and three young boys were sanding the hull or pretending to you hire a new crew ethan asked as simon trotted over to investigate cam glanced to where seth chattered away with danny and will miller it keeps them out of my hair you give up on crabs today pulled in enough he pulled out a cigar and lit it while he gazed thoughtfully out the open cargo doors rains coming down pretty hard tell me about it cam sent an accusing scowl toward the streaming windows thats why those three were in my hair the little onell talk your ears blue and if you dont have the others doing something to keep them busy they make trouble out of thin air well ethan puffed out smoke watched the kids send simon into ecstasy with rough rubs and scratches at the rate theyre going theyll have that hull sanded down in ten or twenty years thats something we have to talk about hiring on those kids for the next two decades no work it was as good a time as any to take a break cam stooped and pumped iced tea out of the cooler i got a call from tod bardette this morning the friend of yours who wants the fishing boat thats right now bardette and i go back a ways he knows what i can do he offer you another race he had cam mused cutting the dust in his throat with the sweet tea turning it down had stung but the sting had eased more quickly this time around i made a promise here im not breaking it ethan tucked a hand in his back pocket and looked toward the boat this place this business had been his dream not cams not phillips i didnt mean it that way i guess i know what you put away to pull this off we needed it yeah but youre the only one whos given up anything to make it happen i havent bothered to thank you for it and im sorry for that every bit as uncomfortable as his brother cam stared at the boat im not exactly suffering here the business is going to help us get permanent guardianship of seth and its satisfying on its own account of course phils bitching about our cash flow every time you turn around thats his strength bitching ethan grinned around the cigar clamped in his teeth yeah and cash flows you and me we could never pull this off without him nagging us about the details we may have more for him to nag about thats what i started to tell you bardette has a friend whos interested in a custom catboat he wants fast and he wants pretty fitted out and sailing by march ethan frowned and worked timetables in his head its going to take us another seven or eight weeks to finish this one and that puts us into end of august beginning of september calculating he leaned back against the workbench his eyes narrowed against the smoke then we got the sports fisher i cant see us finishing her off before january and thats pushing that doesnt give us enough time to deliver no not the way things are i can give it fulltime and after crab seasons over i imagine youll put in more hours here oystering isnt what it was but youll have to decide if you can juggle more time off the water ethan and in here he knew what he was asking ethan didnt just live on the water he lived for it phils going to have to make some hard decisions before much longer too were not going to have the cash to hire on laborers for a while yet he blew out a breath unless we count a couple of kids this friend of bardettes isnt ready to commit hes going to come down and take a look at the place and us and what weve got here i figure we make sure phillips around to sweettalk him into a contract and a deposit ethan hadnt expected it to happen so soon to have one dream grow and steal from the other he thought of the chill winter months spent dredging the rise and fall of the skipjack over hard chop the long often frustrating search for oyster for rockfish for a living a nightmare for some he supposed but hope and glory for him he took the time to look around the building the boat nearly finished waiting for willing and able hands under the hard overhead lights seths drawings were framed on the wall and spoke of dreams and sweat tools still shiny under a coating of dust stood silent waiting boats by quinn he mused if you wanted to grab ahold of one thing you had to let go of another im not the only one who can captain the workboat or the skipjack he saw both the question and the understanding in cams eyes and jerked a shoulder its just juggling time where it needs to be spent most yeah i guess i could work up a design for a cat and have seth do the drawing cam added and laughed when ethan grimaced we all have our strengths pal art isnt yours ill think about it ethan decided and well see what happens next good enough so√¢ cam drained his cup howd the recipe exchange go ethan ran his tongue around the inside of his cheek im going to have a talk with your wife about that be my guest smiling cam plucked the cigar from ethans fingers and took a trio of careless puffs you sure look√¢ relaxed today ethan im relaxed enough he said evenly and id think you might have seen fit to mention to me that anna had some plot to improve my sex life for me i might have if id known about it then again since your sex life needed some improvement i might not on impulse cam grabbed ethan in a headlock because i love you man he only laughed when the elbow plowed into his stomach see it even improved your reflexes ethan shifted angled his weight and reversed their positions youre right he said and rubbed his knuckles hard on the top of cams head for good measure since it was his night to cook ethan added an egg to a bowl of ground beef he didnt mind cooking it was just one of those things you did to get through hed harbored a small selfish and purely chauvinistic hope that anna would take over the kitchen duties as woman of the house shed squashed that hope like a bug of course having her around did spread out the chore but the worst of it as far as he was concerned was figuring out the menu it was different from cooking for himself hed learned quickly enough that when you cooked for a family everybody was a critic what is that seth demanded when ethan shook oatmeal into the mix meat loaf looks like crap to me why cant we have pizza because were having meat loaf seth made a gagging sound as ethan dumped some tomato soup into the mix gross id rather eat dirt theres plenty of it outside seth shifted from foot to foot rose up on his toes to get a closer look at the bowl the rain was driving him crazy there was nothing to do he was starving to death he had six million mosquito bites and there was nothing but kid crud and news on tv when he listed this litany of complaints ethan merely shrugged go bug cam cam had told him to go bug ethan seth knew from hard experience that it took much longer to bug ethan than cam how come you put all that crap in there if its called meat loaf so it doesnt taste like crap when you eat it i bet it does for a kid who only months before hadnt known where his next meal was coming from ethan thought darkly seth had gotten mighty particular instead of saying so he aimed a single sharp dart cams cooking tomorrow oh man poison seth rolled his eyes dramatically grabbed his throat and staggered around the room ethan might have been mildly amused if the dogs hadnt gotten into the act by scrambling in and barking wildly by the time anna walked in ethan had the meat loaf in the oven and was dumping aspirin into his palm hi miserable day traffic was filthy she raised an eyebrow as ethan downed the pills headache huh allday rain can sure give you one this ones named seth oh concerned she poured herself a glass of wine and prepared to listen theres bound to be periods of stress and difficulties he has a tremendous amount to overcome and his belligerence is a defense did nothing but complain for the last hour my ears are still ringing doesnt want meat loaf ethan muttered and snagged a beer from the fridge why cant we have pizza he ought to be grateful somebodys putting food in his belly instead hes saying it looks like crap and will likely taste worse then he gets the dogs all fired up so i cant even work in peace for five damn minutes and√¢ he trailed off steelyeyed when he saw her grinning easy for you to be amused by it i am im sorry but im even more pleased oh ethan its so wonderfully normal hes behaving just like an annoying ten year old after a rainy day a couple of months ago hed have spent that time sulking in his room instead of giving you a headache its such tremendous progress hes progressing into being a pain in the ass yes she felt tears of delight sting her eyes isnt it marvelous he must have been really annoying if it was enough to try your unflappable patience at this rate hell be a terror by christmas and thats a good thing yes ethan ive worked with children who havent faced nearly the miseries seth has and it can take them so much longer to adjust even with counseling you and cam and phillip have done wonders for seth cooling off ethan sipped his beer you had a hand in it yes i did which makes me as happy on a professional level as i am on a personal one and to prove it ill give you a hand with dinner so saying she shrugged out of her jacket and began to roll up her sleeves what did you have in mind to go with the meat loaf hed planned on sticking some potatoes in the microwave because they didnt require any fussing and maybe digging some frozen peas out but√¢ i thought maybe some of those cheese noodles you make would go nice as a side dish the alfredo cholesterol city added to meat loaf but what the hell ill fix them why dont you sit down until the headache passes it already had but it seemed smarter not to mention it he sat prepared to enjoy his beer and fix his sisterinlaws wagon oh grace said i should thank you for the recipe shell let you know how it turns out for her oh turning to hide her satisfied smile anna reached for an apron yeah i got the fried chicken makings for you stuck it in the cookbook he hid his own smile with his beer when her head swiveled you√¢ oh well√¢ id have given it to you last night but it was late when i got back and you were in bed i ran into jim when i left graces jim puzzled annoyance showed clearly on her face went on over to his place to help him tune up this outboard thats been giving him trouble you were at jims last night stayed later than i meant to but there was a ball game on the os were playing out in california she could have cheerfully smashed him over the head with his own beer bottle you spent last night working on an engine and watching a ball game yeah he sent her an innocent look like i said i got in kinda late but it was a hell of a game she huffed out a breath yanked open the refrigerator to get out cheese and milk men she muttered all of them idiots whats that nothing well i hope you had a fine time watching your baseball game while grace was home alone miserable i cant remember enjoying myself more went into extra innings he was grinning now just couldnt help it she looked so flustered and furious and was trying desperately to hide it well hot damn fuming she shifted to get the fettuccine out of the cupboard and saw his face she turned slowly holding the package of pasta you didnt go over to jims to watch a ball game last night didnt i he lifted a brow glanced thoughtfully at his beer then sipped you know come to think of it youre right that was some other time you were with grace was i oh ethan with clenched teeth she slammed the jar down youre making me crazy where were you last night you know i dont believe anyones asked me that since my mother died im not trying to pry youre not all right all right i am trying to pry and you make it impossible to be subtle about it he leaned back in his chair studying her hed liked her almost from the first even when she made him uneasy wasnt it funny he mused to realize that sometime over the last few weeks he had come to love her which mean that teasing her was well required youre not asking me if i spent the night in graces bed are you no no of course not she snatched up the pasta then set it down again not exactly were the candles her idea or yours anna decided it was a good time to get out a skillet she just might need a weapon did they work yours i imagine probably the dress too graces mind doesnt work that way shes not what youd call√¢ sneaky anna hummed and prepared to make her cheese sauce and it was sneaky underhanded meddling to send me over there that way i know it but id do it again more skillfully next time she promised herself you can be annoyed with me all you want ethan but ive never seen anyone more in need of some meddling youre a pro at it i mean being a social worker you make a living meddling in peoples lives i help people who need it she said firing up the skillet god knows you did she yelped when his hand dropped on her shoulder she half expected him to give her a quick shake so when he kissed her cheek she could only blink at him i appreciate it you do not that id care to have you do it again but this once i appreciate it she makes you happy everything inside anna softened i can see it well see how long i can make her happy ethan let it stand he kissed her again as much in warning as affection well take it a day at a time for a while all right but her smile bloomed grace is working at the pub tonight isnt she yeah and just so you dont have to bite your tongue in half to keep from asking im thinking of going by for a while after dinner good more than satisfied anna got to work then well eat soon chapter twelve contents prev next it was like walking wide awake into a dream grace thought where you couldnt be sure what was going to happen next but you just knew it would be wonderful it was living inside a familiar world that had been polished into a constant state of anticipation and excitement days and nights were still filled with work responsibilities small joys and petty annoyances but for now with this full rush of love the joys seemed huge the annoyances minute everything shed ever read about love was true she discovered the sun shined brighter the air smelled fresher flowers were more colorful the songs of birds more musical every clich√© became her reality there were stolen moments an embrace outside the pub during her break that left her jittery and delighted and unable to sleep long after she went home a slow intense look filled with awareness if she managed to linger long enough at the quinn house to see him it seemed she was in a constant state of yearning only more acute now that she knew what could be what would be she wanted to touch and be touched to take that long slow ride into pleasure and passion again side by side with the yearning was the endless frustration that life constantly intruded on dreams there was never enough time to be alone to simply be she often wondered if ethan felt the same edgy need dogging his heels throughout his day she thought it must be something inside her some longhidden sexual greed and she didnt know whether to be delighted by it or mortified she only knew that she wanted him constantly and that with every day that want passed into another night alone that want increased she wondered if he would be shocked worried that he would be she neednt have he only hoped hed timed it right and that his excuses to jim for taking in the catch before checking all the pots werent as ridiculously transparent as theyd seemed he wasnt going to let guilt eat at him either ethan promised himself as he secured his boat at his home dock he would work a couple extra hours that evening in the boatyard to make up for leaving cam on his own that afternoon if he didnt have one hour alone with grace if he didnt release some of this pressure that was building up hed go crazy then hed be no good to anyone and if shed already finished up at the house and left well hed just have to hunt her down thats all he had enough control left not to scare her or shock her but he just couldnt get through another day without her his grin began to spread when he came through the back door and saw that the morning untidiness had yet to be cleared away the washer was rumbling in the laundry room she hadnt finished he started into the living room looking for signs of her the cushions were all smoothed and plumped the furniture dustfree and shining and as the floor above his head gave a quiet creak he glanced up at that moment he thought fate was the most beautiful woman hed ever known grace was in his bedroom and what could be more perfect it would be much easier to lure her into a daytime bed without jolting her sensibilities if she was already close by one he started up the stairs delighted when he heard her humming then his system suffered a sizzling lightning bolt of lust when he saw she wasnt just close by his bed she was all but in it she leaned over smoothing and tucking fresh sheets her long legs showcased in ragged cutoffs his blood raced a roar of speed that left him breathless that turned the low ache hed learned to live with into a sharp and gnawing pain he could see himself springing forward dragging her onto the bed pulling and tearing at her clothes until he could hammer himself inside her and because he could because he wanted to he made himself stand where he was until he was certain his control was firmly in place grace she straightened whirled pressed a hand to her heart oh i√¢ oh she couldnt speak could barely think coherently what would he think she wondered giddily if he knew shed been fantasizing about rolling naked and sweaty over those crisp clean sheets with him her cheeks had gone pink charming him didnt mean to sneak up on you thats all right she let out a long breath but it did nothing to calm her racing heart i didnt expect anyone to√¢ what are you doing home so early in the day quickly she clasped her hands together because they wanted to grab at him are you sick no its not even three oclock i know he stepped into the room saw her press her lips together moisten them take it slow he reminded himself dont spook her aubreys not with you no julies minding her julie got a new kitten and aubrey wanted to stay so√¢ he smelled of the water salt and sun it made her lightheaded then weve got some time he came a little closer i wanted to see you alone you did ive been wanting to see you alone since we made love that night he lifted his hand gently encircled the nape of her neck ive been wanting you he said quietly and lowered his mouth to hers so soft so tender her heart seemed to turn one long loose somersault in her chest her knees went weak they trembled even as she threw her arms around him as she answered that tentative kiss with a flash of heat his fingers dug into her skin his mouth bruised hers for one wild and wicked moment she thought he would take her where they stood fast and frantic and free then his hands gentled smoothed over her his lips softened cruising over hers now come to bed with me he murmured come to bed with me even as he lowered her covered her she arched against him wanting and willing impatient with the clothes that separated her flesh from his it seemed like years since she had last touched him had last felt those hard planes those iron muscles moaning his name she tugged up his shirt let her hands possess and possessing they aroused his breath came raggedly burning his throat her movements under him urged him to hurry hurry but he was afraid he would bruise her if he didnt take time didnt take care so he fought to slow the pace to taste rather than devour to caress rather than demand but where as she had once seduced him she now destroyed him he tugged off her shirt found her naked beneath it she saw his eyes flash turn to a burning blue that all but scorched her skin he was careful so careful not to bruise not to frighten slow to slow the pace even while the brutal desire to take take more take swiftly swarmed into him then his mouth was on her sucking her in with a desperate hunger that threatened to consume them both she threw her arm back reached but there was nothing to hold on to except empty air he dragged her up his mouth streaking down her torso teeth scraping until gasping for air she folded herself around him he couldnt wait knew it would kill him to wait the only thought in his head was now it had to be now and even that was wrapped in the rusty edges of primal need he tugged at her shorts cursing then plunged his fingers inside her she bucked cried out came he watched her eyes go opaque her head fall back so that the long line of her throat was there for him to feast on battling the violent urge to drive himself into her he continued to taste until the sharp void was filled then he freed himself from his jeans and slipped into her she cried out again her muscles clamping tight around him and he lost his mind speed and heat and force more he shoved her knees up and stroked deeper harder darkly thrilled when her nails bit into his shoulders he plunged inside her quivering with raw blind greed sensations swamped her scraped at her stripped her into one shuddering mass of need she thought she might die from it when the next orgasm slammed into her a hard hot fist she thought she had and went limp her hands sliding from ethans damp shoulders the silver flash of energy draining to leave her exhausted she heard his long low groan felt his body plunge then stiffen when he collapsed on her panting her lips curved in a smile of pure female satisfaction the sunlight dazzled her eyes as she stroked her hands down and over his hips ethan she turned her head to kiss his hair no not yet she murmured when he started to shift not yet hed been rough with her and he cursed himself for allowing the knot on his control to slip are you all right mmmmmm i could lie here all day just like this i didnt take the time i meant to we dont have as much as most people no he lifted his head you wouldnt even tell me if id hurt you so he looked for himself carefully studying her face and he saw in it the sleepy satisfaction of a woman well if hurriedly loved i guess i didnt it was exciting it was wonderful knowing you wanted me so much lazily she twirled a lock of his suntipped hair around her finger and hugged the gorgeously wicked sensation of being naked in bed with him in the middle of the day id been worried that i wanted you more than you could ever want me you couldnt to prove it he kissed her long and slow and deep this isnt the way i want it for you cramming minutes alone between chores and using those minutes to jump into bed because its all weve got ive never made love in the middle of the day before she smiled i liked it on a long breath he lowered his brow to hers if it had been possible he would have spent the rest of the day right there inside her were going to have to figure out a way to find a little more time now and again ive got tomorrow night off you could come by for dinner√¢ and stay i ought to take you out somewhere theres nowhere i want to go id like it if we could have dinner in then her smile spread ill make you some tortellini i just got this new recipe when he laughed she threw her arms around him and chalked up another of the happiest moments of her life oh i love you ethan she was so giddy with it that it took her a moment to realize he was no longer laughing had gone very still her wildly bounding heart slowed and chilled maybe you dont want me to say that but i cant help feeling it i dont expect you to say it back or feel obligated to his fingers pressed lightly against her lips to silence her give me a minute grace he said quietly his system had flooded rising tides of joys hopes fears he couldnt think past them not clearly but he knew her knew that what he said now and how he said it would be vitally important ive had feelings for you for so long he began i cant remember when i didnt have them ive spent just as long telling myself i shouldnt have them so all of this is taking me some time to get used to when he shifted this time she didnt try to stop him she nodded avoided his eyes and reached for her clothes its enough that you want me maybe even need me a little its enough for now ethan this is all so new for both of us theyre strong feelings grace you matter to me more than any woman ever has she looked at him now if he said it she knew he meant it hope began to beat in her heart again if you had feelings for me strong feelings why didnt you ever let me know first you werent old enough he pushed his hand through his hair knowing that that was an evasion an excuse and not the core of it he couldnt tell her the core of it and i wasnt real comfortable having the kind of thoughts and feelings for you i was having when you were still in high school she could have leaped up on the bed and danced since i was in high school all this time yeah all this time then you were in love with somebody else so i didnt have any right to feel anything but friendship she let out a careful breath because it would be a confession that shamed her i was never in love with anybody else it was always you jack i never loved him and everything that went wrong between us was more my fault than his i let him be the first man to touch me because i never thought you would and about the time i realized how foolish that was i was pregnant you cant say it was your fault yes i can to keep her hands busy she began to tidy the bed i knew he wasnt in love with me but i married him because i was afraid not to and for a while i was ashamed angry and ashamed she lifted a pillow tucked it into its case until one night when i was lying in bed thinking my life was over and i felt this fluttering inside me she closed her eyes pressed the pillow against her i felt aubrey and it was so√¢ so huge that little flutter that i wasnt ashamed or angry anymore jack gave me that she opened her eyes again and carefully laid the pillow on the bed im grateful to him and i dont blame him for leaving he never felt that flutter aubrey was never real to him he was a coward and worse for leaving you weeks before the baby was born maybe but i was a coward and worse for being with him for marrying him when i never had a fraction of the feeling for him that i did for you youre the bravest woman i know grace its easy to be brave when you have a child depending on you i guess what im trying to tell you is that if i made a mistake it was in going so long without letting you know i loved you whatever feelings you have for me ethan are more than i ever thought you would have and thats enough ive been in love with you for the best part of ten years and its still not enough shed picked up the second pillow and now it slipped out of her hands when tears swam into her eyes she closed them squeezed tight i thought i could live without ever hearing you say that now i need to hear you say it again so i can get my breath back i love you grace her lips curved her eyes opened you sound so serious almost sad when you say it wanting to see him smile again she held out a hand maybe you should practice his fingers had just touched hers when the screen door slammed downstairs feet pounded on the stairs even as they jerked apart seth raced down the hall he skidded to a halt at the door to his room then stood stared he glanced at the bed the sheets not quite smoothed out the pillow on the floor then his gaze shifted and filled with a bitter fury that was much too adult in his young face you bastard there was loathing in the tone as he snapped at ethan then disgust as his eyes locked on grace i thought you were different seth she took a step forward but he turned on his heel and ran oh god ethan when she started to rush after the boy ethan took her arm no ill go after him i know what hes feeling dont worry he gave her arm a squeeze before walking out still she followed him to the steps worried sick shed never seen such dark hate in the eyes of a child damn it seth i told you to hurry up cam slammed in the front door just as ethan hit the bottom of the steps cam glanced up saw grace and felt a grin tug at his mouth oops i dont have time for lame jokes ethan shot back seth just took off what why it struck him even before the word was out oh shit he must have gone out the back im going after him he shook his head before cam could protest its me hes pissed off at right now its me he figures let him down i have to fix it he glanced up to where grace sat on the steps look after her he murmured to cam and headed for the back door ethan knew seth would have headed into the woods and he had to trust that the boy wouldnt run too far into the marsh he was a survivor ethan thought but relief shimmered through him when he heard the rustle of brush and old leaves it was simple enough to spot where seth had veered off the path ethan pushed through tangled vines the prickle of briars and followed the leaves on the trees that arched overhead blocked the glare and the worst of the suns heat but the humidity was immense sweat ran down ethans back dripped into his eyes as he patiently walked and waited he was well aware that seth was evading him keeping a few yards ahead finally he sat on a fallen log deciding it would be easier to let the boy come to him it took ten long minutes with gnats swarming in clouds and mosquitoes sniffing for blood but finally seth emerged from a thicket and faced him im not going back with you he all but spat it out if you try to make me ill just run again im not going to make you do anything from his seat on the log ethan studied him seths face was filthy streaked with dirt and sweat flushed with heat and fury his legs and arms were thoroughly scratched from pushing through briars they were going to sting like fury ethan knew when seth cooled off enough to notice you want to sit down and talk this out he asked mildly i dont believe anything you say youre a liar youre both fucking liars you gonna try to tell me you werent screwing each other no thats not what we were doing seth flew at him so fast ethan was thrown off guard enough to take the first fist solidly in the jaw he would think later much later that the kid threw a fine punch but at the moment it took all his concentration to wrestle seth to the ground ill kill you you bastard ill kill you as soon as i get a chance he wiggled and struggled and fought and waited for the rain of blows just hold on frustrated as the slick sweaty arms kept sliding out of his grip ethan gave seth a quick shake youre not getting anywhere this way im bigger than you are and ill just pin you down till you run out of steam take your hands off me seth set his teeth and snarled son of a whore it was a blow harder and more sharply aimed than the fist had been ethan caught his breath and nodded slowly yeah thats what i am thats why you and i know each other you can run when i let you up seth you can spill filth all over me thats what people expect from sons of whores im going to figure you want better for yourself than that ethan eased back sat on his heels and wiped the blood off his mouth thats the second damn time youve punched me in the face you try it again and im going to wallop your ass so you dont sit for a month i hate your fucking guts fine but youre going to have to hate them for the right reasons all you wanted was to get between her legs and she spread them for you watch it in a lightning move ethan grabbed seth by the shirt and hauled him up to his knees dont you talk about her that way you had sense enough to recognize right off what kind of person grace was thats why you trusted her why you cared about her i dont give a shit about her seth claimed and had to swallow hard before the hot tears poured out if you didnt you wouldnt be so mad at both of us and wouldnt be feeling like we let you down he let seth go then rubbed his hands over his face he knew how miserably inept he could be at explaining emotions especially his own im going to talk to you straight he dropped his hands youre right about what went on before you came home youre just wrong about what it meant seths lips quivered into a snarl i know what fucking means yeah the way you know it its ugly sounds in the next room fast gropes in the dark sour smells money changing hands just because you didnt pay her doesnt be quiet ethan said patiently i used to think thats all it was or the only kind there was hard and heartless sometimes mean all you want from the other is what you can get for yourself so that makes it selfish too you get some release pull your pants up and walk away its not always wrong if it doesnt matter to either one of you if it gets you through the night its not always wrong but its not the only way and it sure as hell isnt the best way he remembered now thinking that he hoped someone else would explain such things to the boy when the time came but it appeared that the time was now and he was in charge he couldnt say it all with a grin and a wink as cam might or smooth and fancy as phillip surely would he could only speak from the heart and hope it was right sex can be the same as eating just filling a hunger sometimes you pay for a meal sometimes you trade something and if its fair youre giving as much as youre taking sex is just sex they just pretty it up to sell books and movies do you figure thats all there is between anna and cam seth moved his shoulders but he was thinking theyve got something that matters and lasts that lives get built on its not what youve grown up with or what i spent the first part of my life with thats why i can tell you straight ethan pressed his fingers to his eyes and ignored the swarm of bugs and the sweat its different when you care when the other person isnt just a face or a body thats convenient and willing ive had that most people do along the way its different when its just that one person who matters who makes it right when it isnt all hunger pushing at you when you want more than anything to give back more than you take i never had with anyone what i have with grace seth shrugged and looked away but not before ethan saw the misery on his face i know youve got feelings for her and that theyre real and strong and important maybe part of you wanted her to be perfect not to have the needs other women do i think a bigger part of you wanted to protect her to make sure nobody hurt her so im telling you what i just finished finally telling her i love her ive never loved anybody else seth stared off into the marsh he hurt all over but the worst of it was shame does she love you back yeah she does damned if i can figure out why seth thought he knew why ethan was strong and he didnt put on a big show he did what had to be done what was right i was going to take care of her when i got older i guess you think thats pretty lame no he suddenly urgently wanted to pull the boy against him but he knew the timing was wrong no i think thats pretty great it makes me proud of you seths gaze flicked up then quickly away again i kind of you know love her sort of not like i want to see her naked or anything he added quickly just i get it ethan clamped down on the tip of his tongue to stifle the chuckle the quick surge of amused relief tasted finer than an icy beer on a hot day kind of like she was a sister like you wanted the best for her yeah and seth sighed yeah i guess thats it thoughtfully ethan sucked air between his teeth its got to be tough for a guy to walk in and see that his sisters been with some guy i hurt her i wanted to yeah you did youll have to apologize if you want to put things right with her shell think im stupid she wont want to talk to me she wanted to come after you herself by this time id say shes pacing around the backyard worried sick seth sucked in a breath that was too close to a sob to suit either of them i razzed cam until he brought me home for my ball glove and when i√¢ i saw you in there it made me think of how i would come back to wherever gloria was living and shed be doing it with some guy where sex was a business ethan thought both ugly and mean its hard to put those things aside or let yourself believe theres a different way since he was still working on it himself ethan spoke carefully that making love when you care when it matters when things are right its clean seth sniffled wiped at his eyes gnats he muttered yeah theyre a bitch out here you shouldve slugged me for saying that shit youre right ethan decided after a moment ill slug you next time now lets go home he rose brushed off his pants then held out a hand seth stared up at him saw kindness patience compassion qualities in a man he might have sneered at once because hed found so little of them in anyone who had touched his life he put his hand in ethans and without realizing it left it there as they walked down the path how come you didnt hit me back even once little boy ethan thought youve had too many hands raised against you in your short life maybe i was afraid you could take me seth snorted blinking furiously at tears that still wanted to come shit well youre small ethan said taking the cap from seths back pocket and snugging it down on seths head but youre a wiry little bastard seth had to take long breaths as they came close to where the sunlight struck the edge of the woods slanting white light he saw grace as ethan had predicted in the yard hugging her arms as if she were chilled she dropped them took a quick step forward then stopped ethan felt seths hand flex in his and gave it a quick encouraging squeeze itd go a long way to making things up to her ethan murmured if you were to run up and hug her grace is big on hugs it was what hed wanted to do what he was afraid to risk he looked up at ethan jerked a shoulder cleared his throat i guess i could if itd make her feel better ethan stood back watched the boy race across the lawn watched graces face light with a smile as she threw open her arms to take him in chapter thirteen contents prev next if you were going to have to work over a long holiday weekend phillip figured it might as well be at something fun he loved his job what was advertising anyway but a knowledge of people and of which buttons to push to nudge them into opening their wallets it was he often thought an accepted creative even expected twist on

love of the outdoors youve only been in business a few months officially phillip said with a flashing smile his hair was a rich deep bronze styled to make the most of a face that the angels had gifted with an extra kiss of pure male beauty he wore fashionably faded levis a green cotton shirt and olivedrab supergas his eyes were shrewd his smile charming he looked exactly like what hed made himself into a sophisticated urbanite with an affection for fashion and the sea weve built or worked on teams that built a number of boats over the years smoothly he guided jonathan toward the framed sketches hanging on the wall seths artwork was displayed rustically as phillip felt suited the ambience of a traditional boatyard my brother ethans skipjack one of the handful that still goes under sail every winter to dredge for oysters in the chesapeake shes had over ten years in service shes a beauty jonathans face turned dreamy as phillip had suspected it would however a man chose to pick wallets he had to gauge his marks id like to see her im sure we can arrange that he let jonathan linger before nudging him gently along now you may recognize this one he indicated the drawing of a sleek racing skiff the circe my brother cameron was involved with both her design and her construction and she beat my lorilee to the finish line two years running jonathan grimaced goodnaturedly of course cam was leading the team he knows his boats phillip heard the buzz of a drill from where cameron worked belowdecks he intended to bring cam into this shortly the sloop currently under construction is primarily ethans design though cam added some points were dedicated to serving the clients needs and wishes he led jonathan over to where seth continued his hull sanding ethan stood on deck attaching the rubrails he wanted speed stability and some luxuries phillip knew the hull was a brilliant show of smooth lap construction hed put in plenty of sweaty hours on it himself shes built for show as well as function teak from stem to stern at the clients direction he added knocking his knuckles cheerfully against the hull phillip wiggled his brows at ethan recognizing the signal ethan bit back a sigh he knew he was going to hate this part but phillip had pointed out that it was good business to bring the potential client into the fold the joints are wedged and married without glue ethan rolled his shoulders feeling as though he were giving an oral school report hed always hated them we figured if the oldtime boat builders could make a joint last a century or so without glue so could we and ive seen too many glued joints fail hmmm jonathan said again and ethan took a breath the hulls caulked in the traditional way stranded cotton plankings tight wood to wood on the inside we rolled two strands of cotton in most of the seams hardly needed the mallet then we payed them with standard seam components jonathan hummed again he had only a vague idea what ethan was talking about he sailed boats boats that hed bought fresh and clean and finished but he liked the sound of it she appears to be a fine tight boat a pretty pleasure craft ill be looking for speed and efficiency as well as aesthetics well see that you get it phillip smiled broadly waving a finger at ethan behind jonathans head it was time to pull out the next round ethan headed belowdecks where cam was fitting out the framing for an underthebunk cabinet your turn up there he muttered phil got him on the string couldnt tell by me i gave my little speech and the guy just nodded and made noises you ask me he didnt know what the hell i was talking about of course he doesnt jonathan hires people to worry about maintaining his boats hes never scraped a hull or replanked a deck in his life cam rose from his crouch worked the stiffness out of his knees hes the kind of guy who drives a maserati without knowing dick about engines but hed have been impressed with your salty watermans drawl and rugged good looks as ethan gave a snorting laugh cam elbowed past him ill go give him my push he climbed topside and managed to look credibly surprised to see jonathan onboard studying the gunwales hey kraft hows it going fast and far with genuine pleasure jonathan shook cams hand i was surprised when you didnt show at the san diego regatta this summer got myself married so i hear congratulations and now youre building boats instead of racing them i wouldnt count me out of racing entirely im toying with building myself a cat over the winter if business slacks off any keeping busy word gets out cam said easily a boat by quinn means quality smart people want the best when they can afford it he grinned fast and slick can you afford it im thinking of a cat myself your brother must have mentioned it yeah he ran it by me you want light fast and tight ethan and i have been modifying a design for what had in mind for me thats bullshit seth murmured only loud enough for phillip to hear sure phillip winked at him but its class a bullshit he leaned a little closer to seth as cam and jonathan launched into the lure of racing a catboat cam knows that while the guy likes him fine hes competitive never beat cam in a headtohead race so√¢ so hed pay buckets of money to have cam build him a boat that not even cam could beat there you go proud phillip gave seth a light punch on the shoulder you got a quick brain there keep using it and you wont be spending all your time sanding hulls now kid watch the master he straightened beamed up id be happy to show you the drawings jonathan why dont we go into my office ill dig them out for you wouldnt mind taking a look jonathan climbed down the problem is i need this boat seaworthy by march first ill need time to test her work out the kinks break her in before the summer races march first phillip pursed his lips then he shook his head that might be a problem quality comes first here it takes time to build a champion ill look over our schedule he added dropping an arm over jonathans shoulder as they walked well see what we can work out but the contracts already in place and the work sheets tell me may is the soonest we can deliver the topquality product you expect and deserve thats not going to give me much time to get the feel of her jonathan complained believe me jonathan a boat by quinn is going to feel fine just fine he added glancing back at his brothers with a quick and wolfish grin before he nudged jonathan inside the office hell buy us till may cam decided and ethan nodded or hell make it april and skin the poor bastard for a bonus either way cam clamped a hand on ethans shoulder were going to have ourselves another contract by end of day below seth snorted shit hell wrap it up by lunchtime the guys toast cam tucked his tongue in his cheek two oclock soonest noon seth said peering up at him two bucks sure i can use the money you know cam said as he dug out his wallet before you came along to ruin my life id just won a bundle in monte carlo seth sneered cheerfully this aint monte carlo youre telling me he passed the bills over then winced when he saw his wife come into the building cool it social worker heading in shes not going to approve of minors gambling hey i won seth pointed out but he stuffed the bills in his pocket you bring any food he asked anna oh no i didnt sorry distracted she dragged a hand through her hair there was a sick ball in the pit of her stomach that she did her best to ignore she smiled a curve of lips that didnt quite manage to reach her eyes didnt you all pack lunch yeah but you usually bring something better this time ive been pretty tied up putting food together for the picnic tomorrow she ran a hand over his head then left it lying on his shoulder she needed the contact i just√¢ thought id take a break and see how things were going around here phil just nailed this rich guy for a ton of money good thats good she said absently then we should celebrate why dont i spring for ice cream you think you can handle picking up some hot fudge sundaes at crawfords yeah his face split into a grin i can handle it she dragged money out of her purse hoping he didnt notice that her hands werent quite steady no nuts on mine remember sure i got it im gone he raced out and she watched him heartsick what is it anna cam put his hands on her shoulders turned her to face him what happened give me a minute i broke records getting here and i need some time to settle she blew out a breath drew one in and felt marginally steadier go get your brothers cam okay but he lingered rubbing his hands over her shoulders it was rare for her to look so shaken whatever it is well fix it he walked to the cargo doors where ethan and phil stood outside arguing over baseball somethings up he said briefly annas here she sent seth off shes upset she was standing by a workbench with one of seths drawing books open when they came in it made her eyes sting to see her own face carefully skillfully sketched by the young boys hand hed been more than a case file almost from the start and now he was hers as much as ethan and phillip were hers family she couldnt stand to think that anything or anyone would hurt her family but she was steadier when she turned scanned the quiet and concerned faces of the men whod become essential to her life this came in todays mail her hand no longer trembled as she reached into her purse and pulled out the letter its addressed to the quinns just the quinns she repeated from gloria delauter i opened it i thought it best and well my names quinn now too she offered it to cam saying nothing he took out the single sheet of lined paper and passed the envelope to phillip she mailed it from virginia beach phillip murmured we lost her in north carolina shes sticking with the beaches but coming north what does she want ethan stuffed hands that had curled into fists into his pockets a low simmering rage was already pumping through his blood what youd expect cam answered shortly money dear quinns cam read i heard how ray died its too bad you might not know that ray and me had an agreement i think youll want to make good on it since youre keeping seth i guess hes pretty settled in there in that nice house i miss him you dont know what a sacrifice it was for me to give him up to ray but i wanted what was best for my only son you ought to have your violin phillip muttered to ethan i knew ray would be good to him cam continued he did right by the three of you and seths got his blood he stopped reading for a moment there it was in black and white truth or lie he looked up at his brothers thats to deal with later ethan felt the ache begin around his heart and move in to squeeze but he shook his head read the rest okay ray knew how much it hurt me to part with the boy so he helped me out but now that hes gone im starting to worry that it might not be the best place for seth there with you im willing to be convinced if youre set on keeping him youll keep up rays promise of helping me out im going to need some money like a sign that youve got good intentions five thousand you can send it to me care of general delivery here in virginia beach ill give you two weeks figuring the mails kind of unreliable if i dont hear back ill know you dont really want the kid ill come get him he must be missing me something awful be sure to tell him his mom loves him and might be seeing him real soon bitch was phillips first comment shes testing us out trying her hand at a little more blackmail to see if well fall for it the way dad did you cant anna put a hand on cams arm felt the quiver of rage you have to let the system work you have to trust me to see that she doesnt do this in court anna cam shoved the letter into the hand ethan had held out were not going to put that boy through a court case not if theres another way you dont mean to pay her cam i dont mean for her to have one fucking cent he prowled away struggling to fight off fury she thinks shes got us by the balls but shes wrong were not one lone old man he whirled back eyes blazing lets see her try to get through us to lay hands on seth she was pretty careful how she worded things ethan commented as he scanned the letter again doesnt make it less of a threat but shes not stupid shes greedy phillip put in if shes already angling for more after what dad paid her shes testing the depth of the well she sees you as her source now anna agreed and theres no predicting what shell do if she knows that source isnt easily tapped pausing she pressed her fingers to her temples ordered herself to think if she comes back into the county and attempts to make contact with seth i can have her detained legally barred at least temporarily from direct contact with him you have guardianship and seth is old enough to speak for himself the question is will he she lifted her hands frustrated let them fall hes told me very little about his life before he came here ill need specifics in order to block any custody attempt on her part he doesnt want her and she doesnt want him ethan resisted barely crumpling the letter into a ball and heaving it unless hes worth the price of another fix she let her johns try for him anna shifted to face him kept her eyes calm and direct on his did seth tell you that did he tell you there had been sexual abuse and shed been a party to it he told me enough ethans mouth went hard and grim and its up to him if he wants to tell anybody else and see it put in some goddamn county report ethan anna laid a hand on his rigid arm i love him too i only want to help him i know he stepped back because the anger was too fierce and too likely to spew on everyone im sorry but there are times the system makes it worse makes you feel like youre being swallowed up he struggled to block out the echo of pain hes going to know hes got us with or without any system to stand with him the lawyer needs to know she made contact phillip took the letter from ethan folded it and tucked it back into the envelope and we have to decide how were going to handle it my first impulse is to go down to virginia beach dig her out of her hole and tell her in a way shed understand just whats going to happen to her if she comes within fifty miles of seth threatening her wont help√¢ anna began but it would feel damn good cam bared his teeth let me do it on the other hand phillip continued i think it might be very effective and look very good if it ever comes to a legal battle if our pal gloria got an official letter from seths caseworker outlining the status the options and the conclusions reached contacting or attempting to contact a birth mother who may be rethinking giving up custody of her child a child whos in your files would come within the parameters of your job wouldnt it anna she mulled it over knowing it was a fine line and expert balance would be required to walk it i cant threaten her but√¢ i may be able to make her stop and think but the big question is do we tell seth hes afraid of her cam murmured damn it the kids just starting to relax to believe hes safe why do we have to tell him shes poking her finger back into his life because hes got a right to know ethan spoke quietly his temper had leveled off and he was able to think clearly again hes got a right to know what he might have to fight if you know whats after you youve got a better chance and because he added the letter was addressed to the quinns hes one of us id rather burn it phillip muttered but youre right well all tell him cam agreed id like to do the talking both cam and phillip stared at ethan you would he might take it easier from me he looked over as seth came through the door so lets find out mother crawford put on extra hot fudge man she just poured it on theres about a million tourists up on the waterfront and√¢ his excited chatter trailed off his eyes went from gleeful to wary inside his chest his heart began to drum he recognized trouble bad trouble it had its own smell whats the deal anna took the large bag from him and turned to set the plastictopped dishes of ice cream out why dont you sit down seth i dont need to sit down it was easier to get a head start running if you were already on your feet there was a letter came today it was best ethan knew if hard news was delivered fast and clean from your mother shes here the fear was back sharp as a scalpel seth took one quick step in retreat going stiff as a board when cam laid a hand on his shoulder no shes not here but we are you remember that seth shuddered once then planted his feet what the hell did she want whys she sending letters i dont want to see it then you dont have to anna assured him why dont you let ethan explain then well talk about what were going to do she knows rays dead ethan began i gotta figure shes known right along but shes taken her time getting to it he gave her money seth swallowed hard to gulp down the fear quinns werent afraid he told himself they werent afraid of anything she took off she doesnt care that hes dead i dont suppose she does but shes hoping for more money thats what the letters about she wants me to pay her fresh and bright fear exploded in seths brain i dont have any money whats she writing to me for money for she wasnt writing to you seth took a ragged breath and concentrated on ethans face the eyes were clear and patient the mouth firm and serious ethan knew was all he could think ethan knew what it was like he knew about the rooms the smells the fat hands in the dark she wants you to pay her part of him wanted to beg them to do it to pay her whatever she wanted he would swear in blood that he would do anything they asked of him for the rest of his life to honor the debt but he couldnt not with ethan watching him and waiting and knowing if you do shell just come back for more shell keep coming back seth rubbed the back of a sweaty hand over his mouth as long as she knows where i am shell keep coming back i have to go someplace else someplace where she cant find me youre not going anywhere ethan crouched so they were closer to eye level and shes not going to get any more money shes not going to win slowly mechanically seth shook his head back and forth you dont know her i know pieces of her shes smart enough to know were set on keeping you with us that we love you enough to pay he saw the flash of emotion in seths eyes before the boy lowered them and we would pay if that would end it if that would ease things but it wont end or ease it its like you said shed just come back what are you going to do its what were going to do now all of us he said and waited for seths gaze to settle on his face again well go on as weve been going on mostly phil will talk to the lawyer so we got that end covered you tell him im not going back with her seth said furiously shooting a desperate look at phillip no matter what im not going back ill tell him annas going to write her a letter ethan continued what kind of letter a smart one ethan said with the hint of a smile with all those fiftydollar words and that officialsounding stuff shell be doing it as your caseworker to let gloria know weve got the system and the law behind us it might give her pause to think she hates social workers seth put in good for the first time in more than an hour anna smiled and meant it people who hate something are usually afraid of it too one thing that would help seth if you can do it he turned back to ethan what do i have to do if you could talk to anna tell her how things were before as close to exact as you can manage i dont want to talk about it its over im not going back i know gently ethan put his hands on seths trembling shoulders and i know talking about it can be almost like being there again it took me a long time to be able to tell my mother to tell stella to say it all out loud even though she already knew most of it it started to get better after that and it helped her and ray get the legal crap handled seth thought of high noon of heroes of ethan its the right thing to do yeah its the right thing will you come with me sure ethan rose held out a hand well go home and talk it through chapter fourteen contents prev next ready mama time to go almost aubrey grace put the finishing touches on her potato salad sprinkling paprika on to give it zest and color aubrey had been asking her the same question since seventhirty that morning grace decided the only reason she hadnt run out of patience with her daughter was because she felt just as anxious and eager as a two year old herself maaamaaa at the deep frustration in aubreys voice grace had to swallow a chuckle let me see grace tucked the clear wrap tidily around the bowl before she turned and studied her little girl you look pretty i have a bow in a purely female gesture aubrey lifted a hand and patted the ribbon grace had threaded through her curls a pink bow pink with a smile aubrey beamed up at her mother pretty mama thanks baby she hoped ethan thought so how would he look at her she wondered how should they behave there would be so many people there and no one well besides the quinns no one knew they were in love in love she thought with a long dreamy sigh it was such a marvelous place to be she blinked when little arms wrapped around her legs and squeezed mama ready laughing grace hauled her up for a big hug and kiss all right lets go no general in the hours before a decisive battle ever ordered his troops into action with more authority and determination than anna spinelli quinn seth you set those folding chairs up under the shade trees over there isnt phillip back with the extra ice yet hes been gone twenty minutes cam you and ethan are putting those picnic tables too close together minute ago cam said under his breath they were too far apart but he walked backward hauling the table another foot thats good thats fine armed with bright red white and blue striped cloths anna hurried across the lawn now you can move the umbrella tables nearer the water i think cam narrowed his eyes you said you wanted them over by the trees i changed my mind she scanned the yard as she spread the tablecloths cam opened his mouth to protest but caught ethans warning shake of the head in time his brother was right he decided arguing wasnt going to change a thing anna had been on a tear all morning and when he said as much to ethan as they moved out of earshot it was with the irritation of the baffled were talking about a practicalminded organized woman here cam added i dont know whats gotten into her its just a damn picnic i guess women get that way over things like this was ethans opinion he remembered the way grace had refused to let him take a shower in his own bathroom just because cam and anna were coming home who knew what went on in a female mind she wasnt this bad over the wedding reception i expect she had her mind on other things then yeah cam grunted as he picked up one of the round umbrella tables again and began to cart it toward the sundazzled water phils the smart one he got the hell out of the house hes always had a knack for it ethan agreed he didnt mind moving tables or setting up chairs or any of the dozens of chores small and large that anna came up with it helped keep his mind off weightier matters if he let himself think too much he started to get a picture of gloria delauter in his head because hed never seen her the image his brain conjured up was a tall fleshy woman with tangled strawcolored hair hard eyes smeared with sooty makeup a mouth lax from too many trips to the bottle too many matings with the needle the eyes were blue like his own the mouth despite its slick coat of lipstick shaped like his own and he knew it wasnt seths mothers face he was seeing it was his own mothers the picture wasnt dim and fuzzy as it had become over time it was sharp and clear as yesterday it still had the power to ice his blood to churn a sick animal fear in his stomach that was kin to shame it still made him want to strike out with bruised and bloodied fists he turned slowly as he heard the squeal of joy and saw aubrey racing over the lawn her eyes bright as sunbeams and saw grace standing by the porch steps her smile warm and just a little shy youve got no right the nasty little voice in his head hissed no right to touch something so fine and bright but oh he had a need one that swamped him like a storm surge and left him floundering when aubrey launched herself at him his arms reached down swung her up and around as she shrieked in delight he wanted her to be his with a bonedeep longing he wanted this perfect this innocent this laughing child to belong to him graces knees wobbled as she walked to them the picture they made flashed into her mind into her heart where she knew it would imprint itself the lanky man with big hands and a serious smile and the goldenbright child with a pink bow in her hair the sun poured over them as full and rich as the love that poured from her heart shes been ready to come over since she opened her eyes this morning grace began i thought we could come a little early and id give anna a hand he was watching her so intently so quietly her nerves did a rapid dance under her skin theres not much left to do but she broke off because his arm had snaked out wrapped around her fast and hard to pull her against him she had time to draw in one startled breath before his mouth came down on hers rough and needy it shot bolts of heat into her blood sent her startled brain into a dizzying spin dimly she heard aubreys happy squeal kiss mama oh yes grace thought sprinting to catch up to this frantic pace hed set please kiss me kiss me kiss me she thought she heard some sound from him a sigh perhaps that came from someplace too deep inside to make a sound his lips softened the hand that had clutched the back of her shirt like a man gripping his own life opened stroked this gentler sweeter emotion that shimmered from him was no calmer than that first whip of greed it only gilded the edges of the yearning hed stirred she could smell him heat and man she could smell her daughter powder and child her arms circled them both instinctively making them a unit holding there when the kiss ended and she could press her face into his shoulder hed never kissed her in front of anyone she knew cam had only been a few feet away when ethan had taken hold of her and seth would have seen√¢ and anna what did it mean kiss me aubrey demanded patting her hand against ethans cheek and puckering up he obliged her then nuzzled at her neck where it would tickle and make her laugh then he turned his head and brushed his lips over graces hair i didnt mean to grab you that way i was hoping you did she murmured it made me feel youve been thinking about me wanting me ive been thinking about you grace ive been wanting you because aubrey was wiggling he set her down and let her run off toward seth and the dogs i meant i didnt mean to be rough with you you werent im not fragile ethan yes you are when he saw aubrey fall on foolish so they could wrestle in the grass he looked back at grace into her eyes delicate he said softly like the white china with pink roses we only use on thanksgiving it made her heart flutter pleasantly that he would think so even if she knew better ethan i was always afraid id pick it up wrong break it in half from being clumsy i never really got used to it he skimmed his thumb lightly across her cheekbone where the skin was warm and soft and silky then he dropped his hand to his side wed better pitch in before anna drives cam over the edge graces stomach continued to flutter with nervous delight even when she went about the chore of carting food from the kitchen out to the picnic table she would catch herself stopping a bowl or platter in hand to watch ethan drive the horseshoe stakes into the ground look how his muscles ripple under his shirt hes so strong look at the way he shows seth how to hold the hammer hes so patient hes wearing the jeans i washed just the other day the cuffs have gone white and theyre starting to fray there was sixtythree cents in the right front pocket see how aubrey climbs up on his back she knows shell be welcome yes he reaches back gives her a little hitch to secure her there then goes back to work he doesnt mind when she steals his cap and tries to put it on her own head his hairs gotten long and the ends glint in the sun when he shakes it back out of his eyes i hope he keeps forgetting to go to the barber for a while yet i wish i could touch it right now make those thick sunbleached ends curl around my finger its a nice picture anna murmured from behind her and made grace jolt with a quiet laugh anna set down the enormous bowl of pasta salad i do the same thing with cam sometimes just stand and watch him the quinns are very watchable men i think im just going to take a quick glance then i cant stop looking she grinned when ethan rose aubrey still clinging to his back and turned slow circles as if trying to find her he has a wonderful natural way with children anna commented hell make a wonderful father grace felt heat rise up into her cheeks shed been thinking the same thing it was hard to believe that only a few weeks before shed told her own mother she would never marry again and now she was thinking and wondering and waiting it had been easy to put all thoughts of marriage aside when she hadnt believed she could ever have a life with ethan she made a poor job of marriage before because her heart had belonged to someone other than her husband that was her fault and she accepted the responsibility for the failure but she could make marriage shine with ethan couldnt she they could build a home and a family and a future based on love and trust and honesty he wouldnt move quickly she mused it wasnt his way but he loved her she understood ethan well enough to know that marriage would be the next step she was already poised to take it the smell of burgers smoking on the grill the yeasty tang of beer pumped from a cold keg the sounds of children laughing and adult voices lifted in bright conversation or lowered in juicy gossip the low roar of a boat zipping over the water with the thrilled shouts of its teenage occupants the metallic clang of a horseshoe striking home there were scents and sounds and sights there was the snappy red white and blue of the cloths covering the tables that were crowded with bowls and plates and platters and casseroles mrs cutters cherry pie the wilsons shrimp salad what was left of the bushel of corn the crawfords had brought along jello molds and fruit salad fried chicken and early vine tomatoes people were spread out and gathered on chairs on the lawn down at the dock and on the porch several men stood with hands on hips watching the horseshoe match their faces sober in the way men had when they kibitzed a sporting event babies napped in carriers or willing arms while others wailed for attention the young splashed and swam in the cool water and the old fanned themselves in the shade the sky was clear the heat immense grace watched foolish nosing along the ground in search of dropped food hed found plenty and she imagined hed be sick as a well a dog before the day was over she hoped it was never over she waded into the water gripping aubrey firmly despite the colorful floats wrapped around her arms she dipped her daughter down laughing when aubreys little legs began to kick with delight in in in aubrey demanded honey i didnt bring my bathing suit but she eased out a little more until the water lapped at her knees so she could let aubrey splash grace grace watch this obliging grace squinted against the sun and watched seth take a running leap off the dock tucking knees wrapping arms and hitting the water like a bomb so that it shot it up in a glittering fountain and all over her cannonball he announced proudly when he surfaced then he grinned gee you got all wet seth take me straining aubrey held out her arms take me cant aub got bombs to blow when he swam off to join the other boys aubrey began to sniffle hell come back and play later grace assured her now soon to ward off what grace knew could turn into a fine temper she tossed aubrey up catching her as she hit the water she let her paddle and splash then let her go biting her lip as aubrey reveled in the freedom swimming mama i see that baby youre a good swimmer but you stay close as grace expected the sun and water and excitement combined to tire the child out when aubrey blinked and widened her eyes as she did when she fought sleep grace drew her in lets get a drink aubrey swimming well swim some more im thirsty grace lifted her braced for the minor battle that was bound to come what you got there grace a mermaid mother and daughter looked up onto the wet slope and saw ethan she sure is pretty he said smiling into aubreys mutinous face can i have her i dont know maybe she leaned close to aubreys ear he thinks youre a mermaid aubreys lip trembled but shed nearly forgotten why shed wanted to cry like ariel yes like ariel in the movie she started to climb out then ethans hand was there clasping hers firmly and when she gained her balance he plucked aubrey out of her arms swimming she told him rather pitifully then buried her face in the curve of his throat i saw you swimming she was cool and wet and curled against him he reached out took graces hand again and pulled her to level ground this time his fingers twined with hers and held looks like ive got two mermaids now shes tired grace said quietly it makes her cross sometimes shes wet she added and started to take aubrey from him shes fine he released her hand only because he wanted to skim his over graces damp and shining hair youre wet too then he slipped an arm around her shoulders lets walk in the sun for a while all right maybe around the front of the house he suggested smiling a little as aubreys breath fluttered against his skin evening out into sleep where there arent so many people with surprise and a low surge of pleasure carol monroe watched ethan take her daughter and granddaughter walking with a womans eyes she saw more than a neighbor and friend strolling with a neighbor and friend impulsively she tugged on her husbands arm distracting him from his absorption in the current round of horseshoes hold on carol junior and i are playing the winners of this round look pete look at that grace is with ethan vaguely annoyed he flicked a glance around shrugged so what with him pete you knothead it was said with exasperation and affection like a boyfriend boyfriend he snorted started to dismiss it christ knew carol had the screwiest ideas from time to time like when she was all het up to take a cruise down to the bahamas as if he couldnt take a sail any damn time of the day or night right in his own backyard but then he caught something in the way ethan leaned his body toward grace the way she tilted her head up it made pete shift his feet scowl look away boyfriend he muttered and didnt know how the hell he was supposed to feel about that he didnt poke his nose in his daughters life he reminded himself shed already gone her own way he scowled hard into the sun because he remembered what it had been like to have his little girl rest her head on his shoulder the way aubrey was doing right then and there with ethan quinn when they were little like that he thought they trusted you and looked up to you and believed what you told them even if you told them thunder was just angels clapping when they got older they started to tug away and to want things that didnt make a damn bit of sense like money to live in new york city and your blessing to marry some sneaky bastard who wasnt half good enough for them they stopped thinking you were the man with the answers and they broke your damn heart so you had to put it back together as best you could with a lock on it so it couldnt happen again ethans just what grace needs carol was saying in a low voice just in case any of the fuddyduddies who thought tossing a horseshoe at an iron peg was an exciting way to spend the day had sharp ears thats a steady man and hes got gentleness in him hes a man she could lean on wont what she wont lean on nobody shes too proud for her own good and always has been carol merely sighed if it was true grace had gotten every stubborn ounce of that pride from her father youve never even tried to meet her halfway dont you start on me carol ive got nothing to say he shifted away from her ignoring the guilt because he knew the gesture would hurt her i want a beer he muttered and stalked away phillip quinn and some of the others were gathered around the keg pete noted with an amused snort that phillip was flirting with the barrow girl celia he couldnt blame the boy she was built like a playboy pinup and not afraid to show it off it wasnt something a man stopped noticing even if he was old enough to be her father want me to pull you one mr monroe predate it pete nodded toward the celebrants in the backyard got you a crowd here today phil fine spread too i remember how your folksd throw a picnic most every summer its nice youre keeping up the tradition anna thought of it phillip told him handing pete a foaming beer in a tall plastic cup women do moren men i suppose if i dont get the chance you tell her i appreciate the invite i gotta get back to the waterfront in an hour or so set up for the display you always put on a good one best fireworks on the shore tradition pete said again it was a word that mattered carol monroe hadnt been the only one to notice the way ethan and grace had walked off together speculation and sly grins started to spread over the potato salad and steamed crabs mother crawford wagged her fork at her good friend lucy wilson you ask me grace is going to have to put her foot down if she wants ethan quinn to come up to snuff before that babys old enough for college never seen a man moved so slow hes thoughtful lucy said loyally not saying different just saying slow seen them moonyeyed over each other since before that boy got his own workboat has to be nearly ten years passed stella and i bless her soul had a conversation over it a time or two lucy sighed over her fruit salad and not just because she was watching her calories stella knew her boys inside and out that she did i said to her one day stella your ethans got cows eyes for the young monroe girl and she laughed said how he had himself a hard case of puppy love but that sometimes it was the best way to start the real thing never could figure why ethan didnt step forward a bit before grace got herself tangled up with that jack casey never did like him much he wasnt a bad sort just weak look there mother lucy said lowering her voice like a conspirator she nodded toward ethan and grace as they walked back around the side of the house hands linked the baby sleeping on his shoulder nothing weak about that one mother wiggled her brows and leered at her friend and slow can be a fine thing in bed cant it lucy lucy hooted it can mother that it can blissfully unaware of the speculation buzzing about a quiet walk around the house on a hot summer afternoon grace stopped to pour some iced tea before shed half filled the first glass her mother was bustling over beaming smiles oh let me hold that precious girl nothing so soothing as sitting with a sleeping baby shed slipped aubrey out of ethans arms while she talked her voice low and quick itll give me a fine excuse to sit in the shade a while and be quiet i swear nancy claremonts been talking both my ears off you young people should be off enjoying yourself i was going to lay her down grace began but her mother just waved it away no need no need i dont get nearly enough chances to hold her when shes still go on and finish your walk ought to get out of the sun though its brutal its a good idea ethan mused as carol hurried off cooing to the sleeping aubrey a little shade and a little quiet wouldnt hurt well√¢ all right but ive only got another hour or so before i have to leave hed been tugging her gently toward the trees thinking that he could find a sheltered spot a private spot and kiss her again he stopped at the verge and frowned at her leave for what for work im on at the pub tonight its your night off it was that is it usually is but im putting on some more hours you work too many hours already she smiled distracted then relieved when the shade she walked into cut the intense heat in half its just a few more shiney was good about helping me out so i can make up what i had to pay for the car oh this is nice she closed her eyes breathed deep of the moist cool air anna said you and your brothers were going to play later ill be sorry to miss that grace i told you if money was a problem id help you out she opened her eyes again i dont need you to help me out ethan i know how to work yeah you know how its damn near all you do he paced away from her paced back as if trying to shake off what was biting at his gut i hate you working down there her spine stiffened she could feel it go hard and straight vertebra by vertebra i dont want to fight with you about that again its a good job honest work im not fighting with you im saying it he stalked toward her the swirling temper in his eyes surprising enough that she backed up against a tree ive heard you say it before she said evenly and it doesnt change the facts i work there and im going to go on working there you need looking after it scraped him raw that he couldnt be the one to do it i dont hell she didnt there were already tired smudges under those changeable green eyes and now she was telling him shed be carting trays until two in the morning did you pay dave for the car yet half it was humiliating he was good enough to give me until next month to pay him the rest you wont pay him that at least was something he could do would do by christ i will she forgot about humiliation her chin came up sharp and fast as a bullet you will not another time he would have persuaded cajoled or simply done the deed on the quiet but something was bubbling up in him something that had been there simmering since hed turned that morning and seen her it wouldnt let him think only feel and act with his eyes on hers he slipped a hand up over her throat be quiet im not a child ethan you cant im not thinking about you like a child her eyes were bright and sharp they were heating the something that was inside him to a boil i stopped being able to do that and i cant go back to it do what i want this time she didnt know when her breath had started to back up or her skin to shiver dimly she felt the rough bark of the tree bite into her hands as she pressed them against it she didnt think he was talking about her accepting a few hundred dollars for a car any longer ethan his other hand was on her breast he hadnt meant to put it there but it covered her and his fingers began to flex and knead her shirt was still damp just a little damp he could feel her skin go hot under it do what i want this time he repeated her eyes were huge he was falling into them drowning in them her heart was pounding against his hand as if he held it beating in his palm his mouth crushed down on hers with a violent greed that he was for once helpless to stem he heard her shocked cry muffled against his assaulting mouth and it only thrilled him darkly the heat swarmed from him stunning her his teeth nipped roughly into her lip making her gasp opening herself to the swift and skillful invasion of his tongue sensations flew too quickly to separate one from the other but all were dark and keen and compelling his hands were everywhere tugging up her shirt claiming her breasts scraping those deliciously rough palms over her she felt him quiver gripped his shoulders to balance them both then he was yanking at her shorts no part of her mind drew back in shock all but screamed it he couldnt mean to take her here like this only yards away from where people sat and children played but another part of her simply moaned in shocked excitement and whispered yes here now like this exactly like this when he drove into her her scream would have carried some of both but it was swallowed by his mouth lost in his ragged breaths he thrust hard fast deep his body surging into hers his hands biting into her tight round bottom as he plunged his mind was wiped clean of everything but this one desperate need when she came exploding over him around him in him his thrill was dark and primal and coated his skin with sweat his own climax had claws hottipped razorsharp that ripped through him brutally so that his vision went red even when it cleared he continued to shudder to pant gradually he became aware of what was he heard the wild drumming of a woodpecker deeper in the woods the tinkle of laughter from beyond the trees and graces sobbing breaths he felt the breezing cooling his skin and her trembles oh god goddamn it his curse was quiet vicious ethan she hadnt known would never have believed anyone could have such a need inside them for her ethan she said again and would have lifted her weak arms around him if he hadnt stepped back im sorry i there werent words nothing he could say would be right would be enough he bent slipped her shorts back up fastened them with the same deliberate care he straightened her shirt i cant offer you an excuse for that there isnt any i dont want an excuse i dont ever need one for what we do together ethan he stared at the ground while a sick pounding began in his head i didnt give you a choice he knew what it was not to have a choice ive already made my choice i love you he looked at her then everything that lived inside of him swirling into his eyes her mouth was swollen where hed ravished it her eyes were enormous her body would carry bruises from his hands you deserve better i like to think i deserve you you made me feel√¢ desired thats not even the word she pressed a hand to her still speeding heart craved she realized craved and now im sorry√¢ her gaze flicked away from his im sorry for any woman whos never known what it is to be craved i scared you for a minute mortified she blew out a breath damn it ethan do i have to tell you that i liked it i felt helpless and overpowered and it was so exciting you lost control and you have this incredibly unshakable control most of the time i liked knowing that something i did or something i am snapped it he pulled his hand through his hair you confuse me grace i dont mean to but i dont think thats such a bad thing either he let out a sigh then stepped forward just enough that he could smooth her tousled hair into place maybe the trouble is weve been thinking we know each other so well but we dont have all the pieces he picked up her hand studied it with that thoughtful frown she loved then he kissed her fingers in a way that made her lashes flutter i dont ever want to hurt you in any way but he had and he would he kept his hand in hers as he walked her back toward the sunlight he would have to tell her about those pieces of himself soon so she would understand why he couldnt give her more chapter fifteen contents prev next so i dont know if im going to go out with him anymore because hes getting way too possessive you know i dont want to hurt his feelings but you gotta live right julie cutter crunched into the shiny green apple shed plucked out of the fruit bowl in graces kitchen she felt every bit as much at home there as she did next door comfortable she hitched herself up to sit on the counter while grace folded laundry on the table plus julie went on gesturing with her apple i met this incredibly cute guy he works at the computer store at the mall he wears these little metalframe glasses and has the sweetest smile she grinned lighting up her pretty heartshaped face i asked him for his phone number and he blushed you asked him for his phone number grace was listening with only half an ear she loved it when julie came over just to visit she was always so full of fun and talk and energy but today it was hard to concentrate her mind was so full of what had happened between her and ethan in those shady woods what had leapt out of him to devour her and why it had left him so distant afterward sure julie cocked her head her brown eyes full of humor didnt you ever ask a guy out come on grace were at the dawn of the next millennium here most of them really like it when the woman takes the initiative anyway√¢ she shook back her long fall of straightasapin brown hair jeff did the sexy computer nerd he got all flustered at first but then he gave it to me and when i called him i could tell he was happy about it so were going out saturday but i have to break up with don first poor don grace murmured and glanced over absently as aubrey knocked over the block tower shed been building then applauded its destruction oh hell get over it julie shrugged its not like hes in love with me or anything hes just used to having a chick grace had to smile a few months earlier julie had been wild about don rushing over to tell grace every detail of their dates or grace suspected at least an edited version of their dates you told me don was the one he was julie laughed for a while im not ready for the only one yet grace went to the refrigerator to pour the three of them a drink at julies age nineteen shed been pregnant married and worried about paying bills she was only three years older than julie but it might as well have been three hundred youre right to look around to be sure she handed julie a glass held her gaze for a moment to be careful im careful grace julie assured her touched id like to be married one day especially if it means having a baby as beautiful as aubrey but i want to finish college then see some of the world do√¢ things she added gesturing widely i dont want to find myself tied down changing diapers and working at some deadend job because i let some guy talk me into√¢ she trailed off suddenly and sincerely appalled at herself eyes huge and apologetic she slid off the counter god im sorry i can be so thick sometimes i didnt mean that you its all right she gave julies arm a quick squeeze thats exactly what i did exactly what i let happen to me im glad youre smarter im a moron julie murmured very close to tears im an insensitive clod im hateful no youre not grace gave a light laugh and picked up a pair of aubreys rompers from the basket you didnt hurt my feelings id hate to think we werent friends enough for you to be able to say what you think youre one of my best friends and ive got a big mouth well you do grace chuckled at julies wince but i like it i love you and aubrey grace i know you do now stop worrying about it and tell me where youre going with jeff the cute computer guy safe date movies and pizza julie let out a soft sigh of relief shed have√¢ shaved her head and dyed it purple she decided before shed do anything to hurt grace hoping to make up just a little for her insensitivity she beamed a smile you know id be happy to keep aubrey on your next night off if you and ethan want to go out grace had finished folding the rompers and started on socks she stopped staring with a tiny white sock trimmed in yellow in each hand what you know catch a movie go to a restaurant whatever she wiggled her brows on the whatever then fought to bite back a grin at graces expression youre not going to stand there and tell me youre not seeing ethan quinn well hes√¢ im√¢ she looked helplessly down at aubrey if it was supposed to be a secret he should be parking his truck somewhere other than your driveway on the nights he sleeps over oh god whats the problem its not like youre having this illicit affair like mr wiggins has been having with mrs lowen on monday afternoons at the motel on route at graces strangled sound julie just shrugged my friend robins working there and taking night classes at the college and she says how he checks in every thursday morning at tenthirty while she waits in her car anyway what must your mother think grace whispered mom about mr wiggins well no no grace didnt want to think about the portly mr wigginss weekly motel romp about√¢ oh you and ethan i think she said something about high time moms not an idiot hes such a hunk julie said with feeling i mean the way he fills out a tshirt is awesome and that smile it takes like ten minutes for it to finish moving over his face and by then man you are drooling robin and i went down to the waterfront every day for a month last summer just to watch him offload his catch you did grace said weakly we both built a real case on him she reached into the white stoneware cookie jar and found two oatmeal raisins i flirted with him big time whenever i got the chance you√¢ flirted with ethan mmm she nodded swallowing cookie really put some effort into it too mostly i think it embarrassed him but i got a couple of great smiles out of him she smiled sunnily when grace kept staring oh im way over it now so dont worry good grace picked up the drink shed neglected and drank deeply thats good still hes got a terrific butt oh julie grace bit her lip to keep from giggling and sent a meaningful look toward her daughter shes not listening so anyway howd i get started on this oh yeah ill keep aubrey for you if you want to go out i well thanks she was trying to decide if she wanted to get well off the subject of ethan quinn or linger on it when she heard a knock and saw him standing at her front door like magic julie murmured and romance bloomed in her heart you know why dont i take aubrey over to see mom for a while ill just keep her and feed her dinner but i dont have to leave for work for nearly an hour yet julie rolled her eyes so make good use of the time pal then she scooped aubrey up want to come to my house aubrey see my kitty cat oooh kitty bye mama oh but they were already sailing out of her back door with aubrey calling for the kitty and waving madly she looked at ethan again staring at his face through the screen then lifted her hands he decided to take it as an invitation and stepped inside was that julie who ran off with aubrey yes shes going to let aubrey play with her kitten and have dinner over there its nice you have someone like julie to look after her id be lost without julie puzzled grace angled her head he was standing awkwardly a hand tucked behind his back is something wrong did you hurt your hand no what an idiot he was ethan thought offering her the flowers he had held behind him i thought you might like some he wanted desperately to find ways to make up to her for the way hed treated her in the woods you brought me flowers i stole some here and there you may not want to mention it to anna i got the tiger lilies off the side of the road theyre blooming thick this year hed picked her flowers not storebought flowers but ones hed stopped and selected and plucked with his own hands on a long trembling sigh she buried her face in them theyre beautiful they made me think of you almost everything does and when she lifted her head when he saw that her eyes were stunned and soft he wished he had more words better ones smoother ones i know you only have the one night off now id like to take you to dinner if you dont have any plans to dinner theres a place anna and cam like up in princess anne suitandtie place but they claim the foods worth it would you like to she realized she was nodding her head like a fool and made herself stop id like that ill come by for you about sixthirty there went her head bobbing again like a spring robin drunk on worms fine thatd be fine i cant stay now because theyre expecting me at the boatyard thats all right she wondered if her eyes were as huge as they felt she could have devoured him with them thanks for the flowers theyre lovely youre welcome and with his eyes open he leaned over laid his lips on hers very gently very softly he watched her lashes flutter watched the green of her irises go misty under those tiny flecks of gold ill see you tomorrow night then her muscles had turned to putty tomorrow she managed and breathed out a long long sigh as he walked away and out her front door hed brought her flowers she clasped the stems in both hands held them out and waltzed through the house with them beautiful fragrant softpetaled flowers and if some of those petals drifted to the floor as she danced it only made the scene more romantic they made her feel like a princess like a woman she sniffed them lavishly as she circled back into the kitchen for a vase like a bride she stopped abruptly staring at them like a bride her head went light her skin hot her hands trembly when she realized she was holding her breath she let it out with a whoosh but it caught and stumbled as she tried to pull air in again hed brought her flowers she thought again hed asked her to dinner slowly she pressed a hand to her heart found that it was pumping light and fast very fast he was going to ask her to marry him to marry him oh my oh her legs wanted to fold so she sat down right on the floor of the kitchen with the flowers cradled in her arms like a child flowers tender kisses a romantic dinner for two he was courting her no no she was jumping to conclusions he would never move that quickly to the next step she shook her head picked herself up and found an old widemouthed bottle for a vase he was just being sweet he was just being considerate he was just being ethan she turned on the faucet and filled the bottle just being ethan she thought again and found her breath gone a second time being ethan he would think and he would do things in a certain manner struggling for calm for logic she began to arrange the precious flowers stem by stem theyd known each other for√¢ she could hardly remember not knowing him now they were lovers they were in love being ethan he would consider marriage the next step honorable traditional right he would believe it right she understood that but had expected it to be months yet before he drifted in that direction yet why would he wait she asked herself when theyd already waited for years but√¢ she had promised herself she would never marry again she made that vow as she signed her name on the divorce papers she couldnt fail so miserably at something ever again or risk putting aubrey through the misery and trauma shed made the decision that she would raise aubrey alone raise her well raise her with love that she herself would provide would build the home tend it where her daughter could grow up happy and safe but that was before she had let herself believe ethan would ever want them would ever love her the way she loved him because it had always been ethan always ethan she thought closing her eyes in her heart in her dreams did she dare break her promise one she had made so solemnly could she risk being a wife again pinning her hopes and her heart on another man oh yes yes she could risk anything if the man was ethan it was so right so perfect she thought laughing to herself as her head and heart went light with joy it was the happyeverafter that shed stopped letting herself yearn for how would he ask she pressed her fingers to her lips and those lips trembled and curved quietly she thought with his eyes so serious so intent on hers he would take her hand in that careful way of his theyd be outside with moonlight and breezes with the scents of night all around them and the musical lap of water close by simply she thought without poetry or fuss he would look down at her saying nothing for a long moment then he would speak without hurry love you grace i always will will you marry me yes yes yes she spun herself in giddy circles she would be his bride his wife his partner his lover now forever she could give her child to him knowing without hesitation that he would love and cherish would protect and tend she would have more children with him oh god ethans child growing inside her overwhelmed by the image she pressed her hands to her stomach and this time this time the life that fluttered inside her would be wanted and welcomed by both whod made it they would make a life together a wonderfully thrillingly simple life she couldnt wait to begin it tomorrow night she remembered and in a sudden panic pushed at her hair dropped her hands to look at them in utter despair oh she was a mess she needed to look beautiful what would she wear she caught herself laughing the laughter full of joy and nerves for once she forgot work and schedules and responsibility and raced to her closet anna didnt notice the stolen flowers until the next day then she noticed them with a shout seth seth you come out here right now she had her hands on her hips her sassy straw hat askew her eyes snapping and dangerous yeah he came out munching on a handful of pretzels though dinner was simmering on the stove have you been messing with my flowers she demanded he slid a glance down to the mixed bed of annuals and perennials and snorted what would i be messing with stupid flowers for she tapped her foot thats what im asking you i never touched them hey you dont even want us to pull up weeds thats because you dont know the difference between a weed and a daisy she snapped well somebodys been in my flower beds wasnt me he shrugged then rolled his eyes in glee as she stormed past him into the house somebody seth thought was in for it big time cameron she stomped upstairs and into the bathroom where he was washing up from work he glanced over lifting a brow as water dripped from his face into the sink she scowled for a moment then shook her head never mind she muttered slamming the door cam would no more fiddle with her gardens than seth she decided and if he was picking flowers for anyone it damn well better be his loving wife or shed just murder him and be done with it her eyes narrowed on the door to ethans room and she made a low threatening sound in her throat she did stop to knock though it was only three staccato raps before she simply pushed open the door christ anna mortified ethan snatched up the slacks that lay on his bed and held them in front of him he was wearing nothing but his briefs and a pained expression just save the modesty im not interested have you been into my flowers into your flowers oh hed known this was coming the woman had eyes like a cat when it came to her posies but he hadnt expected the moment to come when he was half naked half hell he thought and clutched the slacks more firmly somebodys snapped off more than a dozen blooms snapped them right off she advanced on him her eyes scanning the room for evidence oh well√¢ problem cam leaned on the doorjamb tongue in his cheek it was an amusing sight after a hard days work he decided his wellriled wife stalking around his allbutbareassed brother somebodys been in my garden and they stole my flowers no kidding want me to call the cops oh shut up she whirled back to ethan who took a cautious and cowardly step in retreat she looked fit to murder well well i√¢ hed intended to confess throw himself on her mercy but the woman glaring at him out of dark furious eyes looked several quarts low on mercy rabbits he said slowly probably rabbits yeah he shifted uncomfortably wishing to christ hed at least gotten his pants on before she burst in rabbits can be a problem with gardens they just hop up and help themselves rabbits she said again could be deer he added just a little desperately theyd graze over and eat every damn thing down to stubs counting on pity he shot a look at cam right cam weighed the situation knew anna was city girl enough to buy it oh ethan would owe him for this he decided and smiled oh yeah deer and rabbits big problem which having two dogs running tame pretty much eliminated he mused why didnt anybody tell me she whipped off her hat rapped it against her thigh what do we do about it how do we make them stop couple ways guilt stung just a little but ethan rationalized that deer and rabbits could be a problem so she should take precautions anyway dried blood dried blood whose you can buy it at the garden store and you just dump it around itll keep them away dried blood her lips pursed as she made a mental note to buy some or urine dried urine no ethan cleared his throat you just go out and√¢you know around so they smell it and know theres a meat eater in the vicinity i see she nodded satisfied then whirled on her husband well get out there then and pee on my marigolds could use a beer first cam said and winked at his brother dont worry darling well take care of it all right calmer she huffed out a breath sorry ethan yeah well hmmm he waited until shed hurried out then lowered himself to the edge of the bed he slanted a look at cam who continued to lean against the door that wife of yours has a streak of mean in her yeah i love it whyd you steal her flowers i just needed a few of them ethan muttered and pulled on his pants what the hell are they out there for if you get your head cut off for picking them rabbits and deer cam began to hoot with laughter theyre garden pests right enough pretty brave rabbits who hop between two dogs and right up to the house to select a few flowers if they got that far theyd mow the whole garden down to the ground she doesnt have to know that for a while i appreciate you backing me up i thought she was going to punch me she might have since i saved your pretty face i figure you owe me nothing comes free ethan grumbled and stalked to the closet for a shirt you got that right seth needs a haircut and hes already outgrown his last pair of shoes ethan turned shirt dangling from his fingertips you want me to take him to the mall right again id rather have the punch in the face too late cam hooked a thumb in his front pocket and grinned so whyd you need the flowers just thought grace would like them muttering ethan shrugged into his shirt ethan quinn stealing flowers going out voluntarily to a jacketandtie restaurant cams grin widened his eyebrows wiggled serious business its a usual thing for a man to take a woman out to dinner bring her flowers now and then not for you it isnt cam straightened patted his flat belly well i guess ill go choke down that beer so i can be a hero mans got no privacy around here ethan complained when cam sauntered away women come right on into your bedroom dont even have the courtesy to leave when they see you dont have your pants on scowling he dragged one of his two ties out of the closet people ready to skin you alive over a few flowers and the next thing you know youre at the goddamn mall fighting crowds and buying shoes he wrestled the tie under his collar and began to deal with the knot never had to worry when i was in my own place i could walk around buck ass naked if i wanted to he hissed at the tie that refused to cooperate i hate these fuckers thats because youre happier tying a sheepshank who the hell wouldnt be then he stopped his fingers freezing on the tie his gaze stayed on the mirror where he could see his father behind him youre just a little nervous thats all ray said with a smile and a wink hot date taking a careful breath ethan turned ray stood at the foot of the bed his brightblue eyes merry the way ethan remembered they would sparkle when he was particularly tickled about something he was wearing a squashyellow tshirt that sported a boat under full sail faded jeans and scuffed sandals his hair was long past his collar and shining silver ethan could see the sun glint on it he looked exactly like what he was had been a robust and handsome man who appreciated comfortable clothes and a good laugh im not dreaming ethan murmured it was easier for you to think so at first hello ethan dad i remember the first time you called me that took you a while to come to it youd been with us almost a year christ you were a spooky kid ethan quiet as a shadow deep as a lake one evening when i was grading papers you knocked on the door you just stood there for a minute thinking god it was a marvel to watch your mind work then you said dad the phones for you rays smile went bright as sunlight you slipped right out again or youd have seen me make a fool of myself sniffled like a baby and had to tell whoever the hell it was on the phone i was having an allergy attack i never knew why you wanted me you needed us we needed you you were ours ethan even before we found each other fate takes its own sweet time but it always finds a way you were so√¢ fragile ray said after a moment and ethan blinked in surprise stella and i were worried wed do something wrong and break you i wasnt fragile oh ethan you were your heart was delicate as glass and waiting to be shattered your body was tough we never worried about you and cam pounding on each other those first months thought it did both of you good ethans lips twitched he usually started the pounding but you never were one to back off once your blood was up took some doing to get it up he added still does we watched you watch and settle and think and consider you gave me√¢ time time to watch and settle to think and consider everything ive got thats decent came from the two of you no ethan we just gave you love and that time and the place he wandered over to the window to look out on the water and the boats that swayed gently at the dock he watched an egret sail across a sky hazed with heat and plumped by clouds you were meant to be ours meant to be here took to the water like youd been born in it cam he always just wanted to go fast and phillip preferred to sit back and enjoy the ride but you√¢ he turned back again his gaze thoughtful you studied every inch of the boat every wave every turn of a river youd practice tying knots for hours and nobody had to nag you into swabbing the decks it came easy for me right from the start you wanted me to get a college degree for me ray shook his head for me ethan fathers are human after all and i went through a time when i thought my sons needed to love schooling as much as i did but you did what was right for you you made me proud of you i should have told you that more often you always let me know it words count though who would know that better than a man who spent his life trying to teach the young the love of them he sighed now words count ethan and i know some of them come hard for you but i want you to remember that you and grace have a lot to say to each other yet i dont want to hurt her you will ray said quietly by trying not to i wish you could see yourself as i do as she does he shook his head again well fate takes its time think of the boy ethan think of seth and what pieces of yourself you see there his mother ethan began think of the boy for now ray said simply and he was gone chapter sixteen contents prev next there wasnt a hint of rain on the breezy summer air the sky was a hot staggering blue an unbroken bowl that held a faint haze and fragile clouds a single bird sang manically as if mad to complete the song before the long day was over she was as nervous as a teenager on prom night the thought of that made grace laugh no teenager had ever dreamed of nerves like these she fussed with her hair wishing she had long glossy curls like annas exotic gypsylike sexy but she didnt she reminded herself firmly and never would at least the short simple crop showed off the pretty gold drop earrings julie had loaned her julie had been so sweet and excited about what shed termed the big date shed launched straight into a whattowearandwhattowearwithit routine and naturally had deemed the contents of graces closet a total loss of course letting julie drag her off to the mall had been sheer foolishness not that julie had to yank very hard grace admitted it had been so long since shed shopped simply for the simple pleasure of shopping for the couple of hours theyd spent swarming through the shops shed felt so young and carefree as if nothing was really more important than finding the right outfit still shed had no business buying a new dress even if she did get it on sale but she couldnt seem to talk herself out of it just this one little indulgence this one little luxury she so desperately wanted something new and fresh for this special night shed yearned for the sexy sophisticated black with its shoestring straps and snug skirt or the boldly sensuous red with the daringly plunging neckline but they hadnt suited her as shed known they wouldnt it had been no surprise that the simple powderblue linen had been discounted it had looked so plain so ordinary hanging on the rack but julie had pressed it on her and julie had an eye for such things shed been right of course grace thought now it was simple almost virginal with its unadorned bodice and graceful lines but it looked pretty on with the color cool against her skin and the skirt floating around her legs grace traced a finger over the square neckline faintly amazed that the bra julie had nagged her into buying actually did gift her with a hint of cleavage a miracle indeed grace thought with a little laugh concentrating she leaned close to the mirror shed done everything julie had instructed with the borrowed makeup and her eyes did look bigger and deeper she decided shed done her best to blot away the signs of fatigue and thought she had succeeded maybe she hadnt managed more than a wink of sleep the night before but she didnt feel in the least tired she felt energized she reached out and her hand hovered over the samples of perfumes theyd been given at the cosmetics counter then she remembered that anna had told her to wear her own scent for ethan before that it would say something to him choosing that instead she closed her eyes and dabbed it on with her eyes closed imagining that his lips might brush here brush there linger and taste where her pulse beat that fragrance into life still dreaming she picked up a little ivory evening bag another loan and checked its contents she hadnt carried such a small purse since√¢ well before aubrey was born she thought it was so odd to look inside and see none of the dozens of mother things she was used to carrying only women things now she mused the little compact shed splurged on a tube of lipstick she rarely thought to use her house key a few carefully folded bills and a tissue that wasnt thin and ragged from wiping a sticky face it made her feel feminine just to look at it to slip her feet into impractical heeled sandals oh shed be scrambling to pay off her charge card when the bill came to turn in front of the mirror and watch her skirt follow the movement when she heard his truck pull up outside she dashed across the room made herself stop no she wasnt going to race to the door like an eager puppy she would wait right here until he knocked and give her heart a chance to beat normally again when he did knock it was still thundering in her ears but she stepped out smiled at him through the screen and moved toward the door he remembered watching her walk to the door like this before on the night theyd made love the first time shed looked so lovely so lonely with the candlelight flickering around her but tonight she looked√¢ he didnt think he had words for it everything about her seemed to glow skin hair eyes it made him feel awkward humble reverent he wanted to kiss her to be certain she was real and yet was afraid to touch he stepped back as she opened the screen then took the hand she held out carefully you look different no it wasnt poetry and it made her smile i wanted to she pulled the door closed behind her and let him lead her to his truck he wished immediately that hed borrowed the vette the truck doesnt suit that dress he said as she climbed in it suits me she swept her skirts in to be certain they didnt catch in the door i may look different ethan but im still the same she settled back and prepared for the most beautiful evening of her life the sun was still up and bright when they arrived in princess anne the restaurant hed chosen was in one of the old refurbished houses where the ceilings were high and the windows tall and narrow candles yet to be lighted stood on tables draped in white linen and the waiters wore jackets and formal black ties conversations from other diners were muted as in church she could hear her heels click on the polished floor as they were led to their table she wanted to remember every detail the way the little table sat snug by the window the painting of the bay that hung on the wall behind ethan the friendly twinkle in the waiters eyes when he offered them menus and asked if theyd like a cocktail but most of all she wanted to remember ethan the quiet smile in his eyes when he looked across the table at her the way his fingertips continued to brush hers on the white linen would you like to have some wine he asked her wine candles flowers yes that would be nice he opened the wine list studied it thoughtfully he knew she preferred white and one or two of the types were familiar phillip always kept a couple of bottles chilling though god knew why any reasonable man would pay that much money on a regular basis for a drink grateful that the selections were numbered and he wouldnt have to attempt to pronounce any french he gave the waiter the order privately pleased when he saw his choice met with approval hungry a little she wondered if shed be able to swallow a crumb around the delight in her throat its just so nice to be here like this with you i shouldve taken you out before this is perfect there hasnt been much time for this we can juggle some time and it wasnt so bad he discovered wearing a tie eating in a place surrounded by other people not when he got to look at her across the table you look rested grace rested the laugh bubbled out making him smile uncertainly then her fingers squeezed his affectionately oh ethan i do love you the sun dipped lower and the candles were lighted as they sipped wine and enjoyed a perfectly prepared meal served with flair he told her about the progress of the boat and of the new contract phillip had finessed thats wonderful its hard to believe you only started the business this spring id thought about it for a long time he told her had a lot of the details worked out in my head he would have of course she thought thinking things through was innate with ethan even so youre making it work really making it work ive thought about coming by dozens of times why havent you before√¢ if i saw you too often or in too many different places it worried me she loved being able to tell him to watch his eyes change when she did i was sure youd be able to see the way i felt about you how i wanted to touch you and have you touch me the blood hummed in his fingertips as they grazed hers and his eyes did change just as shed wanted deepening as they stared into hers id talked myself out of you he said carefully im glad it didnt stick so am i he brought her fingers over touched his lips to them maybe youll come by the boatyard one of these days and ill look at you√¢ and ill see she angled her head maybe i will you could drop in some hot afternoon and√¢ his thumb cruised lazily over her knuckles bring fried chicken her laugh was quick and easy i shouldve figured thats what really attracted you to me yeah it tipped the scales a pretty face seagoddess eyes long legs a warm laugh they dont mean much to a man but you add a nice batch of southern fried chicken and youve got something delightfully flattered she shook her head and here i was thinking i wouldnt get any poetry out of you his gaze skimmed over her face and for the first time in his life he wished he had a talent for composing odes do you want poetry grace i want you ethan just the way you are with a long contented sigh she looked around the restaurant and you add an evening like this now and then√¢ she shifted her gaze back to him and grinned and youve got something sounds like a deal since i like being out with you like this i like being anywhere with you she curled her fingers into his a long time ago it seems like a long time i used to dream about romance the way i hoped it would be one day this is better ethan real turned out to be better than the dream i want you to be happy if i was any happier id have to be two people for it all to fit her eyes sparkled with the laugh as she leaned toward him and then youd have to figure out what to do with two of me ones all i need do you want to take a walk her heart soared would it be now yes i think a walk would be perfect the sun was nearly gone as they strolled along the pretty streets casting shadows lovely and deep in a sky dazzled by hot color the moon was starting its rise it wouldnt be full grace noted but it didnt matter her heart was when he turned her into his arms just at the edge of the splash of light from a streetlamp she melted into the long slow kiss different ethan thought again as he let himself take the kiss just a shade deeper she felt softer warmer yielding against him though he could feel faint tremors rippling through her i love you grace he said it to soothe both of them her heart bounded straight into her throat making her voice shaky stars were blinking to life overhead brilliantly white points of light i love you ethan she closed her eyes held her breath in anticipation of the words wed better start back she blinked her eyes open oh yes let out her breath yes youre right foolish of her she decided as they walked back to his truck a man as careful and thorough as ethan wouldnt propose to her on a street corner in princess anne he would wait until they got back until julie had gone home and aubrey had been checked on hed wait until they were alone private in familiar surroundings of course that was it so she beamed a smile at him as he started the engine it was a wonderful dinner ethan there was moonlight just as shed imagined it slanted through the window and slipped gently over aubrey in her crib her baby dreamed happy dreams she thought and how much happier they would all be in the morning when theyd taken the next step toward becoming a family aubrey already loved him grace thought as she stroked her daughters hair just a short time ago she had resolved to raise her child alone to make certain that she was enough all that was changing now ethan would be a father to her daughter a loving parent who would watch over her one day theyd tuck aubrey in together one day they would stand over a crib watching another child sleep with ethan she could share the joy of a simple moment like that that quiet moment in the moonwashed dark when you looked in and saw your child asleep and safe there was so much he could give them she thought and that she could give to him a man like ethan she knew would feel that first flutter of life in his heart just as she would feel it in her womb they could share that and a lifetime of simple moments she moved quietly into the living room and saw ethan standing gazing through the screen door she had an instant of panic he wasnt going he couldnt be leaving not now not before√¢ do you want some coffee she said it quickly her voice rising before she could control it no thanks he turned she sleeping all right oh yes shes fine she looks so much like you do you think especially when she smiles grace√¢ he watched her eyes fix on his glow in the low light of the lamp for a moment it seemed to him that nothing had come before nothing would come after it could be the three of them there together on quiet nights just like this in the little dollhouse it could be his future he wanted to believe it could be his life id like to stay id like to be with you tonight if you want i want of course i want she thought she understood he needed to show her love first more than willing she held out a hand come to bed ethan he took care to be tender to stroke her gently to peak holding her there holding until her body bowed up a trembling bridge of sensations to make her float and sigh he watched the moonlight dapple her skin followed its shifting shadows with his fingertips with his lips pleasured her love surrounded her it cradled her it rocked her with a rhythm as gentle as a quiet sea gliding on it she offered it back to him a shimmering reflection his tenderness moved her to tears she knew now that his needs could be ripe and raw and reckless and that thrilled her yet this part of him this compassionate sensitive and most generous part of him touched her heart at the core she fell fathoms deeper into that wide well of love when he slipped into her when they were joined his mouth moved over hers to capture each sigh she glided up trembled on that silkcovered peak holding holding until he was trembling with her and they could catch each other on the slow tumble down after he shifted her so that she curled into the curve of his arm and stroked her her eyes grew heavy now she thought as she began to drift he would ask her now while they were both still glowing waiting she slid into sleep he was ten and the last beating shed given him had left his back a maze of purpling bruises and scarlet pain she never hit him in the face shed learned quickly that most clients didnt care to see black eyes and bloody lips on the merchandise shed stopped using her fists mostly she found a belt or a hairbrush more effective she liked the thin circular brushes that were all hard bristles the first time shed used one on him the shock and pain had been so unspeakable that hed fought back and it had been her lip that had been bloody shed used her fists then until hed found escape in unconsciousness he was no match for her and he knew it she was a big woman and strong with it when she was drunk she was stronger yet and more ruthless it didnt help to plead it didnt help to cry so hed stopped doing both and the beatings werent as bad as the other nothing was shed gotten twenty dollars for him the first time shed sold him he knew because she told him and promised to give him two dollars for himself if he didnt make a fuss about it he hadnt known what she was talking about not then he hadnt known not until she left him in the dark bedroom with the man even then he didnt know didnt understand when those big damp hands were on him the fear was so blinding bright the shame so dark the terror so loud as loud as his screams hed screamed until nothing could crawl through his throat but a guttural whimper even the pain of being raped couldnt push more out of him she even gave him the two dollars he burned it there in the dirty sink in the horrible bathroom that stank of his own vomit he watched the money curl up black and his hate for her was just as black he promised himself staring at his own hollow eyes in the spotty mirror that if she ever whored him again he would kill her ethan her heart tripping in her throat grace scrambled onto her knees to shake his shoulders the skin under her hands was like ice his body was rigid as stone but trembling it made her think wildly of earthquakes volcanoes boiling violence under a hard layer of rock the sounds he made had wakened her theyd made her dream of an animal caught in a trap his eyes flew open she could see only the glint of them in the dark but they looked blind and wild for a moment she was afraid that the boiling violence she sensed would break through and batter her you were having a dream she said it firmly certain that that was what was needed to put ethan back into those staring eyes its all right now it was a dream he could hear his breath rasping more than a dream he knew it had been the coldsweated flashback he hadnt had in years but the result was the same nausea curled sickly in his stomach his head pounded and swam with the pathetic echo of a young boys scream he shuddered once violently under the gentle hands on his shoulders im okay but his voice was rough and she knew he lied ill get you some water no im okay not even water would settle on his jumping stomach go back to sleep ethan youre shaking he would stop it he could stop it it would only take a little time and concentration he saw that her eyes were huge more than a little frightened he was both sick and furious that he had brought even the memory of that horror to her bed dear god had he let himself believe for even an instant that it could be different for him for them he forced himself to smile just spooked me thats all sorry i woke you reassured because she saw a shadow of the man she loved come back into his eyes she stroked his hair it must have been awful scared both of us mustve been dont remember the next lie he thought abominably weary come on lie back down everythings all right now she snuggled up beside him hoping to comfort and laid a hand over his heart it was still racing just close your eyes she murmured as she would have to aubrey close your eyes and rest now hold on to me ethan dream of me praying for peace he did both when she woke to find him gone grace tried to tell herself that the weight of her disappointment was out of proportion he hadnt wanted to disturb her so early so he hadnt said goodbye now that the sun was up he would already be out on the water she rose slipped on a robe and padded in to make coffee and to grab those few minutes of alone time before aubrey roused then she sighed and stepped out on her little back porch she knew her disappointment didnt stem from finding him up and gone when she woke shed been sure so sure he was going to ask her to marry him all the signs had been there the scene set the moment perfect but the words hadnt come shed all but written the script she thought with a grimace and he hadnt followed it this morning was supposed to begin the next phase of their lives shed imagined running over to julies and sharing the joy of it of calling anna and babbling begging for wedding advice of telling her mother of explaining it all to aubrey instead it was a quiet morning after a beautiful night she scolded herself a lovely night she had no business complaining about it annoyed with herself she went back inside to pour the first cup of freshly brewed coffee then she began to chuckle what had she been thinking of this was ethan quinn she was dealing with wasnt this the same man whod waitedby his own admission nearly a decade to so much as kiss her at the rate he took things it could be another one before he brought up the subject of marriage the only reason theyd moved from that first kiss to where they stood now was because she√¢ well shed thrown herself at him grace admitted plain and simple and she wouldnt have had the guts to do that if anna hadnt shoved her along flowers she thought turning so that she could smile at them bright and pretty on her kitchen counter candlelight dinner moonlit walks and long tender lovemaking yes he was courting her and would likely continue to do so until she went mad waiting for him to take the next step but that was ethan she admitted and just one of the things she adored about him she sipped coffee bit her lip why did he have to take the step why shouldnt she be the one to move things along julie had told her men liked it when a woman took the initiative and hadnt ethan liked it when she finally worked up the courage to ask him to make love with her she could do some courting herself couldnt she and she could move it along at a faster pace god knew she was an expert at getting things done on schedule it would only take the courage to ask him she blew out a breath shed have to find that but she would dig inside herself until she did temperatures soared and the humidity thickened in a syrupy morass that cam not so cheerfully dubbed fumidity he worked belowdecks trimming out the cabin until the heat sent him topside desperate for fluids and one stingy breeze though he rarely complained about the working conditions ethan was like cam stripped to the waist sweat poured as he patiently varnished thats going to take a week to dry its so goddamn damp decent storm might blow some of it out then i wish to christ wed have one cam grabbed up the jug and glugged water straight from the lip close weather makes some people edgy im not edgy im hot wheres the kid sent him for some ice good idea i could take a bath in it theres no fucking air down there ethan nodded varnishing was a miserable enough job in this weather but working below in the little cabin where even the big fans couldnt reach was probably kin to working in hell want to switch off for a while i can do my own goddamn job ethan merely lifted a sweaty shoulder suit yourself cam gritted his teeth then hissed okay i am edgy the heats frying my brain and i keep wondering if that alley cats gotten annas letter yet ought to it went out tuesday as soon as the post office broke the holiday its friday now i know what day it is ethan disgusted cam swiped sweat off his face and scowled at his brother arent you worried a damn bit about it it wont make any difference if i am or not shell do what shes going to do his gaze flicked up to cams and was hard as a bunched fist then well handle it cam paced the deck caught a whiff of air from the fans paced back i never could understand how you can stay so calm when things go to hell practice ethan murmured and kept on varnishing cam rolled his aching shoulders drummed his fingers on his thigh he had to think of something else or hed go crazy howd the big date go the other night well enough jesus ethan do i have to get the pliers a smile moved over ethans mouth had a nice dinner drank some of that pouilly fuisse phils so wild about tastes fine enough but i dont see what the big fuss is about so you get laid ethan flicked up another glance took in cams wide grin and decided to take the question in the spirit it was asked yeah did you entertained if no cooler cam threw back his head and laughed damn shes the best thing that ever happened to you i dont just mean the sex though thats got to be part of whats perked you up around here lately the woman fits you like the proverbial glove ethan paused scratched his belly where sweat dribbled and itched why because shes rocksteady pretty as a picture patient as job and shes got enough humor about life to tickle out yours i guess well be sprucing up the yard for another wedding before long ethans fingers tightened on his brush im not going to marry her cam it was the tone as much as the statement that made cams eyes narrow quiet despair i guess i could be reading you wrong cam said slowly i figured the way things were moving you were serious about her i am serious about grace about a lot of things he dipped his brush again watched the clean gold varnish drip marriage isnt something im looking for ordinarily cam would have let a subject such as this drop hed have walked away from it with a shrug your business brother but he knew ethan too well had loved him too long to walk away from the pain he crouched by the rail so their faces were closer i wasnt looking for it either he murmured scared the hell out me but when the woman comes into your life the woman its scarier to let her go i know what im doing the duginattheheels look didnt stop cam you always figure you do i hope youre right this time i sure as hell hope this isnt some shit that goes back to that ghosteyed kid mom and dad brought home one day the one who used to wake up screaming at night dont go there cam dont you go there either mom and dad did better by us than that it has nothing to do with them it all has everything to do with them listen he broke off with a mild oath as seth came running in hey this shits already melting cam straightened scowled over at seth out of habit rather than heat didnt i tell you to find an alternate word forshit you say it seth pointed out shifting the bag of ice thats beside the point knowing the routine seth dumped the ice into the cooler why because annas going to have my ass if you keep it up and if she has mine pal ill have yours oh now im scared you oughta be they continued to bicker ethan continued the varnish tuning them out concentrating on the job at hand he locked his unhappiness away chapter seventeen contents prev next it was going to be perfect it was so obviously right grace wondered that she hadnt thought of it before a sunset sail on calm seas with skies going pink and gold in the west was a custommade backdrop for both of them the bay was part of their lives what it offered and what it took she knew it was more than a place where ethan worked it was a place he loved it had been easy to arrange all shed had to do was ask he looked surprised then he smiled id forgotten you love to sail he said she was touched when hed simply expected that aubrey would come with them there would be other times she thought a lifetime for the three of them but this warm and breezy evening would be for the two of them only giddy laughter continued to rise up in her as she imagined his reaction when she asked him to marry her she could see it so clearly the way he would stop stare at her with surprise in those wonderful blue eyes she would smile hold out her hand to him as they glided along with soft wind and dark water and she would tell him everything that was in her heart love you so much ethan i always have and always will will you marry me i want us to be a family i want to live my life with you to give you children to make you happy havent we waited long enough then she knew that would be the moment his smile would begin that slow beautiful smile that moved degree by degree over the planes and shadows of his face into his eyes he would probably say something about how hed intended to ask her that hed been getting to it they would both laugh and they would hold each other as the sun dropped red beyond the shore and their lives together would really begin where are you sailing off to grace she blinked saw ethan smiling back at her from the wheel daydreaming she told him chuckling at herself sunsets the best time for daydreams its so peaceful she rose nestled herself under his arm im so glad you can take a few hours off so we can do this were going to have the boat trimmed out within the month he nuzzled his face in her hair couple weeks ahead of schedule youve all worked so hard its going to be worth it the owner was here today oh this was part of it too she mused the easy talk about their days what did he say hardly shut up so its hard to know what he said half the time spouted off the latest this and that hed read in his boating magazines asked enough questions to make your head ring but did he like it i figure he was pleased with her since he grinned like a kid on christmas morning the whole afternoon after he left cam wanted to bet me that he would run her aground first time out on the bay did you take the bet hell no he likely will but you havent really sailed the bay until youve run aground ethan wouldnt she mused watching his big competent hands on the wheel he sailed clean i remember when you and your family were building this sloop she trailed her fingers over the wheel i was helping out at the waterfront the first time yall took her out professor quinn was at the wheel and you were working the lines you waved at me chuckling she angled her head to look up at him i was thrilled that you noticed me i was always noticing you she leaned up and kissed his chin but you were careful not to let me notice you noticing on impulse she gave his jaw a teasing nip until lately i guess i lost my knack for it he turned his head until his mouth found hers just lately good with a quiet laugh she laid her head on his shoulder because i like noticing you notice me they werent alone on the bay but he stayed well clear of the zipping motorboats out for a summerevening cruise a flock of gulls frantically swooped and swirled around the stern of a skiff where a young girl tossed out bread her laugh carried high and bright to mix with the greedy calls of the birds the breeze rose up filling the sails and whisking away the wet heat of the day the few clouds drifting in the west were going pink around the edges almost time odd she realized she wasnt a bit nervous a little giddy perhaps because her head felt so light her heart so free hope so long buried was golden bright once freed she wondered if he would slip into one of the narrow channels where the shade would be thick and the water the color of tobacco he could thread past the bobbing buoy markers to a quiet place one without even the gulls for company he was so content with her beside him ethan let the wind choose the course he should make adjustments he thought the sails would reef before long if he didnt but he didnt want to let her go not quite yet she smelled of her lemon soap and her hair was soft against his cheek this could be their lives he thought quiet moments evening sails standing together building little dreams into big ones shes having the time of her life grace murmured hmmm the little girl there feeding the gulls she nodded in the direction of the skiff smiling as she imagined aubrey a few years from now laughing and calling to the gulls from the stern of ethans boat uhoh here comes her little brother to demand his share she laughed charmed by the children theyre nice together she murmured watching as the two of them heaved bread high into the air for eager beaks to snatch company for each other therere more lonely times for an only child ethan closed his eyes a moment as his own halfformed daydream shattered she would want more children deserve them life wasnt all pretty sails on the bay i need to trim the sails he told her do you want to take the wheel ill trim them she grinned at him as she ducked under his arm to move to port i havent forgotten how to handle lines capn no he thought she hadnt forgotten she was a good sailor as at home on deck as she was in her own kitchen she ran the rigging with the same skill that she showed when she served drinks to a crowd at the pub theres not much you cant do grace what she glanced up then laughed its not hard to know how to use the wind when you grow up with it youre a natural sailor he corrected a wonderful mother a fine cook you know how to make people easy around you her pulse went from calm to frantic would he ask her now after all before she had the chance to ask him those are all things i enjoy she said watching him watch her making a home here in st chris contents me you do the same ethan because it contents you ive got a need for this place he said softly its what saved me he added but hed turned away and she didnt hear grace waited another moment willing him to speak to tell her to ask her then with a shake of her head she crossed the deck again the sun was sinking coming close so close to that long nightly kiss of the shore the water was calm little wavelets waltzing against the hull the sails were full and white the moment she thought with a leap of heart was now ethan i love you so much he lifted an arm to bring her against his side i love you grace ive always loved you i always will he looked down at her then and she saw the emotion come into his eyes deepening the blue she lifted a hand to his cheek held it there as she drew in the next breath will you marry me she saw the surprise as shed expected but she didnt notice the way his body went stiff as she rushed on i want us to be a family i want to live my life with you to give you children to make you happy havent we waited long enough and she waited now but she didnt see the slow smile slip across his face into his eyes he only continued to stare at her with something she thought might be horror bony wings of panic fluttered in her stomach i know you might have planned to do this differently ethan and me asking you is a surprise but i want us to be together really together why didnt he say something her mind screamed anything why did he just stare at her as if shed slapped him i dont need courting her voice hitched and she stopped to try to steady it not that i dont love things like flowers and candlelight dinners but all i really need is for you to be there i want to be your wife afraid he would shatter if he looked into those hurt and baffled eyes another instant he turned away his hands whiteknuckled on the wheel we have to come about what she jerked back staring at his set face at the muscle that worked in his jaw her heart was still pounding but no longer in anticipation now it was with dread you have nothing to say to me except that we have to come about no ive things to say to you grace his voice was as controlled as his heart was wild we have to go back so i can she wanted to shout at him to say them now right now but she nodded all right ethan come about the sun was gone when they docked crickets and peepers sent up their nightly chorus filling the air with shrill toobright music overhead a few stars blinked through the haze and a threequarter moon shimmered the air had cooled quickly but she knew that wasnt the reason she was cold so cold he secured the lines himself silently just as hed sailed home silently he stepped back into the boat sat across from her the moon was still low just riding the tops of the trees but the early stars sprinkled down enough light for her to see his face there was no joy in it i cant marry you grace he spoke the words carefully knowing they would hurt im sorry i cant give you what you want she gripped her hands together tightly she didnt know whether they wanted to ball into fists and pound or hang limp and shaking like an old womans then you lied when you said you loved me it might be kinder to tell her so he thought then shook his head no it would only be cowardly she deserved the truth all of the truth i didnt lie i do love you there were degrees of love she wasnt fool enough to think differently but not the way you need to love a woman youd marry i couldnt love any woman more than i love you but im she held up a hand something had just occurred to her if it was his reason for turning her away she didnt think she could ever forgive him is it because of aubrey because i had a child with another man he moved fast so rarely it took her by surprise when he snatched her hand out of the air and squeezed it hard enough to rub bone against bone i love her grace id be proud for her to think of me as her father you have to know that i dont have to know anything you say you love me and you love her but you wont have us youre hurting me ethan im sorry im sorry he released her hand as if it had burned his palm i know im hurting you i knew i would i had no business letting things come to this but you did she said evenly you had to know id feel this way that id expect you would feel the same yeah i knew i should have been honest with you ive got no excuse for it except i needed you i needed you grace marriage isnt something im looking for oh dont treat me like a fool ethan she sighed now too battered to be angry people like us dont have relationships we dont have affairs we get married and raise families were simple and basic and as amusing as that might be to some thats just who we are he stared down at his hands she was right of course or would have been but she didnt know he wasnt simple or basic its not you grace no hurt and humiliation tangled inside her she imagined jack casey would have said the same thing if hed taken the time to say anything before he left her if its not me who is it im the only one here its me i cant raise a family because of what i come from what you come from you come from st christophers on the southern eastern shore you come from raymond and stella quinn no he lifted his gaze i come from the stinking slums of dc and baltimore and too many other places to count i come from a whore who sold herself and me for a bottle or a fix you dont know what i come from or what ive been i know you came from a terrible place ethan she spoke gently now wanting to soothe the brutal pain in his eyes i know your mother your biological mother was a prostitute she was a whore ethan corrected prostitute is too clean a word all right cautious now for she saw more than pain she nodded slowly there was fury as well just as brutal you lived through what no child should ever have to live through before you came here before the quinns gave you hope and love and a home and you became theirs you became ethan quinn it doesnt change the blood i dont know what you mean how the hell would you he shot it at her like a bullet hot and dangerously sharp how would she know he thought furiously shed grown up knowing her parents and their parents never once having to question what they had passed on to her what shed taken from them but she would before he was done shed know and that would end it she was a big woman i get my hands from her my feet the length of my arms he looked down at those arms now at those hands that had bunched into fists without his being aware of it i dont know where i get the rest from because i dont think she knew who my father was any more than i did just another john she had bad luck with she didnt get rid of me because shed already had three abortions and was afraid to risk another thats what she told me that was cruel of her jesus christ unable to sit any longer he rose leaped onto the dock to pace grace followed more slowly he was right about one thing she realized she didnt know this man the one who moved in fast jerky steps with his fists clenched as if he would use them viciously on anything that moved into his path so she stayed out of it she was a monster a fucking monster she beat me senseless for the hell of it as often as when she figured she had a reason oh ethan helpless to do otherwise she reached out for him dont touch me now he wasnt sure what he might do if he put his hands on her just then and it frightened him dont touch me now he repeated she let her empty arms fall to her sides battled back the tears that wanted to come she had to take me to the hospital once he continued i guess she was afraid i was going to die on her thats when we moved from dc to baltimore the doctor asked too many questions about how i fell down the steps and gave myself a concussion and a couple cracked ribs i used to wonder why she didnt just leave me behind but then she got some welfare money because of me and had a livein punching bag so i guess that was reason enough until i was eight he stopped pacing and stood still stood facing her there was so much rage inside him he could all but feel it searing his pores and the bitter rise of it stung his throat that was when she figured id better start earning my keep shed been in the life long enough to know where to go to find men who didnt much care for women men who would pay for children she couldnt speak even when she pressed a hand to her throat as if to push words any words out she could only stand there her face bonewhite in the light of the rising moon and her eyes huge and horrified the first time you fight you fight like your life depends on it and part of you doesnt believe its really going to happen it just cant happen doesnt matter that you know what sex is because youve been around the ugly edge of it all your life you dont know what this is cant believe its possible until its happening until you cant stop it from happening oh ethan oh god oh god she began to weep for him for the little boy for a world where such horrors could exist she made twenty dollars gave me two and made a whore of me no grace said helpless and sobbing no i burned the money but that didnt change anything she gave me a couple of weeks then she sold me again you fight the second time too harder even than the first because now you know and now you believe and you keep fighting every time over and over through the same nightmare until you just give up you take the money and you hide it because one day youll have enough then youll kill her and get out god knows you want to kill her maybe even more than you want to get out she closed her eyes did you he heard the raspiness in her voice took it for disgust rather than the sick fury it was a fury for him underscored with a vicious hope that he had oh that he had no after a while its just your life thats all nothing more nothing less you just live it he turned away now to stare toward the house where the lights glowed in the windows where music cam on guitar carried by the breeze played a pretty tune i lived it until i was twelve and one of the men shed sold me to went a little crazy he knocked me around pretty hard but that wasnt so unusual but he was flying on something and he went after her they tore the place apart made enough trouble that a couple neighbors whod made it their business to mind their own got riled enough to beat on the door he had his hands around her throat ethan remembered and i was sprawled on the floor looking up watching her eyes bulge and i was thinking maybe hell do it maybe hell do it for me she got her hand on a knife and she jammed it into him she jammed it into his back just as the people beating on the door busted it in people were shouting and screaming she pulled the son of a bitchs wallet out of his pocket while he was bleeding on the floor and she ran she never even looked at me he shrugged turned back somebody called the cops and they got me to a hospital im not clear on it but thats where i ended up doctors and cops and social workers he said quietly asking questions writing things down i guess they went looking for her but they never found her he lapsed into silence so that there was only the lap of water the call of insects the echoing notes of a guitar but she said nothing knowing he wasnt finished not yet finished stella quinn was at some medical conference in baltimore and she was doing guest rounds she stopped by my bed i guess shed looked at my chart i dont remember i just remember her being there putting her hands on the bed guard and looking down at me she had kind eyes not soft but kind she talked to me i didnt pay any attention to what she said just her voice she kept coming back sometimes ray would be with her one day she told me i could come home with them if i wanted he fell silent again as if that was the end but all grace could think was that the moment when the quinns had offered him a home had been the beginning ethan my heart breaks for you and i know now that as much as i loved and admired the quinns all these years it wasnt enough they saved you they saved me he agreed and after i decided to live i did everything i could to be something that honored that and them you are and always have been the most honorable man i know she went to him wrapped her arms around him and held tight despite the fact that his arms didnt enfold her in return let me help she murmured let me be with you ethan she lifted her face pressed her mouth to his let me love you he shuddered broke his arms came round her now fiercely his mouth took the comfort she offered he swayed there holding on to her a lifeline in a thrashing sea i cant do this grace its not right for you youre right for me she clung when he would have eased her away nothing youve said changes what i feel nothing could i only love you more for it listen to me his hands were steady but they were firm as they gripped her shoulders and pushed her back i cant give you what you need what you want what you should have marriage children family i dont dont tell me you dont need them i know you do she drew in air let it out slowly i need them with you i need a life with you i cant marry you i cant give you children i promised myself id never risk passing on to a child whatever pieces of her are in me theres nothing of her in you there is his fingers tightened briefly you saw it that day in the woods when i took you against a tree like an animal you saw it when i yelled at you over working in a bar and ive seen it too many times to count when someone pushes me the wrong way once too often holding it back doesnt mean its not there i cant take vows with you or make a child with you i love you too much to let you believe its ever going to happen she scarred more than your body grace murmured its your heart she really abused i can help you heal it the rest of the way he gave her a quick gentle shake youre not listening to me youre not hearing me if you cant accept the way things have to be between us ill understand ill never blame you for stepping back and looking for what you want with someone else the best thing for you is for me to let you go and thats what im doing letting me go i want you to go home he released her and stepped back felt as if hed entered a huge dark void once you think this all through youll see it my way then you can decide if we should go on seeing each other the way we have been or if you want me to leave you be i want no he interrupted you dont know what you want right now you need time and so do i id rather you went on i dont want you here right now grace she lifted a hand to her temple you dont want me here not now he set his jaw when he saw the hurt swim into her eyes for her own good he reminded himself go home and leave me be for a while she took a step back then another then turned and ran around the house rather than through it she couldnt bear having anyone see her with tears on her cheeks and this awful tearing pain in her heart he wouldnt have her was all she could think he wouldnt let her be what he needed hey grace hey seth abandoned his pursuit of the lightning bugs that flickered and flashed through the dark and raced after her ive got about a million of these suckers he started to hold up a jar then he saw the tears heard them in her ragged breathing as she fumbled with the door handle on her car whats wrong why are you crying did you get hurt she sobbed out a breath pressed a hand to her heart oh yes oh yes im hurt its nothing i have to go home i cant i cant stay she tore open the car door stumbled inside seths eyes went from puzzled to grim as he watched her drive away hot with fury he stormed around the side of the house slapping the bright jar on the edge of the porch he saw the shadow on the dock and strode toward it with fists clenched for battle you bastard you son of a bitch he waited until ethan turned then rammed his fist as hard as he could into his gut you made her cry i know i did the fresh and physical pain jolted through him and joined the rest this isnt your business seth go on in the house fuck you you hurt her go on try to hurt me it wont be so easy teeth bared seth swung again and again until ethan picked him up by collar and seat and held him dangling over the end of the dock cool off you hear or ill toss you in he added a hard threatening shake but his heart wasnt in it you think i wanted to hurt her you think i got any pleasure out of it then why did you seth shouted struggling like a baited fish there wasnt any choice suddenly abominably weary ethan dropped seth to his feet on the dock leave me alone he murmured and sat on the edge giving in he put his head in his hands pressed his fingers to his eyes just leave me alone seth shifted his feet it wasnt just grace who was hurt he hadnt really understood that a grown man could be not this way but ethan was tentatively he stepped forward he stuck his hands in his pockets pulled them out shuffled sighed then sat women seth said in a level and considering voice make a man want to shoot himself in the head and be done with it it was something hed heard phillip say to cam and he thought it might be appropriate he was rewarded when ethan let out a short laugh even if it wasnt a happy one yeah i guess they can ethan draped an arm around seths shoulders pulled the boy close to his side and took a little comfort chapter eighteen contents prev next anna weighed her priorities and took the day off she couldnt be sure what time grace would be by to tend the house and she couldnt risk missing her she didnt give a good damn what ethan said or didnt say there was a crisis if shed believed theyd simply had a spat or misunderstanding she would have been sympathetic or amused whichever was most called for it wasnt a misunderstanding that had put misery into ethans eyes oh he had a way of hiding it she mused as she slowly and ruthlessly tugged out weeds that threatened her begonias in the frontyard bed and he hid his more personal feelings very well it just so happened she was a professional at filtering through to emotion too bad for him that hed inherited a social worker for a sisterinlaw shed poked at seth a bit there was no doubt in her mind the boy knew something but shed run straight into unwavering male loyalty all she got out of him was a quinn shrug and a zipped lip she could have wheedled it out nonetheless but she hadnt had the heart to put a chip in that lovely bond seth could keep his loyalty to ethan anna would work on grace she was positive they hadnt seen each other for days it was pathetically easy to keep tabs on ethan he was out on the water every morning in the boatyard every afternoon and through the evening he poked at his dinner then retreated to his room where shed seen the light slanting under his door well into the night on several occasions brooding she thought with an impatient shake of her head and if he wasnt brooding he was looking for a fight she had broken up what would certainly have been bloodshed over the weekend when she walked in on the three brothers going nose to nose in the boatyard seth looking on with avid interest whatever had caused it remained a mystery as shed bounced straight off that same united male wall shrugs and snarls were all she got for her trouble well it was going to stop she decided and attacked some chickweed with enthusiasm women knew how to share and discuss and if she had to bang grace monroe over the head with her garden spade grace was damn well going to share and discuss it was with pleasure that she heard graces car pull in anna tipped back her hat rose and offered a welcoming smile hi there hello anna i thought youd be at work took a mental health day oh yes misery here as well she mused and not quite as well coated as ethans you didnt bring aubrey with you no my mother wanted her today grace ran a hand up and down the strap of the oversized bag over her shoulder well ill get started and let you get back to your gardening i was just looking for an excuse to take a break why dont we sit down on the porch a minute i really should get the first load of laundry in grace anna laid a gentle hand on her arm sit down talk to me i count you as one of my friends i hope you count me as one of yours i do graces voice wavered she had to take three breaths to steady it i do anna then lets sit down tell me whats happened to make you and ethan so unhappy i dont know if i can but she was tired bonetired so she sat down on the steps i guess i made a mess of everything how shed cried herself dry grace thought not that it had helped maybe it would help to talk things over with another woman one she was beginning to feel close to i let myself assume she began i let myself plan he picked me flowers she said with a helpless lift of her hands picked you flowers annas eyes narrowed fractionally rabbits my butt she thought but filed it away for later retribution and he took me to dinner candles and wine i thought he was going to ask me to marry him ethan does things stage by stage and i thought he was leading up to proposing of course you did youre in love with each other hes devoted to aubrey and she adores him youre both nesters why wouldnt you think it grace stared for a moment then let out a long breath i cant tell you what it means to hear you say that i felt like such a fool well stop youre not a fool im not and i certainly thought it we were both wrong he didnt ask me but he loved me that night anna so tenderly i never believed anyone would feel so much for me he had a nightmare later a nightmare yes and she understood it now it was bad very bad but he pretended it wasnt he told me not to worry and brushed it off so i didnt think any more about it then thoughtfully she rubbed a faint bruise on her thigh that shed given herself bumping into a table at shineys the next day i decided if i sat around waiting for ethan to do the asking id have gray hair on my wedding day ethan doesnt exactly rush through life no he doesnt he gets things done in his own time and gets them done well but he could sure use a poke now and then he does doesnt he she couldnt stop the warm wistful smile sometimes he just thinks things to death and i thought this was going to be one of those times so i made up my mind to do the asking myself you asked ethan to marry you anna chuckled leaned back on the steps atta girl grace i had it all worked out everything i wanted to say and how to say it i thought on the water where hes most content so i asked him to take me out for an evening sail it was so lovely with the sun setting and the sails bright and full of wind and i asked him anna slipped a hand over graces i gather he turned you down but it was more than that if youd seen his face√¢ he went so cold he said hed explain things to me when we got back and he did i dont feel right telling you anna because its ethans business but he said he cant marry me wont marry me or anyone ever anna didnt speak for a moment she was seths caseworker which meant shed had full access to the files on the three men who would stand as his guardians she knew their pasts nearly as well as they did is it because of what happened to him as a child graces gaze flickered then she stared straight ahead he told you no but i know about it most of it its part of my job you know√¢ what his mother that woman did to him let other people do to him he was only a little boy i know that she forced him to have sex with clients for several years before she abandoned him there are still copies of the medical reports in his file i know that he was raped and beaten before stella quinn found him in the hospital and i know what that kind of trauma that kind of consistent abuse can do ethan could very well have become an abuser himself its a miserably common cycle but he didnt no he became a thoughtful considerate man with nearly unflappable control the scars are there under it its likely that his relationship with you has brought some of them closer to the surface he wont let me help anna hes got it into his head that he cant risk having children because hes got her blood in him bad blood that he would pass on he wont marry because marriage means family to him hes wrong and he has the best example of how wrong in his own mirror he not only has her blood but he spent the first twelve years the most impressionable years with her in an environment that could warp any young mind instead hes ethan quinn why should his children children that come from the two of you be any less than he is i wish i had thought to say that grace murmured i was so shocked and sad and shaken she closed her eyes i dont think it would have mattered if i had he wasnt going to listen not to me she said slowly he doesnt think im strong enough to live with what hes lived with hes wrong yes hes wrong but his minds made up he wont want me now he says the choice is mine but i know him if i say i can accept this and we go on as we are itll eat at him until he pulls away can you accept it ive asked myself that thought about that for days now i love him enough to want to maybe to settle for it at least for a while but it would eat at me too she shook her head no i cant accept it i cant accept only one part of him and i wont ask aubrey to accept anything less than a father good for you now what are you going to do about it i dont know that theres anything i can do not when we both need different things anna let out a huff of breath grace youre the only one who can decide but let me tell you cam and i didnt just float to the altar on gossamer wings we wanted different things or thought we did and to find out what we wanted together we hurt each other we got in each others faces and we dealt with it its hard to get in ethans face about anything but its not impossible no its not impossible but√¢ he wasnt honest with me anna underneath it all i cant forget that he let me spin my daydreams all the time knowing he was going to cut the threads of them and let me fall hes sorry for it i know but still√¢ youre angry yes i guess i am i had another man do that to me my father she added coolly now i wanted to be a dancer and he knew i was pinning my hopes on it i cant say he ever encouraged me but he let me go on taking lessons and wishing and when i needed him to stand up and help me try for that dream√¢ he cut the threads i forgave him for it or tried to but things were never the same then i got pregnant and married jack i guess you could say that cut his threads and hes never forgiven me have you tried to resolve things there no i havent he gave me a choice too just like ethan did or what they seem to think of as a choice do this their way accept it or do without them so ill do without i understand that but while it may buffer your pride what does it do to your heart when people break your heart prides all youve got left and pride anna thought could turn cold and bitter without heart let me talk to ethan ill talk to him as soon as i can work out what needs to be said she blew out a breath i feel better she realized it helps to say it all out loud and there was no one else i could say it to i care about both of you i know well be all right she gave annas hand a squeeze before she rose you helped me stop feeling weepy i hate feeling weepy now im going to work off some of this mad i didnt realize was in there she managed to smile youre going to have a damn clean house when im done i clean like a maniac when im working off a mad dont work it all off anna thought as grace went inside save some of it for that idiot ethan it took two and a half hours for grace to scrub rinse dust and polish her way through the second floor she had a bad moment in ethans room where the scent of him of the sea clung to the air and the small careless pieces of his daily life were scattered about but she drew herself in calling on the same core of steel that had gotten her through a divorce and a painful family rift work helped as it always had good strenuous manual labor kept both her hands and her mind busy life went on she knew it firsthand and you got through from one day to the next she had her child she had her pride and she still had dreams though shed come to the point that she preferred to think of them as plans she could live without ethan not as fully perhaps not as joyfully certainly but she could live and be productive and find contentment in the path she forged for herself and her daughter she was finished with tears and selfpity she started on the main floor with the same singleminded fervor furniture was polished until it gleamed glass was scrubbed until it sparkled she hung out wash swept porches and battled dirt as if it were an enemy threatening to take over the earth by the time she got to the kitchen her back ached but it was a small and satisfying pain her skin wore a light coat of sweat her hands were pruny from wash water and she felt as accomplished as a corporate president after a major business coup she checked the clock measured time she wanted to be finished and gone before ethan came in from work despite the purging wrought by labor there was a small simmering ember of anger still burning in her heart she knew herself well enough to understand that it would take very little to fan it to full flame if she fought with him if she said even a portion of the things that had careened through her head over the last few days they would never be able to be civil again much less friends she wouldnt force the quinns to take sides and she wouldnt risk putting her precious and vital relationship with seth at risk because two adults in his life couldnt mind their tempers i wont lose my job over it either she muttered as she went to work on the countertops just because he cant see what hes throwing out of his life she hissed out a breath scooped her fingers through her hair which the heat and her exertion had dampened at the temples and calmed herself by giving the drip pans on the ancient range a good scouring when the phone rang she snatched it up without thinking hello anna quinn grace glanced out the window saw anna puttering happily among the back garden no ill i got something to say to you bitch grace stopped two steps from the screen door what this is gloria delauter who the hell do you think you are threatening me im not i got rights do you hear me i got fucking rights the old man made a deal with me and if you and your bastard husband and his bastard brothers dont live up to it youre the ones wholl be sorry the voice wasnt just hard and harsh grace realized it was manic the words shooting out so fast that one ran into the back of the other this was seths mother she thought as more abuse rang in her ear the woman whod hurt him who frightened him whod taken money for him sold him she wasnt aware that she had twisted the phone cord around her hand that it was so tightly wrapped it bit into the flesh struggling for calm she took a deep breath miss delauter youre making a mistake youre the one who made the goddamn mistake sending me that fucking letter instead of the money you owe me you fucking owe me you think im scared cause youre some asshole social worker i dont give a shit if youre the goddamn queen of goddamn england the old mans dead and if you want things to stay like they are youre going to deal with me you think you can hold me off with words on paper youre not going to stop me if i decide to come back and take that boy youre wrong grace heard herself say but her voice sounded far away echoing in her head hes my flesh and blood and i got a right to take whats mine try it rage tore through her like a storm surge youll never put your hands on him again i can do what i like with whats mine hes not yours you sold him now hes ours and youre never going to get near him hell do what the hell i tell him to do he knows hell pay for it otherwise you make one move toward him ill take you apart myself nothing youve done to him however monstrous is close to what ill do to you when im finished theyll barely have enough left to scrape up and toss in a cell thats just where youll go for child abuse neglect assault prostitution and whatever it is they call a mother who sells her child to men for sex what kind of lies has that brat been telling i never laid a finger on him shut up you shut the hell up shed lost track mixed seths mother and ethans into one woman one monster i know what you did to him and there isnt a cage dark enough to lock you in to suit me but ill find one and ill shove you in it myself if you come near him again i just want money there was a wheedle in the voice now both sly and a little scared just some money to help me through youve got plenty i dont have anything for you but contempt you stay away from here and you stay away from that child or youll be the one who pays you better think again you just better think again there was a muffled sound then the clink of ice against glass youre no better than me im not afraid of you you should be afraid you should be terrified im√¢ im not finished with this im not done the click of the disconnect was loud maybe not grace said in a soft and dangerous voice but neither am i gloria delauter anna murmured she stood just on the other side of the screen door where shed been for the last two minutes i dont think shes human if shed been here if shed been in this room id have had my hands around her throat id have choked her like an animal she began to shake now fury and reaction crashing against each other inside her id have killed her or tried i know how it feels its hard to think about someone like her as a person and not a thing anna pushed the door open her eyes on grace she would never have expected to see that whitehot rage in such a mildtempered woman i see it all too often in my work but i never get used to it she was foul grace shuddered she thought i was you when i answered the phone i tried to tell her at first but she wouldnt listen she just shouted and threatened and swore i couldnt let her get away with it i couldnt stand it im sorry its all right from the end of the conversation i could hear id say you handled it you want to sit down no i cant i cant sit she shut her eyes but still only saw that blinding red haze anna she said shed come back and get seth if you didnt give her money thats not going to happen anna moved to the refrigerator pulled out a bottle of wine im going to pour you a glass of this youre going to drink it slowly while i get my notebook then i want you to try to tell me what she said as close as possible to exactly what she said can you do that i can i can remember good anna glanced at the clock were going to want to document everything if she does come back were going to be ready anna grace stared down into the wine anna had given her he cant be hurt anymore he shouldnt have to be afraid anymore i know it well make sure hes not ill only be a minute anna took her through the conversation twice as she went through it the second time grace found herself unable to sit she rose leaving her glass of wine half full and got a broom the way she said things was every bit as vile as what she said she told anna as she began to sweep she must use that same tone on seth i dont know how anyone can speak to a child that way then she shook her head but she doesnt think of him as a child hes a thing to her if you were called on to testify youd be able to swear under oath that she demanded money more than once grace agreed will it come to that anna will you have to take seth into court i dont know if it heads in that direction we should be able to add extortion to the list of charges you reeled off you must have scared her she added with a small satisfied smile youd have scared me things just come flying out of my mouth when i get worked up i know what you mean there are things id like to say to her but in my position i cant or i shouldnt she said with a long sigh ill type this up for seths file then i suppose ill have to compose another letter to her why graces fingers tightened on the handle of the broom why do you have to have any contact with her cam and his brothers need to know grace they need to know exactly what gloria delauter and seth were to ray its not what some people are saying graces eyes flashed as she yanked a dustpan out of the broom closet she couldnt seem to sweep away the simmering anger inside her professor quinn wouldnt have cheated on his wife he was devoted to her they need to have all the facts and so does seth ill give you a fact professor quinn had taste he wouldnt have looked twice at a woman like gloria delauter unless it was with pity or disgust cam certainly feels the same way but another thing people say is that when they look at seth they see ray quinns eyes well theres another explanation for it thats all her own eyes were hot as she shoved the broom and dustpan away yanked out a bucket and a mop perhaps but it may have to be faced and dealt with that the quinns hit a rocky patch in their marriage as people often do extramarital affairs are distressingly common i dont give a damn about all the statistics you hear on television or read in magazines about how three out of five men or whatever it is cheat on their wives grace dumped cleanser in the bucket dropped it into the sink and turned the water on full blast the quinns loved each other and they liked each other and they had an admiration for each other you couldnt be around them and not see it they were tied only tighter together because of their sons when you saw the five of them together you were seeing family just the way the five of you are family touched anna smiled well were working on it you just havent had as many years as the quinns did grace hauled the bucket out of the sink they were a unit units anna thought often broke down if something had happened between ray and gloria would stella have forgiven him grace thrust the mop into the bucket and gave anna a cool decisive look would you forgive cam i dont know anna said after a moment it would be hard to because id have killed him but i might eventually put flowers on his grave exactly satisfied grace nodded that kind of betrayal doesnt swallow down easily and it follows that if the quinns had that kind of tension between them their sons would have known it children arent fools no matter how many adults might think so no theyre not anna murmured whatever the truth is they need to find it im going to type up my notes she said as she rose will you take a look at them see if theres anything you want to add or change before they go into the file all right ive still got some wash to hang out then ill be√¢ they heard it at the same time the wildly happy barking of dogs graces reaction was pure distress shed lost track of the time and ethan was home going on instinct anna slipped her notebook into a kitchen drawer i want to talk to cam about this before we tell seth about the phone call yes thats best i√¢ you can go out the back grace anna said quietly nobody could blame you for not wanting another emotional hit today i have wash to hang out youve done more than enough for one afternoon grace straightened her shoulders i finish what i start she turned into the laundry room and the lid of the washer clanged as she tossed it up which is more than can be said of some people anna lifted a brow ethan was in for a surprise she decided and wasnt it handy that she was around to see him get it chapter nineteen contents prev next when he saw her car in the driveway ethan had to force himself not to rush into the house just for a look at her a quick glimpse just one he could take all of her into his mind with just one look he hadnt known it was possible to miss a woman to miss anything the way he was missing grace the way he thought that left him empty and achy and edgy every hour of every day until he was desperate to fill the void until he laid awake at night listening to the air breathe until he thought he was losing his mind the control hed kept in place for so many years where she was concerned seemed constantly shaky these days the walls of that control had already been breached were tumbled at his feet so that he could swear he was choking on their dust he supposed once a man let it go it was hard to build it back up again but hed left the choice in her hands he reminded himself since she hadnt made a move in his direction in days he was afraid he knew which choice shed made he couldnt blame her for it she would find someone else someone she could make a life with the thought burned in his gut as he loitered by his truck but he refused to let it pass she deserved to have what she wanted out of life that was marriage and children and a pretty home a father for aubrey a man who would appreciate both of them for the treasures they were another man another man who would slip his arms around her waist rub his mouth over hers hear her breath quicken feel her bones go soft some faceless son of a bitch who wasnt good enough for her would turn to her in the night sink inside her and smile every goddamn morning because he knew he could do it again christ ethan thought it was making him crazy foolish bumped into his legs a ratty tennis ball clamped hopefully in his mouth his tail wagging persuasively in a habitual move ethan tugged the ball free and tossed it foolish bounded after it yapping furiously when simon darted like a bullet from the left and intercepted ethan only sighed when simon pranced back sat and waited for the game to continue it was as good an excuse as any to stay outside ethan decided he would fool with the dogs go fiddle with his boat stay out of graces way if she had wanted to see him she could have found him the dogs worked him around the side yard and taking pity on the slower less skilled foolish ethan found a stick to toss along with the ball it lightened his mood a little to watch them bash into each other wrestle fetch and retrieve you could depend on a dog he thought giving the ball a higher harder toss that sent simon bounding in pursuit they never asked for more than you could give them he didnt see grace until he was well around the house then he simply stood no one look one quick glimpse wasnt enough would never be enough the sheet she lifted to the line flapped wetly in the breeze as she pegged it the sun was on her hair as he watched she bent to the basket took out a pillowcase gave it a quick snap then clipped it beside the sheet love flooded into him swamped him left him weak and needy small details hammered him the curve of her cheek in profile had he ever noticed how elegant her profile was the way her hair sat on her head feathered at the back of her neck was she letting it grow the way the trim cuff of her shorts skimmed her thigh she had such long smooth thighs foolish rapped his head against ethans leg and snapped him back abruptly nervous he wiped his hands on his work pants shifted his feet it was probably best he decided if he just slipped back around the front went into the house and upstairs he took the first step back then pulled up short when she turned she gave him a long look one he couldnt read then bent to take out another pillowcase hello ethan grace he tucked his hands in his pockets it wasnt often he heard her voice quite so cool its foolish to go all the way back around to the front of the house just to avoid me i was√¢ going to check something on the boat thats fine you can do that after i talk to you i wasnt sure youd want to talk to me he approached her cautiously her tone of voice took the blistering heat right out of the day i tried to talk to you the other night but you werent inclined to listen she reached into the basket apparently unperturbed that she was now hanging his underwear then i needed a little time to myself to settle everything in my head and have you oh i think so first i should tell you that what you told me about what you went through before you came here shocked me and it hurt me and i have nothing but pity for that little boy and rage about what happened to him she glanced at him as she secured the next clothespin you dont want to hear that you dont want to think that i have feelings about it that it touched me no he said evenly no i didnt want it to touch you because im so fragile because im so delicate of nature his brows drew together partly and so you hoarded that nasty little seed all for yourself she went on calmly working her way down the clothesline even though theres nothing in or of my life that you dont know its the way it should be in your opinion that im an open book and youre a closed one no it wasnt that exactly what could it have been exactly she wondered but he didnt think it was a question and wisely formed no answer ive been thinking about that ethan ive been thinking about a number of things why dont we go back a ways first you like to do things in neat logical steps and since you like things to be done your way well just be neat and logical the dogs sensing trouble retreated to the water ethan found himself envying them you told me youve loved me for years years she said with such quick fury that he nearly stumbled back but you dont do anything about it you dont once not once come up to me and ask me if id like to spend some time with you one word from you one look from you would have thrilled me but oh no not ethan quinn not with his broody mind and incredible control you just kept your distance and let me pine over you i didnt know you had those kind of feelings for me then youre blind as well as stupid she snapped his brows drew together stupid thats what i said seeing the outrage cross his face was balm to her battered ego i would never have looked twice at jack casey if youd given me anything to hope for but i needed someone to want me and it sure as hell didnt appear it was ever going to be you now just a damn minute im not to blame for you marrying jack no i take the blame i take the responsibility and i dont regret it because it gave me aubrey but i blame you ethan and those goldflecked green eyes blazed with it i blame you for being too pigheaded to take what you wanted and you havent changed a damn bit you were too young she used both hands and all the force of her temper went into the shove oh shut up you had your say now im having mine in the kitchen seths eyes went hot he made a dash for the door only to be brought up short by anna who was eavesdropping as hard as she could no you dont he yelled at her shes yelling too hes fighting with her im going to stop him anna cocked her head does she look like she needs any help his mouth set seth glared through the screen then reconsidered when he saw grace shove ethan back a full step i guess not she can handle him amused she gave seth a scrubbing pat on the top of the head how come you dont leap to my defense when cam and i argue because hes afraid of you anna rolled her tongue into her cheek enjoying the idea oh really half afraid anyway seth said with a grin he never knows what youll do and besides you guys like to argue observant little brat arent you he shrugged cheerful now i see what i see and know what you know laughing she edged closer to the door with him hoping for a better view lets move to the next step ethan grace shoved the empty basket out of her way with her foot fastforward a few years think you can keep up he took a long breath because he didnt want to yell at her again youre pissing me off grace good i mean to and i hate to fail at something im working on he wasnt sure which emotion came out on top annoyance or bafflement whats gotten into you oh i dont know ethan lets see could it be the fact that you think im some brainless helpless female yes you know√¢ she jabbed her index finger into his chest like a drill into wood i bet thats just whats gotten into me i dont think youre brainless oh just helpless then even as he opened his mouth she was rolling over him do you think a helpless woman can do what ive been doing the last few years do you think what was it you called me once delicate like your mamas good china im not china she exploded im good solid stoneware the kind you can drop and it rattles around on the floor it doesnt shatter you have to work to break good stoneware ethan and im not broken yet she punched a finger into his chest again darkly pleased when his eyes flashed a warning i wasnt so helpless when i got you into my bed was i which is just where i wanted you you didnt get me anywhere hell i didnt and youre brainless if you think differently i reeled you in like a goddamn rockfish it gave her pleasure oh such vivid pleasure to see both fury and frustration race over his face if you think a statement like that flatters either of us im not trying to flatter you im telling you straight out i wanted you and i went after you if id left the matter up to you wed have been pinching each others butts in a nursing home jesus grace just be quiet there was no stopping now whatever the consequences not with this roaring sea crashing in her head you just think about that ethan quinn you give that some good long thought and dont you dare call me fragile again he gave her a slow nod its not the word thats coming to mind at the moment good i havent needed you or anyone to help me build a decent life for my baby i used muscle and i used guts to do what needed to be done so dont you tell me im china you wouldnt have had to do it all alone if you werent too damn proud to settle things with your father the truth of that put a hitch in her step but she balled her fists and rushed on were talking about you and me you say you love me ethan but you dont for one minute understand me im starting to agree with that he muttered youve got some egoridden male idea in your head that i need to be taken care of protected coddled when what i need is to be needed and respected and loved and youd know that if you paid attention you ask yourself this ethan who seduced whom who said i love you first who proposed marriage are you so nearsighted you cant see ive had to take every step first with you you make it sound like youve been leading me by the nose grace i dont care for that i couldnt lead you by the nose if i jabbed a fish hook in it you go exactly where you want to go ethan but you can be so infuriatingly slow i love that about you and i admire it and now i understand it more you had a terrible period in your life when you had no control now you take care not to lose it but you can slip from control into stubbornness in one short step and thats just what youve done im not being stubborn im being right right its right for two people to love each other and not build a life out of it its right to pay all your life for what someone else did to you when you were too young to defend yourself against it is it right for you to say you cant and wont marry me because youre√¢ stained and you made some ridiculous promise to yourself never to have a family of your own it sounded off when she said it like that it sounded√¢ stupid its the way it is because you say so i told you how it is grace i gave you the choice her jaw hurt from clenching it people like to say theyve given somebody a choice when what theyre really saying isdo this my way i dont like your way ethan your way only takes into account what was and doesnt add what is or what could be you think i dont know what you expected youd take your stand and sweet delicate grace would just fall in line i didnt expect you to fall in line then crawl off wounded and pine after you for the rest of my life youre getting neither ill give you a choice this time ethan you straighten yourself out you go on and think things through for the next eon or two then you let me know what conclusions youve come to because my stand is this its marriage or its nothing ill be damned if ill spend the rest of my life pining over you i can live without you she tossed back her head lets see if youre man enough to live without me she whirled around and stalked off leaving him fuming upstairs anna hissed at seth hes coming inside now its my turn are you going to yell at him too maybe i want to watch not this time she all but shoved him out of the room upstairs i mean it hell he stomped to the stairs waited a moment then slipped back down the hallway anna was pouring herself a homey cup of coffee when ethan slammed the back door part of her wanted to go over and give him a big sympathetic hug he looked so miserably unhappy and confused but the way she figured it there were times when it was best all around to kick a good man when he was down want some he flicked a glance at her and kept walking no thanks hold it she smiled sweetly when he stopped when she all but saw the jittery waves of impatience shimmering around him i need to talk to you for a minute im about talked out for the day thats all right deliberately she pulled a chair out from the table you sit down and ill talk women ethan decided as he dropped into the chair were the bane of his existence i guess ill take the coffee then all right she poured him a mug brought him a spoon so he could dump his customary heaps of sugar into it she sat folded her hands neatly and continued to smile you stupid jerk oh jesus he rubbed his hands over his face left them there not another one im going to make it easy on you at first ill ask a question you answer are you in love with grace yes but no qualifications anna cut him off the answer is yes is grace in love with you hard to say just now he shifted his hand to nurse the point on his chest where shed all but bored a hole in him the answer is yes anna said coolly are you both single otherwise unattached adults he could feel himself sinking into a sulk and detested it yeah so just laying the groundwork gathering the facts grace has a child correct you know damn well correct anna lifted her cup took a sip of coffee do you have feelings of affection for aubrey of course i do i love her who wouldnt and does she have feelings of affection for you sure what wonderful weve established the emotions of the parties involved now lets move on to stability you have a profession and a new business you appear to be a man with skill whos willing to work and has the capability of earning a good living have you incurred any large outstanding debts you believe youll have difficulty meeting for gods sake no offense intended she said brightly im simply approaching this matter the way i assume you would calmly patiently step by tedious step he narrowed his eyes at her seems to me people are having major problems with how i do things lately i love the way you do things she reached across the table and gave his tense hand an affectionate squeeze i love you ethan its wonderful for me to have a big brother at this stage of my life he shifted in his chair he was touched by the obvious sincerity in her eyes but he had a feeling she was tenderizing him in preparation for the roasting to come i dont know whats going on around here i think youll figure it out so well say youre financially sound grace as we know is well capable of earning a living you own your own home and a onethird share in this one shelter certainly isnt an issue so well move on do you believe in the institution of marriage he knew a trick question when he heard one it works for some people doesnt work for others no no do you believe in the institution itself yes or no yes but then why the hell arent you down on one knee with a ring in your big clumsy hand begging the woman you love to give your fat head another chance im a patient man ethan said slowly but im getting tired of insults dont you dare get out of that chair she warned when he started to scrape it back i swear ill belt you god knows i want to thats another thing thats going around he subsided only because it seemed easier to get it all over with at once go ahead then say what you have to say you think i dont understand you think i cant relate to whats eating you up inside youre wrong i was raped when i was ten years old shock jolted his heart pain squeezed his soul jesus anna jesus im sorry i didnt know now you do does it change me ethan arent i the same person i was thirty seconds ago she reached for his hand again held it this time i know what it is to be helpless and terrified and want to die and i know what it is to make something of your life despite that and i know what it is to have that horror in you always no matter how much youve learned no matter how much youve come to accept it and know it was never ever your fault its not the same its never the same not for any two people we have something more in common as well i never knew who my father was was he a good man or a bad one tall or short did he love my mother or did he use her i dont know what parts of him were passed to me but you knew your mother yes and she was wonderful beautiful and yours wasnt she beat you physically and emotionally she made you a victim why are you letting her keep you one why are you letting her win even now its me now anna there has to be something twisted something sour inside a person to make them the way she was i came from that sins of the fathers ethan im not taking on her sins im talking about heredity you can pass on the color of your eyes your build weak hearts alcoholism longevity those things can run in families youve given this a lot of thought yeah i have i had to make a decision and i made it so you decided you could never marry or have children it wouldnt be fair well then youd better talk to seth before too long seth someone has to tell him hes never going to be able to have a wife and children its best if he knows that early so he can try to protect himself from becoming emotionally involved with a woman for a trio of heartbeats he could only gape at her what the hell are you talking about heredity we cant be sure what bad traits gloria delauter passed down to him god knows shes got something twisted inside her just as you said a whore a drunk a junkie from all accounts theres nothing wrong with that boy what difference does that make she met ethans furious stare blandly he shouldnt be allowed to take chances you cant mix him in with me this way i dont see why you both come from similar situations in fact there are far too many cases that come through social services nationally that slip into parallel categories i wonder if we can pass a law to prevent children of abusers from marrying and having children of their own think of the risks wed avoid why dont you just geld them he said viciously thats an interesting concept she leaned forward since youre so determined not to pass on any unhealthy genes ethan have you considered a vasectomy the instinctive and purely male cringe nearly made her laugh thats enough anna is that what you would recommend to seth i said thats enough oh its more than enough she agreed but answer this last question do you think that bright troubled child should be denied a full and normal life as an adult because he had the bad luck to be conceived by a heartless perhaps even evil woman no his breath shuddered out no thats not what i think no buts this time no qualifications then ill tell you that in my professional opinion i couldnt agree with you more he deserves everything he can grab everything he can make and everything we can give him to show him that hes his own person and not the damaged product of one vile woman and neither are you ethan anything but your own man stupid maybe she said with a smile as she rose but admirable honorable and incredibly kind she went to him put an arm around his shoulders when he sighed turned his face to press it against her midriff tears stung her eyes i dont know what to do yes you do she murmured being you youll have to think about it for a while but do yourself a favor this time and think fast i guess ill go down to the boatyard and work until i get it clear in my head because she was feeling suddenly maternal toward him she bent and kissed the top of his head do you want me to pack you some food no he gave her a squeeze before he rose when he saw that her eyes were damp he patted her shoulder dont cry camll have my head if he finds out i made you cry i wont well then he started out hesitated then turned back briefly to study her as she stood in the kitchen her lashes wet her hair tangled from being out in the breeze anna my mother my real mother he added because stella quinn was in his mind all that was real would have loved you hell anna thought as he walked away she was going to cry after all ethan kept going particularly when he heard annas sniffle he needed to be alone to clear out his head and let the thoughts gather again hey with his hand on the door he looked over his shoulder and saw seth on the stairs where the boy had dashed like a skillful rabbit seconds before ethan had started out of the kitchen hey what seth started down slowly hed heard everything every word even when his stomach had begun to pitch he had stayed and listened as he studied ethan now owlishly he thought he understood and he felt safe where you going back to the boatyard i got some things i want to finish up ethan let the door ease closed again there was something in the boys eyes he thought you okay yeah can i go out on the workboat with you tomorrow if you want if i went with you wed finish sooner and be able to work on the boat with cam when phil comes down on the weekend we can all work on her together thats how it goes ethan said puzzled yeah thats how it goes all of them seth thought with a flash of pure joy together its hard work because its hot as a bitch in heat ethan bit back a chuckle watch the mouth annas in the kitchen seth shrugged but aimed a wary glance behind him shes cool yeah ethans smile spread shes cool dont stay up half the night drawing or bugging your eyes out at the tv if youre working with me in the morning yeah yeah seth waited until ethan was outside then snatched up the bag sitting beside the chair hey christ boy are you going to let me out of here before tomorrow grace forgot her purse seth pushed it into ethans hand and kept his face bland and innocent i guess she had something on her mind when she left i guess brows knit ethan stared down at it damn thing weighed ten pounds if it weighed an ounce he thought you ought to take it over to her women go nuts if they dont have their purses see you he raced back inside pounded up the stairs and straight to the first window that faced the front of the house from there he could watch ethan scratch his head shove the purse under his arm like a football and walk slowly to the truck his brothers sure could be weird he thought then he grinned to himself his brothers letting out a whoop he raced down the steps to head for the kitchen and nag anna for something to eat chapter twenty contents prev grace intended to cool off and calm down before she stopped by her parents house to pick up aubrey when she was this emotionally churned up there was no hiding it from anyone much less from a mother or a very perceptive child the last thing she wanted was questions the last thing she felt capable of giving was explanations shed said what needed to be said and done what needed to be done and she refused to feel sorry for it if it meant losing a longstanding friendship one that she had always treasured it couldnt be helped somehow she and ethan would manage to be adult enough to be polite when in public and not to drag anyone else into their battles it certainly wouldnt be an easy or happy situation but it could work the same arrangement had worked for three years with her father hadnt it she drove around for twenty minutes until her fingers were no longed gripping the wheel like a vise and the reflection of her face in the rearview mirror was no longer capable of frightening children and small dogs she assured herself that she was now perfectly under control so under control that she thought shed take aubrey out to mcdonalds for a treat and on her very next evening off she was taking them both to oxford for the firemens carnival she certainly wasnt going to stay around the house moping she didnt slam the door of her car which she felt was an excellent sign of her now placid mood nor did she stomp up the steps of her parents tidy colonial she even paused for a moment to admire the palepurple petunias spilling out of a hanging planter near the picture window it was just bad luck and bad timing that her gaze shifted a few inches past the blooms and that she spotted her father through that picture window lounging in his recliner like a king on his throne temper geysered and blasted her through the door like a sharpedged pebble from a wellaimed slingshot i have a few things to say to you she let the door slam at her back and marched up to where pete rested his feet ive been saving them up he goggled at her for the five seconds it took for him to arrange his face if you want to speak to me youll do it in a civilized tone of voice im through being civilized ive had civilized up to here she made a sharp slashing motion with her hand grace grace cheeks flushed eyes huge carol hustled in from the kitchen with aubrey on her hip whats gotten into you youll upset the baby take aubrey back to the kitchen mama and it wont traumatize her for life to hear her mother raise her voice as if to prove arguments were inevitable aubrey threw back her head and sent up a wail grace stifled the urge to grab her run out of the house with her and smother her face with kisses until the tears stopped instead she stood firm aubrey stop that now im not mad at you you go on in the kitchen with grandma and have some juice juice aubrey sobbed it at the top of her lungs straining away from carol with her arms held out to grace and fat tears trembling on her cheeks carol take the child in the kitchen and calm her down pete clamped down the exact urge as graces and waved a hand at his wife impatiently child hasnt shed a tear all day he muttered with an accusing look at grace well shes shedding them now grace snapped back adding layers of guilt onto frustration as aubreys sobs echoed back from the kitchen and shell forget them five minutes after theyre dry thats the beauty of being two you get older you dont forget tears as easily you made me cry plenty of them you dont get through parenthood without causing some tears but some people can get through it without ever knowing the child they raised you never looked at me and saw what i was pete wished he was standing he wished he had shoes on his feet a man was at a distinct disadvantage when he was kicked back in a recliner without his damn shoes on i dont know what youre talking about or maybe you did maybe im wrong about that you looked you saw and you put it aside because it didnt fit in with what you wanted you knew she continued in a low voice that nonetheless snapped with fury you knew i wanted to be a dancer you knew i dreamed of it and you let me go right on oh taking the lessons was fine with you maybe you grumbled about the cost of them from time to time but you paid for them and a pretty penny it came to over all those years for what daddy he blinked no one had called him daddy in nearly three years and it pinched at his heart because you were set on having them what was the point if you were never going to believe in me never going to let go enough or stand by enough to let me try to take the next step this is old business grace you were too young to go to new york and it was just foolishness i was young but not too young and if it was foolishness it was my foolishness ill never know if i was good enough ill never know if i could have made that dream real because when i asked you to help me reach for it you told me i was too old for nonsense too old for nonsense she repeated but too young to be trusted i did trust you he jerked his chair up and look what happened yes look what happened i got myself pregnant isnt that how you put it at the time like it was something i managed all by myself just to annoy you jack casey was no damn good i knew it the first time i laid eyes on him so you said over and over again until he took on the gleam of forbidden fruit and i couldnt resist sampling it now petes eyes flashed and he rose out of the chair youre blaming me for getting yourself in trouble no im to blame if there has to be blame and i wont make excuses but ill tell you this he wasnt nearly as bad as you made him out to be left you high and dry didnt he so did you daddy his hand shot up shocking both of them it didnt connect and it trembled as he lowered it hed never done more than paddle her bottom when she was a toddler and even then hed suffered more than she had because of it if youd hit me she said struggling to keep her voice low and even it would be the first real feeling youve shown me since i came to you and mama and told you i was pregnant i knew youd be angry and hurt and disappointed i was so scared but as bad as i thought it would be it was worse because you didnt stand by me the second time daddy and the most important of all and you werent there for me a mans daughter comes in and tells him shes pregnant that shes gone on and been with a man he took trouble to warn her away from it takes him time to deal with it you were ashamed of me and you were angry thinking of what the neighbors were going to say and instead of looking at me and seeing that i was scared all you saw was that id made a mistake you were going to have to live with she turned away until she was sure absolutely sure there wouldnt be tears aubrey is not a mistake shes a gift i couldnt love her any more than i do or me any less thats not true he began to feel sick inside and more than a little scared himself thats just not true you stepped back when i married jack stepped back from me you did some stepping back yourself maybe she turned around again i tried to make it once without you putting my money away for new york i couldnt do it on my own i was going to make my marriage work without any help but i couldnt do that either all i had left was the baby inside me and i wasnt going to fail there too you never even came to the hospital when i had her i did groping he picked up a magazine from the table rolled it into a tube i went up and looked at her through the glass she looked just like you did long legs and long fingers and nothing but yellow fuzz on her head i went and looked in your room you were asleep i couldnt go in i didnt know what to say to you he unrolled the magazine frowned at the freshfaced model on the cover then dropped it back on the table i guess it made me mad all over again youd had a baby and you didnt have a husband and i didnt know what to do about it ive got strong beliefs about that kind of thing its hard to bend i didnt need you to bend very much i kept waiting for you to give me the chance to i thought when that son of a bitch ran out on you youd figure out you needed some help and come home so you could have told me how right you were about everything something flickered in his eyes that might have been sorrow i guess i deserve that i guess thats what i wouldve done he sat down again and damn it i was right she gave a half laugh weary around the edges funny how the men i love are always so damn right where im concerned am i what youd call a delicate woman daddy for the first time in too long to remember she saw his eyes laugh hell girl about as delicate as a steel rod thats something anyway i always wished you had a little more give in you instead of coming once just once and asking for help youre out there cleaning other peoples houses working until all hours in a bar not you too she murmured and moved to the window half the time if i see you down on the waterfront youve got shadows under your eyes course the way your mothers jabbering thatll change before long she glanced over her shoulder change ethan quinns not a man wholl let his wife wear herself to the bone working two jobs thats the kind of man you should have been looking at all along honest dependable she laughed again pushed a hand through her hair mamas mistaken i wont be marrying ethan pete started to speak again closed his mouth he was smart enough to learn by his mistakes if hed pushed her toward one man by pointing out his flaws he might also push her away from another by listing his virtues well you know your mother he let it go at that trying to fit the words in his head he plucked at the knee of his khakis i was afraid to let you go to new york he blurted out then shifted when she turned from the window to stare at him i was afraid you wouldnt come back i was afraid too that youd get yourself hurt up there hell gracie you were only eighteen and so damn green i knew you were good at dancing everybody said so and you always looked pretty to me i figured if you got yourself up there and didnt get your head bashed in by some mugger youd find you wanted to stay i knew you couldnt manage it unless i gave you the money to start you out so i didnt i thought youd either stop wanting to go so damn bad or if you didnt itd take you a year or two to put by enough when she said nothing he sighed and leaned back a man works hard all his life building something and while hes doing it he thinks that someday hell pass it on to his child my daddy passed the business on to me and i always figured id pass it on to my son had a daughter instead and that was fine i never wanted to change that but you never wanted what i was planning on giving you oh youd work you were always a good worker but anybody could see you were only doing a job it wasnt going to be a life not your life i didnt know you felt that way didnt matter how i felt it wasnt for you thats all i started to think that youd get married one day and maybe your husband would come into the business that way id still be passing it on to you and to your children then i married jack and you didnt get your dream either his hands rested on his knees and he lifted his fingers let them fall maybe aubreyll have an interest in it im not planning on retiring anytime soon maybe she will shes a good girl he said still looking down at his hands happy you√¢ youre a fine mother grace youre doing a better job than most under hard circumstance youve made a good life for both of you and done it on your own her heart trembled and ached thank you thank you for that ah√¢ your mother would like it if youd stay for dinner finally he looked up and the eyes that met hers werent cool werent distant in them was both plea and apology id like it too so would i then she simply walked over climbed into his lap and buried her face in his shoulder oh daddy i missed you i missed you grade he began to rock and to weep i missed you too ethan sat on the top step of graces front porch and put her purse down beside him he had to admit hed been tempted several times to open it and poke inside to see just what a woman carted around with her that was so damned heavy and so indispensable but so far hed managed to resist now he wondered where she could be hed driven by her house nearly two hours earlier before going to the boatyard since her car wasnt in the drive he didnt stop odds were her door was unlocked and he could have set her purse inside the living room but that wouldnt have accomplished anything hed done some hard thinking while he worked some of that thinking centered on how long it was going to take her to cool off from snarling mad to mildly irritated he figured he could deal with mildly irritated he decided it was probably best that she wasnt home quite yet it gave them both more time to settle down got it all figured out yet ethan sighed hed smelled his father before he heard him before he saw him sitting comfortably on the steps feet crossed at the ankles it was the salted peanuts in the bag ray had in his lap he had always had a fondness for salted peanuts not exactly i cant seem to think it through so it gets clear sometimes you have to go with the gut instead of the head youve got good instincts ethan following instincts what got me into this if i hadnt touched her in the first place√¢ if you hadnt touched her in the first place youd have denied both of you something a lot of people look for all their lives and never find ray rattled into the bag and pulled out a handful of nuts why regret something that rare and that precious i hurt her i knew i would thats where you went wrong not in taking love when it was offered but in not trusting it for the long haul you disappoint me ethan it was a slap the kind that both knew would sting the most because it did ethan stared hard at the thirsty little pansies going leggy beside the steps i tried to do what i thought was right for whom for a woman who wanted to share your life wherever that would take you for the children you may or may not have youre on dangerous ground when you secondguess god annoyed ethan slanted a narrow look at his fathers face is there is there what is there a god i figure you ought to know seeing as youve been dead the last few months ray threw back his big head let out his wonderful rolling laugh ethan ive always appreciated your understated wit and i wish i could discuss the mysteries of the universe with you but times passing munching on nuts he studied ethans face and as he did rays wickedly amused grin softened warmed watching you grow into a man was one of the greatest pleasures of my life youve got a heart as big as your bay i hope youll trust it i want you to be happy therell be trouble coming for all of you seth hell need his family all his family ray added in a murmur then shook his head theres too much misery in the short time we spend living ethan to turn away happiness you remember to value your joys then his eyes twinkled id brace myself son your thinking times over ethan heard graces car glanced toward the road he knew without looking that his father was no longer beside him when grace saw ethan sitting on her front porch steps she wanted to lay her head on the steering wheel she wasnt sure her heart could handle yet another trip through an emotional wringer instead she climbed out of the car and went around to unstrap the sleeping aubrey from her car seat with aubreys head heavy on her shoulder she walked to the house and watched ethan unfold his long legs and rise im not willing to go through another round with you ethan i brought your purse by you left it at the house startled she frowned when he held it out to her it showed just how jumbled her mind had been that she hadnt even realized shed been without it thank you i need to talk to you grace im sorry i have to put aubrey to bed ill wait i said im not willing to talk about this again i said i need to talk to you ill wait then you can just wait until im good and ready she told him and sailed into the house it appeared she hadnt quite gotten down to mildly irritated he decided but he sat again and he waited she took her time stripping aubrey down to her training pants covering her with a soft sheet tidying the bedroom she went into the kitchen and poured herself a glass of lemonade she didnt want but she drank every drop of it she could see him through the screen door sitting on the steps for a moment she considered simply going to the door closing it and tossing the bolt to make her point but she discovered she didnt have quite enough mad left to be that petty she opened the screen let it close quietly is she down for the night yes shes had a long day so have i i hope this wont take long i guess it doesnt have to i want to tell you im sorry for hurting you for making you unhappy since she didnt come down and join him on the steps he stood and turned to her i went about it wrong and i wasnt honest with you i should have been i dont doubt youre sorry ethan she walked to the rail leaned out looked over her little patch of yard i dont know if we can be friends the way we were before i know its hard to be at odds with someone you care about i made up with my father tonight did you he stepped forward then stopped because shed shifted away just a little just enough to tell him he no longer had the right to touch im glad i suppose i have you to thank for it if i hadnt been so mad at you i wouldnt have let myself be mad at him and get everything out im grateful for that and i appreciate your apology now im tired so you said a lot of things to me today she wasnt going to brush him off until hed finished yes i did she shifted again met his gaze straight on some of it was right but not all not acting on how i felt about you before√¢ its the way it had to be because you say so because you couldnt have been more than fourteen when i started loving you and wanting you i was close to eight years older i was a man when you were still a girl it would have been wrong to touch you then maybe i waited too long he stopped shook his head i did wait too long but id had time to think it through and id promised myself i wouldnt get you tangled up with me you were the only one who i wanted enough that it mattered part of it was for me because i knew if i ever had you i wouldnt want to let you go and youd already decided that you would id decided that i was going to live my life pretty much alone i was managing that well enough until recently you see it as a noble sacrifice i see it as ignorance she lifted her hands knowing she was heating up again i guess wed better leave it at that you know damn well that if we were to get married youd want more children yes i would and while ill never agree with your reasoning for not making them together there are other ways to make a family you of all people should know we could have adopted children he stared at her you√¢ i figured youd want to get pregnant you figured right i would want it because i would treasure your child living inside me and knowing you were there with us but that doesnt mean i couldnt find another way what if i couldnt have children ethan what if we were in love and planning to be married and we found out i couldnt have babies would you stop loving me because of it would you tell me you couldnt marry me no of course not thats thats not love she finished but its not a matter of cant its a matter of wont and i could have tried to understand your feelings if you hadnt kept them from me if you hadnt turned me away when all i wanted was to help you and i wont compromise on everything i wont be with a man who doesnt respect my feelings and who wont share his problems with me i wont be with a man who doesnt love me enough to stay to make a promise to me to grow old with me and to be a father to my child and i wont spend my life having an affair with you and then having to explain to my daughter why you didnt love and respect me enough to marry me she stepped toward the door dont he shut his eyes fought down panic dont turn away from me grace im not doing the turning away dont you see ethan youve been doing the turning away all along ive ended up right back where i started looking at you needing you im never going to be able to stop now i made so many promises to myself about you i keep breaking them i let her put her hands on this too he said slowly i let her put her mark on what we have i want to clear that mark away if you give me the chance he lifted his shoulders ive been doing some thinking she nearly smiled well theres news do you want to hear what im thinking now following instinct listening to his heart he started up the stairs im thinking its always been you grace and only you its always going to be you and only you i cant help it if i want to take care of you it doesnt mean i think youre weak its only because youre precious to me ethan he would make her give in she knew it dont and im thinking im not going to be able to give you the chance to live without me after all he took her hands holding them when she tried to tug them free and keeping his eyes on hers he drew her out and down the steps to catch the last gilded light of the setting sun ill never let you down he told her ill never stop needing you to stand beside me you make me happy grace i havent valued that enough but i will from now on i love you he touched his lips to her brow when she trembled the suns setting you said that was the best time for daydreams maybe its the best time to pick the dream you want to

answer and overcome with gratitude he brought her hands to his lips will you give aubrey to me let me give her my name let me be her father tears began to swim in her eyes she willed them back she wanted to see him clearly as he stood watching her with his face so serious lit by the last quiet light of the day you know not yet he murmured and this time touched his lips to hers theres one more will you have my children grace he saw the tears shed been struggling to hold back spill over and wondered that he could ever have thought to deny them both that joy that right that promise make a life with me one that comes from love one that i can watch grow in you only a fool would believe that what comes from what we have together would be anything but beautiful she framed his face with her

build it with you her lips curved slowly ill marry you ethan ill give you my daughter ill make children with you and well take care of each other he drew her close just to hold while the sun slipped away and the light shimmered into evening her heart beat quick and light against his her single quiet sigh echoed seconds before the whippoorwill began to sing in the plum tree next door i was afraid you werent going to be able to forgive me so was i then i figured hell she loves me too much i can get around her the laugh rumbled out as he nuzzled her throat youre not the only one who can reel somebody in like a damn rockfish took you long enough to bait the hook if you take your time about things you end up with the best at the end of the day he buried his face in her hair wanting the scent and the texture now ive got the best good solid stoneware laughing she leaned back so she could see his eyes the humor there she thought was aimed at both of them youre a smart man ethan few

up for one soft kiss in a little while turn the page for a preview of inner harbor nora robertss trilogy about the lives and loves of three brothers continues with a captivating new novel√¢ phillip quinn would always remember the generosity of the couple who took him in and gave him a second chance at life and he vowed to keep his promise to his father by helping to raise young seth even through the difficult times the quinn family had never been so strong until phillip falls in love with a beautiful woman who holds a secret that could destroy everything√¢ phillip quinn died at the age of thirteen since the overworked and underpaid staff at the baltimore city hospital emergency room zapped him back in less than ninety seconds he wasnt dead very long as far as he was concerned it was plenty long enough what had killed him briefly was twocaliber bullets pumped out of a saturday night special shoved through the open window of a stolen toyota celica the finger on the trigger had belonged to a close personal friend or as near to a close personal friend as a thirteenyearold thief could claim on baltimores bad streets the bullets missed his heart not by much but in later years phillip considered it just far enough that heart young and strong if sadly jaded continued to beat as he lay his blood pouring out over the used condoms and crack vials in the stinking gutter on the corner of fayette and paca the pain was obscene like sharp burning icicles stabbing into his chest but that grinning pain refused to take him under into the release of unconsciousness he lay awake and aware hearing the screams of other victims or bystanders the squeal of brakes the revving engines and his own ragged and rapid breathing hed just fenced a small haul of electronics that he stole from a thirdstory walkup less than four blocks away with two hundred fifty dollars in his pocket he had swaggered down to score a dime bag to help him get through the night since hed just been sprung from ninety days in juvie for another b and e that hadnt gone quite so smoothly he was out of the loop and out of cash now it appeared he was out of luck later he would remember thinking shit oh shit this hurts but he couldnt seem to wrap his mind around another thought hed gotten in the way he knew that the bullets werent meant for him in particular hed caught a glimpse of the gang colors in that frozen three seconds before the gun had fired his own colors when he bothered to associate himself with one of the gangs who roamed the streets and alleys of the city if he hadnt just popped out of the system he wouldnt have been on that corner at that moment he would have been warned to stay clear and he wouldnt be sprawled on the street staring into the dirty mouth of the gutter while his lifeblood pumped out of him lights flashed blue red white dully he watched them turn the gutter trash into bright nasty gifts the scream of sirens pierced through human screams cops even through the slick haze of pain his instinct was to run in his mind he sprang up young agile streetsmart and melted into the shadows but even at the effort of the thought cold sweat slid down his face he felt a hand on his shoulder fingers probing until they reached the thready pulse in his throat this ones breathing get the paramedics over here someone turned him over the pain was unspeakable but he couldnt release the scream that ripped through his head he saw faces swimming over him the hard eyes of the cop the grim ones of the medical technician red blue and white lights burning his eyes someone wept in high keening sobs hang in there kid why he wanted to ask why it hurt to be there he was never going to escape as hed once promised himself he would what was left of his life was running red into the gutter what had come before was only ugliness what was now was only pain what was the damn point he went away for a while sinking down below the pain where the world was a dark and dingy red from somewhere outside that world came the shriek of the sirens the pressure on his chest the speeding motion of the ambulance then lights again bright white to seer his closed lids and he was flying while voices shouted on all sides of him bullet wounds chest bps eighty over fifty and falling pulse thready and rapid in and out pupils are good type and crossmatch we need pictures on three one two three his body seemed to jerk up then down he no longer cared even the dingy red was going gray a tube was pushing its way down his throat and he didnt bother to try to cough it out he barely felt it barely felt anything and thanked god for it bps dropping were losing him ive been lost a long time he thought with vague interest he watched them half a dozen greensuited people in a small room where a tall blond boy lay on a table blood was everywhere his blood he realized he was on that table with his chest torn open he looked down at himself with detached sympathy no more pain now and the quiet sense of relief nearly made him smile he floated higher until the scene below took on a pearly sheen and the sounds were nothing but echoes the pain tore through him an abrupt shock that jerked the body on the table sucked him back his struggle to pull away was brief and fruitless he was inside again feeling again lost again the next thing he knew he was riding in a drughazed blur someone was snoring the room was dark and the bed narrow and hard a backwash of light filtered through a pane of glass that was spotted with fingerprints machines beeped and sucked monotonously wanting only to escape the sounds he rolled back under he was in and out for two days he was very lucky thats what they told him there was a pretty nurse with tired eyes and a doctor with graying hair and thin lips he wasnt ready to believe them not when he was too weak to lift his head not when the hideous pain swarmed back into him every two hours like clockwork when the two cops came in he was awake and the pain was smothered under a few layers of morphine he made them as cops at a glance his instincts werent so dulled that he didnt recognize the walk the shoes the eyes he didnt need the identification they flashed at him gotta smoke phillip asked it of everyone who passed through he had a lowgrade desperation for nicotine even though he doubted he could manage to suck on a cigarette youre too young to smoke the first cop pasted on an avuncular smile and stationed himself on one side of the bed the good cop phillip thought wearily im getting older every minute youre lucky to be alive the second cop kept his face hard as he pulled out a notebook and the bad cop phillip decided he was nearly amused thats what they keep telling me so what the hell happened you tell us bad cop poised his pencil over a page of his book i got the shit shot out of me what were you doing on the street i think i was going home hed already decided how to play it he let his eyes close i cant remember exactly id been√¢ at the movies he made it a question opening his eyes he could see that bad cop wasnt going to buy it but what could they do what movie did you see who were you with look i dont know its all messed up one minute i was walking the next i was facedown in the street just tell us what you remember good cop laid a hand on phillips shoulder take your time it happened fast i heard shots it must have been shots somebody was screaming and it was like something exploded in my chest that much was pretty close to truth did you see a car did you see the shooter both were etched like acid on steel in his brain i think i saw a car dark color a flash you belong to the flames phillip shifted his gaze to bad cop i hang with them sometimes three of the bodies we scraped off the street were members of the tribe they werent as lucky as you the flames and the tribe have a lot of bad blood between them so ive heard you took two bullets phil good cop settled his face into concerned lines another inch either way youd have been dead before you hit the pavement you look like a smart kid a smart kid doesnt fool himself into believing he needs to be loyal to assholes i didnt see anything it wasnt loyalty it was survival if he rolled over he was dead you had over two hundred in your wallet phillip shrugged then regretted it as the movement stirred up the ghosts of pain yeah well maybe i can pay my bill here at the hilton dont smartmouth me you little punk bad cop leaned over the bed i see your kind every fucking day not out of the system twenty hours before you end up bleeding your guts into a gutter phillip didnt flinch is getting shot a violation of my parole whered you get the money i dont remember you were down in drug city to score did you find any drugs on me maybe we did you wouldnt remember would you good one phillip mused i could sure as hell use some now ease off a little good cop shifted his feet look son you cooperate and well play square with you youve been in and out of the system enough to know how it works if the system worked i wouldnt be here would i you cant do anything to me that hasnt been done for christs sake if id known something was going down i wouldnt have been there the sudden disturbance out in the hall took the cops attention away phillip merely closed his eyes he recognized the voice raised in bitter fury stoned was his first and last thought and when she stumbled into the room he opened his eyes and saw hed been right on target shed dressed up for the visit he noted her yellow hair was teased and sprayed into submission and shed put on full makeup under it she might have been a pretty woman but the mask was hard and tough her body was good it was what kept her in business strippers who moonlight as hookers need a good package shed poured on a halter and jeans and clicked her way over to the bed on threeinch heels who the hell do you thinks gonna pay for this youre nothing but trouble hi ma nice to see you too dont you sass me i got cops coming to the door cause of you im sick of it she flashed a look at the men on either side of the bed like her son she recognized cops hes almost fourteen years old im done with him he aint coming back on me this time i aint having cops and social workers breathing down my neck anymore she flicked off the nurse who hustled in to grab her arm and leaned over the bed why the hell didnt you just die i dont know phillip said calmly i tried youve never been any good she hissed at good cop when he pulled her back never been any damn good dont you come around looking for a place to stay when you get out of here she shouted as she was dragged out of the room im done with you phillip waited listening to her swearing shouting demanding papers to sign to get him out of her life then he looked up at bad cop you think you can scare me i live with that nothings worse than living with that two days later strangers came into the room the man was huge with blue eyes bright in a wide face the woman had a face full of freckles and wild red hair that escaped from a messy knot at the nape of her neck the woman took his chart from the foot of the bed scanned it then tapped it against her palm hello phillip im dr stella quinn this is my husband ray yeah so ray pulled a chair up to the side of the bed sat down with a sigh of pleasure he angled his head studied phillip briefly youve got yourself in a hell of a mess here havent you want to get out of it converted by an unregistered version of detagger visit http wwwjafsoftcom detagger
