the siege of eternity before the world was going about its everyday business when something happened that was quite strange for one part of the world that everyday business it was going about amounted to nothing more than watching its television screens some of the worlds people gazed at a prizefight in kenya some watched cop shows and soap operas in the americas a tiny fraction sat somnolent before the finals of the english national snooker matches when those programs were interrupted for a news bulletin that part of the world was seriously annoyed the bulletin that interrupted their programs quickly made the viewers forgive the annoyanceat least it did for that fraction of those viewers who believed it was real the bulletin said that a genuine message from space had been received on a seldom used radio frequency most of the message was indecipherable a small portion was easier to decode and it turned out to be a crude form of video before long the simple animated drawing it displayed filled all the worlds screens the animated sequence started with a dark screen except for one tiny pinpoint of intense brilliance then that spot exploded smaller less brilliant spots of light flew in all directions that runaway expansion gradually slowed then it stopped entirely and reversed itself as all the spots first slowly at increasing velocity fell back to the center of the screen that was it that was all there was as entertainment it was pretty poor stuff but after all it did come from some offearth source the people at the radio telescopes sure of that so the scientists and the newsmakers began to try to figure out what the cartoon meant their best guess was that it represented a condensed account of the life of the universe beginning in the big bang expanding as far as that original impetus would carry it then recollapsing into the big crunch as everything fell back together again so said the pundits but not even they could think of any good reason why some extraterrestrials would want to tell the human world about it however that wasnt the end of it a few months later there was another of the same this one was somewhat more interesting too it had people in itwell sort of people at least though they were not in any way human ones this second message ran a little longer than the first it started with that same old birthanddeathoftheuniverse bit only this time a figure then appeared the figure looked either comical or terrifying depending on how seriously you took it the creature depicted was as skinny as a scarecrow and it had a head with a wide toothed mouth that grinned like a halloween pumpkin its hands were a forest of fingers at least a dozen of them on each side each digit ended in a menacingly sharp talon and what the creature was doing with them was pitilessly crushing the bright coal that had been the universe it wasnt alone either around it appeared seven other smaller figures each one uglier than the next one had a beard one had a stupid smile one had halfclosed eyes all were perfectly hideous by the standards of any ethnic group on earth that was it a moment later the picture winked out all that was left was the attempts of the worlds savants to figure out what it was all about some people especially the people who made their living as the worlds standup comics took it to be a joke it didnt take some of the comedians very long to identify the scarecrow as the one from oz and not much longer than that to give identities to the seven others they mixed up their childrens classics to be sure but the one with the beard they called doc the dumbly smiling one dopey the drowsyeyed one sleepy why they were the seven ugly space dwarfs though there was no snow white anywhere to be found not everyone was amused the worlds terrorist crazies were getting particularly active around then and some people thought the message might have something to do w tft that others took it to be a warning of some modernday armageddon about to happen or perhaps an advance notice of the second coming of christ it wasnt any of those things though as it turned out it was a whole lot worse chapter one uptown traffic was terrible and there was an abandoned vehicle on the henry hudson elway at sixtyfirst street that everybody was afraid to approach until the bomb squad got there colonel morriseys driver had to detour all the way over to broadway it was snowing enough to slow everyone down and the traffic went from terrible to worse am traffic advisory the new jersey turnpike is mined between exits and southbound one lane is open during mineremoval activities an abandoned car presumed boobytrapped is in the northbound henry hudson elevated highway at sixtyfirst street and traffic is diverted the lennilenape ghost dance revengers have declared a freefire zone within four hundred meters of the world trade center from to pm today no other warnings currently in effect fortunately they wouldnt be coming back that way because a plane would be waiting near the yacht basin on the river but the woman who was on her way to arrest or rearrest her favorite agent was getting shorttempered her name was hilda jeanne morrisey she had kept that name unchanged all her life even through her two marriagesboth of them brief ancient and pretty damn stupid since there were so many less troublesome ways of having sex hilda morrisey stood a hundred and sixty centimeters tall and weighed fifty kilograms give or take a kilo or so that weight also had not changed since her longago days as a police cadet although it was true that it seemed to take more and more effort to keep it so her rank in the national bureau of investigation was full colonel it had taken a lot of work on her part to keep that unchanged too colonel morrisey was long overdue for the promotion that the bureaus higher brass kept trying to force on her the thing about that promotion wasnt that hilda morrisey objected to either the higher pay or the higher rank what she minded was the consequences being promoted one step higher would automatically move her to a desk in the nbi headquarters in arlington virginia and hilda hated desk jobs the place where she felt at home was in a communications truck in say nebraska commanding a raid on their radright religious militias or flying high over the sea of marmara to listen to the furtive coded reports of the agent she had run into the kurdish command post somewhere on the slopes of mt ararat or for that matter her present assignment in new york which was recruiting bilingual japaneseamericans to penetrate the car factories in osaka who were apparently violating the trade agreements by using new guineamade parts in their allegedly alljapanese cars anywhere in short but in a desk job a brigadiers star was hers by right of seniority but accepting it would cost her all those fun jobs true bureau policy was up or out but not for hilda she had been beating that rule for years when the personnel people got too antsy about her status they always had to buck the question up to the director himself who always said hilda wont take up and shes just too damn good for out give the silly bitch another waiver and they always did the other thing about colonel hilda was that even at nevermindhowold she was still a pretty neatlooking womanwhich is to say one who had very little trouble in attracting any man who attracted her like for instance the man friend of the moment wilbur carmichael whoonce this distasteful job was completeshe had every intention of giving a call that evening but the other thing about those jobs she liked so well was that every once in a while they had a bad spot like the present one which required her to do something she really hated namely to arrestor rearrestone of her own when they reached the corner of jim daniel dannermans block sergeant mcevoy had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting the overflow from a minor riot going on two sidewalk vendors were having an argument in the snow it had got violent punches were being thrown and one of them had overturned the others tray of inflationbeating collectibles tarot cards and genuine guaranteed simulated confederate currency were all over the sludgy grayblack snow at the curb the bystanders had joined in and two street cops were doing their best to cool everybody down when they caught sight of master sergeant mcevoys uniform they hastily cleared a path for the bureau van in front of dannermans apartment building hilda unbuckled herself and looked over at the sergeant target status sergeant mcevoy already had his head down over his instrument panel hes back in his room he got himself one of those gyro sandwiches at the place on the corner and took it back to his room to eat i hope he eats fast hilda said stepping out into wet slush a little man was waddling hastily toward her he wore a fleece jacket a wool cap and an armband that said neighborhood watch and he was shaking of all things a golf club at her a golf club obviously one of those nuts who had some sort of airyfairy objection to carrying a gun like everybody else he was belligerent enough for anybody though move it lady he barked no doubleparking today you got to leave room for the plows to get through then as he caught sight of the sergeant stepping out of the other side of the van sergeant horace mcevoy in full federal police force uniform big as a house and with his hand on the butt of his shotgun the man added oh he didnt look impressed he just looked surly but he backed out of the way as hilda got out of the elevator on dannermans floor she saw the landlady peeking at her out of one of the rooms clearly the woman recognized hilda morrisey she didnt say anything though she was looking surly too the colonel let herself into dannermans room with her own key and caught him in the act of taking off his wet socks he was sober if unshaved he didnt look like the agent she had commanded through a dozen tough assignments but then no one could look like an agent when he was wearing a housearrest radio collar oh shit hilda he said wearily but unsurprised dont you ever knock i couldve been doing something private you dont have anything private anymore danno she told him did you sign that release yet he touched his spy collar you know damn well that i didnt she nodded since it was the truth but only said then put your socks back on they want you in arlington you can eat your lunch on the plane dannerman didnt ask any questionsnot in his room not in the car that took them to the vtol pad by the river not on the way to arlington he chewed away at his cold and congealing lamb sandwich with full attention he didnt even ask for anything to drink with it when the sandwich was all swallowed and its paper wrappings neatly stowed in the seat back dannerman closed his eyes he kept them that way until the plane circled the washington monument preparing to set down at the bureaus pad across the potomac colonel morrisey approved it was precisely the way she would have comported herself if unimaginably she had ever found herself in his position hilda morrisey was as fond of dannerman as she ever let herself get of any of the field agents she was charged to run she certainly didnt spoil them but they werewellfamily as long as they remembered that she was the head of their family with the power to punish or occasionally reward hilda gave them her unflinching support and even a little bit of as much as she had to give in the way of affection dannerman now had had quite a lot of both the man was often a pain in the ass and irritatingly likely to go off on tangents of his own and at such times he needed to be brought back in line but he generally got the job done hildas affection for dan dannerman wasnt sexual at least it wasnt exactly sexual though at rare times when she had nothing better to do she had let herself daydream a little about danno as a stud she certainly wasnt sexually jealous of him she knew that he was currently banging some actress in that little theater group in coney island he played around with plus god knew how many other previous women now and then when he was out in the fieldwell god knew but he wasnt the only one who knew so did hilda because it was her business to know that sort of thing she had sometimes even felt a little hostility toward the other women she knew dannerman bedded like that kraut terrorist bimbo who had put him in the hospital hilda had to admit shed enjoyed putting the cuffs on that one federal reserve inflation bulletin the morning recommended price adjustment for inflation is set at reflecting an annualized rate of federal reserve chairman walter c boettger predicts continuing moderation in the inflation rate for the next sixty days but it didnt pay to think that way about dan dannerman not only could she not afford to get sexually involved with anyone in that much deep shit but he was her property the bureau had strict rules about that and so did she dannerman opened his eyes at last when the sound of the planes engines changed they were switching to hover mode they had arrived while the plane was depositing itself on the landing pad by the threestory structure that was the visible part of the bureaus headquarters hilda peered outside three people were waiting in the cold drizzle it wasnt until they were out of the aircraft and sergeant mcevoy and the two headquarters guards were hustling dannerman away that hilda realized that the third of the waiting men his face obscured by the rain hood was deputy director marcus pell himself pell didnt offer to shake hands and colonel morrisey didnt bother to salute good to see you again sir she said electing to be a little more deferential than usual now unless youve got something you need me here for i guess ill just catch the return flight he gave her the smile she specially disliked the one that said he was about to give her an order she didnt want to hear not today hilda i want you to sit in on the ananias team briefing before we interrogate your boy again sir ive got this japanese carparts thing screw the japanese car parts dont look so unhappy weve got some lunch for you if you havent eaten yet fine lets go there was no use arguing but she hesitated what about dannerman well what about dannerman he can sweat for a while do him good the operation ananias team had expanded since the last time hilda visited arlington a dozen people waited in the deputy directors private briefing room half of them strangers as promised there was a small salad and a plate of sandwiches at each place on the blondoak table and big ceramic coffee jugs scattered handily about some people were eating and that was good enough for her as soon as she was seated she began to follow their example the deputy director in no hurry to get started was thoughtfully sipping at a cup of coffee while keying through his notepad the men and women around the table were murmuring to each other or staring into spaceexcept for the woman across the table who was signaling for hildas attention it was pells vice deputy daisy fennell she was pretending to scribble with one hand on the palm of the other looking at hilda with a questioningly raised eyebrow hilda got the message she shook her head no dannerman hadnt signed fennell pantomimed a sigh of resignation and went back to her own notepad hilda chewed methodically as she sorted out the people on the team the screen idd the civilians at the table for her and the bureau personnel were mostly easy daisy fennel two of the staff psychologists the elderly asian woman who was in charge of electronic operations that left one she couldnt quite place a bureau man she was sure but what was his specialty she got no help from marcus pell either as he refilled his coffee cup he said might as well get going all you bureau people know each other of course and i guess the rest of you have introduced yourselves around already the colonel here is hilda morrisey who has been agent dannermans keeper hilda this is dr xiangli hou from the naval observatory and went around the table repeating what the screen had already said the stout black woman in the paisley dress turned out to be a cerebrospinal surgeon from walter reed the two youngish women with the careworn looks were legislative liaison from respectively the senate and the house and one of them surprisingly had her senator sitting next to her alicia piombero the black woman from georgia the aggressively trimlooking man with the obvious hair transplant was a brigadier general from the pentagon the one who looked like a prosperous corporation lawyer was was some kind of a lawyer at least though his specialty wasnt given he wasnt a badlooking man though he might almost have been a somewhat older edition of wilbur carmichael whom hilda glanced at her watchif this damn meeting ever got itself over with she might still get a chance to see that evening she looked up at pell as he finished so now we all knew each oilier and id like to thank all of you from outside the bureau for volunteering your time toi beg your pardon dr evergood morning report to all national bureau of investigation units subject current terrorist alerts welsh nationalist dawid ap llewellyn sought in connection with the british museum firebombing has been reported in mexico city presumed en route to a united states destination scotland yard requests bureau assistance in apprehending this fugitive the rocky mountain militia command deadline for amnesty for convicted assassins in federal custody expired at midnight the threatened release of anthrax agents in the missoula montana water supply has not occurred but emergency measures are still in force all standing alerts remain in effect the surgeon had raised her hand i said who volunteered it was put to me as an order which makes us even more grateful to you dr evergood the deputy director said smiling tolerantly what were here for is a matter that urgently affects the national interest you probably know some of the background but im going to ask vice deputy fennell to fill in some of the details daisy the vice deputy didnt miss a beat you all remember the messages from space that came in two years ago many people thought they were a hoax a few did not one of those was an astronomer named dr patrice adcock head of the dannerman observatory in new york city who believed they came from an abandoned astronomical satellite called starlab dr adcock by the way is on the premises and you will be seeing her later hilda suppressed a grin as she translated for herself what on the premises meant of course was in one of our confinement cells daisy fennel was as slick as the deputy director himself she had come a long way since she was hildas own field manager back when hilda was a junior agent and the quarry of the moment was the man who had placed a bomb in the smithsonian and daisy hadnt aged very much in the process she hadnt gained a gram and hilda observed hadnt touched her sandwiches either dr adcock the vd was going on discovered some astronomical evidence that an unidentified object had entered our solar system and conjectured that it had dropped a probe which attached itself to the starlab satellite she glanced at the man from the naval observatory dr hou the astronomer stirred himself yes at mr pells request i made a study of that cometlike object the data are sparse but consistent with what you just described although i saw no probe being dropped neither did dr adcock daisy agreed but she came to believe that one had been and that there might be some sort of extraterrestrial technology on starlab so she asked the space agency to provide her with a spacecraft to visit the satellite ostensibly with the purpose of repairing it and putting it back in service she believed she had the right under the original contract when starlab was launched the space agency was unable to grant her request the translation of that hilda knew was we leaned on them to slow her down until we found out what the hell she was up to because among other reasons no american space pilots were available however dr adcock recruited two other pilots one was a floridian general martin delasquez the other a chinese national commander james pengtsu lin she obtained a court order requiring the agency to provide a clipper spacecraft to carry out the mission in addition to herself and the two pilots she had obtained the services of a ukrainian national dr rosaleen artzybachova an instrument specialist who had helped design starlab in the first place dr artzybachova was to go along to study starlabs present instrumentation the vd paused at this point she said the bureau had become aware that dr adcocks purpose was not to repair the satellite but to see if there was indeed some alien technology now present on it which she conjectured might be worth a lot of money marcus pell held up his hand now that they were coming to the good part he was taking over which it damn well would be of course as well as being of great national interest to this country so we took a hand we arranged for one of our agents james daniel dannerman to go with her this is not public information and i caution you all not to discuss it with anyone outside this team go on daisy so she said the five of themadcock the two pilots artzybachova and our agentlaunched to the orbiter and came back they reported that nothing had changedno alien technologyand the satellite was not repairable and that seemed to be the end of it she looked inquiringly at the deputy director who nodded thats when it got hairy he said dr artzybachova was ill when they landed i guess because of the stress of the tripshe was actually a very old lady she returned to her home near the city of kiev ukraine and died shortly thereafter he paused to look around the table i caution you again that what you are about to hear is highly classified and not under any circumstances to be discussed except within this team starlab one of the largest and best of the worlds astronomical satellites was the property of the t cuthbert dannerman astrophysical observatory it was designed to house visiting astronomers for weeks or months at a time in the days when passenger launches to low earth orbit were merely very expensive not preposterous then it was called the dannerman orbiting astrolabthe doa for short until the last scientist to use the place a condensedmatter physicist named manfred lefrik had the bad judgment to die there by the time the automatic monitors reported to earth what had happened it was far too late to save his life and in view of the declining interest in space exploration not worth the trouble to send up a ship to rescue his body what the observatory did however was to rename the satellite starlab because they thought doa sounded too apt still some people preferred to call it the starcophagus there is an organization of ukrainian nationalists who think ukraine should be ruling russia the way it used to like a thousand years ago instead of the other way around the way they claim it is nowi dont know enough about russianukrainian history to get the details straight and dont want to actually anyway this group wants to take over russia and theyre willing to use terrorist tactics to make it happen of course thats a local matter normally the bureau wouldnt consider it an american concern but like a lot of these cockamamie terrorist groups theyve got cells here and they get a lot of their financing from ukrainianamericans so the russians asked us to lend a hand and one of our assets in place in the chicago cell passed on a report that the ukrainians had autopsied the old lady and found something weird take a look at your screens it wasnt necessary to do anything to comply the popup screens were rising again at every place and what they displayed was a sort of x ray of a human skull where skull joined spine there was a fuzzy object the size of a hazelnut this is a slice of a pet scan pell said it shows the thing the ukrainians found in dr artzybachovas head and this other one clickcomes from the head of our agent dan dannerman theres one just like it in dr patrice adcocks headand we think though we cant get at them to check in the heads of commander lin and general delasquez as well nothing like it has ever been found in the heads of anybody else weve examined just in the people that went to starlab and came back he paused there gazing amiably around the table until senator piombero couldnt contain herself any longer well what is it marcus some kind of a tumor the dd shook his head no its not a tumor we have a copy of the ukrainian report on the object they took from dr artzybachovas body its metal it does not resemble any human artifact it appears to have been implanted in them while they were on the orbiter he paused giving the group a sort of half smilenot so much a smile as the grimace of somebody who had bitten into something really foul now we come to operation ananias there seems to be a lot of lying going on both dannerman and dr adcock deny that anything of the sort happened the floridians havent been very cooperative but weve established that general delasquez denies it too we havent been able to get much out of the chinese about commander lin but what it is definitely is a piece of that extraterrestrial technology that dr adcock went looking for we want to find out why one of our senior agents is lying to us not to mention that we damn well need to know exactly what the implant thing is he glanced at his watch seemed about to add something but changed his mind theres more but lets leave it at that for the moment now we should go to the interrogation theater so you can get a look at dannerman and dr adcock yourselves chapter two with all twelve of them in it at once the elevator was pretty crowded conversation wasnt easy but that didnt stop senator piombero what im wondering marcus she said leaning past the man hilda couldnt quite remember to get the dds attention is why dont you just take the thing out of your agents head i mean surgically i certainly wouldnt want anything like that in my own head according to the flow charts the national bureau of investigation is part of the nations federalized police force but it keeps itself clear of the street cops those are the thin blue linethough noticeably thickened since the passage of the police draft lawsthat does its best to keep the peaceloving citizen from the muggers and murderers the street cops share a headquarters with the department of defense in the old pentagon the nbis headquarters is a few kilometers away in suburban arlington and it has a different mission its quarry is the transnational crooks and druggers and terrorists it has inherited its id files from the old fbi and its habits from the old cla although it chooses its agents from the police draftees the ones it picks are the cream of the crop and they know it inside the beltway the nbi that is one option yes he agreed unfortunatelywell thats your department dr evergood its not that easy the surgeon said obstinately ive studied both subjects of course the implants can be removed but they are much more complex than they appear on your screens each of the implants has a large number of fine processes that do not show up well in those images but reach deeply into many areas of the brain my opinion is that removing them might well kill the patients and at the least would almost certainly cause severe loss of much brain function i wouldnt like to take that kind of a risk if i didnt have to watching senator piombero hilda suspected the woman wouldnt be satisfied with that she wasnt she gave the surgeon a narroweyed look then turned to the deputy director maybe we can get a second opinion she suggested he looked surprised of course senator if thats what you wish but dr evergood is perhaps the best in the world at this kind of work weve been grateful to her in the past for what shes been able to do for some of our own people truly amazing results hilda repressed a shudder because shed seen some of those truly amazing results mummified corpses in lifesupport capsules looking at the world through electronic lenses and getting around in overgrown wheelchairs she did not want to think of her dan dannerman like that so you see the deputy director said sunnily as the elevator door opened now if youll go to your right well go into the pit of pain the senator persisted well then couldnt you ah secure the device the ukrainians removed from the instrument person pell looked surprised oh didnt i say they dont have it anymore the silly buggers let somebody else steal it hilda morrisey knew the pit of pain well she had watched many an interrogation from one of those seats had often enough been the interrogator down in the pit herself when the subjects were bombers tax evaders smugglers all the kinds of nasties that the bureau had to deal with it had never been like this before though the problem had never concerned ridiculous alien creatures from mars or some other preposterous place more important still the sweaty person being interrogated had never before been one of her own as the ananias team took its seats in one corner of the stands hilda saw that senior agent dannerman was already sitting on one of the straightbacked chairs he didnt seem to be doing much sweating in fact she noted with a faint hidden grin of approval he looked pretty much as though he were asleep daisy fennell said chattily its all right to talk up here they cant hear us now if youre all ready she looked at the dd he nodded she spoke into the microphone at her place down in the pit the door opened and the interrogator came in hilda didnt know the interrogator who was female young goodlooking in a severely nononsense kind of wayprobably new to the bureau headquarters she placed a hand on dannermans shoulder and said wake up i need to ask you some questions if dannerman had been asleep at all he woke quickly and completely he glanced knowingly toward the oneway mirror yawning before he said is there any coffee around no the interrogator said concisely seating herself across the table from him she plunged right in agent dannerman you are accused of filing false reports to the bureau yes i know that i didnt do it by the way i have to pee the interrogator ignored that when you returned from the starlab orbiter you reported i know what i reported pee remember i have to do it for the first time the interrogator looked uncertain i think that can wait until we finish here you reported well if you think it can wait dannerman said agreeably but it doesnt feel that way to me i think itd be better if you took me to the mens room or else i can just go in my pants the interrogator didnt scowl at him didnt look at the mirror either just got up walked stiffly to the door and summoned a male guard to escort dannerman to the toilet the deputy director was frowning hilda wasnt in fact she was feeling a faint glow of pride her agent faithful to his training was controlling the interrogation he was a good boy except she reminded herself glumly that he wasnt when dannerman was back in his chair he was more cooperative hed made his point yes hed gone to starlab looking for traces of alien presence no there hadnt been any yes he was sure of that hed said so about a hundred times now hadnt he yes he had seen that xray before he was willing to take the bureaus word that it was of his own head but what that object was he had no idea and youre aware that one just like it was found in dr rosaleen artzybachovas skull on autopsy and that it is definitely a piece of alien technology so you tell me he agreed do you think the bureaus lying to you agent dannerman has one personal trait that comes in useful to the nbi he was born rich grew up among rich people and thus had entry to circles the average nbi agent couldnt penetrate the late t cuthbert dannerman who was his uncle on his fathers side not only endowed the dannerman astrophysical observatory but had enough left over to bequeath a tidy little fortune to his two surviving relatives one of whom was dan unfortunately for dan he was in deep cover abroad when the will was probated by the time he got his hands on the money the worlds rampant inflation had shrunk it to chump change i hope not but you think im lying to you and im not hell friend you ought to know that by now your shrinks have tested me a thousand times and i always came up clean in the spectator seats hilda and most of the others looked at the pair of bureau shrinks who shrugged and nodded reluctantly i dont know why that is the interrogator agreed what it looks like is that youve found some way of beating the tests now how could i do that dannerman asked they shot me so full of drugs i was out of my head for weeks the interrogator paused then she said there is a way of settling this once and for all dr patrice dannerman ely metcalf adcock attained her position as head of the dannerman astrophysical observatory by virtue of her training as an astronomer and also because she was the niece by marriage of the late t cuthbert dannerman whose money had funded the observatory in the first place patrice adcock was luckier in her inheritance than her cousin by marriage dan dannerman she was able to transfer her legacy to inflationproof investments as soon as she received it but two divorces depleted her cash which was why she seized on the chance of riches from the starlab orbiter yes i know what that is you want to cut my head open so you can get a good look at that thing thats right theres a release form right in front of you if youll just sign it no i cant do that dannerman said apologetically i wish i could help but i hear that the operation could turn me into a vegetable maybe could no one knows for sure not until they open you up and get a look im sorry thats not good enough im not signing you dont have a choice she said the deputy director is ordering you to sign the release well thats different dannerman said cheerfully let him give it to me in writing and then let me give a copy of it to my lawyer and then well see that was enough for the deputy director i think weve heard enough from agent dannerman he said to the room in general then spoke into his microphone as the interrogator hearing terminated the interrogation and took dannerman out of the pit dr marsha evergood raised her hand mr pell you understand i cant undertake the operation without his consent pell said heartily naturally no one in the bureau would ask you to dr evergood but if he wont sign i give you my word that you wont have to pick up a scalpel until you have his signature on the release form now theyll be bringing dr adcock in signature signature hilda thought cudgeling her memory there was something about signatures down in the pit they were bringing the adcock woman in but hilda wasnt looking at her she was looking at the other bureau man tardily remembering where she had seen him before he was the man whod replaced old willy godden when he retired as chief of documents the branch of the bureau which was in the business of providing you with any papers and any signatures you might happen to want chapter three as senior agent dan dannerman currently on administrative leave left the pit of pain his interrogator cozily took his arm im sorry about all this agent dannerman she said looking up at him with large eyes and an apologetic smile but i guess you know how it is still want that coffee why dont you wait in the conference room here and ill get it for you fine he said but he was already talking to the door she had closed behind him and when he tried it it was locked he had expected no less the conference roomcall it the holding cell because that was what it wasoffered him a choice of two backless benches to sit on both bolted to the floor he chose neither he perched on the edge of the table between them idly examining its surface the thing was undoubtedly packed with electronics lacking a pass card there was no easy way for him to get at them though and in any case what would be the use this wasnt some crime gang that was holding him it was his own bureauwhat had been his own bureau anyway until all this preposterous crap hit the fan that was what was very wrong with the way things were going for dan dannerman under other circumstances he would have known what to dowhat to try to do anyway maybe try to get into the tables electronic resources maybe position himself by the door to coldcock this young woman when she came back with the coffee maybe try to rid himself of the collar that made any escape attempt useless maybe well hed been trained for almost everything that could happen to a bureau agent in the field but never for this sooner than he expected the interrogator was back juggling a little tray in one hand carefully closing the door again behind her there were two cups on the tray when dannerman had taken his and seated himself she sat down on the bench across from him with the other and became conversational like i say im sorry to meet you this way agent dannerman i do know who you are and i only wish i had your record im merla tepp he nodded slightly amused she was being the good cop she wasnt bad at the job either although she dressed for nononsense business shed allowed herself a hint of perfume and the makeup and all in all she was quite an attractive young woman so he said sociably can i go home now you mean back to new york i dont know im waiting for orders was i rough on you in there you were doing your job thanks for taking it that way agent dannerman this is my first week in headquarters and i get the jobs nobody else wants you know how it is that was too obvious to require a response so he didnt try to make one the woman sipped her coffee gazing at him over the rim of the cup she wasnt being flirtatious exactly confiding maybe she said do you mind if i ask you a question why dont you want to sign that release that was pretty obvious too he said it anyway because it might kill me well yes she admitted i cant blame you for that but dont you want to know what that thing is what does it feel like anyway what did it feel like it felt like nothing at all he hadnt felt it being put in hadnt known it was there at all until without warning the damn bureau pickup squad had scooped him up and hustled him in for examination and ever since then theyd asked him the same damn questions over and over again just like this little jumpedup cadet who was after all young and rather pretty and would have been more so if shed let herself look girly instead of efficient and it had been a long time since hed seen his own girl so all he said was i cant feel it whats this theyve detailed you to soften me up she looked at him quizzically over her coffee cup do you think i could when colonel morrisey and deputy director pell couldnt but we wont talk about it if you dont want to she leaned back against the wall trying to get comfortable sorry about these benches do you want to talk at all or should i just shut up like you could tell me about some of your missions or you could tell me about yours he suggested beginning to feel amusement mine arent very interesting they had me infiltrating some of the radical religiousmilitia groups in the southwest we cleaned up one little bomb factory but it was taking a long time and that wasnt getting me any promotions so i applied for a tour here so youre a career agent i guess so she said finishing the last of her coffee i was in protsy in college and they called me up for active duty the police reserve officers training corps dannerman grinned in spite of himself me too she said doubtfully well maybe it was a little different for me see my parents were very religious i grew up in a fundamentalist group and the bureau needed somebody who could get inside some of them so the machines kicked my name out but i guess ill stay in the bureau it isnt that bad and so on and so on the woman seemed to like talking about her life in the bureau dannerman let her talk it was a new and relaxing experience for him these days to be closeted with another agent when the other agent did all the talking so here i am she finished want some more coffee when human beings began to wonder if there were other intelligent races somewhere in the universe they began the seti programthe search for extraterrestrial intelligence that meant they listened for radio broadcasts from space in the expectation that they might somehow establish peaceful communication with them they did not take seriously the idea that some of those extraterrestrial intelligences might have similar programs of their own with expectations a good deal less peaceful well sure and if you could find something to eat to go along with it ill see what i can do she promised gathered up the cups and left naturally locking him in again dannerman yawned and stretched wondering absently what the bureau had in store for him next wondering what he would do if in fact the deputy director did give him a direct order in writing to sign the release he didnt think that was likely marcus pell was too sharp a bunny to put anything like that in writing especially if he thought dannerman would file it with his attorney which dannerman reflected wouldnt be all that easy since he didnt really have an attorney unless you counted the old fart of a family lawyer who had screwed up his inheritance and helped him get the job with cousin pats observatory that had led to his flight to the orbiting old starlab and thus to all this other stuff he turned as the door opened again expecting merla tepp with the coffee refills it was tepp all right but she wasnt alone she had someone with her and the someone was dannermans cousin pat i brought some company for you tepp said brightly and ive got to leave the two of you here for a bit but i found something for you to snack on and the coffees fresh cousin pat aka dr patrice adcock gave dannerman a look that was part weary and mostly just hostile as she took the bench across from him he ventured hello pat pat adcock didnt answer dannerman hadnt really expected her to she hadnt forgiven him and in a way he didnt blame her nobody liked having a bureau spook planted on them especially when the spook was a cousin they had known since childhood he fingered his collar studying her it was the first time in many weeks that he had had a good look at his cousin apart from looking tired and cranky she looked smaller than usual in her unornamented bureau prison gown mostly she just looked mad he tried again so howve you been he asked sociably she gave him an eyesnarrowed look but this time she answered shitty she said she didnt bounce the conversational ball back by asking how he was she evidently didnt care he sighed pat i know youre pissed at me but what was i supposed to do i work for the bureau the bureau wanted to know what you were up to if it hadnt been me it wouldve been somebody else sure dan but i wouldnt have trusted anybody else as much would i she was silent for a moment then said thoughtfully you just cant leave that thing alone can you he hadnt been aware that he was still fingering his collar he took his hand away at least they didnt make you wear one sure not why would they ive been in solitary confinement in this dump moodily she picked up her coffee cup which reminded dannerman to inspect the food agent tepp had brought it was an opened box of cheeseflavored crackers but still pretty full pat adcock watched him chew for a moment then asked dan do you know whats going on he shook his head his mouth full of stale crackers what was the point of that business in the interrogation theater they just asked the same questions theyve asked a million times before he shrugged chewing of course they had it was pure theater designed for the benefit of whoever was on the other side of that oneway mirror but for what reason he could not guess she fidgeted unsatisfied listen do you think the whole thing with the implants could be some kind of trick maybe there isnt really anything in our heads at all he swallowed the crackers i wish no weve got them all right i saw the images come up on the screen the first time they examined me and most of the other times too through all the teststhe x rays and the pet scans the ionicresonance tests when they bounced some kind of radiation off the back of his neck and tried to identify the chemical composition of whatever the damn thing was that had somehow unbelievably turned up in his skull anyway he said theyd have to go to a lot of trouble to fake it and what would be the point youre the spook if you dont know who would well i dont know i dont remember it ever being stuck into my head either same here she sighed they say weve all got one jimmy lin and general delasquez too they want me to sign some kind of release so they can take it out ii told them i would sign if you did and if you didnt i wouldnt dannerman blinked at her that was an indication of some kind of trust after all and he hadnt expected it from her he didnt know how to react to it either he didnt have to because pat had decided to be conversational now well anyway whatve you been doing since i saw you lasti mean before they started all this nonsense about implants hows that girl of yours she asked sociably the actress that was a downer because hed spent a lot of time wondering the same thing he confessed i dont know i havent talked to her in a while she nodded looking at him thoughtfully i uh i hear you werent in real good condition to talk to her i mean they say you were drunk most of the time that touched dannerman where he lived just for the record he said stiffly they shot me so full of their psychoactive chemicals that i was out of it for weeks i dont even remember what i was doing i see youre blaming somebody else for your behavior im not blaming im telling you what happened she didnt look convinced but she didnt argue the point he asked so talking about love interest have you got anybody special now how the hell could i anyway ive got other things on my mind not just this crap here i keep wondering whats happening at the observatory the way they came and took me awaygod knows what they told the people dannerman grinned theyre very british about that i imagine they told them you were assisting with inquiries yeah well theyre not stupid there you know and im worried you know i was having some money problems i wish i knew what was going on with my fundsoh whats this what it was was merla tepp her face was as expressionless as she could make it and what she said was sorry to interrupt people but ive been ordered to take you for a little ride the ride wasnt that little they were the better part of an hour speeding along the beltway in one of the bureaus unmarked electrovans with two burly noncoms carrying stunsticks and riot guards sitting alertly behind them at least theyd left the van windows transparent so dan and pat could look out he was a little surprised to see that it was dark theyd spent the whole day stooging around but the beltway looked like the beltway wherever it was taking you and merla tepp wasnt answering any questions where are we heading no answer whats going on here no answer who gave you the orders no real answer but at least a kind of response colonel morrisey will meet us and you can ask her when you see her but when the van at last turned into city streets one question answered itself oh shit dannerman said theyre taking us to walter reed pat blinked at him the hospital damn straight its the hospital listen tepp if you think but he never got to finish and she didnt have to answer one of the noncoms leaned forward and placed a huge hand on dannermans shoulder while the other casually unlimbered his stunstick dannerman saw the light and shut up anyway they were pulling up to a back entrance and dannerman saw hilda morrisey moodily waiting in the damp cold she wasnt answering any questions either or at least not right away no talking iliese people arent cleared she said nodding to the noncoms wait till we get you settled and then when they got out of the elevator and were herded into a small room that was a close copy of the bureaus cell she said what about it danno change your mind yet he didnt answer that and she didnt wait for him to all right she said her expression frank and openthe expression she wore when she was being most duplicitous i understand your problem i admit there are certain risks but have you ever thought of the fact that if one of you volunteered for the operation we wouldnt have to ask the other one hilda he said dangerously cut the crap whatve you got us here for neither one of us signed the consent paper no she agreed and thats too bad because it would simplify things just to go in and pull one of the gadgets out but ive got good news for both of you theres another kind of test something the lab guys have just figured out hero astronaut returns home major general martin delasquez has unexpectedly returned to florida after a tour of duty in kourou assisting the eurospace agency in preparation for a mission to the abandoned starlab satellite on arrival the general scoffed at reports in the anglo media that his tour was cut short for security reasons there is no truth to them general delasquez told reporters my task was completed so i came home thats all there is to it el diario miami hilda agent dannerman she said frostily elevating herself to the height of her rank dont give me a hard time do you understand me i understand theres something i dont like here neither pat nor i agree to any kind of surgery of course you dont youve made that clear and dr evergood certainly wont perform any without a signed consent so this isnt like that there wont be any cutting into your heads they think theres a chance they can get more dope on that thing in your skulls with some new xray thingdont ask me what it is all i know is it takes a long exposure and you cant wiggle have you eaten anything since you were in the pit a couple of crackers but thats too bad it might slow things down alarm bells went off in dannermans head does that mean we get put to sleep now how would i know that sounds plausible though doesnt it some sort of tranquilizer i think nothing big im sure of that now really hilda really danno she began her voice suddenly harsher theres no sense arguing about it im not asking for your consent im just telling you whats going to happen because you dont have any ch then she stopped in midbreath she didnt even finish the word choice her eyes went unfocused for a moment then she blinked and looked at them again you two stay here she barked and hurried out of the room pat turned wonderingly to dannerman what the hell was that all about he gave her an abstracted look what oh she got a message in her private phone he explained the little button in her ear you probably didnt even notice it what kind of message pat demanded he shook his head dan tell me whats happening here do you think theyre going to operate on us anyway they cant do it without our signatures can they dannerman considered the question thats what the law says he said and didnt add that the bureau had its ways of getting around laws and decided that if the next person through that door was carrying anything that looked like a hypodermic then that would be the nine to get physical the next person who entered wasnt carrying a needle he wasnt even hospital personnel it was deputy director marcus pell himself he nodded to dannerman and spoke to pat we havent officially met dr adcock but ive seen a good deal of you he was being courtly dannerman had no patience with that just at that moment whats going on he demanded the deputy director sighed im not sure i know he said theres been a rather surprising new development there has just been a new transmission from that satellite of yours dr adcock but theres nobody there dannerman said pat had a different reaction she caught her breath do you think its one of those funnylooking extraterrestrials not this time pell said somberly studying his agent it was from a human being dannerman he said there were a bunch of people up there in orbit he said they were going to come back to earth in the orbiters assured crew return vehicle the emergency vehicle thats supposed to i know what its supposed to do dannerman snapped yes well the funny thing about it dannerman is this guy on starlab said he was you that took dan dannerman back as nothing else had he goggled at the dd he says hes me thats what the man claims we didnt believe him of course so we checked his voiceprint and by god he was right he is chapter four colonel hilda morrisey liked orders that gave her some slack for interpretation but this time she could have wished for a little less of it the deputy directors parting order had been no more than take care of those two and stick around that was it nothing more specific especially nothing more informative and then he was gone so when dannerman demanded to know what was going on hilda could only say i dont know any more than you do wishing she did she did turn on the screen in the van so he and pat adcock could hear the bureaus recording of what the world had just heard there was no secret about that it had been a voiceonly transmission so the only picture on the screen was the legend transmission received from starlab astronomical satellite hours december then the voice spoke tinny fuzzy but definitely familiar this is james daniel dannerman calling my associates in arlington from orbit pat adcock was right except that its a lot bigger than she thought ill try to bring some samples of the stuff we were talking about with me when i come back that will be very soon assuming jimmy lin can get this assured crew return vehicle thing working and assuming that we can all fit in because there are nine ahthe voice hesitated for a momentnine persons here and we dont want to leave anybody aboard please acknowledge on this frequency that was it broadcast in clear so every son of a bitch with a radio all over the world could have been listening in and a lot of them had been is that me dannerman demanded looking from hilda to pat and when they only shrugged well what does heiwhat do they mean nine people only five of us went up there how would i know hilda asked reasonably maybe your friend artzywhatshername had quadruplets space voice may belong to us intelligence agent a retired member of the us intelligence community has identified the voice from space as belonging to national bureau of investigation agent james daniel dannerman although the source declines to be identified he states there is no damn doubt at all of the identification adding that until recently dannerman was reported to be under house arrest on unspecified charges officials of the nbi decline to comment on the report the new york times he gave her a dangerous look but all he said was play it again so they played it again and again and then they switched to a news channel to hear all the things everybody had to say about this astounding report hilda gave that five minutes then she squirmed ahead to the front seat phoning ahead to make arrangements at the headquarters then she just sat there the dead phone to her ear because she had nothing to say to either pat or dan and didnt want to hear any more of their questions there was one good thing she thought there was at least a temporary hold to the dds little plan to anesthetize dannerman and adcock and then blandly hand dr evergood the impeccably best signed release the skilled forgers of documents could produce maybe that hold would be permanent maybe even this baffling new development was going to confirm what hilda had always known in her heart her own dan dannerman simply could not possibly have been turned or subverted oh sure the evidence had looked pretty bad but that just meant the evidence had to be wrong there had to be some other explanation now it appeared that there was onewell sort of an explanation anywaybut who was going to explain this wholly incomprehensible explanation at the headquarters she wasted no time she hustled the two of them into an elevator down to the accommodations she had arranged for them you can watch the news she said or you can go to bed or you can do anything you likeexcept leave here ill see you in the morning have a heart hilda dannerman begged i want to know whats happening so do i get some sleep ive got work to do i he truth though was that she didnt everyone else did every other person she saw in the bureaus underground fortress seemed not only to have something to do but to be about thirty minutes late in getting it done and desperately trying to make up lost time but not hilda morrisey the last time she had seen the joint jumping like this had been when the presidents press secretary got himself kidnapped and murderedno she corrected herself not even then that was just an ordinary kill the only reason the bureau got involved in it at all was because the president demanded it what was going on now waswaswell what was it exactly weirdness thats what it was unthinkably preposterous weirdness but it happened to be real she couldnt find marcus pell or the director herself she couldnt even find daisy fennell they were certainly somewhere on some level of the subterranean headquarters no one seemed to know just where more likely hilda thought bitterly the ones who did know simply werent telling the topmost of the top brass were holed up somewhere dealing with this new crisis as best they could and they didnt want to be bothered with peons who would only get in the way hilda morrisey did not like being one of the peons the obvious place for them to be was the communications center that was the first place hilda looked but when she had looked in every other place she could think of she went back there at least there she could get some idea of what was happening although what was happening seemed to be only that half the population of the planet earth was asking questions that nobody here could answer there were plaintive coded queries from the bureaus field managers by the score there were beggingor pleading or sometimes demandingtransmissions from fifty or sixty of the friendlies the other national intelligence agencies with which the bureau maintained some sort of cooperative relationship then there were the heavy hitters the question from the senate and the house from state and defense from the white house itself not to mention the endless flurry of concerned citizens who somehow had learned the bureaus least classified call codes and wanted to be informed these last were the least bothersome the only answers they got didnt come from a human being they were computergenerated and all they said was regret have no further information at this time please watch your local newscasts the other queries could not be brushed off so lightly they took personal responses from some human being tending to them was what a large fraction of the bureau personnel on duty were doing with their time but though the responses were more elaborate the information they contained was about the same but the little that was different about them was interesting hilda gleaned a fact here and a hint there and slowly pieced together a picture why had there been no further transmissions from this other dan dannerman because the comm officer on duty had been bright enough and quick enough to send an instant narrowbeam order to this dannerman on the satellite telling him to shut up do nothing just wait there for further instructions and a lucky thing that for once this other dannerman had done exactly what he was told there was a quick breathy sound of surprise from the group clustered around one screen they had heard something half the comm center immediately dropped what they were doing to see what it was they had heard it was a blip one of the technicians was saying excitedly no nothing more just one quick pulse but it definitely came from starlab direct no i guess theyre somewhere out of sight in their orbit it was relayed from goldstone but it was positively hey theres another one it wasnt one it was two everyone heard them this time and the screen showed them moving slowly across the field two brightly jagged spikes so dannerman was communicating again more or less that was enough for hilda morrisey she stood up stretched yawned and walked out of the communications center she knew what had happened because it was what she would have done in the same case what the closeted big brass had been doing was trying to figure some way of arranging a twoway conversation that the rest of the world couldnt hear apparently starlab wasnt rigged for narrowcastingwell it wouldnt matter if it were reporters werent stupid and they had resources of their own undoubtedly there were forests of mobile antennae deployed all over arlington and probably all around goldstone and the station on wake and every other place where the bureau might receive a signal so they had worked out a simple code the bureau could ask a question and dannerman could answer by blipping his transmitter something like one blip yes and two blips noand maybe three blips for how the hell do you expect me to do that but you had no hope of deciphering what the answers meant unless you knew what the questions had been she glanced at her watch it would be daybreak in an hour or two and she hadnt had sleep shower or a change of clothing since she got out of the bed in her new york city apartment nearly twentyfour hours ago the lack of sleep wasnt a big problem the bureaus standardissue wakeup pills took care of it the problem was something else surreptitiously she bent her head for a quick sniff at her armpit envious of the crisp cleanliness of everyone around her she knew why that was they had all been able to take enough time off to get cleaned and changed that was the way it was when you were headquartersbased you kept spares of everything on hand in case of emergency if she were to give up the struggle and let them hand her that damned promotion but that was out of the question hilda morrisey didnt belong in this place she was a field manager she could make herself at home wherever the job took her san diego or new york berlin or karachi in those places she was the boss and as long as her teams produced results nobody got in her thinning but still bravely blond hair here she was just one of a mob of fifty or sixty people of equivalent rank with the topheavy bureau executive staff over them all here as a matter of fact if anything she was in the way but she couldnt leave not only was this whole business a puzzle that hilda morrisey didnt trust anyone but herself to solve but it was her own agent who was at the core of it if she couldnt leave sleep or bathe the next best thing was to eat she sought out the fieldgrade mess sat at a table in a corner swallowed another wakeup pill and thought the mess was usually deserted this time of nightor morning not this one there were half a dozen others at the tables and the graveyard mess shift looking aggrieved at their unusual workload was clearing up the tables that still others had left while she was waiting for someone to take her order she popped up the tables screen and coded for the news summaries when a waiter approached hilda dumped the screen and turned to give her order but what he said was excuse me colonel but theres a junior officer asking to speak to you hilda turned the person waiting at the door was the interrogator the junior agent merla tepp send her in she said and then when the woman had come to the table sit down tepp i didnt expect to see you here for another couple of hours i came in early colonel colonel im sorry to interrupt your meal but i wanted to apologize i wouldnt have given agent dannerman those crackers except i didnt know he was scheduled for surgery no you didnt hilda agreed in fact you dont know it now you especially dont want to say anything about it to agent dannerman no maam maam im pretty sure he suspected it hilda surveyed the woman im damn sure he did dannermans a fine agent just dont confirm it for him she was silent for a moment studying junior agent tepp while her fingers were absentmindedly playing with the screen keys after a moment she said actually i would have done just what you did have you eaten tepp looked surprised no but colonel this dining room is for hilda overrode her what this dining room is for is for people like me and our guests waiter well have a couple of sandwiches and saladsif its that fruity dressing put the dressing on the side she waved him away and told the girl that stuff is too damn sweet you might prefer to eat the salad plain i forgot to ask if you had any special dietary needs no ma am because god knows what the sandwiches will be she leaned back studying the girl although she knew she had never seen junior agent tepp before there was something vaguely familiar about her she couldnt place the thought and abandoned it actually she said apart from giving them the damn crackers that wasnt a bad move putting the two of them together tepp looked rueful i was hoping that if they got to talking they might say something useful did they not really colonel i have the recordings hilda waved away the notion of looking at the recordings i didnt think they would dannos too smart for that but it was worth a try means you were using a little initiative i see by your file that youve only been with the bureau for a little over a year merla tepp did not show any surprise at finding that the colonel had called her file up on the table screen thats right maam mostly in the field in new mexico after i finished training checking into the religious nut groups hilda nodded i get the impression that youve been pretty interested in religion all your life tepp hesitated you could say i was a seeker colonel i was born pentecostal then when that didnt seem to be giving me what i wanted i tried catholic then i went to shul for a yeari guess thats why you asked about dietary requirements then i tried buddhism the american radical religious right came in five main flavors there were the fundamentalists who believe in the verbal inerrancy of the christian bible the bornagains who claim a personal experience with christ the evangelicals who are either of the above plus a drive to convert others the pentecostals who are any of the above plus public demonstrations of ecstasy and the charismatics who differ from the others only in that they retain communion in a conventional protestant or catholic denomination generally speaking what the fundamentalists thought the government ought to do about the possible space aliens who might have occupied starlab was if possible to kill them because they were probably the antichrist while most of the others thought they were probably angels of some kind and what the government should be doing was arranging for them to be worshipped what they all agreed on was that everything the government actually was doing was wholly and unforgivably wrong she broke off as the sandwiches and salads arrived colonel hilda waved to her to eat doing so herself she hadnt realized quite how hungry she was with her mouth full she paused long enough to ask and now the girl grinned i guess youd say the bureaus my religion now maam hilda nodded it was a good answer it was the kind of answer she might have given herself and as a matter of fact she suddenly realied what that puzzling familiarity was all about agent tepp was just about her height just about her weight just about her general build taken all in all she was not far from a copy of what colonel morrisey had been long before she became a colonel she had nothing more to talk about so she switched the screen over to repeats of the news digests and watched them as she ate her meal another good thing about agent tepp was that she took the hint and didnt speak either when the waiter brought their coffee she said thanks for keeping me company agent tepp but i imagine you have duties here agent tepp touched a napkin to her lips yes maam can i ask you something if youre going to be on permanent duty here youll probably need an aide hilda didnt let her finish whats that about permanent duty have you been hearing latrine talk no maam its just logical i thought but if i was wrong i hope to god you were wrong hilda thought for a moment still she said i wouldnt mind thinking about having you in my command if you wanted to come to new york tepp looked disappointed thank you maam but id really like to stay at hq for a while fine now if youll excuse wait a minute it was the deputy director on her screen hilda we need that adcock woman get her down to the pit galleries so that was where hed been holed up pell didnt wait for an answer hilda started to get up just as agent tepp was doing the same saying regretfully thank you for the meal maam it was a pleasure to talk to you hilda put her hand on the womans arm maybe you can do me a favor you look like youre about my size do you keep a change of clothes here fine then lend me some clean underwear and find me a shower i can use chapter five dr patrice adcock hadnt been taken back to her cell instead they put her in a quite comfortable bedroom in a little suite that apparently was kept for vip visitors who couldnt or didnt choose to go home to sleep it had a really comfortable bed which was a nice change from the ironhard cot in her old cell for all the good it did her first she lay awake wondering just what the hell was going on now another dannerman radioing to earth from starlab when she did at last fall asleep it didnt last because that morrisey woman woke her to say the deputy director needed to talk to her right now so pat climbed wearily back into her jail uniform she let herself be conducted to where marcus pell and six or seven other people were huddled around screens and little tables littered with coffee cups and the remains of largely uneaten food and then what was it he asked her it was did starlab have facilities for something called a digitprime coordinatedchaos encryption system of course she had no idea about that whatever it was wellless patientlywho would know the answer anyone at the observatory she thought about that then shrugged maybe but they would all be asleep now for gods sake and anyway the real expert was rosaleen artzybachova who was dead and then the funny thing they all suddenly looked both surprised and relieved the deputy director manwas his name pell nodded to the morrisey woman that was the end of it the woman took pat back to her new home and left her to lie awake an hour or so longer with all the old questions and a dozen new ones to keep her from sleep so when a uniform knocked at her door and opened it a crack she woke at once good morning maam the woman said civilly its oheighthundred and you might want to get ready to see the deputy director then she closed the door without saying when the deputy director was likely to arrive or why but when pat adcock came out of her very own private bathroomanother touch of luxury complete with a full array of toiletries in their original unopened wrappingsshe made a pleasing discovery the guard must have come back while she was in the shower pats own clothesthe ones she had been arrested inwere draped over the foot of the bed cleaned and ready to put on a few minutes later dressed in something other than that jail uniform after all these long weeks and pleased about that much anyway she opened the door it led into a little sitting room with comfortable chairs and pictures on the wall and even a fireplacefake of course but a nice touch a moment later dannerman came out of his own room to join her just in time for the guard to roll in a cart loaded with breakfast dannerman gave her an appreciative grin hey nice outfit did you have a good nights sleep she didnt bother to answer that and after an uncertain moment lie turned his attention to their breakfast pat took a while longer to get to it but when she tasted the fresh ripe papaya and the cold sweet juice she dug in as well it was the best meal shed had since the police had picked her up at her observatory her observatory she wondered if it was really still hers well probably the observatory itself was still running more or less normally uncle cubbys money was still available to finance its oprations and no doubt pete schneyman or one of the other senior scientists had taken over as acting director in her absence gwen morisaki would be going right on with her cepheid counts and kit papathanassiou with his cosmological studies and all the rest of it whether she was present or not things might even be going better without her because pat had to admit her last few months at the observatory shed been a lot more interested in starlab than in doing science the other question that entered her mind was to wonder if she herself were in bankruptcy yet how united are the united nations the current imbroglio in the united nations general assembly reminds us once more of the worser consequences of the infamous resolution under this you may recall the general assembly decreed that each signatory nation was to elect one delegate to the assembly by means of popular vote this wellmeaning reform was intended to ensure that the people at large rather than some junta or clique represented each country in its deliberations the models for this were the european communitys council and more appositely the united states senate but what has been the effect rather than achieving unity the delegates now represent parochial issues and worse political parties in this parliament of man with its lamentable tendency toward passing sweeping resolutions that are meant to micromanage purely internal matters throughout the world our own delegate mr hiram singhwho it will be remembered was until recently first lord of the admiralty in the new labor party governmentis not least at fault do we really want to import the tawdry political practices of the americans to govern our planet we think not we think it is time for a thoroughgoing reconsideration of this illadvised measure financial times london the economic fact was that she had hocked just about everything she owned to raise the money for her flight to the orbiter money shouldnt have been any problem at all the government should have financed or provided the whole thing but the government hadnt so shed had to find the money herself it came to serious money too enough to bribe the floridian authorities who controlled the launch pads at the cape to hire pilots to fight the feds lawyers through the courts until reluctantly they did give in and provide a launch vehicle for her and then she had managed to get that clipper launched with the five of them in it and then and then it all went to hell dandan she said tentatively he looked up warily from his eggs benedict yeah she said slowly trying to think it through as she spoke you know whats funny dan i can remember the flight up to orbit i can remember the flight back but all i can remember of what we saw in starlab was that everything was just the way it was left when the satellite was abandoned there wasnt anything there that wasnt on the specs nothing had changed nothing had well i know that i remember remembering that when we were on our way back but i dont remember seeing it do you know what i mean he frowned well thats the way it was for me too its funny now that you mention it do you think your bureau people know why that is but he was shaking his head not those turkeys they dont know any more than we do when the door opened again the man who came in was the deputy director marcus pell he was followed by one of the uniformed cops coffee for you too sir the cop suggested coffee my ass it might be breakfast time for you but for me its lust the tail end of a long long night get us a bottle of jim beam and some glasses he turned to pat you were right dr adcock he caught her offbalance what was i right about alien technology the man said so himself the orbiters loaded with it among other things nohe held up his handi dont know exactly whose technology or how it got there were having to be careful about communicating you know all about that dr adcock thats what we got you out of bed for was i actually any help she asked curiously it didnt look that way he gave her a judicious look punctuated by a yawn sorry well you were and you werent what you did was remind us of dr artzybachova but shes dead he shook his head looking amused not anymore shes alive and well on your starlab or one of her is there are a lot of duplicate people around wouldnt you say so we sent her a narrowbeam query she didnt have anything that could make a really secure link but we worked out a code dannerman was asking the deputy director questions but pat hardly heard she was trying to get used to the idea of rosie artzybachova alive again then she remembered to ask a question why are you making such a big secret out of it he grinned at her youre asking me that the lady that bet the ranch on finding extraterrestrial technology because if any part of what this man is saying is true then theres a lot of stuff there that we want and maybe we want to keep it for ourselvesah about time he finished as the door opened and two of the uniforms came in silently they set down the whiskey some mixers glasses ice even a tray of hastily slappedtogether hors doeuvres glanced at the deputy director for permission to leave again and did pell poured himself two fingers of whiskey disdaining the ice and the mixers help yourselves he invited pat shook her head i didnt know prisoners were allowed to have liquor she said he gave her a friendly smileno she thought not really a smile of any kind of friendship it was the kind of smile you manufactured to make somebody think you were being friendly when you wanted to soften them up this was a complex and totally controlled man youre thinking about those federal charges against you bribery filing false flight plansall chickenshit of course you can forget them theyre dropped and as for you dannermanhe shruggedyour suspension is lifted too youre back on duty with full pay restored incoming dispatch spanish federal police madrid to director us national bureau of investigation most secret humint indicates probable major action by catalan separatist forces in connection with the iberian games to be held in barcelona this spring internal source states a large shipment of weaponry and explosive devices is expected from american sympathizers probably channeled through basque underground urgently request cooperation in dealing with this terrorist threat in particular in identifying and embargoing arms shipment dannerman looked wary fingering his collar what about this well the deputy director said thats a whole other thing isnt it are you sure you want it taken off dannermans expression changed now mostly puzzled why wouldnt i pells glass was empty he refilled it but this time with soda and ice and just enough whiskey to tint it lightly you know what you two have inside your skulls he said did it ever occur to you that some people might want to get their hands on those things even if they had to kill you in the process pat adcock felt a sudden chill what people why dr adcock the man said cozily i would say just about anybody including some of our own people right here in the bureau i wouldnt be surprised but dont worry about that the president himself forbade any surgical attempts so maybe youd like to keep enjoying our hospitality for a while dont you think or if youd rather go out into the world again well supply you with as much protection as we can same as weve done with danno here but there would certainly be a risk damn it dannerman said with feeling i knew i was being followed of course you did pell said smiling that warmhearted empty smile again one way of looking at it you were bait if someone wanted to snatch you wed pick him up before he could get very far dannerman was looking at him with distaste thats assuming they wanted to kidnap me alive but if they were going to have to kill me anyhow youre not thinking it through pell said reprovingly he reached out and tapped dannermans collar that thing is tough plastic and metal as long as you had that on your neck nobody could whack your head off and hustle it away before we got to them so what would be the point of killing you on the street no we figured you were pretty safe and of course there were other reasons for having you wear the collar there was always the possibility that you were dirty after all wasnt there colonel morrisey was pretty sure you werent but some people had other opinions and we had to cover all the bases dannerman said doggedly i want it off yes i thought you would well when hilda comes back ill have her take you down to the shop and theyll remove it excuse me there had been an inaudible signal pell lifted his phone to his ear he listened for quite a long time spoke brieflypat couldnt make out a wordand listened again when he was through he looked up at them well he said sounding pleasantly surprised sometimes you get lucky when you least expect it the capes socked inthunderstorms high winds the weathers going to persist for a couple of days at least so they cant land there thats good the last thing we want is to get the floridians involved in this so where will they land thats the question isnt it theyre working on it meanwhile the president has warned everybody especially the damn europeans that starlab is us property and anyone who attempts to board it risks being shot at pat stared at him blankly shot at what with pell said comfortably i always knew some of those old star wars orbiters might come in useful someday there are two of them that still have some navigation capacity theyre in the wrong part of the orbit but the guys in houston are working on moving them into position even as we speak of course the europeans and the chinese and so on know that so we can leave it alone for a while and right now the first thing were going to do is to get that party of nine down and there are some surprises there theyre not all human you see not all human thats what dannerman says yes he said a lot of other stuff toountil we told him to shut up even in code and report in full once hes landed he hesitated one thing though youre an astronomer dr adcock have you ever heard of somebody named frank tipler tipler she frowned i think i mightve heard the name he was some kind of astronomer too late twentieth century we retrieved all we could find about him from the bank but the only interesting thing was that he wrote a book once about how heaven was astronomically real oh right pat said tracking down a faint recollection i remember hearing something about himmaybe in grad school it sounded pretty silly to me what does tipler have to do with all this thats what id like to know dannermanthe other dannerman i meansaid we should look him up if i get you access to the network can you do the bureau a favor and see what you can find or dr patrice adcock the worst thing about jail was having nothing to dothis woman who had never before in her life found herself with nothing to do now things were looking up she wasnt in jail anymore and better still she had a job to do that she was good at it took pat an impatient half hours waiting to get access to bureaus databankno not the classified databank of course but to the one that accessed most of the countrys libraries then it took a while longer to get used to the bureaus procedures she found the american men of science entry for dr frank tipler quickly and began sorting through some of the sources cited she hardly noticed when dannerman was back collarless and occasionally touching his now bare neck to remind himself of the change that colonel hilda morrisey came in with him new orders dr adcock morrisey said cheerfully were all going for a little ride tonight the people from starlab are coming down and were going to meet them chapter six dan dannerman had never been in the deputy directors plane before in spite of himself he was impressed it wasnt one of those customconverted thousandseat leviathans like the presidents air force one but those few who had experienced both reported that it was just as luxurious dannerman and pat adcock were even given a private compartment of their own their little cubicle wasnt as fancy as the room colonel hilda had appropriated for her own use and certainly it was nothing like the fourroom private suite belonging to the dd himself but it definitely was not shabby it had full electronics it had cut flowers floating in a sort of fishbowl a pair of screens a call button for one of the policecadet flight attendants even two pullout beds neatly made up in case they wanted to sleep on the wayon the way to wherever they were going because neither pat nor dannerman had been given the word on where that might be dannerman had lost his sense of time somehow a whole day had got away from him all spent on waiting after the long wait time while the deputy director got his ducks in order there was the waiting for the bureaus sniffer squads to finish their routine inspectionsyou never knew where someone might sneak in a bomb it was full dark again by the time they took off dannerman saw pat cast one yearning look at the beds but then she resolutely turned her back on them she had no time to sleep because she was busy at one of the screens checking databases for information on the tipler person for the deputy director dannerman wasnt sleeping either but the reason was different the prospect of seeing this man who claimed to use his own name and spoke with his own voice had pumped him full of adrenaline he used his screen on and off sometimes to kill time by watching news summaries sometimes to try to find answers to some of the questions that inflamed his thoughts perhaps some of the answers were there but dannerman didnt have enough clearance to penetrate these particular systems he was seriously considering trying out one of the beds after all when pat made a small grunt of conditional satisfaction she sat back watching the printer squirt out hard copy did you find what you wanted dannerman asked i hope she said standing up evidently getting ready to take the printout to marcus pell its weird you can read it for yourself on the screen weird how but she was gone he shifted to her seat and scrolled the screen beginning to read dr frank tipler was a highly respected cosmologist until he published the book called the physics of immortality in it tipler predicted that the universe currently expanding sooner or later would fall back to what is called the big crunch reproducing the conditions of the big bang but in reverse at that time tipler said everyone who had ever lived anywhere in the universe would be reborn to live again as an immortal most of tiplers colleagues laughed at his idea but there were two significant groups who shared his opinion though tipler had never heard of either weird was the right word this frank tipler had published a book back in the closing years of the twentieth century it was called the physics of immortality and what it was about was tiplers theory only he didnt call it a theory he claimed it was fact and offered a hundred pages of equations to prove itthat the universe after expanding as far as it could would contract again into what he called the omega point and then some very strange things would happen the first part of it wasnt surprising that was what the messages from space had described years before the big bang and the universes expansion the recollapse into the big crunch the surprising part was the consequence that was predicted in tiplers book according to tipler at that omega point or big crunch whichever you chose to call it everybody who had ever lived would inevitably be brought to life againin perfect health at the peak of their powers and would go on living forever it was tipler said the scientific reality that underlay all the ancient human yearnings for a heaven after death dannerman scrolled the report again just to make sure he hadnt missed somethinglike the reason why this alleged other dan dannerman wanted the bureau to know about this tipler person he hadnt that was all there was that was typical of the way the bureau was run nobody told any inferior anything until they absolutely had to dannerman had a cynical theory about that it was turf protection the more information the higherups hung on to for themselves the harder it was for some lowerdown to leapfrog above them in the chain of command of course that kind of secrecy never worked for long sooner or later some one person in the know would see a tactical advantage for himself in telling dannerman what was up might for instance at least tell him where they were going when they boarded the plane pell had said they were going to meet the people from starlab and that was all dannerman craned his neck to peer out the window but that didnt help it was starry dark out there no sun or moon to give him at least a clue about their direction of travel the only thing he could be sure of was that they had io be heading generally west or north had to be because otherwise theyd be out over ocean by now and they werent he could catch glimpses of lights on the ground far below resigned he decided to get a little sleep as it turned out it was very little he had hardly closed his eyes when pat adcock returned from pells private quarters forward in the plane she was holding a partly full cup of coffee trying not to spillmy and she looked annoyed oh listen she said setting the cup down i got this from one of the stews but i didnt stop to think about whether you might want some eschatology which is the study of last things is a fundamental part of nearly all of earths religions buddhism speaks of the eternal bliss called nirvana while the biblical book of revelations describes the eschaton in more specific and concrete terms and death shall be no more neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more it is what some religions call heaven as it turned out there were other parties who didnt think of that state as religious for them it was a strategic objective and they were prepared to fight for it nbi briefing document id rather sleep whats all this omega point stuff she gestured toward the screen which still displayed her report all i know is what it says there i think somebody once mentioned tipler and his idea in one of my seminars but nobody took it very seriously and i dont remember anything else about it and you gave the report to the dd whatd he say she grinned he was asleep i woke him up when i came in and what he said was shit that was all then he waved at me to get out but i didnt go you didnt well i had some questions i wanted answeredlike what i was doing on this plane so i asked him i said i knew they wanted you along to confront this other dannerman but what did they want from me dannerman who had been wondering the same thing asked so why did they he didnt exactly say he just said hed rather i saw for myself saw what she shrugged he didnt say that either then when i stopped for coffee on the way back the stew told me that we were going to start coming down for a landing pretty soon so we better strap ourselves in oh she added fumbling for her seat belt there was one other thing you want to know where were going its canada they ordered the escape vehicle from starlab to come down at someplace called calgary calgary turned out to be really cold and when dannerman left the warm plane for the freezing dark outside an unexpected memory struck him he had been there before it had been a summer when the girl he was involved with at the time had made up her mind to go off on a fossil dig in the alberta bone beds somewhere or other among his scattered possessionsmost likely in one of the bureaus warehouses for storing the things an agent couldnt carry around with himhe probably still had a souvenir of her it was a pair of neckbones of some terriersized hundredmillionyearold dinosaur she had had them made into cufflinks for him just before she told him she was marrying her paleontology professor dannerman didnt remember calgary very well but something he had been told about its airport had stuck in his mind it possessed a hellish long runway because at one time it had been designated as an alternate emergency landing site for the old space shuttle which of course was just what was needed for starlabs assured crew return vehicle another plane was coming in also a big one it looked to dannerman like a troop transport he strolled over to where colonel morrisey was watching it land close enough to the deputy director so he could find her if he had orders for her far enough away not to intrude okay hilda dannerman said keeping his voice down explain something to me i understand the return ship from starlab probably needs a lot of landing strip but why in canada for gods sake she didnt look at him security what do you think everybody in the world is watching starlab now and theyve seen the acrv detach itself to come down therell be people waiting at every possible airport in the states she gave him a sidelong glance almost affectionate dont worry its all worked out with the canadians the president himself flew to ottawa to make a deal with the prime minister wheres your cuz pat went into the terminal to get warm actually dannerman was thinking of doing the same thing there was a freezing wind coming across the bare space of the airport hed been lucky enough to have the anorak he was taken to the headquarters in but even so his face was hurting from the cold pat hadnt been that fortunate when she was arrested they picked her up indoors and she hadnt been out in the open air ever since at the last minute one of the stews had found her a spare jacket that belonged to one of the pilots but it was meters too big and did nothing for her bare legs what kept dannerman out in the cold was the spectacle overhead there were more stars than he had seen in years and what looked like a handsome aurora borealis display off toward the horizon but when he pointed it out to hilda she said mildly asshole thats the sun getting ready to rise she paused to listen to the button in her ear and then said theyve got through reentry all right they say eta in thirtyfive minutes dannerman felt a sudden chill of a different kind he was that close to seeing this person who claimed to be himself he tried not to speculatesome bizarre alien creature that had duplicated his voice as a disguisebut it was a queasy unpleasant feeling all the same hilda was squinting at the horizon it ought to be broad daylight by then and thats what they wantedthey didnt want to risk a night landing but they wanted them to get down as fast as possible but i dunno i hope this chinaman knows what hes doing isnt he going to be landing right into the sun thats not how it works dannerman said out of the superior experience of somebody who had actually once made a return flight from orbit they swing around to land from the eastits to take advantage of earths rotation he looked to see if she was impressed she wasnt i think ill go use the mens room while i can when he was inside the warmth of the terminal seduced him into lingering he spotted pat wanly hunched over a cup of coffee by one of the vast glass windows with her junioragent minder alertly sitting just behind he located the place where the coffee was coming from and supplied sat down next to her she glanced up at him fretfully curious what are all the soldiers for looking out at the floodlit runway he could see what she was talking about the troop transport had nosed up to the hardstand next to the terminal its clamshell bow had opened and three personnel carriers each filled with armed infantrymen eased themselves down the ramp followed by a company or more of commandos on foot the newcomers were all in us combat uniforms but a pair of rcmps were glumly watching the spectacle i guess the mounties dont want anybody interfering he said the minder cleared her throat to attract his attention can i get you anything agent dannerman when he took a closer look at her he recognized the woman merla tepp the one who had interrogated him since when are you a stewardess since i volunteered for the flight sir you know how it is you want to be promoted you stay where the big brass can see you youll go a long way dannerman said absently glancing toward the huge window something was moving as it rushed past he identified it as another plane dropping toward the runway and turned to the minder hey is that she shook her head no sir it isnt the starlab acrv that planes from ottawa its expected maybe i should get back outside junior agent tepp touched her right ear the one with the communications button theyll let me know when its time she offered if you want to stay in the warm therell be a while yet thanks he said gratefully and then realized that it wasnt all generosity on her part as long as he and pat stayed inside she could too he yawned and sat down suddenly aware that the warmth had made him sleepy drowsily he watched as the new plane slowed turned off the landing strip and trundled toward the terminal it had a familiar look to dannerman though he couldnt see its markings airport crews were already rolling a flight of steps toward it and the door was opening almost before the plane stopped three or four people got out and hustled toward the group with the deputy director at least one of them also looked vaguely familiar to dannerman but he couldnt make out the face he yawned and closed his eyes he didnt realize he had fallen asleep until he felt merla tepp shaking his shoulder show time sir she was saying they want us out there now it was full daylight now though not a whit less cold but at least the bosses werent standing out in the freezing winds anymore someone had got smart enough to collect an airport bus and they were all inside it its heater going full blast at the end of the runway a squad of the commandos was deployed around it in full winter gear all of them carrying weapons but the soldiers waved them in when they saw the uniformed minder that was when dannerman saw who it was who had just come from ottawa it was the bureau director herself the cabinet officer the woman whose pictures showed her always superbly coiffed wearing what the latest fashion decreed and perpetually busy on the highest of highlevel affairs dannerman had not been physically in the directors presence since she addressed his graduating class when the american congress got tired of passing laws that instructed their successors of a few generations later but not themselvesto balance the damn budget once and for all they took a different tack they simply decided not to bother anymore it was simpler just to borrow more money of course that led to the problem of paying the interest on the money they borrowed that was a cost of government they could not escape nor could they avoid paying for more and more police so everything else had to be cut notably the space program ad astro he could hear only fragments of what the director and the dd were talking about yes marcus the director was saying to her deputy now suddenly deferential the prez squared it all i wrote the prime ministers order to the calgary people myself an unheard question from marcus pell then an answer from the director almost as hard to hear because she looked around and lowered her voice she seemed to be saying that theyd promised something to the canadians probably a share of whatever they got out of starlab dannerman speculated and amused himself by thinking about how much the canadians would ever collect on that promise if he knew the director not a great deal here it comes somebody said dannerman caught a glint of metal over the mountains to the west as predicted the acvr sailed past them far overhead but descending as it banked and turned it grew larger settling down toward the ground wobbling slightly and then it was touching down at the far end of the runway plumes of smoke erupted from its tires as they squealed against the runway then suddenly the thing was screeching past them still going a hundred kilometers an hour or better on its stilty landing gear behind it ground vehicles began to give chase two of the personnel carriers filled with troops a fire truck an ambulance get this thing moving the deputy director roared and the bus driver obeyed the spacecraft was well ahead of them still speeding for a moment dannerman feared that even the endless calgary runway wasnt going to be long enough for this job but it wasbarely by the time they reached the end of the runway the clumsy old antique was sitting there its ancient ceramic tiles cracked and smoking and two squads of riflemen had surrounded itto protect it from any of those expected interlopers dannerman assumed until he noticed that the ring of soldiers was facing in as they all piled out of the bus he could hear cracking sounds coming from it as it began to cool get those people out of that thing the director snapped one of the men with him cleared his throat its risky he said the landers still too hot to touch we have to wait a minute so cool it off the airport fire chief rubbed his chin we could foam it i guess he said but i dont know if that would make much difference and of course we cant use water why cant you use water the fireman looked surprised it would crack the tiles it might ruin the vehicle permanently now what difference do you think that would make listen half the radars in the world have followed that thing down were going to have visitors in the next hour ruin the son of a bitch when the pumpers started to pour water on the spacecraft everybody jumped back even so they were splashed the water from the hoses flashed into steam as soon as it touched the skin of the spaceship droplets of boiling hot water that almost instantly turned into icy cold water flew in all directions and the ceramic tiles snapped and popped loudly but it worked within no more than a minute or two the pumpers stopped and the airport crews trundled the wheeled steps up to the cabin door it opened the first person out of it was a real surprise to dannerman and a far greater one to pat adcock it was another pat adcock grimy worn hunching one arm around her chest against the cold as she cautiously made her way down the steps the second person was a greater surprise still because it was yet an additional pat adcock with her arm around the frail and limping figure of a new rosaleen artzybachova who was alive dannerman had gone to artzybachovas memorial service himself after she died on the way back from their trip to starlab but here she was suddenly possessing a new life the third figure was still another pat adcock that made three of them to go with the fourth pat adcock who was standing beside dannerman who moaned to herself oh jesus what is happening here then a chunkier male figure appeared it had an unfamiliar skimpy beard but it was definitely jimmy lin the chinese pilot sulkily staring around him and shivering in the chill he was almost immediately followed by someone whothough also bearded and definitely somewhat beatup and exhaustedlooked exactly like dan dannerman it was dan dannerman the watching dannerman couldnt doubt it any longer that was the face he had seen in his shaving mirror less bearded then of courseevery morning of his life how that was possible he could not imagine but that it was real was no longer in doubt those clear memories of what had happened in his trip to starlab they had somehow been falsified his head had been implanted with that damn gadget the x rays showed and his mind had been tampered with and he hadnt been aware of a thing he shook himself and turned back to the gangplank that had been six persons but the dannerman on the radio had spoken of a party of nine who were the other three more dannermans a couple of martin delasquezes the floridian copilot on the expedition maybe even some more pats it wasnt any of those it was something a good deal more strange the figure that appeared in the doorway was huge pale and not in any way human it looked to dannerman like a multiarmed golem and it carried another creature stranger stilla dwarfish being that looked like a turkey with a cats head incongruously wearing a goldmesh belly bag but he had seen those things before dannerman realized drawings of them at least they were two of the weird aliens whose pictures had appeared in the mysterious messages from space long before as that first alien made his way down the steps a second of the same species appeared by then the ring of soldiers had instinctively dropped to their knees their rifles zeroed in on the aliens dont shoot wailed a thin high voice dannerman had never heard before and it was only one more surprise to realize that it came from the kittenfaced turkey that was cradled in the first golems arms chapter seven for once in her life hilda morrisey wasnt sorry to be in the presence of the bureaus highest brass there were decisions now to be made that had never come up in any field operation the procession of improbables that had come out of the old spacecraft had simply paralyzed her decisionmaking faculties fortunately for the people who had to make those decisions some of the problems solved themselves what to do about the old lady from ukraine the first medics to arrive took one look at her and didnt wait for orders in half a minute they had her on a wheeled stretcher and one of the medics was pushing it toward the open ambulance door while the other two palped and poked her from alongside the other human beings were all lightly dressed and clearly freezing in the cutting canadian prairie windlike hilda herself the director and her dd were softly debating high policy considerations frowning pausing to make hurried calls on their coded carryphones they seemed impervious to cold hilda wasnt she caught the eye of one of the mounties the one that looked to be the most senior officer around any reason we cant get back in that bus us president reported in ottawa airport police sources confirm that the president of the united states arrived at the ottawa airport early this morning for a topsecret meeting with the prime minister the meeting is said to be related to the broadcast from the us astronomical satellite starlab no further information available at this time toronto star reckon not he said then took matters into his own hands he hustled everyone into the busthe pat who had flown up from the bureaus flight strip plus three additional pat adcocks dannerman and the bearded second dannerman the hired pilot from china named james pengtsu lin looking grouchy and for some reason upset and three others it was the three others that made a peculiar situation totally bizarre the little one that looked like a turkey didnt actually look that much like a turkey after all the face didnt belong to any kind of poultry it was more like that of some illtempered tiger cub hilda thought the plume that decorated its tail was almost peacock in its colorful splendor but it wasnt made of feathers at all it was a display of something more like fish scales that changed color from moment to moment as its owner gazed around in displeasure colonel morrisey hilda turned swiftly when she heard her name called and wasnt surprised to find it was that ubiquitous junior agent tepp the woman was pointing at the turkey and her finger was shaking its dopey and hilda saw yes it was its picture had been part of the zoo of weirdos that had been displayed in one of those unexplainedor now beginning to be explainedlunatic messages that had arrived from space a year or two before this was the one they called dopey all right it was not really comical in appearance but it wasnt particularly scary either unlike the other two those were definitely frightening to took at they were big the bus sagged perceptibly on its springs as they entered and they were surehell ugly fishbelly skin multiple arms with a whitefluff beard over the lower part of their faces that was more like foam plastic than hair hilda decided they were the ones called doc the dopeycreature seemed quite at ease at being carried by one of the pale monsters even the six humans who had come out of the spaceship seemed to pay them little attention the earthbound ones in the welcoming party though kept a wary distance one of the mounties had dutifully interposed himself between the docs and the humans presumably in case these space monsters suddenly began ravaging and murdering but he did not seem happy about it and when the dopey hopped down from the arms of his bearer and began to investigate the interior of the bus the mounty said sharply scoot get back there you the man was waving his arms as though at an unfamiliar but probably not really dangerous stray animal dopey peered up at him but why he asked reasonably and to hildas surprise in impeccable english i am simply curious about this crude vehicle get back the mounty said his tone still firm although his expression was distinctly uneasy the little alien flicked its great spread of tail and sulkily obeyed all this colonel hilda morrisey was observing and trying to remember in every detail she wasnt pleased there should have been recording devices in place to catch every word and every movement for analysis later on those first few minutes after you got a suspect in custody were the most important that was when some unguarded remark might slip out that you could pounce on later she fretted over wasting opportunities the sooner they got thesepeopleinto bureau custody the sooner interrogation could begin but she couldnt do it here all she could do at this point was listen there wasnt much to listen to the human arrivals were obviously on the ragged edge of exhaustion dannerman and dr pat adcock the real dannerman and pat adcockwere trying to engage the new ones in conversation but they were too wasted to respond much except for one of the new pats who was looking thoughtfully from one dannerman to another when she caught the real dannermans eye she smiled got up and sat down again beside him and began a lowvoiced conversation eavesdropping hilda was startled to hear the woman begin a cozy conversation they call me patricesaves confusion well it saves a little of the confusion anyway listen im sorry about the way i look hilda raised an eyebrow that was pickupbar talk the woman was actually incongruously making a move on dannerman while the other dannerman and one of the other pats were already sound asleep in a shared seat the mans arm lovingly around the woman horny little devils hilda thought wonderingly and looked outside the firemen were slowly trundling their trucks away no longer necessary and a bit disappointed while a tractor was nuzzling up to the spacecraft to haul it somewhere the director was standing by the little ship talking to a man in the doorway with a bureau tag hanging from his jacket not far away the three ambulances were parked with all the medics clustered around the vehicle where the old lady had been taken as hilda watched that one moved off siren blasting a pair of the other medics came trotting over to the bus and climbed in asking anyone here need medical attention the other dannerman roused by the sound of the sirens looked up yawning he pointed to one of the other pats better check pat five over shes pregnant the real pat adcock gasped hilda stared at the new dannerman you dog she said halfadmiringly he gave her a weary shake of the head it wasnt me that done it hilda he said but thats a really long story chapter eight the situation wasnt that pat adcockthe real pat adcock or so she couldnt help thinking of herselfhad nothing to say to these three new selves it was the other way around she had too much she had so many questions to ask and so many things she needed to express that she didnt know where to begin the real shocker was that one of her was actually getting ready to have a baby that took a lot of getting used to pat adcock had never been pregnant had never really wanted to beoh sure maybe now and then there had been a fleeting wistful notion quickly gone away who had the time for bringing up a child so now she sat mute in the bus while they waited to be told what to do then stood mute in the doorway of the deputy directors plane while the dd and five or six others wrangled over jimmy lin this jimmy lin the one who had just returned from somewhere in space the one who now was adamantly refusing to go anywhere at all until he had a chance to talk to the chinese consul in vancouver the one most amazingly of all who turned out to be the father of this other pats child that was really hard to believe down on the ground voices were raised in anger the argument seemed to be between the deputy director and the rcmp officer and the deputy director was losing the mountie was shaking his head firmly significantly a dozen other mounties were standing silently behind him clearly the deputy director didnt want a major confrontation he turned and stormed up the steps canadian bastards he was muttering first they take the old lady away from us now its the chinese well it isnt worth a war more loudly to the people in the doorway get your asses on board were going home as soon as they were airborne it started the agents unstrapped themselves heedless of the fact that the fasten seat belts lights were still on colonel morrisey reseated herself at a little desk by a window and pulled out a keypad she tapped swiftly then nodded to the other spook recording has commenced she said right said the other female spook im vice deputy director daisy fennell i dont think we met before because i flew in on the directors plane but now i need to ask you some questions you first agent dannerman turning to the dannerman with the beard i want you to begin at the beginning starting with your launch to the starlab satellite but the new dannerman was shaking his head first we have to eat he said the vice deputy raised her voice and lowered its temperature agent dannerman she began frostily you will do as i he stood his ground have a heart you dont know how it is with us weve been eating crap for months and we are damn starved the vice deputy opened her mouth to speak again but colonel morrisey stood up quickly she murmured something to the other woman then said ill take care of that but you start talking while youre waiting for the food danno thatll be fine he said if its not too long the look hilda morrisey gave him as she left was reproachful but also amused pat thought begin the older woman commanded you approached the satellite in orbit dannerman nodded the first thing we saw was that there was some kind of blister on the side of the satellite that didnt belong there and pat couldnt help herself but we didnt i was looking for it id seen it on the remote and it just wasnt there thatll do vice deputy fennell cut in youll get your chance to talk later now im taking agent dannermans statement the new dannerman looked at pat quizzically then went on as soon as they entered starlab he said theyd seen at once that it had been changed radically new machines big ones strange ones the orbiter was full of them he said and all the time we were there i had the feeling we were being watched it went on and on dannerman telling these incredible storiesthese untrue stories by pats own recollectionwhile the three other pats nodded agreement but it hadnt happened that way or had it had something gone really wrong with her own memory she hardly noticed when the food began to arrive but all four of the returned people leaped at it and as a matter of fact when she absentmindedly took some for herself she discovered that it was an impressive meal a tribute to the deputy directors airborne kitchen there was a huge salad the lettuce crisp enough to crackle the cucumber slices neatly trimmed of skin a few curls of a red onion and five different kinds of dressing in silver boats it didnt go to waste before the steaks camehalfkilo steaks beautifully marbled still sizzling as the stew set them down the three pats and the recently arrived dannerman had finished the salad every scrap as well as the quarterliter glasses of milk she kept refilling for them the debriefing paused briefly for eating and pat took advantage of the chance dan she asked i dont remember any of that no of course not he said kindly dopey blanked out your memories who did what dannerman started to grin but the pat next to him tugged at his arm he suppressed the smile it isnt your fault pat they have all kinds of tricksoh whats this what the stews were offering was fruit salad and all four of the returnees cried a unanimous no surprise us one of them added something that cant be freezedried or canned or irradiated okay and then looking at pat weve been living on old stores from starlab for months so this is pure heavenor would be anyway if this plane had a spare bathtub the pat next to the real or beardless dannerman apologized weve been a little short of that kind of thing for a long time too especially poor pat five over there at least patrice and i managed to get a swim in a few days agooh you want to know about the names they were rosaleens idea im pat one this is patrice our pregnant one is pat five what shall we call you call me it was a problem pat had not expected to face what she was called was pat or dr adcock that was an immutable given in her life and there had never been a reason to think about it at all until now when there were three others entitled to the same name anything but patsy please said patrice we had a patsy but she died the pat bit her lip some interior struggle was going on oh hell she said unhappily well talk about that later anyway maybe ill be big about this you stay with pat ill be pat one well thanks pat said a little bit grateful still a lot puzzled just as a pair of stews made their entrance carrying plates of hot apple pie with ice cream sorry we took so long one of them apologized but those weirdos are in the galley trying to find something they can eat christ but they take up a lot of room and they stink said the other one just as the real dannerman came in from the front of the plane he seemed cheerful hey ill take a piece of that too and some coffee and then maybe a beer a beer the other dannerman said reverently the real one was grinning were missing all the fun he said the whole worlds arriving in calgary now the ukrainians are after dr artzybachova the chinese are taking jimmy lin off in a hell of a hurry even the floridians are complaining that you didnt bring their general delasquez back backgrounder nbi contacts file lin james pengtsu cdr prc spaceforce commander lin has a somewhat shadowy background a full commander in the peoples republic spaceforce he was dismissed from the service for reasons variously given as political unreliability and sexual misconduct research has not definitively established which if the misconduct was sexual one account has it that lin is given to reenacting the exploits of his remote ancestor an ancient chinese sage named pengtsu who wrote a book extolling the necessity and varieties of frequent sexual experience an alternative report however suggests that lin is homosexual and the alleged heterosexual activity is a cover for what in prc eyes is a serious crime lin was hired as pilot by dr patrice adcock in her mission to starlab there are now two of him one who came back with the first batch of returnees from starlab the other with agent jd dannerman and the extraterrestrials the second one is said to be the artificialinsemination father of the unborn child of the dr adcock known as pat five martins dead dannermanwithabeard said between bites we think he is anyway yeah well i hate to secondguess the boss but maybe moving the landing site to canada wasnt the best idea he ever had pat shushed him and turned to pat one what do you mean martins dead it was a short question but it had a long answer and not a cheery one the floridian pilot pat had hired for her mission general martin delasquez had stayed behind to cover the rest of them while they escaped escaped from what well there was a sort of a war going on a big one how big well as far as they could tell it seemed to involve the whole damn universe vice deputy fennell sighed how weird is this going to get lets get back to the beginning from where you all entered starlab if what these people were saying was trueand pat realized that she didnt have any choice anymore about believing themthey had been through a hell of an ordeal taken captive on starlab by the creature they called dopey and his docsby them but not for them they were only subject races doing their masters bidding and who were these masters why all the newcomers agreed the whole thing had been organized by that scarecrow creature from the space messages a race of superbeings who chose to be called beloved leaders though why anyone should love them pat could not imagine certainly their human captives had no reason to they had been kept penned for weeks in a cell no larger than the airborne drawing room they were in but without any of its amenitieswithout any amenities at all even toilets that struck pat as nasty then she heard a good deal nastier at least the original band of captives had been allowed to live intact as a sort of control group of humans to be studied but the aliens had other studies in mind as well and those had been far worse the aliens had made additional copies of their captives for anatomical research nearly all of those unfortunates had died during the experimentation generally pat five said in considerable pain she herself had been lucky she had been the one who was chosen pretty much at random to become pregnant so the aliens could discover how human beings produced their young romance was not involved nor even actual sexual intercourse she had been artificially inseminated with spermfrom she thought one of the jimmy lins though she couldnt be positive even of thatand so she alone of that group had survived backgrounder nbi contacts file delasquez martin maj gen florida air guard general delasquez qualified for astronaut training in the us nasa program but never went into space due to the defunding of the program when the state of florida declared itself sovereign in its own territory delasquez became part of its air guard rising to the rank of major general he was attached to the florida mission to the united nations stationed in new york city when dr patrice adcock hired him as copilot on her mission to starlab he returned with the others and was subsequently found to be bugged he was then hired by eurospace as a consultant on starlab when they proposed to fly their own mission to the satellite in which capacity he served for some months at the eurospace facility in kourou guyana delasquez is said to be well connected politically in floridas cubanamerican circles a second delasquez is said to have died while with the others in captivity by the scarecrows it did not seem to pat that pat five had been all that lucky she tried to imagine what it might be like to be a laboratory specimen with an unwanted new life growing inside her then she stopped trying to imagine it it was more painful than she could bear chapter nine hilda morrisey had a good imagination too she needed it in her work but she also needed to be able to turn it off when it was troublesome which vice deputy daisy fennell evidently could not the woman listening with openmouthed horror had completely lost control of the debriefing hilda quelled the uneasy stirrings in her own belly and spoke up lets get back to business one at a time now go back to when you woke up in this place with the mirrors all around you what happened nextpointing to the one who called herself patrice who shook her head i wasnt there patsy and i came along later and then there was a whole confusing other story about this patsystill another copy of dr adcockand how shed been electrocuted by some still other kind of alien monster that looked like a hippopotamus but delivered lethal electrical shocks only that didnt happen in the mirrored cell it happened later on after theyd all been taken out of the cityor the base or the encampment or whatever you chose to call itwhere theyd first arrived and then been dumped out in the woods somewhere because the other guys the other variety of wouldbe universeconquerors they called the horch were fighting against the ones they called the beloved leaders well it went on like that hilda couldnt keep them from interrupting and correcting each other not even with the help of the recovered daisy fennell the two of them were trying to untangle the question of horch vs beloved leaders when the deputy director came in he waved them to go on and listened for a moment frowning silently he didnt stay silent that lasted only until one of the pats said so the horch took over the helmets you know the things we could see things in they showed us the beloved leaders destroying planets hold it the deputy director said beloved what who loves them its what the slave races call those scarecrow things daisy fennell explained remember in the first transmission from space beloved leaders my ass cant we just call them aliens hilda coughed there are a whole bunch of different aliens sir he scowled and thought for a moment scarecrows then thats what they look like right so whos fighting who in this war basically its those two the horch and the ah scarecrows hilda said what they want is control of this eschaton thing which is what hilda gamely opened her mouth to try to respond but one of the pats saved her remember what you asked us to look up mr pell about this man tipler he wrote a book back around it seems he thought at the end of the universe wed all be born again and live forever the deputy director was staring at her you mean the scarecrows got hold of the book by this guy tipler oh no one of the other pats put in they thought it up by themselves it wasnt until dopey told us about it that we thought of tipler the little turkey told you marcus pell scratched his chin well he said maybe we should get it from the horses mouth lets get them in here the first people in the room were a pair of armed guards not just armed as everyone was these days especially if they were in the police corps these toughlooking individuals carried serious rapidfire carbines they took up stations beside the door just as the creatures they were guarding against came in hilda smelled them before she saw them but she wasnt prepared for what she saw one of the big pale creatures was carrying a selection of bowls and pitchers in various arms the other was carrying the turkeycreature dopey who was spooning granulated sugar out of a bowl and complaining about the quality of it between mouthfuls he was addressing the guards as they herded the golems into one corner of the salon why do you treat the bearers as though they were dangerous animals he demanded hopping down to the floor they are entirely obedient it is their natures make them understand please dr adcock agent dannerman he took one more spoonful of sugar then handed the bowl to the doc dusting his hands on his belly bag also make them understand that this simple sugar is not adequate for my diet the bearer indicates it will not poison us but why can we not have the proper food we brought from your starlab astonishing event second doktornauk r v artzybachova arrives in kiev hundreds of ukrainians who mourned the death of the honored scientist of the republic r v artzybachova gathered outside hospital no before dawn to welcome the return of their beloved technologist the state information agency offered no explanation of how dr artzybachova returned to life but stated there is no question this is dr artzybachova although the scientist was too weak to be interviewed the agency released a statement from her which said i am gratified to return to my beloved ukraine i wish to thank the president of the republic and the leaders of the democratic duma who have unfailingly striven to care for every citizen vremya kiev ukraine the deputy director looked at him with dislike then turned to the pats please ask this ah person you may call me dopey i do not take offense dopey then ask him about this war thats going on the tigerfaced little turkey made a sound of protest address me directly please please answer my question about the food as well hilda repressed a smile she didnt mind seeing the damn bureau bureaucrats embarrassed and the expression on the face of the deputy director was enough to make a cat laughwell not the particular cat who was telling him all this certainly not the docs who were simply standing where they were put holding on to chair backs and swaying slightly in the motion of the plane and it wasnt making anyone else laugh the deputy director collected himself all the artifacts that came from starlab are under seal in the cargo hold they cant be reached until we land and then theyll go directly to the bureau technicians for analysis now tell us about this goddam war dopey flirted his brighthued tail in irritation but complied hilda listened doubting every word eternal life two great races the scarecrows and the horch each determined to rule itforever and willing to kill or enslave every other race in the universe to make sure they were the ones who won out and not one word of it believable to as hardheaded a woman as hilda morrisey if it hadnt been for the bizarre creature who was doing the talking when dopey ran dry pell had a question so how did this man tipler get onto it yes the little alien acknowledged it is interesting that even a primitive like yourselves had some suspicion of the eschaton most races do not the deputy director sighed and you expect us to believe this crap dopey looked surprised expect no i do not care what you believe however it is so we know this because we have been told so by our beloved leaders beloved leaders the deputy director began his tone derisory but then his expression changed as he broke off all the others turned to look at what he was seeing one of the golems had surprisingly moved from his statue like stance startled the guards turned toward him weapons at the ready but all the creature did was to squat suddenly there was a noise as of a fountain and a stain seeped out across the rug around him hilda stared in revulsion the damn thing had pulled a little cuplike thing off its surprisingly tiny genitals and now it was urinating on the floor and when it had finished it stood up again looking at the puddle in surprise patrice glanced up at dannerman with a little laugh youll have to forgive our friend dandan theyve got better floors where he comes from they just uh absorb waste i guess he never heard of flush toilets the deputy director stood up in disgust christ he said im getting out of here corporal clean that mess up and then as he turned to leave he took another look at the pouch dopey wore on his belly and well want that thing for analysis so take it away from him no cried one of the patsno at least two of them and dan dannerman shouting something as well but the nearest guard did as he was ordered or tried to the little alien did his best to scuttle away but the guard reached out for the reddish metal muff and screamed and fell back or was thrown back and fell to the floor chapter ten whatever the little aliens belly bag had done to the guard the man hadnt died of it mores the pity hilda told herself if the damn fool had been dead that would have been the end of it his corpse could have been offloaded and transported at leisure to the bureaus autopsy facilities where something useful might have been learned alive he was a lot more trouble he had to be personally escorted to the nearest emergency room with a senior officer going along to make sure he didnt blab anything he shouldnt and who was the lucky senior officer to get the job why naturally it was colonel hilda morrisey infuriatingly the man was wideawake and apologetic long before hilda got him to the emergency room the duty doctors were annoyed there isnt anything seriously wrong with this man one said to hilda he could stand to lose a few kilos and id watch that liver but he doesnt belong here you say he had some kind of electric shock has he had medical treatment already no well yes she added remembering that one of the golems had forced his way over to fiddle with the unconscious guard for several minutes for all the good that could have done i guess you could say he had some first aid but our plane was just landing so we brought him right here when the doctor said it would probably be best to keep him overnight hilda agreed but required the privilege of saying a word or two in the patients ear when she was confident that he understood the importance of keeping his mouth shut about anything that had happened on the plane she left him she hurried to the headquarters and one of the suites for visiting vips and the first real sleep she had had in more hours than she wanted to count hilda slept dreamlessly and woke herself early she didnt need an alarm it was a matter of will and as soon as her eyes were open she knew where she was and what she had to do first thing was to peek out into the suites living room to make sure her uniform was back cleaned and pressed overnight it was she retrieved it and headed for the bathroom scooping up the underwear shed washed and left to dry on the little line while she was pulling her stockings on she called the bureaus new york office on the secure line voice only and got the night duty officer colonel morrisey here she told him im going to be stuck at hq for a while any problems your end there werent all the ongoing operations were proceeding smoothly without her the man said and accepted her instructions to turn all her studebaker files over to major geltmann then she made herself a cup of coffee from the little machine in the bathroom while she checked the situation reports as she expected all four of the pat adcocks and both dannermans had been stowed away in a safe house with plenty of bureau security surrounding them what was more surprising was that the aliens were squirreled away with them that couldnt be permanent if only hilda reflected because the woman agent who ostensibly lived there would have a lot to say about the damage to her carpets the only other item that concerned her was that a meeting of the ananias team was scheduled for vice deputy director daisy fennell was to be in the chair and hilda herself was listed as one of the participants but marcus pell was not and when hilda checked a little farther it turned out that he too was logged as remaining overnight in the safe house well that made sense if there was anything important for the national bureau of investigation to investigate the place to do it was where the starlab people were hilda felt a brief sense of resentment she should have been there herself would have been if she hadnt been stuck with that damn guard but she wasnt there and meanwhile she had time for some errands of her own she checked her makeup swallowed the last of the coffee and took the elevator up to the motor pool because she did not intend to sleep another night in that borrowed tshirt from the bureaus womens bowling team twenty minutes later she was parking at one of arlingtons shopping malls she did not miss the fact that the valet who took her twoseater gave her one of those ohyoureacop looksnot hostile exactly and certainly not deferential just wary she got the same look from the half dozen sidewalk vendors who were peddling inflationhedge knickknacks just outside the mall entrance even the two city cops who were interrogating a young woman against a wall shoplifter someone with a cause who had perhaps tried to plant a stink bomb in the food departmentpaused to salute her but their expressions were as stony as the perpetrators herself it was the uniform of course yanqui bureaucrats refuse to release delasquez alleged death data once again the anglo politicians in washington have denied the official demands of the sovereign state of florida for a full and complete account of the socalled death of the other general martin delasquez el diario miami hilda morrisey was proud of the uniform it marked her and everyone who wore it as part of that group that was charged with protecting all these peoplefrom themselves often enough but there were times when she didnt want to advertise what she did for a living if she were going to stay in this area for a few days away from the closets of her little new york city flat so once she had picked up the necessities she spent another half hour picking out things she could wear off duty some of them nice things the sorts of things that made her look like the kind of woman a man some man might want to know better some man to replace wilbur who evidently wasnt going to be handy for a while on her way back with her acquisitions hilda allowed herself a pleasant little reverie about that some man she had not yet met idly switching on the news halflistening to the garbled stories and wild speculations over the amazing reports from calgary the message light flashed on the car screen she hit the display button what turned up was an extract from die orders of the day it said col morrisey hilda j reassigned arlington hq promoted brigadier that took care of news wilbur and idle speculations you bastard she said to the air switched over to manual drive and whipped the car around in the direction of the safe house and deputy director marcus pell the safe house had sixteen rooms and seven baths not counting the jacuzzi and the pool in the backyard it needed them all it was crowded with four pats two dannermans two docs the dopey the deputy director and a couple of his interrogatorsand eleven count em eleven guards in and outside the house plus about half a dozen maids cooks and cleaners who were of course also guards even if they didnt flaunt their weapons quite as conspicuously as the ones in uniform the guard at the gate wasnt uniformed he was dressed in overalls and he held what looked like a leaf blower he looked briefly at hildas uniform and the id she flashed at him then waved her on to the next guard or actually guards there were two of them here this time in uniform and standing at a checkpoint with stopemdead spikes in the driveway just past their post hildas rank wasnt enough to get her past them she had to sit in the car fuming until the deputy director himself came strolling down from the safe house he gave the guards a nod of the head and waited until they had taken themselves out of earshot before he spoke morning hilda he said pleasantly i bet i know why youre here i bet you damn well do marcus she snarled im here to tell you that im quitting and as soon as i get to a secure terminal youll have it in writing he shook his head patiently no he said i wont calm down hilda you know this business is too big for you to sit out jesus he went on his expression changing you wouldnt believe what kind of technology these people have i was up half the night with that dopey creature and he talked straight through my god how he talked matter transmitters jail walls the keepers can walk through but the inmates cant pass weaponsoh hilda the weapons theyve got youre not going to want to miss all this the hell im not but he finished not missing a beat even if you did you dont have the choice the president has declared a national emergency so no resignations are going to be accepted he gave her a tolerant pat on the shoulder so youll be with us for the duration hilda and as long as youre here you might as well come in and get in on the fun and by the waycongratulations on your promotion colonelnow brigadierhilda morrisey never allowed herself to waste time on resentment that didnt mean she wasnt capable of carrying a grudge sooner or later she thought darkly she would find a way to pay marcus pell back for all this but that could wait meanwhile she had to admit that yes she really did want to be in on this bizarre affair pell led the way to a large room where most of the people from starlab were gathered the human ones anyway the room appeared to be the mansions library since the walls were lined solidly with cases of books but no one was reading a screen was displaying the dopey creature sulkily describing some other weird creatures who were involved with his beloved leaders in one way or another but no one in the library was paying much attention to that either they were mostly eating the room smelled of recent bacon and eggs and there were pitchers of coffee and juice and remnants of toast and fresh fruits on the low tables it looked to hilda like the sort of breakfast pigout you might find the morning after a highschoolgirl sleepover there was a bureau interrogator sitting alertly in a straightbacked chair but he wasnt interrogating sensibly enough hilda thought he was simply listening as they talked among themselves while his recorders were capturing everything that was said they all looked a lot cleaner than they had on the aircraft and the ones from starlab were wearing fresh clothes from the safe houses stores they looked as though theyd had some sleep toonot necessarily alone hilda thought noting the way the dannerman with the beard and the pat who seemed to be affixed to him were cozily sharing a bowl of strawberries in one corner of the room tiplers thesis was that when the expansion of the universe finally ran out of steam and the whole thing fell back into that bizarre point in space that had exploded into the big bangthe big crunch as they called that ultimate collapseeverybody who had ever lived would live again tipler called it the omega point that even more bizarre creature dopey called it the eschaton but it was the same basic idea when she checked around they seemed to be one pat short a couple of doctors are checking pat five over the one called patrice explained want some coffee there are clean cups over there she took some so did the deputy director looking pleased with the way things were going dopey who was in the next room had been telling his interrogators all kinds of things about the mass of hightech materiel on starlab pell nodded were going to have to go back up there to get it the directors getting that set up now hilda looked skeptical how are you going to know how to make it work but that wasnt a problem patrice explained dopey himself didnt know how to operate most of it he had admitted as much evidently somewhat amused at the thought but he didnt have to one of the creatures dopey called his bearers was a specialist in that sort of thing he could operate any of it and show the bureaus people how hilda looked incredulous the golem can do that one of them can the others a kind of biologicalmedical handyman hes the one who fixed up the guard last night and he fixed rosaleen up too dannermanbeard called from across the room between the two of them they can do all kinds of things if dopey tells them to they sounded like pretty handy gadgets to hilda she opened her mouth to say as much to the deputy director but he wasnt paying any attention to the conversation he was scowling at the screen on which dopey was complaining one more time to his interrogators about how desperately they needed their real food it clearly was not what pell wanted to hear from the alien he got up and headed for the door to the other room but as he opened it dopey caught sight of hilda just behind marcus pell stop now dopey said peremptorily waggling his plumed tail in reproof i do not require much rest but i must have some i will answer no further questions for the next he twiddled his little paws in his belly bag twentyfive minutes he didnt wait for a reply but hopped off his perch on a coffee table and brushed past the deputy director as he entered the library room he advanced on hilda my dear brigadier morrisey i appeal to you as a woman please relieve our distress see that the foodstuffs are delivered to us at once hilda morrisey was not used to being appealed to as a woman actually she thought it rather quaint but she shook her head i have nothing to say about that dopey the little alien sighed in that event i will sleep for the remainder of the twentyfive minutes and he squatted down on the floor under a dictionary stand as he closed his eyes the great fan of his tail bent forward covering him from the light and he was still the deputy director glared around the room looking for someone to blame then he shrugged youre in charge he snapped at hilda and hurried out of the roomon his way hilda supposed to find a secure screen so he could check in with headquarters being in charge was nice hilda thought but it would have been even nicer if she knew what she was supposed to do for starters she nodded at the guards and interrogators you can all take ten she said as they left gratefully she peered at dopey is that the way the thing sleeps patrice answered for all of them i dont know we never saw him sleep before urn hilda said and then got down to business all right tell me what youve found out so far she ordered looking at her own dannerman he looked rebellious christ hilda theyve been talking for hours its all on the tapes anyway it was a reasonable answer so she tried a different tack then lets get to something they havent talked about dont you have any questions that havent been answered yet pat spoke up for him well i do she said sounding tentative turning to the other pats you said something about another one of us who died the two other pats looked at each other patrice sighed yes that was patsy we were swimming and these other creaturesthey looked sort of like seals more like a hippopotamus pat one corrected anyway they had some kind of electric shockers like electric eels i guess and they lived in the water and well things went sour and one of them killed patsy do we have to talk about this now it was bad im afraid you do hilda informed hernot cruelly but not particularly sympathetically either making people talk about things they didnt want to talk about was basic to her job description you have to talk about everything now these animals with the electric shockers they werent animals dannermanbeard corrected her they were fellow prisoners just like us anyway all thats on the tapes already patrice said there were lots of different kinds ofpeoplefrom different planets there and oh hi she said turning to greet pat five as she entered hi pat five said looking belligerent she spotted the table with the coffee cups and headed toward it come on pat one coaxed dont keep us in suspense what did the doctors find out they found out i was pregnant pat five said pouring a cup and adding four or five spoonfuls of sugar they wanted me to go into a hospital here for observation i told them screw that there are plenty of hospitals in new york and i want to go home and then i want to get back to work so do i said patrice eagerly i was thinking about it all the time we were in that damn cell then her face fell oh hell she said i didnt think how in the world are we ever going to sort that out sort what out hilda demanded patthe real patanswered for them all sort out which of us is going to run the observatory of course they were all silent for a moment then she added gloomily i dont think itll be me anyway patrice gave her a curious look why not you canadas rights in starlab technology unquestionable we must not forget that canada has a special interest in the starlab venture since it was on canadian soil that the first returnees from scarecrow captivity reached the earth globe and mail toronto she glanced bitterly at hilda because these people tell me im goddam prey thats why ive got this damn lump of something in my head and according to them somebodys likely to grab me and saw my head off to get at it oh patrice said nodding you mean the bug ive got one too hilda snapped to attention you do sure so did patsythe one of us who died and of course all the ones who went back to earthyou twonodding at the earthly pat and dannermanand jimmy lin and martin and rosie its a spy thing dannerman frowning opened his mouth but hilda was in command tell me exactly what you mean spy thing she demanded and was astonished to hear the answer the bugs in the head were little transmitterswell no surprise there everyone had guessed that much but these werent simple soundonly bugs you put on a kind of helmet that acted as a receiver patrice said and then you were the other person the other you i saw that jail cell you were in pat through your eyes just like i was there the bearded dannerman confirmed what she said i was in your head once when you were waking up with a hangover dan and martin said he was at kourou and jimmy lin was back in the chinese space center in fact i think one time when our jimmy was listening in the one of him that was in china was getting laid he said it was just like being there you could see hear taste smell feelit was virtualreality stuff only better than anything ive ever seen then they were all talking at once waking dopey you people are very noisy he complained peering out from under his great plume but no one paid attention to him you mean pat said shakily you could feel and see everything i did everything well just when we had the helmet on pat one said consolingly and we could only receive ourselvespatrice and patsy and i could tune in on you dandan on the other dan and so on dopey had a way of tuning in on everybodythats why they put the bugs in your heads in the first place but he never let us do that pat was shaking her head thank god i wasnt doing anything very interesting she said but now i really do want to get this damn thing out even if it kills you dannerman asked dopey yawned a little cat yawn you people concern yourselves over such trivial things he complained why should that procedure kill you the device no longer serves any useful purpose since you have destroyed the relay channel on your starlab my medically trained bearer can remove it without harm to you pat sat up openmouthed youre sure of course i am sure was it not he who installed the devices in the first place chapter eleven dannerman knew what going to hospital was all about because hed done it more than once you went to hospitals when for instance the kneebreakers of the mad king ludwigs or the scuzzhawk enforcers had found out you were a narc and consequently had beaten the pee out of you then when you got to the hospital the basic thing you felt was just gratitude that youd made it there all you hoped for was that maybe these people could make everything stop hurting this time was different dannerman had never before gone into a hospital when there was actually nothing wrong with him at all and when the reason he was there was to let somebody chop holes into parts of his head where neurosurgeons hesitated to cut where if they made one little slip pow your brain was tapioca what made it worsenot that dannerman required that it be made was that the somebody who was about to stab him in the worse spinal cord wasnt even a human being it was a twometertall golem with a lot more arms than seemed reasonable from some preposterous part of outer space the damn thing wasnt even looking at dannerman as it stood impassive in the lurching bureau van it wasnt looking at anything it seemed to be in a standingup coma and it smelled terrible the party had waited until after dark to make the trip to walter reed darkness wasnt perfect security it wouldnt stop any professional snoop from switching on his ir scanner that turned any scene into broad fullcolor daylight but it might save them from being observed by some chancemet news reporter or simple civilian gawker who might just happen to be passing by the freight entrance when their little procession of cars slid through the door to the loading dock and the door descended behind them walter reed was meant as a veterans hospital but it happened to be really handy to the nations capital presidents and congressmen noticed that right away and so it became the sort of general allpurpose lowcost medical facility for the nations top brass what it didnt have many of anymore was military veterans because there hadnt been that many wars lately now it was mainly the federal police corps which supplied the bodies to fill those ready beds the bureaus casualties didnt mingle with shotup street cops the bureau had its own little section where security was easy to maintain dr marsha evergood was waiting for them on the dock she glanced at the pair of aliens the doc and the dopey with a mixture of skepticism and dislike but said nothing as she led them into an elevator they made a considerable procession with the aliens the three bugged humans and colonel hilda morrisey the bureaus advance party had done its job no one else was in sight not in the halls behind the freight dock not in the elevator which was manually operated by a uniformed bureau cadet not in the short stretch of hallway that led them to an operating theater it was a real operating theater this time dannerman saw the difference between it and the bureaus pit of pain were that this one had actual surgical machinery some of the pieces faintly whispering and chuckling to themselves and the glass wall to the gallery was ordinary glass there was nobody watching in those seats either dr evergood planted herself at the head of the operating table and peered at the doc how do you want to do this she asked the room in general the doc didnt answer it simply stood impassively while dopey methodically picked up surgical instruments and put them down again in disdain so very primitive he sighed still we will do the best we can the best we can that didnt really sound good enough to dannerman involuntary little choking sounds that came from patrice and pat showed that they felt the same way there were four or five operatingroom attendants in the room meticulously scrubbed and masked though all dannerman could see of them was their eyes he was pretty sure that what he saw in those eyes was horror as the weird little being from space touched their sterile racks with his unwashed fingers what had become of asepsis why for that matter were dannerman and hilda and the two pats allowed to enter in their inevitably germladen clothes exhaling their germladen breaths maskless into the pure air of the operating room dr evergood and dopey talked for a moment in low tones then dopey raised his voice anesthesia he said no of course not we will have no need for your anesthesia hey pat said faintly dopey turned to peer at her have i alarmed you but there is no reason to fear this bearer is quite competent you will experience little or no pain he paused for a moment for some of that silent communion with the doc then he is prepared to commence who wishes to be first dannerman glanced at pat and patrice both of them were gazing at him me he said dopey took it as an offer then very well he said if you will simply lie on that structure over there agent dannerman facedown if you please yes that is fine do you dr adcocks wish to watch if not you may wait outside but i think you will find it interestingoh what are you doing to agent dannerman now dannerman felt something being draped over the back of his head as the nurses sprang to action theyre masking the area dr evergood said no no that is not necessary one other thing agent dannerman do you wish your actual memories restored in place of the simulations we imposed on you that would take a bit longer but if you wishno very well then we can begin and they did or dannerman supposed that they did though all he experienced was the docs light touch at the base of his skull then a sharp sting in the same place and then dopey was saying you may get up now agent dannerman which of you dr adcocks wishes to be next and next to the operating table dr evergood was incredulously holding some coppery thing in the folds of a surgical cloth and the two pats were looking astonished andwell yes there was no other word for it looking terrified one of the nurses took dannermans arm and led him away to the recovery room once outside the operating theater he pulled his mask off gazing at dannerman in wonder but all he said was holy shit the recovery room wasnt actually much of a recovery room but then it didnt have to be as far as dannerman could tell he didnt really have anything to recover from what the room was in the normal course of events was an upperfloor solarium for the use of ambulatory patients on this day the ambulatory patients were out of luck because the deputy director had preempted the space dannerman was surprised to see that there were two people in it already the other dannerman and the pat from spacenot the patrice or the pat who had just come from the bureaus cells who were still in the operating room and not the pregnant pat five it took dannerman a moment to figure out that this had to be the one called pat one he was still having trouble keeping them all straight the nurse gazed from one to another of them unbelievingly then shook his head well want you for tests and x rays he said but you can just wait here now and he left still shaking his head as pat said are you all right i guess so dannerman said rubbing the back of his neck dont ask me what happened i was asleep let me see she ordered dannerman bowed his neck while the others studied the place where there should have been a wad of surgical packing but wasnt they were still doing it when patrice came in rubbing the back of her own neck in the same way she did have some answers though she had been watching while the doc removed dannermans bug but i couldnt see much she apologized it looked like the doc used a couple of the scalpels to open up the back of your neck dannerman but then he just reached in with the fingers of one of his little arms and fiddled around for a while it didnt take long then he pulled this little metal thing out of you and handed it to dr evergood i didnt even see how he closed the incision up let me look dannerman pleaded obediently the pat bent her head but there was nothing much to see a pair of faint pink lines surrounded her spinal cord just below the hairline that was all there was and even those were fading as he looked at them the door opened again dannerman looked up but the pat who came in wasnt the remaining one with the bug it was the pregnant one pat five just back from an examination by the hospitals obstetrical staff and looking hostile the thought of pat adcock any pat adcock being pregnant was almost as bizarre for dannerman as his own bug or the freaks who had implanted it it didnt seem to strike the other pats that way they were quick to find her a chair and perch on either side of it tell one of them demanded pat five shrugged they said im a healthy middleaged primapara she said they wanted to do ultrasound and all that stuff but i wouldnt let them i want to get back to myourown doctor right on agreed patrice but what about she glanced at the dannermans and lowered her voice before she asked her question they had dannerman supposed got into some of the more intimate aspects of pregnancy he didnt listen in what he did though was put on a pretense of eavesdropping not because he particularly wanted to hear how the pregnant one was doing with such matters as morning sickness and bladder control but so that he would not have to make conversation with that other dan dannerman sitting there as uncomfortable as himself federal reserve inflation bulletin the morning recommended price adjustment for inflation is set at reflecting an annualized rate of federal reserve chairman walter c boettger expressed alarm at the increase which he said in a prepared statement is entirely due to public hysteria at recent events does not fairly represent the nations economic realities and which if continued will necessitate adjustments in the interest rate when he glanced at the other dannerman he found the man looking at him in the same rueful and perplexed way oh hell dan the other one said coming over and sitting beside him i guess sooner or later you and i are going to have to talk i guess so dannerman said stiffly the question was what to talk about he chose an innocuous subject to start have they said anything to you about money oh sure they said they had never had a situation like this before and they didnt know who was entitled to what same here the bearded one was glancing at one of the pats his patso dannerman tried something a little more personal are you two going to get married that dannerman looked resentful in his turn but then he shrugged we never said so butyeah i think we might funny isnt it it wasnt exactly not really funny but certainly considering dannermans own experiences with pat adcock pretty odd there had been nothing like that between the two of them before they went to starlab quite the opposite in fact jim daniel was now looking a little bit embarrassed the thing is he said diffidently anita the girl i uh we were dating i thought about her a lot at first when pat and i were getting interested in each other back in captivity i think i had a kind of a guilty conscience maybe anita deserved better than an occasional roll in the hay and well you know what im talking about have you seen her lately it was a perfectly reasonable question but dannerman felt a sudden flash of warmth in his face and knew it was anger he wasyes damn it he was jealous the unpleasant fact was that this other man who was not himselfnever mind the fact that in some sense he actually washad taken his very own anita berman to bed often knew all of her scents and habits as intimately as dannerman himself nothing that had passed between them was secret from him at least not up until the moment they had left for the starlab and there had been little enough happening since then dannerman knew it was not a reasonable rage but what was there about the things that had been going on for all of them that was really reasonable not lately he said stiffly and turned away he knew perfectly well that sooner or later he and this other dan would have to try to come to terms maybe they could maybe sometime they could be as close and amiable as the pats but not yet when dr evergood arrived looking baffled she had two nurses in tow it took them a while to sort out which three of the six persons involved had just come out of surgery but after they did they got busy the nurses began taking pulses and blood pressures and sticking tiny gadgets in the patients ears to check their temperatures while the doctor peered unbelievingly at the backs of the patients necks she didnt speak until she was quite through then she sighed in resignation nobody she said heals from an incision that fast she touched the back of patrices neck again wonderingly then shook her head anyway theyre waiting for you three in x ray but deputy director pell wants to show you something first she looked inquiringly at the nurse standing by the door who nodded a moment later deputy director pell arrived not alone right behind him as he came in the door was hilda morrisey carryingdannerman noted with surprisea lethallooking carbine she nodded impartially to the two dannermans and stepped out of the way to let in four additional armed and uniformed police corps guards two of them pushing what looked like an office safe on wheels i thought youd like to see what we took out of you the deputy director said genially nodding to hilda she took a pair of keytabs out of her pocket unlocked the safe and stood back as one of the guards lifted out a transparent box inside it was an almondshaped coppery object not much bigger than the end of dannermans thumb its more complicated than it looks the deputy director said happily and now weve got three of them according to dr evergood here while it was in place in your heads it extruded little filaments that penetrated large sections of your brains but your manyarmed friend managed to get it to withdraw them again so it could be removed seen enough all right hilda take it away and when hilda had relocked the safe and the guards were rolling it away he looked around at the pats and added one thing which of you is the one thats pregnant pat five raised her hand me is something wrong you mean medically no nothing like that youre fine but i got a call from the state department the ambassador of the peoples republic paid them a call last night they didnt waste much time what he was there for was to serve them with a summons the complainant is commander james pengtsu lin and hes suing you and the government of the united states for custody of the child chapter twelve unsurprisingly hilda morrisey hadnt forgiven the deputy director she wasnt very good at forgiving she hadnt had much practice what she was good at was facing facts in the present situation the deputy director held all the cards she was stuck here with all these headquarters cruds for the foreseeable future therefore she might as well make herself comfortable for openers that meant getting a place of her ownnot too far away but definitely not so near that she was under somebodys eye twentyfour hours a day rank helped the bureaus housing office was eager to serve a brigadier they quickly pulled three possible apartments for her out of the databank and she signed herself out on personal time to look them over the first was good the second was better the third was perfect they called it a studio but it had a jacuzzi and a balcony and if you stood just right even a view of the distant potomac river and it had a fine strong bed easily large enough for two persons who were on friendly terms and of course when and if some other person might occasionally share it with her they would definitely be friendly indeed hen she slipped in to take her seat at the team meeting the man from the naval observatory was talking about the cometlike object from space that might or might not have been the mother ship that delivered the pod that contained the equipment that let the scarecrows take over starlab hilda didnt listen very attentively she was thinking of where one might best look for that suitable other person and of whether the doorman would remember all the instructions she had given him about the personal stuff that would be coming from her new york pad by bureau courier she nudged the man next to her and pointed to the coffee pitcher it wasnt until he had passed it to her with a wry look that she realized he was a new face on the team his name was harold ott he was the bureaus number two electronics nerd and no friend of hilda morriseys it was otts disdainful opinion that fleshandblood agents were the hard way to obtain intelligence that could be got a lot more easily with one of his surveillance tools though wrongheaded of course the man did know his stuff but what did his stuff have to do with the ananias team he didnt seem any more interested in what the astronomer was saying than hilda herself ott had his screen up and was idly playing with it doing what hilda could not tell because he had the privacy flaps up he seemed to be waiting for something so was daisy fennell in the chair she was nodding absently as the astronomer complained that although they had identified the object on its approach no one had been paying much attention to it therefore they had a very incomplete orbit and had not succeeded in tracking its subsequent course which would in any case be difficult since it seemed to have been a powered rather than a ballistic flight yes well thank you fennell said now lets hear from dr ben jayya and there was another new face at the table it might have been better hilda thought to have done her apartment hunting on a different morning since shed missed all the introductions as unobtrusively as she could she popped her own screen and did some hunting then she raised her eyebrows and looked at the doctor with more interest dr sidoni ben jayya was a biochemist and he had just been coopted to the team from his regular base of operations which was camp smolley that made hilda sit up she had never visited camp smolley but she knew what it was about so did everybody in the bureau though not too many civilians did camp smolley was biowar and what the hell did that have to do with the ananias team camp smolley began its existence as a topsecret research facility for the development of biological weapons when the united states signed on to the treaty banning these it continued its activities as a topsecret laboratory for developing defenses against biowar when some busybodies in the congress thought that was too close to actually making the things it switched its efforts over to general biochemical researchmost of them anyway in the change it was administratively reassigned to the nbi and the bureau found some uses for its skills it did not think necessary to report to congress as it turned out plenty all three of the weird space cratures had been moved there for maximum security he explained and for convenience in research our primary concern at the moment is feeding them and so we have been analyzing some of the food canisters that they brought from starlab that made sense to hilda there werent many biolaboratories better equipped than camp smolleys and certainly none that was easier to keep private from the outside world however the problem of extraterrestrial nutrition was not a subject that interested hilda a lot and her attention began to wander again so did daisy fennells she was paying more attention to her own screen than to the speaker hilda studied the woman thoughtfully because there was a lesson there for her time was when fennell had been a field manager like herself she had even once run junior agent hilda morrisey when they were trying to infiltrate the religiousright groups that had been setting fire to schoolbook warehouses around the country daisy had been good at the work too until she had made the mistake of letting herself get promoted as hilda just had and now here she was stuck in administration trying to keep people like this biochemist from telling the team more than it had any desire to know about the significance of chirality in organic molecules across the table the man from the state department did seem interested he frowned and lifted one finger to signal he wanted to say somethingit was as close as he ever came to raising his hand there would be serious international repercussions if we let them die he pointed out are you saying there isnt anything you can do dr ben jayya gave him a frosty look of course i am not saying this we have begun many lines of research for instance dr appley has taken cell samples from each of the extraterrestrials if we could grow the cells in sufficient quantity in a nutrient solution we might be able to feed thesecreatureson cells from their own bodies there is after all one thing every animal can digest and that is its own flesh but were having a difficult time finding the proper nutrients and if that fails ben jayya frowned but that is only one line of research as i have just said in addition we are making genetic studies there is the possibility that we can immunize certain kinds of food animals against proteins from the aliens themselves in which case the aliens might be capable of assimilating the meat from let us say a hamster or rabbit which has been made compatible statement of the central presidium the central presidium of the peoples republic of china has released this statement ever mindful of the vital concerns of its many people the central presidium shares their just wrath at the latest provocation of the snarling dogs of global monopoly capitalism they presume to kidnap the unborn child of our heroic peoples republic of china astronaut commander james pengtsu lin let these slavish tools of the multinationals keep their bloodstained claws off this heroic unborn chinese citizen or the consequences will strike terror to their hearts south china morning post hong kong prc i dont think the state department man said severely that thats good enough dr ah ben jayya they must be kept alive the biochemist shrugged of course he said looking at daisy fennell there is also the fact that there are additional stores of food on the starlab orbiter the subject called dopey has urged that a spacecraft be launched to obtain them thats being looked into daisy said quickly but even that you must understand is only an interim solution while our researches must ultimately but he didnt get a chance to finish saying what his researches must ultimately do the door opened and the deputy director came in quietly but changing the climate of the room everyone perked up sorry im late hope im not interrupting he apologized knowing that he was but i think now its time we gave everybody a look at the gadget we took out of our friends so that was what harold ott was doing in the room the man was already on his feet politely elbowing daisy fennell out of the way to get at the master controls as he touched the keypad the room lights darkened and the projectors of a d system arose from the tabletop there was a brief polychromatic haze over the middle of the table then it cleared and turned into an image of something that looked like a coppercovered almond slowly rotating as they watched i thought of bringing one of the actual gadgets in for you to look at marcus pell said chattily but were really not supposed to take them out of the secure lab one of the men raised a hand thats pretty big to go in somebodys head he said doubtfully its enlarged so we can see it better pell explained the actual object is only a little over two centimeters long its a bug all right and weve got three of them thats half the worlds supply wheres the other half the man asked scattered im afraid theres one in general delasquezs head and hes back in florida theres another in the chinese pilotnot the one that just came back the other one we dont know where he issomewhere in china anyway and theres the one the ukrainians took out of the dead dr artzybachova and they let get stolen that one were trying to locate we have some leads the general said testily the people who stole it theyre terrorists right i dont like having that kind of thing in their hands what if they take it apart and see whats inside pell looked courteously at the electronics man harold ott pursed his lips its not that easy here in the lab weve done about all the noninvasive studies we can and they dont tell us much next step would be to use a can opener on one of them but theres a considerable risk of destroying it if we do tissue and hair samples from the extraterrestrials give us clues as to the basic proteins fats and other molecules that make up their bodies but they are not enough without invasive surgery we cant tell what less common compounds are required by their glands nervous systems etc however we have succeeded in isolating a number of their basic chemicals and through polymerase chain reaction and other techniques are capable of manufacturing them in dietary quantities the proteins are the most difficult proteins are basically composed of two parts an alpha helix and a number of beta sheets we have synthesized quantities of these however it isnt enough to put the right ingredients in a kettle and cook them up the planar beta sheets for example must be folded in just the right way still we have produced basic ration packs for each species which should sustain life for a period whether it contains all the required vitamins and minerals is another question we cannot guarantee that the ets will not start developing something like scurvy or kwashiorkor over time the biowar report so you re stymied maybe not he gave the deputy director an inquiring look and got a nod of permission it seems that one of the doc creaturesthe one that isnt a brain surgeonis supposed to be an expert on that sort of thing we think probably he could disassemble one for us and then we could get a better look at it its a pretty impressive little gadget apparently it monitors full fivesense inputs and transmits them to at least orbital distance we dont have any idea really what its range is it uses some frequency that we havent been able to detect it isnt in any of the conventional radio bands and it requires no external power source one of the men said thoughtfully i can see why youd like to take it apart if the alien can do it whats holding you up trouble is we cant communicate with the doc directly he never speaks the dopey talks for him but if he doesnt speak at all well thats another thing wed like to know more about somehow the dopey creature communicates with them daisy turned to the neurosurgeon from walter reed dr evergood are you asking if the extraterrestrials are bugged too it doesnt look that way nothing shows up on x rays well theyve got something ott said stubbornly what about this little muff thing that the dopey creature wears all the time he wont let us investigate it of course we could simply take it he added looking at marcus pell not yet anyway the deputy director said go on daisy the vice deputy turned to the state department man whose one finger was again elevated hilda resigned herself to five minutes of hearing about all the turmoil that was building up all around the world but what he said was the canadians are asking for one of those things since weve got three now they claim theyre entitled to it under the ottawa agreement in return for letting us use the base at calgary to get the people down the president promised marcus pell waved a hand negligently we know what the president promised well certainly keep them informed in due course is that all well no theres also this chinese custody suit pell looked tolerantly amused wouldnt you say thats a bit premature the damn kid hasnt even been born yet thats their point they say the baby has a right to be born on the territory of the peoples republic so that he may enjoy full citizenship what they want is for the mother to come to beijing not later than ninety days from now and stay there for the delivery hmm the deputy director considered for a moment then shrugged next time you see the ambassador why dont you point out to him that unfortunately our domesticrelations courts are pretty well backed up with cases so their suit might not get heard until the babys getting ready for college he gazed benevolently at the man from state then said now im afraid ive got some other matters to deal with brigadier morrisey if you can come to my office for a moment pell didnt speak to hilda all the way to his private suite he was listening intently to the messages coming from his earpiece and she didnt interrupt when they got to the office a man was sitting there he got up as they entered and hilda recognized him solly garand a field manager like herselflike she used to be anyway the deputy director said colonel garand brigadier morriseyyou know each other sure do said garand grinning and extending his hand to hilda congratulations on your promotion hilda pell didnt give her time to respond sollys been running some of our ethnics including the ukrainian group thats financing the irredentists the ones that stole the bug from the authorities you want to tell her where you stand now solly right i guess you know weve got assets in the expat group here in america and now weve got one in ukraine too thats courtesy of the russians because they dont want the ukrainians getting anything they dont have doktornauk artzybachova recovering administration officials at hospital no confirm that doktornauk r v artzybachova has left the hospital for rest and recovery officials declined to speculate on her whereabouts or how long she would remain in seclusion citing her advanced age and the exhausting experiences she has undergone state information agency ukraine background her later solly cut to the chase well we havent located the device yet but now we have a problem its this dr artzybachova the irredentists have tried to kidnap her so shes left the hospital and now shes holed up in her dacha with a few bodyguards she trusts because theyre from old zek families hilda interrupted from what families of old concentrationcamp people from the gulag people who served time with artzybachovas grandfather she knows the irredentists are after her and the zek children are the only ones she trusts only we think one of her guards is actually a terrorist hilda mulled that over for a moment then she turned to the deputy director thats tough for the old lady but why do we care the woman looked pretty much past it in calgary fooled me too pell said sourly thats why i let the canadians have her but it looks like what was wrong with her was mostly missing her medications for a few months anyway we cant let the mob have her do you happen to remember what her specialty was instrumentationoh exactly oh she knows more about the freaks instruments than anybody else whos human does she know enough to get some use out of that bug i dont know but i cant afford to find out the hard way thats where you come in hilda im putting you in charge she blinked at him back in the field in the field hell no hilda sollyll be the field manager but i want you right here supervising and hold it a minute his screen was flashing urgency he turned it away from his guests and took a message then he looked up furious the goddam french he snarled that was a flash from state that mission eurospace was planning to starlabtheyre going through with it the french sent this notehe glanced at the screenblahblah freedom of the skies treaty blahblah is an abandoned satellite blahblahblah so they intend to launch within ten days chapter thirteen with the space freaks gonegone somewhere or other no one seemed to be willing to say wherethe safe house changed character the uniformed guards disappeared so did most of the interrogators a fact which carried an attractive fringe benefit now there was less backandforth calling between the safe house and the bureau headquarters and so the starlab people had a chance at the one secure line dannerman lucked out he got the first crack at the phone and the person he was calling answered on the first ring hello honey he said looks like theyre going to let us out of here pretty soon any chance of dinner tonight maybetomorrow at the latest there turned out to be a very good chance anita berman was a forgiving soul and besides she had been watching the news like everybody else ive really missed you dan she said sounding as loving as ever and ive missed youi cant tell you how much he said meaning it literally too because he was reluctant to say all the things he wanted to say to her with two of the pats waiting impatiently for their turn at the phone anita was saying your voice sounds funny is everything all right well it undoubtedly did and so did hers but he couldnt tell her that it was because the secure line was chaosencoded and then decoded at the bureau before being redirected to the open lines to new york look i have to get off the phone but he looked over his shoulder swallowed said it anyway i love you he gave the nearest pat a belligerent look as he hung up she didnt return it she had clearly been eavesdropping and the look she gave back to him was actually well affectionate but as she took the phone all she said was dandan was calling you its about this french thing hes in the library so he was irritably switching channels he looked up as dannerman entered what french thing is pat talking about dannerman asked the president the presiding officer of the united nations council recognizes the honorable representative of democratic agrarian albania mr t gabo mr presiding officer what is the hurry why are we rushing to a judgment in this matter the socalled starlab satellite has remained in orbit for many years now it will remain for many years more why must we proceed with such reckless haste to authorize a united nations flight to secure and exploit this wonderful technological machinery which we are told will revolutionize our science i will answer that question the haste is due to the desperate hunger a few large powers have to secure these secrets for their own use a gain from which most of our great independent nations will be excluded i say go slow i say wait until the vast majority of the worlds nations have time to catch up so that we may all benefit from this treasure trove my little country of democratic agrarian albania is not rich but we have our pride and we do not choose to be excluded from our rightful participation in this endeavor proceedings of the general assembly vol xxvii p his duplicate jerked a thumb at the screen see for yourself that was how dannerman learned about the eurospace intention he peered at the news story read the french communiquй and then shrugged i guess the bureau isnt going to like that dannermanwithabeard looked at him the bureau is that all you think is there something more to think you just dont get it do you you havent seen the kind of stuff theyve got on starlab what if the french let the scarecrows in again dannerman objected i thought you smashed the whateveritis sure i did as much as i could but what if the french luck out and get it going again dannerman confronted his copy amiably too many ifs to worry about right now he said anyway theres nothing you and i can do about it is there and ive got other things on my mind like getting home the other dannerman sighed then shrugged which brings us to another problem he said whose home are we talking about yours or mine that was a stopper oh right i didnt think of that ritas room isnt really big enough for the two of us is it then he brightened anyway he said i dont think we have to worry about that right now either because for the next couple of nights i hope to be sleeping somewhere else uhhuh the other said and dannerman was pleased to see that he looked faintly jealous from the door a tentative voicepats voicesaid dandan dannerman turned around but it was the other one she was talking to she looked perturbed rosaleens left the hospital in kiev and they wont tell us where we can call her can you find out ill give it a try he said and left them together it took dannerman a moment to figure out which pat it was they had settled on differentcolored outfits from the safe houses stores to tell them apart blue for the real pat a red shorts suit for pat one a sparkly golden sweater for pregnant pat five this one was wearing a gray tailored jackettherefore patriceand she was lingering she seemed to want to say something that embarrassed her what he asked encouragingly she cleared her throat its just dan listen if you thought i was coming on to you well hell i was coming on to you can i explain you dont have to he told me she bristled oh really so what did he tell you exactly well never mind what he said was the truth when we were all in the deep stuff up there and he was the only decent human male aroundall right i admit i got a kind of a crush on him well on you if you know what i mean because when i came off the lander and saw you there i figured hey heres my chance to have a dandan of my own but then i heard you talking to your girl it was his turn to look embarrassed oh dont get uptight you sounded sweet and its okay theres a whole world of men out there i wont bother you again listen he said gruffly it wasnt a bother i was kind of flattered she looked him over approvingly you said the right thing dan shes a lucky girl surprisingly she leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek just as the other dan came back he gave them both a surprised look but what he said was i got a number in ukraine but theres something wrong with the line i couldnt get through but i got some news hildas here were going home shes got a van waiting outside to take us to the plane and right behind him was hilda herself in full uniform with the brigadiers golden stars on her collar points some of you she corrected not you danno the deputy director wants to talk to you hilda wasnt answering questions either not while they were on their way to her little twoseat electro not while she climbed in to the drivers side while she waved dannerman to the other not as she circled around the group loading themselves happily into the van and scooted past the saluting guards at the checkpoint only as they were turning into the road dannerman caught sight of a determined little group of people no more than half a dozen waving handprinted placards the devils are among us and they are the antichrist and succinctly send them back hey he said those people are in the wrong place arent they but howd they even know about the safe house i wish i could tell you she said grimly out of the side of her mouth and that was all she did say she was driving fast and silent with the car on manual so she could exceed the speed limit and she wasnt talking dannerman squirmed around in the bucket seat to look at her face it wasnt telling much she was driving manually and concentrating on it he tried his luck do you want to tell me what pell wants with me she obviously didnt she didnt even look at him come on hilda this is a bureau car isnt it so nobodys listening in is it about the damn european launch she gave him a sidelong look hell have to tell you himself well if its a job dont you think i ought to get a little time off first i want to go to new york she didnt respond to that either he was silent for a moment watching her her eyes were on the road and her face told nothing which told dannerman a lot she knew exactly what the deputy director wanted him for and she didnt think he would like it pacific states ready to share defense burden at an emergency meeting of sopacto heads in papeete tahiti all the states of the pacific region reiterated their demand for complete sharing of all information received from the starlab orbiter and urged that the flight take place as soon as possible prime minister gribforth declared australia will place all of its scientific and technical facilities at the disposal of the united nations in the analysis of scarecrow technology but it must not be a europeanamerican monopoly the states of the pacific region will not be excluded from this venture the bulletin sydney australia he decided that it had to be the european space launch he tried a different tack what i dont understand he said chattily is how the french have the balls to try to take starlab when they know weve got muscle up there do they think were bluffing hilda sighed we just might be she said moodily the dd checked it out the pentagon guys admitted that their best estimate for any of our military satellites was that it had a ten percent chance of still being operational and we only have two that can be maneuvered into position hell dannerman said startled exactly danno thats not all of it either ours arent the only birds up there the russians have two so do the chinese and nasa thinks theirs may be a little more reliable hell and damnation what are you telling me hilda did those people build better war satellites than we did better no she said judiciously the way i understand it ours were a lot more sophisticated they could deal with four or five more targets at once and do it a lot faster but that made them a lot more complicated and those crude old soviet jobs just had fewer things to go wrong with them as they aged she slowed down at the entrance to the bureaus complex while the guard was checking their vehicle for possible explosives someone might have planted in it she said so were trying a different tack were trying to get the un in on the embargo that would mean getting the russians and the chinese to join in she waved to the guard who was signaling the all clear as she started up again dannerman asked are they doing it well she said not really theyre bargaining so what you really need is time like having someone go to kourou and kind of slow them down he guessed maybe someone like me she didnt answer that unless a faint smile was an answer but in dannermans opinion it was all the answer he needed but it turned out to be the wrong answer when the deputy director at last saw dannermanhalf an hour after hilda had gone in ahead leaving dannerman to sit in a tiny conference room to think about how he might handle the problem in kourouhe discovered that pell wasnt at all interested in discussing the french threat the eurospace launch no thats being handled dannerman youre not involved what i want to talk to you about is rosaleen artzybachova dannerman was actually startled but shes no problem is she im afraid she is pell paused looking at his screen making a few changes i understand you want some time off but thats all right itll take a day or two to get our ducks in order hilda will brief you and then dannerman he said smiling pleasantly thats where you come in youre going to ukraine chapter fourteen back in her own familiar environment and especially with that hideous spidery thing out of the base of her skull the recently debugged pat adcock felt kilograms lighter and kilometers happier if there was any little fly in the ointment it was simply that there were too many of her that was a major management problem for the dannerman astrophysical observatory when the four of them finally presented themselves to the staff pat expected an exciting time the whole situation was totally bizarre even to herself and at least she had had the time to try to get used to it what the innocents at the observatory might make of it she could not imagine but certainly they would be baffled and confused and excited and they werent well theyd been glued to their screens like everybody else in the world and they knew all about how the bunch of them had been abducted to some galactically distant penal colony and what happened there when pat explained the dress code that they could use to tell them apart janice the receptionist giggled and pete schneyman who had been in charge of the observatory during her enforced absence asked stiffly which one is going to be the director all four of them opened their mouths but pat was the first to speak we all are she said were going to take turns being physically present here but therell only be one of us at a time we drew lots and pat one will go first it sounds like a pretty lousy arrangement to me the extemporary director observed it sounded that way to pat too she thought about it all the way homealone for a change pat five had an appointment with her doctor and patrice with a beauty parlor then when she arrived in front of her apartment house and got out of her bureausupplied limo with its bureausupplied armed driver and its bureausupplied personal guard she found two men waiting on the sidewalk bundled up against the snow they didnt look to her as though they were there by accident they didnt look that way to the bodyguard either wait a minute please the bodyguard said to her even before the men moved toward the car the driver leaped out to join her his hands on his gun for a moment pat thought there was going to be a firefight right before her eyes but the shorter of the men was holding up some sort of document the two bureau agents studied it asked a few questions and muttered among themselves then the bodyguard turned to pat hes a diplomat she said from china he says he just needs to talk to you for a minute pat hesitated but the two bureau operatives had their guns in their hands now and the waiting men showed no signs of hostility indeed they had no violent intentions dr patrice adcock the smaller one said my associate has a summons for you thank you thats all they turned and walked away leaving pat holding a thick sheaf of folded paper the man was a simple process server and when pat looked at the paper she discovered that she had been served with a suit commander james pengtsu lin plaintiff was demanding of dr patrice adcock defendant that she proceed forthwith to the peoples republic of china so that the child she was carrying could be born as a citizen of his fathers country she thought of telling them they had served the wrong ie the nonpregnant dr pat adcock but what was the point she sighed thank you she said politely to the chinese and to her bodyguards its all right lets go upstairs there were too many of her for the apartment on the upper east side too it had been comfortably roomy for dr patrice adcock but with four dr patrice adcocks living there it was pretty damn cramped the pats had done the best they could to resolve the difficulties theyd drawn lots for sleeping quarters and pat considered she had done well on that draw she hadnt got her own bedroom no that was the one with the canopied bed and the hot tub and it had gone to pat five as a courtesy to approaching motherhood the two guest rooms had gone to patrice and pat one pat herself had the neverused maids room small yes remote from the rest of the apartment sure but the maids room not only had its own private little bath it had a fullfunction screen monitor the original purpose of that pat supposed was so that the maid could do her meal planning and recordkeeping without interfering with her employers but it worked so the fact that pat couldnt be in the observatory didnt mean that she couldnt do astronomy as soon as she was out of the boots and heavy coldweather slacks she made herself a cup of mint tea sat down at her workspace and began digging into this crazy eschaton thing the bureau had exerted pressure where it was needed as a result some university library had messengered her its file copy of the frank tipler book the physics of immortality she opened it gingerly for the book was packed in its own custombuilt casing with a note pasted to the front cover that said it was in delicate condition and should be handled with extreme care that was true enough the old woodpulp pages threatened to crack as she turned them but she was able to read enough to remember the general argument of the book as prissy little dr mukarjee had described it for his class in that ancient graduateschool seminar at caltech what tipler called the omega point dopeys people seemed to call the eschaton but it was the same thing and of course it was unbelievable the only thing going for it was that some pretty powerful beings somewhere in space seemed to believe it very much on earth there was still a lot of disbelief around even about the reality of dopey and the docs for pat who had seenand touched and even smelledthe aliens from starlab there was no question these were real extraterrestrials all right but most of the world had seen only the news broadcasts the bureau had allowed and a considerable fraction of that audience skeptically supposed they were nothing but another set of tv morphs that didnt bother pat what bothered her was the skepticism from her colleagues notably the fiercely combative arguments that were coming from the maxplanck institut fur extraterristriche physik the germans werent just skeptical they were downright libelous part of that particular fountain of hostility pat knew was an old score being settled the germans had supplied some useful information which had helped to figure out what was going on on starlab theyd asked for information about her mission in return she had refused to give it to them naturally they were going to piss all over anything connected with the dannerman astrophysical observatory whoever said that scientists were never motivated by petty angers invasion near what we must do this latest alarming communiquй from the space aliens emphasizes the need for immediate and affirmative action on the proposals of the albanians in the united nations as the nigerian representative to the un mr albert ngoro said this morning in new york the flight to the starlab satellite must take place immediately so that we can begin to protect ourselves from a challenge that is sure to come mr ngoro also added that the flight must be multinational and that one of our fine nigerian weapons specialists should be a major member of the crew daily times lagos nigeria but they had or seemed to have a point what the germans claimed was that there couldnt possibly be any eschaton or omega point or grand resurrection because there wasnt ever going to be a big crunch everyone knew they said loftily that the universe was never going to recollapse but would simply go on expanding forever well there was no doubt about it they did have a point thinking of forever reminded pat to look at her watch and what she saw surprised her it was midafternoon she had forgotten to eat lunch while she was microwaving the handiest thing in the freezer pat five came in looking harried lunch yes maybe so whatve you got there meatballs but ill have to eat fast becausepausing to catch a glimpse of herself in the kitchen mirror and frowningive got to go out again as soon as i change janice was right damn her this isnt my color is it i think ill see what else weve got that might fit me now anyway ive got an appointment with the lawyer the bureau got me to respond to this suit tardily pat remembered the summons wait a minute she said in the middle of putting another carton into the microwave for herself but when she displayed the document pat five shrugged it off we all got one i guess they wanted to make sure it got to the right person arent you going to ask me what the doctor said of course i am pat said remorsefully well brace yourself pat five said spooning swedish meatballs into her mouth what she said was im going to have triplets triplets pat five nodded thats right three of them all girls she thinks but she wants to do another amniocentesis in a couple of weeks and whatve you been doing with your day it took pat a while to get back to her screen because long after pat five had left she was still thinking about triplets three little girls genetically her own daughtersalthough with the unfortunate genetic contribution of their presumed father jimmy lin but definitely her own flesh and blood she couldnt handle that it was a relief to turn back to the eschaton file if the ugly space aliens were right one of the germans had posted then the quantity astronomers called omegathe measure of how much mass the universe containedhad to be more than one okay pat thought there was no argument about that if the universe didnt contain enough mass the force of gravity would not be strong enough to pull it all back together again of course also of course no one had any good way of measuring omega you couldnt weigh every star and galaxy not to mention all the dark and undetectable particles that might add vast amounts of mass to the total so you had to try to estimate it from other valuesvalues that you could measure sort of though with considerable difficulty and with huge error bars values like analyzing the ratio between distance and rate of recession to see if there was any evidence of slowing expansion for that investigations in a great many areas were under way though what a pity it was pat thought that they were so prone to giving contradictory results taking one consideration with another the consensus among earthly astronomers was that the results that gave an omega of less than were probably more trustworthy than the ones that didnt that was what the germans were contending and for all of her professional career pat had shared that view but not everyone did and among those who did not were apparently those fantastic creatures whose images had appeared on the worlds tv screens two years before the monstrous horch with their snaky long dinosaur necks and their brutal faces and the even uglier scarecrowbodied beloved leaders they could be wrong too pat told herself but they were obviously a lot more technically advanced than human beings so maybe they knew and maybe it was true that at some unimaginable time in the future she and everyone else she knewand everyone she hadnt ever known or even heard of as wellwould be reborn in this improbable eschatological heaven medical report gross morphology of extraterrestrials docs classified the physical measurements of doc a are height cm weight kg resting pulse resting respiration for doc b height cm weight kg

side instead of hair they possess a chitinous white growth on face axillae and genitals it has not been possible to obtain x rays or blood samples however stool urine and saliva samples have been obtained which are currently under study curiously few microorganisms have been observed even in the excreta it is desirable that additional studies be carried out but the subjects do not respond to our efforts to secure their cooperation when the doorbell rang it was the livein guard who responded peered through the spyhole opened the door it was a permitted visitor in fact it was dan dannerman escorted there by his own guard as the guards retired to wherever the guards went when they stayed out of the way pat looked him over which one are you she asked he grinned wryly im the stayathome one and you the same that is she added the one that still thinks youre a shit dan he didnt protest and pat felt quick sting of remorse she tried to be more friendly i thought you were off with your girlfriend she said more sociably i was but now ive got a job to do thats what i want to talk to you about he hesitated and then said without preamble its about rosaleen artzybachova shes in trouble her life is in danger then he noticed the expression on her face whats the matter he demanded we buried rosaleen months ago she said christ pat pay attention im talking about the other rosaleen i know who youre talking about but when you tell me her life is in danger its just kind of funny he looked at her with disapproval i thought you and artzybachova were friends we were are what about it she needs help there are terrorists who are trying to kidnap her for what she knows about that alien technology you were so hot for do you want to help her or not help her how he looked uneasy but said ive been ordered to go to kiev to take care of things there itd make it a lot easier if you came along medical report gross morphology of extraterrestrial dopey classified the physical measurements of dopey are height cm weight kg pulse ranging from to respiration ranging from to the cause of the variations in pulse and respiration are not known and do not seem to relate to changes in stress or emotional state the subject which speaks english is extremely recalcitrant and states that it will not cooperate in further studies unless demands are met which it says it has already communicated to relevant authorities stool samples have been obtained and are currently under analysis preliminary reports have not yet been received why shes scared pat she knows the terrorists want her and shes not letting anybody near her that she doesnt know she knows you pat said stalling for time actually dannerman said she doesnt or at least not very well its the other dannerman she really knows not me but she and you have been friends for years whats the matter are you afraid and she naturally had to assure him that she certainly wasnt afraid and in the process didnt notice that he hadnt said what things he was going to take care of chapter fifteen when hilda morrisey met with the woman from the fzb as the russians had taken to calling their current successor to the cheka it wasnt in the gloomy old russian embassy and it certainly wasnt at bureau headquarters they met on neutral ground a steak n shake a few blocks from the embassy when hilda protested that they shouldnt be talking about secret matters in a public place the woman laughed at her her name she said was grace she was a lot younger than hilda and a lot prettier and better dressed too iridescent tanktop that made the most of her brassiereless breasts and as mini a miniskirt as hilda had ever seenthe latest thing from the ateliers on nevsky prospekt no doubt dont worry dear colleague hilda she said it is quite safe here all the busboys are friends we call this place our commissary since the food in the embassy is not great and indeed there was never a moment in the whole time they sat there when a busboy or two wasnt nearby rattling dishes at the tables of any other diners who might have overhead anything dawdling over clearing the nearest tables so that no one could be seated too close in the old soviet days the country of ukraine did not get the respect it deserved most of the world called it the ukraine as though it were some mere backwater province while the countrys russian masters did worse they made it a province to patriotic ukrainians this was an infamy wasnt ukraine as early as the tenth century the first christian kingdom in the area wasnt it under the princes of the rurik dynasty an empire of its own with the russian hinterlands no more than a province itself and wasnt it about time that glorious epoch was restored the two of them confirmed their recognition signals with no problems only when they came to the specifics of the pickup grace demurred you would prefer to use an american aircraft out of the question dear colleague it would certainly attract attention no we will supply a brandnew russian mig vtol it is the same model we sell to the ukrainians themselves and it will have appropriate markings i have already chosen the pilot a very good man he will whisk your people to moscow not moscow vienna grace put down her chiliburger but why vienna we can supply perfect security for you in moscow your plane can be waiting at the airport to take them home a quick transfer no problem vienna hilda said firmly grace sulked for a moment then gave in and they spent the rest of the meal discussing why moscows dynamo team could beat any western footballers and then back in the bureau headquarters hilda changed back into her uniform while talking on the secure lines to frankfurt going over the arrangements solly had made with the assets in ukraine everything was set for the mission but it was wrong it was the first time one of hildas chicks had gone off on a mission without hilda herself lurking somewhere near was there any chance that even now the deputy director could be persuaded to dump solly and let hilda go where she properly should go near to the scene of action there wasnt when she reported to the deputy director he scoffed at her take field command you not a chance hilda ive got a job for you here youre going to take over from daisy fennell alarm bells went off in hildas head running the damn team meetings among other things yes pell said his tone suddenly frosty things are heating up im locked into all the negotiations with the un and thats turning into a fulltime job so im turning all the operational stuff over to daisy for the time being and youre the best choice to take over her assignments i dont mean just the team meetings i mean handling the freaks and keeping an eye on the starlab bunch youre the one who knows them best what well certainly youll still be in charge of the ukraine thing too if you need help requisition it now go talk to daisy shes got her hands full daisy had her hands full all right she was in the middle of some problem with the catalans and the basques and a field manager from bangladesh was waiting to talk to her about asian drug gangs she waved hilda to a seat while she finished dictating a note to the spanish police then leaned back and regarded her congratulations hilda she said lets see where do we start youll need to go out to camp smolley today the freaks are bitching about their food andwell everything anyway the one that looks like a parrot is but the other two are having troubles too what kinds of troubles daisy waved a hand theyll tell you all about it when you get there then theres the team marcus doesnt want to lose momentum with the experts so he wants a meeting every day all those people every day you can choose the participants yourself you probably dont need the astronomer anymoreor do you its your call and probably you can skip today if you have to there wont be much time before you get back from smolley thenwait a minute she frowned as her screen buzzed at her listened for a moment then said apologize to him ill be with him in five minutes ten at the most she turned back to hilda sorry where was i oh the starlab people in new york guards and surveillance are being handled by your old office ive instructed them to report to you but there havent been any problems the chinese are still trying to get their hands on the pregnant one and the damn floridians are pissing and moaning about letting their general delasquez get killed or abandoned or whatever happened to him up there she thought for a moment then leaned back and smiled so what about it hilda how do you like life in the fast track the answer was very little but all hilda said was id rather be out in the field daisy said sympathetically i felt that way too at first but you get used to it and theres a time to settle down isnt there listen while i think of it my husband and i were wondering if youd like to come over for dinner hilda goggled at her husband when had that happened and what did daisy want one of those things for maybe tonight youve never seen our house have you so about eight and theres somebody frank and i would like you to meet all the way out to camp smolley hilda was fuming to herself time to settle down time to turn into another daisy fennell the worst part of it was that she hadnt ducked fast enough now she was committed to dinner with daisy and frank and franks really nice partner in the realestate business richard who had lost his wife to a mugger two years before and was just the kind of man hilda ought to get to know she swore under her breath then as she drove up to the entrance of the old biowar establishment it got worse there was a police corps lieutenant directing traffic at the turnoff impatiently waving hilda away with the other commuters until he saw her uniform then he saluted and allowed her to enter the public road that led to smolleys access but when she reached the gated drive to the labs there was half a company of police lining the far side of the road across from the twometer berm that surrounded camp smolley itself nearly a hundred picketers stood behind the police line shouting and waving banners beware the antichrist from space god is not mocked there is only one true word and one other small group shooed away from the other by the police who had a different crusade on their minds their placard read free dopey and the docs am traffic advisory no bomb or freefire zones have been declared in the district or immediate environs there is unusual crowd activity at the white house and in the vicinity of the national bureau of investigation headquarters in arlington at present the situation is orderly but alternate routes are advisable damn these people how did they know the aliens had been moved here under the tightest security the bureau could provide but here were the protesters naturally the protesters had no hope of getting into the biowar plant itself even brigadier hilda morrisey couldnt pass until she parked her car and went through a metal detector a patdown and a bureau cadet with a sniffer like a portable vacuum cleaner to make sure there were no traces of banned chemicals on her person then they wouldnt let her take her car the remaining half kilometer to the building proper therell be a shuttle van here in a moment maam the guard officer said you can wait inside if you like welcome to camp smelly she didnt like she did it anyway sitting with an unwatched news screen for entertainment it wasnt entertaining what was on at the moment was an interview with that colonel whatshisname dusomething the french astronautor wouldbe astronaut because as far as hilda could tell he had never actually been in space the interview was in french but after the first few seconds an english voiceover translated his words we will be ready to launch to the socalled starlab within the next few days he said the american threat it is pure braggadocio i am not afraid they dare not shoot us down there are no national boundaries in space and we have as much right to go there as they do son of a bitch hilda said out loud startling the lieutenant who had come in to get out of the damp chill oh not you she said waving at the screen that son of a bitch and those sons of bitches across the road too oh dont worry about those people maam the lieutenant said earnestly do you see that berm out there surrounds the whole base and there isnt only full electronic surveillance its mined antipersonnel mines squirrels and birds wont trigger themthough we got a deer oncebut i guarantee none of those creeps will get through and here comes your van he never got a chance to tell the man that what she was worrying about wasnt the protestors breaking into camp smolley it was how they had known enough to be there in the first place when she got out of the van she was searched again before she was allowed to go through the ostensibly simple wooden door of the ostensible ancient mansionneither of which had ever fooled anyoneand then had to be searched one more time before she was allowed to pass through the real door bankvault thick ponderously opening on its huge hinges with a hiss of air being admitted to the loweredpressure anteroom behind it none of that was really necessary of course no one thought there was any real need for category five containment for dopey and the two docs if the things had brought any horrible alien plagues to earth with them there had been plenty of opportunities to spread the disease before they ever saw camp smolley but the director had decreed category five containment hilda would have done the same not for any epidemiological need but just to cover your butt for the congressional inquiry that sooner or later was sure to come hildas heavy uniform coat was taken away from her and then she was allowed into the wing where the aliens were housed the warmth was wonderful after the damp cold of outdoors but suddenly camp smelly began to deserve its old nickname the stench of alien metabolism was startling in one room the two docs were kept one characteristically standing immobile the other very uncharacteristically lying on a pallet on the floor with two or three medics hovering around the cadet who was guiding her explained its diarrhea brigadier morrisey they were trying to get some minerals into their diet they think it was the soluble calcium and iron that did it now captain termans waiting for you in the laboratory there were two more armed guards in front of the laboratory door but they stepped aside to let hilda and the cadet enter the stink of the laboratory was different from the one that came from the sick doc but not a lot more pleasant it seemed to come from an opened canister captain terman stood there watching a medic carefully measure out spoonfuls of what looked like lavender slime the stuff had orangeandblack lumps in it and it smelled like a brewery charityat a price when the high governors office announced that our brothers to the north were graciously willing to remove the device that was implanted in the brain of our brave astronaut general martin delasquez they were polite about it they did not mention that the yankee authorities have presented a rather large bill for the costs of these services if our information is correct the only services the washington government will contribute is the provision of a room for the operation to take place in the actual surgery will not be done in fact cannot be done by any north american it will be performed by the very doc creature which general delasquez himself did so much to bring to us so once again we floridians learn that gifts from the north are never without a price el diario miami florida the captain was an elderly man even more past his proper ageingrade than hilda had been and he waited until the canister had been capped before he turned to greet her sorry i couldnt meet you myself maam he said not really sounding very sorry at all but theyre very strict about how much of this we can give them at a serving has the cadet told you what we do here i can see what you do here hilda said looking around show me what else you do then i want to talk to dopey what they were doing was a lot through a plateglass window she got a look at a sterileenvironment biology lab everyone inside wore clean suits and face masks one woman was starting a centrifuge two men were titrating drops of something into petri dishes of something else three other people including dr ben jayya were clustered around a screen with dancing curves of red and blue and green doing what hilda could not guess in another room there was a long table that contained half a dozen objects mostly metal they were not any kind of objects hilda had ever seen before with a shock she realized these were some of the things the rocket had brought back from starlab inside a containment hood two technicians were carefully dismantling a sixsided goldcolored object the size of a hatbox dopey says its a recording unit captain terman told her wait a minute ill give you a better look he turned on a wall screen and she was looking down into something that didnt look like any recording unit she had ever seen no revolving spool no drive heads what was coming out of the machine layer by layer was a succession of flat thin hexagonal things that looked more like filter paper than any mechanical device but in half a dozen different colors some of them faintly glowing we have three of these captain terman said with satisfaction so we figured we could try to take one apart that other stuff junk mostly that long green thing looks like a crowbar if you ask me thats what it is theres no internal mechanism at all do you want to see dopey now probably whats he doing being debriefed of course wait a minute ill show you the captain touched the controls again and dopey appeared the little alien was perched glumly on a chair surrounded by his debriefers his cat whiskers were drooping and his fan had turned leaden gray he was talking in a low monotone and when hilda tried to make out what he was saying she frowned is that spanish hes talking why the captain looked unhappy he said he was tired of speaking english and both herrera and ortiz are bilingual he was quite insistent hes not easy to get along with maam he looked aggrieved you know that belly bag of his it wasnt the most sensible question anyone could ask hilda was looking right at the thing what about it well the lab people want it for study only he wont let us take it the last man to try that hilda said remembering the flight back from calgary nearly got electrocuted yes maam they know that but they think they could use insulated tongs or something funny thing is it doesnt seem to shock him you know i cant figure that part out anyway he complains that our teststheyve been going over it with radiation counters and thingsthe tests are depleting its power reserve and he cant live without it do we have any idea whether thats true no maam only one way to find out thoughtake it away from him and see if he dies but i cant do that without orders hilda nodded eyeing the man she wasnt going to be the one to get him off the hook if someone ever gave that order it wouldnt be hilda morrisey well let that go for a while lets go see him as soon as dopey saw hilda he pushed his way past his debriefers and scurried over to her colonel morrisey you must help mewhat he paused to listen to something one of the debriefers said in spanish then apologized oh it is now brigadier morrisey my congratulations please make these people understand that we are starving we must return to the starlab and get more of our food you have food captain terman said quickly glancing at hilda it is not food it is certainly not our fooda teaspoon of that at a time thats all you give usand that other stuff will kill us you see what happened to my poor bearer it is only diarrhea the captain said the medics say hell be better as soon as he gets it out of his system and what if i get it too dopey bristled his whiskers at them i do not like to complain brigadier morrisey but these people simply do not know me can you not have one of the dr adcocks come here or even an agent dannerman someone with whom i have been through adversity who appreciates the sacrifices i have made who would surely not allow these people to give us such foul food hilda was losing patience shut up about the food for a while she commanded but i cannot it is not as though i am asking you for something on my own behalf alone brigadier morrisey if you go to the starlab orbiter there is more than food there there are wonderful things things that will be of great value to you i have given captain terman a complete inventory she turned to the captain who looked defensive he gave us some kind of a list sure but its gibberish i didnt bother passing it along because who can make sense out of quantum pseudorationalizer and things like that it is not my fault that your language does not contain terms for truly advanced technology dopey said i want that list hilda ordered crisply do we at least know what the things look like when we do go back to starlab well want to know whats what i could ask him to describe them all the captain said doubtfully describe but why do i not have my bearer simply draw pictures of them for you dopey said eagerly i thought he was sick it is the medical one who is sick do you see what your diet is doing to us oh please brigadier morrisey give us proper food and arrange a flight to starlab so that we can get more and added as an afterthought and please please do instruct one of the dr adcocks to come here so i will have the company of at least one person who understands me before hilda left camp smolley the captain had managed to turn up drawing materials and she had the satisfaction of seeing the uninfected golem begin to turn out meticulous sketches of strangelooking machines i want these copied and couriered to me every day she ordered this isnt satisfactory performance captain why havent you done this before mr sanjit rao will the delegate from the estonian republic yield mme pt padrylys no i will not yield to the delegate from sri lanka the estonian republic cannot allow this inquiry by a few large powers to the exclusion of the smaller nations whose right to the fruits of any technology arising from interplanetary activities is clearly delineated in general assembly resolutions and and on this subject i have a right to be heard the president the delegate from the estonian republic has indeed a right to be heard however her time has expired and if we dont get on with this hearing we will be here all day proceedings of the general assembly he looked hangdog theres been so much to do he complained you didnt even hear about the war stories he was telling war stories stories you wouldnt believe maam weve got them all recorded if you want to hear them she did want to hear them she was running late would have to go directly home to change for daisys damn dinner party but she waited an extra ten minutes while one of the techs produced the chip with the interrogation records on it and then she got out of there there would certainly have to be a lot of changes at camp smolley she thought as she drove back onto the road when she could switch the car to automatic she popped the chip into the cars player the man had been right the stories were hard to believe they werent war as hilda morrisey knew war they were stories of annihilation of whole planets destroyed by dropping asteroids onto them even of whole solar systems wiped out by making a sun go nova the people of those planets werent human of course but they were so dopey had said quite intelligent quite civilized quite advanced cultures which had simply refused to accept the scarecrows as their masters so there was an actual war going on and it was universe wide she sighed and turned off the player not one word of it sounded plausible to her it was the kind of childrens fantasy you came across on the television when you were idly hunting for something worth watching and immediately moved to the next channel it couldnt be true the astronomers had been definite about that the universe was not going to recollapse in the first place and if it did it surely would not bring about the miraculous rebirth of everyone who had ever lived a category which for hilda included a fair number of people whose deaths she had personally helped to bring about and certainly did not wish ever to meet again but if it were true hilda morrisey didnt spend much time thinking about her own death and certainly not about some possible afterlife if anything she hoped there wouldnt be one when hilda thought about dying at all she thought of it as a sort of grant of executive clemency being dead meant you didnt have to face any more consequences of things you had done that someone sometime might want to hold you accountable for she didnt want to think that she could have been quite wrong about that the next morning she woke early and with a great desire to get the taste of daisy fennells quiche and ratatouille dinner and the chocolateraspberry dessert that followed it out of her mouth her little apartment had a fully stocked kitchen so hilda was able to make herself some real oatmeal and pour herself some honest coffee not flavored with mexican chocolate or florida limes she had not expected so much domesticity from daisy and she especially had not expected the two teenage girls that frank had brought to the marriage jesus she thought and put the dinner and franks partner richard out of her mind forintel sitrep nbi eyes only the spanish police have asked us to investigate possible stateside activities by members or sympathizers of the basque nationalist organization the euskadi ta askatasuna it is thought that such persons particularly in southern california are active in supplying funds and possible weapons to the basque separatists in the atlantic seaport towns of northern spain no other new alerts are reported at this time all current surveillance operations will continue the first thing she did in the office was recheck all the arrangements for dannermans mission he was in kiev he hadnt yet made contact it was now up to the locals to get him to artzybachovas hideaway the second thing was to report to the deputy director who scowled ferociously at what she had to say pickets around camp smelly now how the hell did they know where to go and it wasnt a rhetorical question either find out he ordered and why havent you convened a team meeting today dont give me you didnt have time you have to make time hilda and your man dannermanthe other oneis being a real pain in the ass deal with him he did not say just how the dannerman who wasnt in ukraine was being a pain but hilda had a pretty good idea when she got back to her little office she half expected to find him waiting there he wasnt but there were five messages from him in her mail increasingly hostile in tone demanding she call him back she didnt she was perfectly sure there would be a sixth call and she would decide how to deal with him then meanwhile she had other things on her mind she dialed the locator service and instructed it to find junior agent merla tepp and have her report then she gritted her teeth and dropped in on daisy fennell to thank her for the perfectly lovely time fortunately daisy was busy they had at last located the last of the gang that had kidnapped and killed the presidents press secretary and she was assembling a team to bring the man in dont go away she ordered hilda and finished giving orders on her screen then she turned and smiled how did you like richard frank says he was really interested in you hell probably call you that would be nice hilda said dismally daisy cant we do better than this captain terman whos running camp smolley oh terman daisy said yes i suppose youre right he lost a leg in the field and the director gave him that job himselfknew the family i think i guess he thought it didnt matter because terman was basically just a caretakerwho needed camp smolley but if he cant hack it anyway what i wanted to say about richard but hilda was reprieved when daisys screen buzzed at her again it only took a moment then she turned and looked blankly at hilda funny thing she said its that spanish business the police got an anonymous phone tip and when they checked it out they found a munitions dumpall kinds of stuff even mininukes the funny part is our assets in the basque community in california they think it was the basques themselves that phoned it in she shook her head listen hilda its crazy around here today but how about you and i having lunch one of these days you know girl talk i want to tell you more about dear richard there wasnt going to be any way of avoiding a lunch and girl talk but hilda was firmly determined to avoid dear richard no friend of daisy fennells would do even for an occasional bed partner but it would be nice to have somebody hilda thought back in her office cadet merla tepp was waiting she stood up as hilda came in you called for me brigadier if its about my application to be your aide hilda waved that aside what its about she said is the fact that there were bornagain pickets at camp smolley yesterday looks like they came from the kind of groups you were investigating how did they know tepp said promptly there was a rumor when i was investigating them that they had a lead into the bureau did they i dont think so brigadier i think they were just bragging the woman who claimed to have it was picked up in the raids and im pretty sure shes still serving timethat was for the arsons in the california schoolbook warehouses i didnt interrogate her myself but ive seen the transcripts what the interrogators concluded was that she was lying there probably wasnt a real body in place here but there might have been a leak in the electronics thanks hilda said you can go the woman tarried maam about being your aide go hilda ordered well talk about it later and perhaps they would she thought she was certainly going to need more help here but there were things that had to be done first she put through a call to the electronics man to tell him that someone seemed to be able to tap into bureau business she called personnel to produce a list of candidates to replace captain terman what she needed she thought was a fieldgrade officer who knew enough about biology and technology to shake up die teams at camp smolleyor at least knew enough to know who to requisition as his operations officers she was studying the personnel files of the first three candidates when agent dannerman appeared at her door she turned to scowl at him and he was scowling back at her whats happening with the other one he demanded she elected not to bother with reprimanding him for walking uninvited into her office hes on a classified mission out of the country i know its a classified mission and i know its out of the country its in goddam ukraine where rosaleen artzybachova is and its none of your business danno howd you even know about it christ hilda the pats talk to each other you know he took one of them with him she sighed and shook her head its not your operation and its classified tell me one thing he insisted whats he supposed to do with her when he finds her rescue her or cut her head off chapter sixteen it was the first time pat adcock had ever traveled on a passport actually on two different passportsthat were not her own and it was certainly the first time she had had to do any of that cloakanddagger hsstherearethepapers stuff it made her nervous on the way to frankfurt she slept as much as she could she knew that with the wig and a lot more makeup than she had ever worn before she didnt really look a lot like herself but she didnt want to test it by talking too much to her seatmates she worried about making her connections but when she walked into the lobby of the airport hotel there was dannerman smoking a large cigar and studying a german paper just as he was supposed to be liebchen he cried ma cherie and as he flung his arms around her and gave her a surely unnecessarily big kisshis stiff german beard scratched her cheek and the son of a bitch tasted horribly of cigar smokehe whispered in her ear give me the passport and tickets she didquite openly because the bureau spooks who briefed her had had no confidence in her ability to be surreptitious and although she watched carefully she didnt see what he did with them all she saw was that he picked up his briefcase from the armchair tossed his newspaper down put out his cigar and offered his arm and as they left the lobby she looked back and saw that yes just as had been planned somebody was casually picking up the paper along with whatever dannerman had slipped into it as though simply to see what the days soccer results were like on the aeroflot flight to kiev she hoped to feign sleep again but dannerman was having none of it probably it was the suppressed actor in the man she thought irritably he was playing his part to the hilt then it was champagne for the two of them because the honeyblonde flight attendants were glad to make the flight as comfortable as possible for herr doktor heinrich sholtz the statistician from the gesellschaft fur mathematik und datenverarbeitung mbh who was combining business and honeymooning with his pretty french bride yvette and how charming it was that neither of them spoke the others language and so they could converse only in english the second bottle of champagne came with the compliments of the captain with his best wishes for the newlyweds it went well with the pale pink caviar it wasnt such an awful assignment after all pat conceded to herself in fact the whole thing was turning into an adventure flushed with the wine enjoying playing her cloakanddagger part she thought of the three other pats who had been passed over she admitted to herself that she had been a little jealous of them sure they had suffered privation and fear and even pain but they were the ones who had had the excitement too had been to places where no other human had ever gone had met alien creaturesall thatwhile all she herself had had to talk about was boredom and aggravation in the bureaus jail it was only fair that she get some of the thrilling stuff now while they were condemned to stay at home because the bureau didnt want to risk didnt want to risk abruptly pat set the champagne glass down dannerman turned solicitously to her is something wrong yvette not really heinrich she managed to say but it was untrue what was wrong was that she had suddenly realized what it was that the bureau didnt want to risk it was what the other pats and the other dannerman knew those little facts about their captivity somewhere in space that the bureau was not prepared to share just yet with the rest of the world if these terrorists should capture them they would surely find ways to make them tell everything they knew while if she and dan were captured even the most painful interrogation was bound to fail because there wasnt anything of that sort that those two could tell but that would not keep the terrorists from trying pat had never been in eastern europe before for that matter she hadnt been in any part of europe frequently enough to know it her overseas traveling had been limited to the usual grand toursingapore japan the prcthat had been uncle cubbys graduation present plus an occasional weekend seminar for the seminars you flew in and you flew out and there wasnt much sightseeing in between you spent your time in colloquia and cocktail parties with your astronomical colleagues if you found an hour or two for a quick peek at whatever the local attraction happened to be in whatever otherwise indistinguishable city that particular meeting chanced to be held in you counted yourself a lucky tourist in kiev she was a very lucky tourist as long as she was able to keep the thought of what might happen if they were discovered out of her mind there was a lot to enjoy the great gate hotel was surprisingly comfortable the food was goodwell interesting at least there seemed to be more garlic in the borscht than she had expected the service was uneven but always friendly with a lot of what a pity you come in winter kiev is so beautiful in spring the chestnut trees in bloom everything fresh and lovely the only thing that troubled her was the bed what was wrong with the bed in their room was that there was only one of it it was a big bed with a comfortable mattress and a giantsized duvet to keep them warm but there was only the one the ukrainians evidently felt that a married couple particularly a honeymooning married couple had no need of separatebutequal accommodations for a moment pat had actually tried demanding that dannerman sleep on the floor but all that had got her was a warning finger to the lips and being dragged to the bathroom there with the shower running full tilt to cover his whispers he pointed out that slavs had a notorious habit of bugging foreigners and they were after all supposed to be newlyweds it wasnt until they were actually retiring that night that it occurred to pat to wonder just how newlywed they were supposed to act but he got chastely into his side of the bed and decorously pajamaed she got into hers and that night at least the unseen observers if any didnt have anything interesting to watch meanwhile there was sightseeing what they had to do was to wait until they were contacted by whom by the zek children who were supposed to be rosaleens bodyguards but who he explained might also be members of the ukrainian nationalist terror group who were planning to kidnap dr rosaleen artzybachova for purposes of their own meanwhile they were to conduct themselves just as the newlyweds herr doktor and frau doktor heinrich sholtz would and once they were contacted what were they supposed to do then that was where dannermans explanations became vague and unsatisfying rescue dr artzybachova of course he said but when she asked him why they didnt simply turn the matter over to the local pot lice all he could say was that some of the police were probably also members of the terrorist group themselves the two of them would have to thwart the terrorists plan on their own he didnt say how meanwhile they acted their parts dannerman conscientiously reserved for their third day in kiev a car with a germanspeaking driver to take them into the evacuated zone around the ruined chernobyl nuclear power plant when pat said plaintively that it was dangerous there he said for the benefit of any possible eavesdroppers but we must ma pauvre petite otherwise how can i explain our visit here to the people who pay expense accounts they visited the ryemarket and the ancient catacombs by the banks of the dnieper riverless extensive than the more famous ones in rome but ghoulish enough to give pat pause it wasnt that she found those narrow underground passages frightening it was just that she found it obscene to stare at the mummified remains of ancient monks when you were dead you were certainly entitled at least to privacy they attended a folkdance recital one evening and an opera on another they told everyone they happened to meet just what the herr doktor sholtz and his parisian bride were doing in kievengaged in a lengthy statistical analysis of health problems resulting from the chernobyl disaster and therefore desirous of getting a look at the territory to make the numbers come alive and they looked at every cathedral and museum the city had to offer the area which suffered the worst fallout from the old chernobyl nuclear explosion is called the zone of alienation and it was evacuated immediately after the accident it didnt stay evacuated old people came back because they didnt want to change their ways and they died there their families came to bury them some stayed so did their descendants some of them hunting mushrooms in the forests and selling them in kiev some simply scrabbling out a living for themselves on the old farms over time they were joined by hermit types and a few people hiding from the police in all a few hundred people still live in this area of nearly square kilometers pat found that she was enjoying herself she was amused when a woman with a notepad in her hand urged them to sign a recall petition for the ukrainian un delegateuntil the woman found out they didnt speak ukrainian and obviously werent eligible to sign she was surprised to see how much kiev resembled any american city cops patrolling in pairs against possible urban violence hawkers selling their inflationproof merchandise just as though they were in new york it was actually kind of funprovided you were careful not to think too much about what might go wrong surprisingly dannerman turned out to be an easy traveling companion well she shouldnt have been surprised pat thought remembering the longago days when they played together as children on uncle cubbys estate but that had been years past and a world away the two of them had changed she had become a rather respectable astronomer and he damn him had turned into a lousy gumshoe for the national bureau of investigation what astonished her was how easily living their roles as carefree sightseers they had both turned back they were even playing house again just as they had when they were nine or ten years oldthough she reflected with an interior grin without any of those youshowmeyoursandishowyoumine games they had graduated to a little later of course that sort of thing wasnt out of the question even now might actually enhance their cover as honeymooners if indeed they were being watched amused at herself pat brushed her teeth and even picked up dannermans clothes where he had dropped them over the edge of the tub as he changed into his pajamas as she was folding his pants she discovered something odd there was an unexpected sort of interior pocket at the waistband and what was in it was a peculiar little glass pistol she sniffed it there was a faint odor of vinegar it was one of those strange little chemical steam guns they called bombbuggers hell she thought glumly they were not children anymore of course and they werent playing a game here in ukraine so when they climbed into the big welcoming bed pat turned away and stayed virtuously on her own side so did dannerman and those unseen observers if any got nothing interesting to look at that night the next morning it was snowing again pat viewed it with mixed emotions maybe they wouldnt go into the evacuated zone after all but dannerman was firm the car was hired the snow was only a light dusting he was definitely going she could stay in the hotel if she was that frightened of a little residual radiation but that would make her whole presence here pointless wouldnt it all through breakfast she considered that option but who was dannerman to tell her she was frightened then when they arrived in the lobby complete with parkas and boots the concierge was apologetic yes he had arranged their picnic baskets which the doorman would put in their carthere were no restaurant facilities in the evacuated zonebut it would be a different car the germanspeaking stefan had had an unfortunate accident he would not be able to take them after all however the concierge had arranged for another man vassili very good spoke little german but his english was excellent and he knew the zone very well besides he was already committed to go to chernobyl that morning in order to drive an engineer who worked with the monitoring crew back from leave he would drop the woman off at far rainbow the town where the workers lived and then simply take them on to the reactor itself she would not be in the way she would have her own food as would the driver also she knew the zone well and perhaps could tell them things even vassili didnt know at least the car was bigger than pat had fearedthe woman engineer sat in front with vassili and dannerman and pat had the fairly spacious backseat to themselvesand it had a good heater pat dozed on dannermans shoulder for the hour it took to get to the zone proper and only woke when she heard the driver talking to him they were passing a structure like a toll plaza on an american superhighway that sat on the other side of the road the road wasnt any superhighway it was paved but it had a hard and potholed life there were two or three cars going through the structure on the other side and the driver explained check wheels cars people for radioactivity do you see us also when we come out the woman rattled something and the driver grinned and translated she says easy to get in not so easy to get out you step in wrong place you pick up radioactive mud then you have to take shower and wash clothes before you leave no hot water either so please be careful where you step what is being concealed are there indeed intelligent creatures living on other stars in our universe yes we are told there are and some representatives of them are currently being held incommunicado in the chambers of the american spy agency do they possess priceless information which is being withheld from the great mass of peoples of the world there can be no question of that either what must be done to rectify this wrong there can be only one response the general assembly of the united nations must convene its emergency session and seek yea demand answers to all these questions elahram cairo behind them was a little village of small houses it was one of the purposebuilt places where the people of the town of pripyat had been rehoused after the great explosion ahead was nothing the dead zone didnt look particularly dead in its coating of snow and when pat said something the driver spoke briefly to the engineer and reported no is not dead she say you come back in two months in spring and you see everything wonderful green trees meadows even crops still coming up in places only nobody eat them too much cesium you know what that is you eat them your children have two heads unless you die first it seemed that the engineer did have a little english after all because she wasnt letting vassili get away with any of that for the next twenty minutes all the way to far rainbow she spouted facts and statistics to the driver who dutifully translated the flow of ukrainian to dannerman who in his incarnation as visiting research scientist dutifully made notes when they had dropped her in the company town the driver turned and made a face at dannerman and pat how she talks amazing he said and said nothing more until they were well clear of the town then he stopped the car he peered up and down the deserted road then turned to his passengers you get out now i must search you for weapons then we will meet a friend and he will take us to dr artzybachova chapter seventeen rosaleen artzybachova stood as much as she could of the solicitous yammering from the three of them then she retired to the bathroom she did not actually have to move her bowels and when she did have to she managed the feat expeditiously enough still there she was perched morosely on the pot for half an hour and more because where else in her little dacha could she be alone even so she could hear them muttering to each other outside the bathroom door they were getting impatient they wanted decisions made and actions taken soon enough marisa would be knocking in polite inquiry or yuri would to ask if she were quite all right in there soon enough she would have to come out then she would have to face their tender bossy concern again she didnt want to what rosaleen artzybachova wanted was to be left in the sort of peaceful solitude that had seemed so boring to her just a few months before all this began and now seemed like heaven she sighed gloomily yearning for the tedium of those endless games of chessbyfax she stood up and flushed the toiletnot that there was anything there to flush apart from the sparkling water from the dnieper river two kilometers away she ran some more of that water in the sink and looked at herself in the mirror in just a few years she would begods sakea hundred she observed herself critically she was definitely more hunched over than she had been a few months before that was osteoporosis one of the side effects of those months in the captivity of the beloved leaders without her medications and it would be with her for the rest of her life once the calcium was gone it didnt come back but at least she had stopped losing it and taken all in all she looked no more than well perhaps seventyfive eighty at the most but ninetyandsome was how old she truly was and wasnt that enough of an age to content any reasonable human being was it worth the trouble to try to prolong it the zek children wanted her to prolong it they wanted to save her from all the threats that were building up around her and it would be impolite to refuse their kind if unwanted solicitude when she opened the door marisa was standing there the girl had a couple of towels in her hand not because she was carrying them anywhere but to provide an excuse for being in that place at that moment all right rosaleen artzybachova said roughly but fondly you see for yourself that i did not die in there so please put those silly towels down and sit somewhere the dacha of doktornauk rosaleen artzybachova had only four rooms but that was because she only wanted four it wasnt her fathers dacha though it was built on the same tenth of a hectare on the same hillside fiftytwo kilometers from kiev with the same prettyif distantview of the dnieper river her fathers dacha had also been four rooms but those rooms were slapped together of roughsawn boards from the trees at the top of the hill it had not been anything like a luxurious country home it was hardly heated at all apart from one fireplace and the jawbonedtogether tangle of copper water pipes that was meant to but seldom did conduct some of the fireplace heat to the bedroom of course it was lacking electricity and running water and of course it had been taken away from the family when the gehbehs carried her grandfather off to the camps when rosaleen began to be distinguished in her field it had given her some satisfaction to buy the dacha backcheaply enough after that whole area had been contaminated by the explosion in the chernobyl power plantand then to tear it down and have the new one built in its place which had been not at all cheap since the workmen demanded and got triple pay for the risks of working in the zone of alienation in the dachas spacious living room tamara and yuri were somberly watching a news channel the pictures on the wall screen were of dopey and the two docs caught as they were being escorted from one place to another somewhere in america but rosaleen could not tell where because the sound was off wheres bogdan she asked he has gone to find an untapped phone tamara said he will be back very soon i think he says we may have to move tonight tomorrow morning at the latest also there is another legal notice in the incoming all right fine rosaleen said and gestured toward the samovar while marisa was getting her a glass of tea she sat down on the comfortable chaise warmed to body temperature and thankfully free of the bedding her guests used since there was no actual bed on the premises for anyone but rosaleen herself she didnt ask what the legal notice was about she knew somebody somehow had persuaded the village clerk to make a fuss about her ownership of the dacha again it was purepurepure chickenshit she thought to herself her americaacquired vocabulary always useful for such matters no one contested that dr rosaleen artzybachova had owned the dacha in fee simple what they were making trouble about was that it was clearly established in the official records that dr rosaleen artzybachova had unfortunately died having left no will and therefore with her estate reverting to the government although this new dr rosaleen artzybachova certainly seemed to be in some sense the same person there would have to be a hearing and a court determination and and yes it was chickenshit all right rosaleen knew that the only thing those powerful unseen someones really wanted to accomplish was to get her out of the safety of her house for what precise reason rosaleen did not know but was sure it was an unpleasant one she took a lump of sugar from the tray tamara offered and placed it in her mouth as she sucked the first scalding sip of the tea through it tamara waved shyly to the picture on the wall screen doctor what was it like to be a captive of those horrible creatures were you frightened mr l korovy and in our own country of ukraine what do we see our inflation rate has trebled for no other reason than apprehension in our financial circles over the impact of these new technologies from space and whose efforts are largely responsible for wresting these precious articles from their source and bringing them back to us why none other than our own dear doktornauk emeritus r v artzybachova yet the americans have usurped them from us and all the world this is clearly unsupportable it is the evident duty of the united nations general assembly to with immediate effect begin a formal investigation into this matter and then to ensure that the fruits of these discoveries are shared with all the worlds people particularly those who like ukraine have done so much to obtain them proceedings of the general assembly yuri clucked angrily at her impudence but rosaleen shook her head at the man she was grateful to all her companions in this new captivity but small young tamara was the one who touched her heart she expertly tucked the sugar in the corner of her mouth and said yes i was frightened my dear what was it like very much like it is here crowded frustrating worrying like being imprisoned anywhere although you all smell better than the extraterrestrials did indeed she said smiling fondly at her three protectors no doubt better than i will in just a moment since as long as bogdan is not here yet i think i will do my exercises tamara nodded and began to set up the exercise machines marisa said fretfully but where is bogdan where was he tugging at the weights of her exercise machine before the great picture window rosaleen asked herself the same question it was curious that a short time ago she had been trying to postpone the discussion as long as she could and now she was impatient to get it over with all down the slope of the mountain the snow was still thick the picture windows layered thicknesses of thermal glass and inert gases shut the outside cold away from the people in the dacha but rosaleen knew exactly how bitterly cold it would be out there if they had to leave she did not look forward to being cold she didnt look forward to leaving her dacha at all as a matter of fact but bogdan was firm she could not stay here he declared well she knew that apart from anything else she could not allow her companions to remain in this place where the ground was soaked with cesium and all the residual radiation permeated even the house they were in true there was very little radiation left now not enough to kill not even enough to make one sickhad she not lived in it herself for the years of her retirement before pat adcock called her to the adventure of visiting starlab but in those prestarlab days no one had lived in the house but rosaleen herself and her do itall housekeeper and companion both too old to worry about the real dangers of the radiation those dangers were primarily to unborn children so many had been born with incomplete hearts or brainless heads with quickgrowing cancers with every sort of damage rosaleen would certainly never bear a child but what about these young people who were protecting her bogdan of course said that he was well aware of the problem and was monitoring their exposure and he was the one who gave orders he was the doctor in fact that had been useful in getting her out of the kiev hospital where she had not been safebogdan had said so himself that was useful still because he was the one who kept reporting to those who wanted to come and interview her that she simply was even now not well enough for that kind of stress she trusted bogdan his grandfather had been the one who had tried to keep her own grandfather alive in the camps of dreary memory he had found the other zek children to guard her and wait on herall descendants of men and women from the gulagtamara who was bogdans own niece yuri and marisa from families his family and her own had known for generations in the final analysis it was family that was important to ukrainianseven to cosmopolitan ukrainians like rosaleen artzybachova herself except that to certain ukrainians the ones who wanted to regain for ukraine the imperial status it had had under the grand duke cyril it was the nation that was important when in april of the controllers at the chernobyl nuclear power plant managed to blow the thing up the resulting explosion spread a dusting of radioiodine cesium and hundreds of other radioactive isotopes over many thousands of square kilometers of the ukraine and adjacent belorussia in much of that territory the human inhabitants stayed where they were in spite of growing numbers of childhood cancers and shortened lives because they had nowhere else to go in the worst of itthe socalled evacuated zonethe people were moved out but their livestock and the wild creatures who shared the space remained the animals didnt disappear they suffered their own cancers and mutations but without a human population to hunt or exterminate them they multiplied rosaleen could not understand those people to be ukrainian yes that was a good thing she felt that herself to have lasting angers against the russians yes that too from soviet times from czarist times before that the russians had shown contempt for ukrainian customs languageand people but to want to make russia a mere province of a greater ukraine as in the longforgotten day of cyril that was simply insane which did not mean that it wasnt real if there was one thing about human nature that rosaleen artzybachova had learned in more than ninety years of life it was that people frequently acted quite in sane rosaleen was just getting out of her afterexercise shower when she heard the excited voices from outside she grabbed for a robe and was still tying the sash dripping wet under the towel cloth when she saw what was going on little tamara was already in her fleece jacket assault rifle in her hand going out the door to take her post commanding the road yuri had turned the enabling switch for the mines buried under the pavement and had his hand hovering over the button what they were looking at out the great picture window was a little electric car whining up the grade it was bogdans car but there were more people than bogdan in it he had rosaleen observed without surprise found more than an untapped phone marisa was scrutinizing it through her glasses its bogdan driving she reported but there are two other men and a woman in it i know one of the men vassili i dont know the others hes stopping yuri said marisa took the glasses away from her eyes to give him a nervous look youre not detonating the mines are you yuri didnt even look at her he picked up the desk phone tamara theyre supposed to get out of the car there keep them covered if tamara answered rosaleen couldnt hear her but what yuri said was happening the little cars doors opened and bogdan and a woman got out followed a moment later by the other two men squeezing their way over the front seats to exit through the only doors the car had i dont know them marisa reported and rosaleen clenched her teeth give me the damn binoculars she ordered and when she had them to her eyes studied the people carefully then she set the glasses down i do she said two of them anyway pat adcock and dan dannerman they were with me in captivity chapter eighteen he was waiting for hilda in her office when she got back from her five minutes with the deputy director lt col priam makalanos fiftyfive years old but looking no more than midthirties tall solid reliable pulled in from a dirty job in hanford washington to become hildas new chief at camp smolley makalanos hadnt been in the top three of the candidates personnel had offered her but he had one big advantage over the others as a brandnew agent he had been part of the team that hilda had run in el paso cleaning up some smugglers of fake antibiotics although makalanos had had no more sleep than you could catch on a redeye across the continent he had already been out to smolley on his own initiative and was brighteyed and bushytailed as he sat across from her hed done more than just visit too hed brought back some samples i understand theres a team meeting this morning he said so i thought you might like to show these around he opened a duffel bag on the floor and pulled out a purplish metal object hexagonal the size of a hatbox to put on hildas desk its one of the food containers she said yes maam this ones empty and its been cleaned and sterilized and these are some of the drawings the doc made the things that are on the starlab orbiter he added pulling out a sheaf of papers well damn the man hilda thought halfannoyed halfproud of her choice there was such a thing as almost too much initiative but as she glanced through the papers pride won out over annoyance they were wonderfully clear sketches of objects she didnt recognize but were clearly strange do we know what the things are she asked sort of yes i had the dopey identify them as much as he could welldone she said now youll need to familiarize yourself with the situation when you get a chance pull up the backgrounders on camp smolley and the whole starlab business already did maam i played them over on the flight well she said good for you all right the team people should be getting together already so you can take this stuff up there ill be there in a minute medical report food supplies of extraterrestrials classified the food supplies consist of four items a leafy vegetable greenish yellow in color a compressed bar dark gray in appearance and with a high water content apparently manufactured another bar greenish in color circular in cross section and gelatinous in texture also apparently manufactured and a small quantity of brown powdery substance perhaps used as a condiment the two species of extraterrestrials apparently eat the same foods though the docs are not observed to consume the brown powdery substance and only infrequently the gelatinous bar biochemical assays are under way but are hampered by the fact that we have received only a gram or smaller quantities of each preliminary examination following indications from the doc show that the leafy vegetable and the gelatinous bar do contain several sugars including small amounts of sucrose more detailed analysis awaits further study elemental ash content of each substance derived from massspectrometer analysis is attached this does not provide information as to the compounds contained nor of course to the biochemistry data on these will be provided as available she gazed after him thoughtfully as he left makalanos was definitely a good man a good man as a matter of fact and what a pity it was that he was working for her and thus offlimits for any other kind of relationship she wondered absently what wilbur was doing these dayswould he maybe like to fly down to washington one of these eveningsand then turned to her screen what she wanted those few minutes for was to try to check up on dannos progress in ukraine there wasnt much to hear contact had been made there was no subsequent report and then as she got up to leave there was an annoying phone call hilda this is wretched i was wondering if you were doing anything for dinner tonight it took a while for her to realize that wretched was just the mans virginia shore way of pronouncing richard and a while longer for her to figure out how he got her number at headquarters and even longer for her to get rid of the man without either making a date or hurting his feelings so she was five minutes late for the meeting she herself had called but no one complained because they were passing around the food container makalanos had brought they hardly even noticed her entrance senator alicia piombero was there in person today she had the thing in her hand and she was asking makalanos what holds the lid on magnets thats what i would have thought myself maam but it isnt the two rims are so precisely flat that they stick to each other you cant open it without pressing that little tab on the side now if youll just look at your screens and one by one he fed the docs sketches into the scanner identifying them as he did a stark white pillarsixsided againwith vents like a fishs gills along the side according to dopey that ones an environment modifierlike an air conditioner an oddly shaped coppery object he says that has something to do with maintaining the orbiters orientation in space he didnt seem to know how maybe theres a kind of gyroscope inside multichannel radio receivers used for monitoring earths broadcasts a different kind of receiver for the bugs they had implanted in the crew that was sent back to earth a large object with a door like a refrigerator dopey says this is the transit terminal of course this is the way it looks when its in working condition as i understand it the actual one on starlab was destroyed by agent dannerman as a precautionary measure we do have some fragments from it in the lab pieces that were knocked off ive seen the pictures senator piombero said testily pieces of junk a crowbar two or three things were told are recording devices but we dont know how to make them workand what was it twentythree cans of food how come we didnt get anything like the stuff youre showing us now makalanos glanced at hilda morrisey throwing the ball to her alicia piombero wasnt one of the senators hilda actively disliked like eric wintczak from illinois your damn archetypal liberal not to mention old tom dixon from new jersey and half a dozen others who were always a lot too curious about just what the bureau was doing all the same hilda took her time to answer we got what we got senator they tell me it was dopey who picked the items to take back i suppose he was naturally more interested in food for himself she looked around the room im sure colonel makalanos wants to get back to camp smolley any more questions for him before he goes the question i have the senator said testily is when were going to go up there and get those things for that hilda said gratefully we need to hear from delegate kriegs associate here mr downey and while the staffer from the american delegation to the united nations was telling them what complications the un was giving them she nodded to makalanos who quietly departed shed have to get out to the biowar camp herself and see what he was doing she told herself maybe after lunch provided she could get this damn meeting over with it was about time hilda thought that she got some personal help she thought about the person who had volunteered for the job merla tepp would she do while the speaker was droning on hilda furtively accessed tepps file most secret from brig gen justin t carpenhow to joint chiefs of staff subject extraterrestrial weaponry the full text of national bureau of investigation meetings on statements made by the extraterrestrial dopey in regard to weaponry employed by the socalled scarecrows in subjugating or annihilating other extraterrestrial species is submitted herewith particular attention may be given to the weapons of mass destruction these included destroying a planet by diverting a large asteroid or comet to strike it and triggering a release of bound underwater volumes of carbon dioxide from its sea bottoms an even largerscale effect is claimed by causing a star to go nova this apparently in cases where the enemy species has bases on several planets or in orbiting habitats within a system submit copies of this text be forwarded to pentagon longrange planning section for analysis and determination of possible inclusion in research efforts most secret it didnt take long to scan through it there wasnt much to scan high school grades not startling but good the same in college with a degree in of all things agronomy no near relatives person to notify in case was a widowed aunt by marriage who lived near frederick maryland also on a farm good scores in basic training with special commendations in marksmanship and martial arts good efficiency rating in cadet school and in the field two more commendations for the job with the radicalright godder groups her request for transfer to arlington listed to be near family as the reason and hilda smiled at that the reason was because arlington was where the promotions were of course but tepp knew enough not to say so tepp was hilda thought an awful lot like the young cadet captain hilda morrisey herself right out of the training corps and as determined as this one was to make a reputation for herself which meant that merla tepp probably had a good chance of going a long way in the bureau and also that she would bear watching that was all right hilda had no doubt she could take care of herself against any ambitious junior quietly she put through a call to have merla tepp join her on the afternoon trip to camp smelly hilda liked driving the little twoseater but this time she let tepp drive so she could both observe her and chat her up there was no doubt in hildas mind that tepp understood this was a kind of audition for the part she was doing well she drove competently and fast stayed on manual even on the highway and expertly passed the vehicles on automatic keeping up her end of the conversation civilly respectfully but not deferentially boyfriend no no boyfriend at least not around herethough aunt billie was always wanting her to meet some of the young men from her church what kind of church oh presbyterian no aunt billie wasnt from the fundamentalist part of the family friends yes some she was getting along well with the others in the general scutwork pool one of the women had suggested the two of them take an apartment together but she really liked being by herself and when they pulled into the access road for camp smolley tepp glared at the pickets defying the chill and damp as they waved their posters and shook her head theyre everywhere arent they maam theyre really good people but its about time they got a life and tepp was clearly impressed as she should have been by camp smolley itself smolley hadnt been quite mothballed once the united states signed the convention against biological warfare it still did a little contract researchon phages for the national institutes of health on diseases that were affecting the atlantic cod population what was left of it and the nebraska cornfields but it had kept its tradition of total security if anything it was even tighter since colonel makalanos had come aboard he met them at the inner door looking not at all like a man who had had essentially no sleep for more than twentyfour hours youre a tribute to the bureaus wakeup pills hilda told him but i want you to get a nights sleep tonight this is cadet tepp he shook hands then said theres something id like you to look at before we go in to see dopey him hes fine i let him sleep for a while and now hes busy telling the debriefers about this universal war thats going on wait ill show you as they entered the workshop room he snapped on a screen and there was dopey speaking in english again hilda paused to listen for a moment yes the horch managed to penetrate our channel for that broadcast fortunately i was able to jam most of their message what else was in the message nothing of importance only more of their vile libels against the beloved leaders no the horch didnt come to starlab in person that is a foolish question if they had i wouldnt be alive to talk to you they are utterly ruthless ruthless hilda thought this from the creature who had cheerfully told them how his own people wiped out whole planets she noticed a faint smile on colonel makalanoss face and saw that he was looking at tepp the womans expression was pure horror as she stared at dopey makalanos cleared his throat over here brigadier he said pointing at a workbench you remember the recording device they were disassembling well there was a problem there certainly was the device was in a sealed cubicle now glassfaced with attached sleeves so that the workers could work on it from outside dry pure nitrogen maklanos remarked seems it was taking up moisture from the air and that hadnt helped it a bit two of the dissected parts were on the table next to it and they looked well moldy where mold had been scraped off so that the original material was visible the parts that had once looked like cardboard were now gelatinous and splotchy whatever the gadget had done it was clear that it would never do it again ive ordered a hold on opening the others makalanos reported the bio team has taken samples and theyre working on them in their own lab i havent had dr ben jayyas report yet i was about to talk to dopey about it but perhaps youd like to question him yourself she would she did the creature gave her a lofty look but surely you understand that your primitive technology cant hope to deal with truly advanced devices can you deal with them for us no of course not not me personally dopey looked surprised at the question that is what bearers are for are you saying that one of your docs could have taken the recorder apart without damaging it could he tell us how he cant talk yes he can and no of course he does not talk that is not necessary he can draw schematics if that is necessarythat is provided he hasnt been so starved on the inadequate diet you give us that his faculties have been impaired i dont want to hear any more about your diet were doing the best we can hilda said grimly but it is simply not good enough brigadier morrisey if you will go to starlab i dont want to hear about that either im asking you about these gadgets dopeys fan turned a sulky pale yellow and i am telling you that they are beyond your understanding why do you treat me this way i have befriended your people at great risk to myself i want you to bring one of my companions down hereone of the dr adcocks or even an agent dannerman they can tell you you can tell us everything we need to know dopey she said persuasively now listen to me for a moment i am listening brigadier morrisey what choice do i have no she corrected you arent listening youre talking what i want to say is that we have two sets of programs here your program is for us to send a flight to starlab to get you more food our program is also to go to starlab because we want to learn from your peoples machines so we have a lot in common do you see but something prevents us from doing that yes brigadier morrisey something does your bickering among yourselves time for change although our delegate to the united nations has continued his wise policy of restraint the patience of the peoples republic of china is not inexhaustible his call for an emergency meeting of the security council must be heeded this newest provocation of the americans in reassessing their inflation indices is the direct cause of the recent large losses in the shanghai stock exchange their preposterous claim to custodianship of the artifacts from space is without justification and we do not even mention their highhanded actions in regard to the child of our brave astronaut cdr j p lin editorial new china journal taipei taiwan prc no thats not it well straighten out the bickering trust me on that what really prevents us is that we dont know what to do when we get there how do we take the machines apart to bring them back for study whats inside them we dont want our people cutting into some piece of equipment the wrong way and ruining it the way we did with your recorder we particularly dont want one of our people touching the wrong thing and getting killedor accidentally blowing up the whole starlab you dont want that either do you that would be no good for either of us so what we need you see is for us to have really good solid detailed information about the machines before we leave on the way to the room where the docs were held dopey waddling sullenly ahead hilda reflected complacently that the skills of interrogation didnt change no matter who you were interrogating eyewitness felon bizarre freak from interstellar spaceall the same dopey had achieved a small concession from her she had undertaken to get one of the pat adcocks drafted to keep him company and now she had gained his cooperation in something that really mattered she hoped merla tepp had learned something from the exchange the woman was clearly nervous but that was not surprising in the presence of one of those bizarre freaks anyway she controlled it well at least until they reached the docs room the great pale golems were standing statue like as usual a medic attendant sitting quietly in a corner of the room taking notes on their behaviornot that there was any behavior to note hilda thought then as tepp got her first good look at them a flash of pure horror escaped her control for a moment even dopey noticed it as he was trying to get up on his platform panting he piped up do not fear cadet tepp they will not harm you the bearers arewerea highly civilized intelligent race it is a pity that it was necessary to modify them but now they can do nothing without orders please will you help me up there i am very fatigued tepp hesitated annoyed hilda picked the little turkey up herself she was surprised to find how light he was and how hot his body he didnt speak merely gazed at the nearest doc who touched his whitefoam beard ruminatively for a moment then moved swiftly to the side of the attendant gently but irresistibly he took the notepad from the man and began to draw tepp made a small worried sound then said tightly excuse me please brigadier she fled hilda was annoyed the smell was getting to her of course but she was not going to let it interfere with her job and neither should tepp hilda crowded over beside the doc watching in satisfaction as the creature swiftly began to draw a recognizable diagram of the recorder twenty minutes later hilda clutching the first batch of drawings found merla tepp waiting for her in the cold outside air hilda gave her a curious look are you all right certainly brigadier im sorry its just i thought i was starting my period hilda looked her over more carefully with dawning suspicion she leaned forward and sniffed tepps lips the odor was definite do you always vomit when youre having your period no brigadier im in excellent health i think i may have eaten something i think hilda said sharply that you just cant stand touching the little freak is that it tepp was clearly shamefaced im uncomfortable yes im sorry sorry isnt good enough hilda said meditating oh please maam no tepp begged fully aware of what might be coming next i do dislike them yes but it doesnt interfere with my duties what do you call what just happened i give you my word it wont happen again please brigadier it means so much to me to have the chance to work with you get in and drive hilda said cutting the conversation short in a way she wasnt displeased it wasnt entirely a bad thing for an american to loathe and despise aliens of any kind but to take this one on as her aide that was going to take further thought on the way back to the bureau hilda devoted herself to catching up on the news on the cars screen the un was making trouble again a speaker at a convention of police chiefs noted an encouraging drop in the number of terrorist actions in the past few weeks nothing important really but she stayed with it and did not speak again to cadet tepp chapter nineteen come on dannerman said to pat adcock halfpulling her out of the car they stood silent in the packed snow while the hooded figure in the parka kept them covered with an assault rifle it was a weapon dannerman knew wellwell enough to suppress any thought of resistance just stand still vassili was whispering nervously do not startle her she is quite young and may do something foolish her she but when the person with the rifle stood up and waved them forward dannerman saw that it was a woman all right in fact no more than a girl long hair spilling out from beneath the hood of her parka and suddenly she was not alone a larger figure definitely a man definitely also carrying a rifle came out of the door to join her he said something peremptory in ukrainian beside dannerman the man named vassili groaned objected surrendered he says to you must immediately take off your outer garments here pat cried in surprise well freeze but said bogdan his english worsening with strain must do it get weapons of you and suddenly he had them covered with a gun of his own they didnt freeze though dannermans teeth were chattering by the time he had been patted down and his carry gun and radio transmitter removed then they were allowed into the house that stood all by itself on the desolate hill it was warm there in fact the house was a pleasant and wholly unanticipated oasis of comfort they came in through a kitchen complete with every device modern domestic technology had to offer they entered a living room with a huge picture window and a wall screen as well as two or three expensive exercise machines scattered among the pieces of also expensive furniture the furniture was not in the least modern it was the sort of thing one might have found in a home of nobility in czarist times with a huge samovar on a table and an icon of some tortured saint hanging above it another man and another woman were there chattering worriedly in ukrainian to bogdan and vassili there also was dr rosaleen artzybachova looking not a bit different than the way she had appeared when dannerman first saw her in the office of the t cuthbert dannerman astrophysical observatory in new york city she was smiling she clapped her hands and spoke sharply in ukrainian then she advanced on pat and dannerman hands outstretched this is a pleasure i had not expected she said kissing pat hesitating only a moment then kissing dannerman as well this is better than our cell on that planet isnt it wait as pat opened her mouth to speak before we talk there is a custom i want to observewhen i am in my home you see she added halfapologetically i become very ukrainian she beamed at the woman who had resignedly hurried into the kitchen and was returning with a tray which contained bread and salt rosaleen said proudly it is what we do to welcome friends and who could be closer friends than we who lived in such proximity for so long eat a little please then we can talk no pat said suddenly rosaleen paused with the tray in her hand to look at her no she repeated no we are not the ones who were in captivity with you rosaleen were the ones who were returned to earth and dan is still a spook for the bureau yes rosaleen said placidly i am aware of that she set the tray down before them and retired to sit down excuse please the fact that i am quite old and still a bit tired you dont understand pat said we arent here just because were your friends were here because this man has been ordered prison cells from space a source close to sen eric wintczak reports that the national bureau of investigation has identified a number of extraterrestrial technologies which it proposes to adapt for use in its own system one is a sort of energyfield containment device to hold prisoners in an escapeproof cell while jailers and others can pass freely in and out another is a way of using devices similar to the implants taken from the returnees to tap into the actual thoughts of the subjecta sort of mind control with unimaginable consequences for civil liberties washington timespost but rosaleen raised her hand to stop her my friends have told me about his orders pat dear they were given to him by some higherup spook by the name of brigadier hilda morrisey in the national bureau of investigations headquarters in arlington virginia this brigadier morrisey is afraid that i will give information away that the united states wishes to keep for itself and so she has ordered young dannerman here to come to my home and kill me she sighed shaking her ancient head i was going to ask you about that but wont you for gods sake please sit down and eat some of the damn bread and salt first pat adcock did as she was told she didnt do it right away she had expected a lot more to happen after what she had saidsomething drastic maybe certainly something at least some kind of startled outburst from rosaleen perhaps some violent action from one of the zek children what she had not expected was to discover that everyone present knew more about dannermans mission than she had eat rosaleen repeated testily and so she ate the bread was heavy dark chunks cut from a round loaf the salt wasnt the sort of thing you shook onto your french fries in america but coarse crystals it occurred to pat that maybe there was something in the salt or the bread some moodaltering chemical maybe something like the daterape stuff she had been warned against in college something that would turn them into mere putty in the hands of these young ukrainian zealots but dannerman seemed to have no such fears he was chewing doggedly away on the tough bread and she could read nothing from his expression nor did rosaleens guards reveal anything except perhaps mild annoyance at the ritual then rosaleen sighed all right she said now that weve all had a chance to settle down would you like to explain yourself dan he swallowed the last chunk of the bread then he said sure but i want you to do something first will you ask your friends to put their guns down better still give them all to youyou do know how to use them dont you why should we do that the one named vassili demanded suspiciously dannerman shrugged rosaleen studied him for a moment then spoke lets do as he says vass give me yours and pile the rest of them in front of me vassili looked rebellious then complied pat trying to guess what dannerman had in mind had a sudden thought be careful hes got a bombbugger too dannerman gave her a curious look but slowly carefully tugged at the waistband of his trousers revealing the little holster thats right i want you to take this one too and give it to rosaleen then we should all back away and give her a clear field of fire and at whom should i fire dan rosaleen asked sounding amused why thats up to you you see youre right i did get orders from hilda morrisey and they were to keep whatever information you have about scarecrow technology from falling into the hands of the greater ukraine terrorists the guys he amplified who already stole the bug that was in the other rosaleen they think you can help them take it apart me i cant dannerman nodded i dont think you could either but they dont know that so you were going to shoot me with that thing that was one of hildas options dannerman admitted it wasnt mine i was pretty sure youd agree to be rescued that radio you took away from me its to call a plane to pick us up then the three of us you and me and pat will fly to vienna and then to the states the bureau can keep you safe there safer than i am here with my friends rosaleen asked skeptically well yes a lot safer you see at least one of your friends is a terrorist of course that really hit the fan all four of the zek children were shouting at oncemostly in ukrainian but pat didnt need a translator to get the gist the big one vassili was standing up and pleading with rosaleen but rosaleen was shaking her head stay where you are vass please she said i see now why dan wanted me to have all the gunsassuming of course that hes telling the truth afraid so dannerman said figure it out for yourself rosaleen how did they know what my orders were steam gun this hand weapon colloquially known as the bombbugger contains reservoirs for two hypergolic liquids which when mixed produce a rapid evolution of steam propelling a droplet of liquid at a muzzle velocity high enough to wound or kill an opponent since the weapon contains no nitrogenous chemicals and no metal parts it is a favored handgun for concealment the colloquial name derives from the bombardier beetle an asian insect which uses a similar system to stun and capture its prey you tell me because the damn terrorists have managed to get inside information from the bureau i dont know how but they have and thats how the greater ukraine guys knew but these are my friends rosaleen protested i trust them and anyway that doesnt make sense theyve had all the time they need to kidnap me if theyre terrorists oh not all of them dannerman said i think only one which one i dont know that but probably you do which is the one who told you about my orders and every eye in the room turned on little marisa who began to cry but we never would have hurtyou she managed to get out between sobs and rosaleen put down the gun to take the young woman in her arms my dear she said patting her back i am sure that is what you intended but can you speak for all the others you must tell us all you know they were coming for you tonight marisa said they waited until now because they wanted to take gospodin dannerman as well as a hostage i was supposed towell i wouldnt actually have shot any of you i swear that but i was to make sure no one resisted chapter twenty hilda morrisey put the team meeting off as late as possible because it had been one of those days it wasnt just trying to deal with that temperamental freak dopey or getting rid of the battalion of timewasters who managed to track her down with one damn request or another there was still no word from danno in ukraine either and the deputy director was in a towering rage and now each last member of the ananias team was insisting on making demands of their own marsha evergood you must let me borrow the medical doc to see what he can do with some of our terminal cases the astronomer if you want me to find the scarecrow cometthing you must make every large optical telescope in the country concentrate on checking for possible objects the man from state we must know how to respond to this note from the albanians by tonight they all had one must after another and of course they all had to take time to explain why their particular urgency was more urgent than anybody elses even the ones whose problems hilda could do nothing about the albanian note was the deputy directors concern not hers but it wound up in her lap because the man from state hadnt been able to reach marcus pell that wasnt surprising the note from albania was one of the two things that were making pell crazy because it was clearly the tip of the iceberg every damn pipsqueak country in the united nations was demanding a share in whatever came out of starlab under threat of using their collective veto to make sure none of the big nations got any either well some good oldfashioned political horsetrading would eventually settle that it could probably be handled with a bunch of promises which might or might not have to be kept but what about the other thing that fed the deputy directors fury it wasnt a thing exactly it was senator alicia piombero who had most injudiciously spoken off the record to somebody who had turned around and put it on the record and so the days crop of news stories nbis new spy machine tomorrows prisons in the bureau how scarecrow machines threaten american liberties it didnt surprise hilda that senator piombero chose to miss that afternoons meeting of the team she wished they all had and when at last she was able to adjourn it she breathed a sigh of relief she checked herself out and headed for home because this was the evening she had resolved to take for herself in order to deal with something quite personal and not very far from urgent medical report for bureau eyes only agents assigned to walter reed hospital report that the medical doc has effected a number of apparent remissions in terminally ill patients some patients resisted receiving this therapy as an apparent laying on of hands but blood work and gross physical studies indicate real changes it is suggested that the doc secretes some form of metabolically active biochemicals administered through small penetrations from the talons in his smaller arms attempts to secure samples of these chemicals if any have been unsuccessful the cure rate however is significant especially in intractable cases of immune deficiency carcinomas and most antibioticresistant infectious diseases his major failures have been on patients who already have had surgical intervention for example cardiacbypass procedures brigadier morrisey was not really off duty very oftenshe generally kept herself on call and certainly kept informed of what was happening in her personal turf in the bureau but when she was off duty she was all the way off when she got out of her swirl tub she stood before the fulllength mirror in her bath and studied herself critically for several minutes before beginning to dress first came the underthings that no one in the bureau would ever have imagined her wearing the negligible pantybelt and the pushup halfbra that didnt really need to do much pushing the blouse was windowed silk the kind that opened its mesh revealingly when the wearer was warm as she had every hope she would be in the bar she had chosen for the evening the skirt was midthigh length not a practical choice for a washington winter but she had a long thermal coat to get her to and from her car the pickup bar she had selected was more than twenty kilometers from her little apartment it was over the maryland line but conveniently close to the outer belt hilda was as careful about choosing a territory for hunting purposes as about dressing for the occasion most important it had to be a place where she had never or almost never been before and where she thus was not known and it had to have in the background files of the local police a reputation as a lawabiding and reasonably orderly singles bar it didnt have to be fancy hilda had no prejudices about the economic status of her sexual partners but it had to be fightfree and clean this one was at the fancy end of the spectrum she parked and locked her car herself ignoring the hostile looks of the valet parkers she didnt begrudge them their tip but she was not having any stranger poking around in her vehicle she programmed her carryphone to store all messages lower in priority than directorurgent at that point she was truly off duty and she allowed herself to feel pleasingly expectant as she entered the bar it was a good feeling and she liked what she saw the bar possessed a twoperson band an elderly woman on strings a younger one on synthesizer they were pumping out familiar tunes with a decent beat and four or five couples were actually dancing on the tiny patch of hardwood hilda morrisey was encouraged the evening might well turn out successful because she had almost always had good luck in bars where the customers actually danced it was in just that sort of a place for instance that she had met wilbur the gentle and entertaining stockbroker assistant who was her most recent abouttobe exlover wilbur was a man she was going to miss when she checked her coat the attendant made her check her carry gun and pass through a detector array that too was a good thing though no commercial detector was going to pick up her two emergency weapons singles were three deep at the bar busily hitting on each other hilda made no attempt to join any of them her practice was to check out the available talent before committing herself so she walked slowly toward the ladies room inconspicuously noting which interestinglooking men seemed to be getting close to moving to one of the booths with the women they were talking to and which were still searching there were at least four possibilities she thought and her good luck was that three of them were fairly close together near the service corner of the bar one of them was large fair and amused as he chatted with the little blonde who was not getting anywhere with him hilda noted that he was also a good fifteen years younger than hilda herself but that wasnt really a problem could even be an asset another was an older manbut not too oldand the third she hadnt really had a good look at but the size of his shoulders was promising in the ladies room mirror she checked her hairokay and the little bleachedout circle around the ring finger of her left hand she esteemed herself ready for the encounter as she left the powder room but that was when she saw a familiar face gazing around the bar it was that cadet agent what was her name yes merla tepp that spoiled things hilda didnt like to have bureau people anywhere in sight on occasions of this sort reluctantly she decided it was time to cut her losses and try again on another night or perhaps simply in another place she thought as she reclaimed her coat and gun the night was still young and there were other spots on her list fortunately tepp didnt seem to have seen her but then as she was heading for the parking lot her carryphone beeped that was bad news too it could only be something serious enough to get past her message block and that meant that maybe there would be no prowling for her that night she heard a car door gently close somewhere nearby but paid no attention as she stepped into the shelter of a large van to take her call she never got the call though just then someone hit her over the head from behind hilda was knocked to the ground halfstunned and cursing to herself it was an unpleasant reminder of the fact that not all violence was political quite a lot was generated by people who wanted to own things without the trouble of working for them and it was just her bad luck that a couple of them had chanced on her she struggled to get at her gun but one of the two attackers kicked her arm sending the weapon flying while the other had pulled out a knife it was suddenly looking like a very bad evening indeed for brigadier hilda morrisey and then there was rescue she heard two muffled shots the kicking stopped the men fell away she rolled over getting to her knees ready for whatever was going to happen and when she looked up there was a figure with a gun standing there and it was junior agent merla tepp brigadier morrisey tried to get up got as far as a sitting position and thought better of it she was woozy her arm hurt like hell where one of the bastards had kicked her and her long coat was a filthy mess from the slush in the parking lot she was vaguely aware of sirens coming into the lot and of cadet tepp standing over the prone figures of the attackers then tepp let the cops take over and came back to hilda holstering her gun i called for backup she said apologetically and she had got it more than anyone could need for a simple mugging there were three police cars there and two ambulances one of perps is dead tepp added and the other looks pretty bad she didnt sound upset about having just killed another human being she sounded as though she were making a routine report hilda rubbed a hand over her face good shooting she said what how mr shigasimu yana i speak in support of the remarks of the gentleman from the czech republic it is certainly essential to the wellbeing of our planet that we make maximum use of whatever technologies we may learn from extraterrestrial sources but i would go beyond that for many years japan has urged the resumption of a fullscale international space program on scientific and humanitarian grounds now it is more urgent than ever as the distinguished members of this body are aware my country has languished in the grip of a great economic depression for some years we have the skills and knowledge to participate in this needed space program what we do not have is the capital i submit that it is the duty of the countries which can afford it to provide funding for an enlarged space program in which japan stands ready to play a major role proceedings of the general assembly i saw you going out the cadet explained and i thought i better uh tell you what i was doing here so i followed you and hilda said grudgingly a good thing you did thanks then she eyed tepp more carefully youre pretty handy to have in a dustup didnt i see you got commendations in martial arts yes maam also in marksmanship hilda sighed probably she owed the woman something and in any case she did need an assistant all right do you still want to be my aide fine youve got it report to my office by ohseventhirty in the morning ill be in by eight and ill clear it with the deputy director thank you maam tepp said eagerly and would have said more but one of the medics had left the wounded mugger to the others and insisted on checking hilda out the arm didnt seem to be broken but hilda was aware she was going to have a hell of a bruise the blow to the head was something else she really ought to let them take her to the emergency room the medic was telling her and while they were arguing the police sergeant was strolling thoughtfully toward them rolling a little metal object in his fingers he looked at hilda with more interest than the incident seemed to warrant you the nbi woman who called it in he demanded shes brigadier junior agent tepp began but hilda shushed her she stood up shakily and let her id holo do the talking for both of them oh the cop said he didnt sound impressed he didnt sound particularly happy either but then local police hardly ever were really friendly to bureau personnel well maybe that explains it explains what we searched their car he said and found a locator radio so we checked yours brigadier this was stuck under your right front fender you were bugged oh shit hilda said and didnt have to say what that meant this was no simple mugging these people had followed her from her apartment and what they were after was brigadier hilda morrisey herself she would have none of the medics desire to take her to the emergency room for a checkup nor of agent tepps to escort her home she was perfectly capable of driving and annoyed besides this damn business would have to be reported which meant that people would know that brigadier hilda morrisey was known to frequent makeout bars she was aware as she was leaving the parking lot that there was suddenly a lot of shouting going on from inside the barsomething on the news screen odd enough to have distracted the clientele from the pursuits that had brought them there but it wasnt her business and she had other things on her mind she was halfway around the outer belt when she remembered two things the first was that junior agent tepp hadnt finished explaining what she was doing in the place the second was that she hadnt finished taking the call on her carryphone when the thugs attacked radio intercept received hours transmission follows and then as she listened to the message she learned what the commotion at the bar had been all about she sat bolt upright behind the wheel jesus she said out loud now weve got troubles chapter twentyone pat adcock was the first to reach the old car flinging the doors open but dannerman came slipping and sliding down the snowy hill after her halftugging old rosaleen artzybachova you drive he ordered hustling the old lady into the backseat before trotting around the car to get in beside pat do you know how to drive this thing he asked as an afterthought but she already had the motor going and was turning the car around the cars screen had lighted up as soon as pat turned the key displaying some weird kind of creature that dannerman didnt have time for he slapped it off hurry up he ordered we have to get to the rendezvous before sundown and we dont know if they have friends nearby what artzybachova was pounding on his shoulder turn that back on she demanded dannerman craned his neck around in honest puzzlement what for we can watch tv once were in the vtol do it now didnt you see who was speaking pat resolved the dispute as soon as she had the car heading downhill she reached forward and snapped the screen on again oh hell dannerman said sulkily whats the matter with you what can be so important that we have to see it this minute but then the picture showed an agitatedlooking woman with a sheet of fax flimsy in her hand was received just minutes ago she said we will repeat it now and then we will go to the white house for comments on this astonishing new development stand by please she disappeared there was a moment of whitescreen silence then a picture appeared it showed a bizarre creature with a pumpkin head and a spindly body and a mouthful of teeth and dannerman did not ask again what it was that was so important the scarecrow didnt seem to be speaking it stood stolid before the camerawhatever kind of camera it usedwith its spindly arms crossed over its spindly chest but there was a voice and it spoke in english people of earth your difficulties are at an end we have succeeded in establishing communication with you once again soon we will provide you with further information as to how you may join the legions of sentients who are proud to call us their beloved leaders the picture faded oh christ said pat adcock almost going off the road its starting all over again chapter twentytwo the scarecrow message changed many things for hilda morrisey not just for her for the whole damn world of course but all that she would have to think about later when she found time what it meant for her right now was another allnighter still wearing her makeout dress with no time to go home and change up to her unsatisfied loins in things that had to be attended to this instant if not before loaded on wakeup pills frazzled harassed overtaxed and yes loving it because it surehell beat doing nothing at all lacking a specified job description hilda took a hand wherever she was needed the entire bureau headquarters staff had to be found and wakened and called in the team had to be convened situation estimates had to be prepared current bureau missions had to be prioritized some would go forward unchangedthe clear and present danger ones like imminent bombings ongoing hijack plans missions that involved serious loss of life or major property damagethough probably even some of them would be starved of manpower everything else had to go on hold by am the headquarters was fully staffed and buzzing like a wasp nest and hilda had her own most urgent jobs under control she had time finally to stop in at the clinic and get a pill for the head that was still pounding from the assault in the roadhouse parking lot that turned out to be a mistake about time you got here said the duty doctor we buzzed you hours ago for what for your posttrauma checkup of course the doctor said picking up the phone to call in supporting staff then there was nearly threequarters of an hour gone out of hildas life just when she wanted the time most x rays blood tests peeing into a bottle having one or more medics stare in relays into the pupils of her eyes not to mention the infuriating business of having to count how many fingers were being held up before her it could not be helped shed hoped that no one would have reported the incident that hope was doomed tepp of course had quite properly ratted her out at least no one was having quite enough gall to ask her what she had been doing in a pickup bar probably didnt have to she thought gloomily as she finally made her escape by now the rumors about hilda morriseys sexual habits were no doubt already flying around the bureau just before she went through the door the head medic at last gave her the pill shed asked for you really should get some sleep the medic warned and youve been taking a lot of those wakeup pills theyre not advisable for more than seventytwo hours thanks for your concern hilda said swallowing the pill and walking out on him sleep who wanted to sleep when the world was going insane it wasnt just the bureau it was all of government the president would be getting in an emergency meeting with his immediate staff maybe the whole cabinet the pentagon war room would be filling up all over the world in every country people in high places would be doing just what they were doing here hilda reflected that headquarters duty might not be so bad if it could always be like this it was almost like one of those triumphantly glorious nights in the field when the net was spread and the evidence collected and it was time to spring the trap on the unsuspecting malefactors and open the celebratory bottle of champagne and then as soon as convenient thereafter to perform that other rite of celebration and get laid unfortunately neither one of those was going to happen very fast this time but then hilda reminded herself philosophically you couldnt have everything for now the rush was enough when hilda entered the conference room marcus pell was already in the chair conducting the meeting that for a change was unexpectedly dealing with matters of actual importance he wasnt fooling around either the man the deputy director had in his sights was the astronomer from the naval observatory and the man was sweating yes they did get a line on the broadcast but it was too short for a real fix the source is somewhere within about a fivedegree area but thats a lot of space to examine examine it pell snapped that message came from some kind of a spaceship and i want to know exactly where it is i thought you already had plates of the whole damn solar system not quite that much the man said stubbornly and nobody was looking for this particular emission source unless it turns up serendipitously were out of luck so well need to organize a search the lessons of history our nation which successively endured the tyranny of spain the united states japan and then the united states again for many years is now said to be a free and equal state with all the rights of every other member of the general assembly but do we have them we have been denied a seat on the security council we have been refused our request to make tagalog one of the official languages of the united nations our delegate has been given posts on only the most menial committees of the general assembly and no filipino has ever been appointed to high office in the un bureaucracy and now we are told that our delegate will not even be permitted to take part in questioning the witnesses in the present emergency session it is time to make a stand the forthcoming summit meetings on trade and human rights issues with the united states japan and the peoples republic will be the place to do this if we are not to be given the status we deserve we can retaliate it is our right to do so and it is our duty manila herald fine said the deputy director see to it what about you generallooking at the man from the space agency if we find this thing can we bring any of the spacebased weaponry to bear on it maybe yes maybe no the man said and went into a lengthy explanation of why that would depend on where it was and also on whether or not the damn things would still fire after decades of neglect but the warsats arent in optimum position for that purpose you ordered us to redeploy them to protect starlab if you recall and what position would be optimum the dd said fretfully he too was paying the price for all those wakeup pills again that depends on where it is those weapons were meant to be used primarily against othernation assets and groundlaunched missiles not for targets that can be millions of kilometers away the general coughed excuse me but i have to ask you this are you sure youre going to want us to fire on this extraterrestrial vessel that decision will be made when we have to make it what i want now is to know what our options are pell checked the notes on his popup lets talk about security he said we assume the scarecrows are monitoring all our broadcasts again so we want to make sure nothing goes out to the public about using the orbital weaponry god knows what kinds of armaments these people might have so if it does come to pulling the trigger we want to shoot first and we dont want them warned in advance he paused looking at hilda who had her hand up its the bugs deputy director she said ive been talking to colonel makalanos theres another security problem there remember what the returned people told us they said they knew everything the people on earth wearing bugs knew the dd turned to the electronics man he was calm we havent detected any transmissions from them besides which what would they be going to transmit anyway the bugs dont have a chance to pick up much information while theyre on a shelf in the lab then make damn sure nobody accidentally gives them any the deputy director ordered no conversation inside the lab especially gossiping about what goes on here is that what you wanted hilda the siege of eternity up to a point sir colonel makalanos called my attention to another possible problem the one they call dopey may be bugged tooso as to communicate with the ones that dont talk if nothing else ah said deputy director pell sinking back in his chair now thats a problem he looked around the table recommendations yank the damn things out of em growled the man from the pentagon hilda spoke up i think not if we did that then dopey couldnt communicate with the other two things besides who would take the bug out of the one who knows how if we have to make sure he isnt transmitting it would be easier to kill him outright pell stared at her is that your recommendation no sir only to take precautions we can just keep them ignorant but there are two bugs still in placegeneral martin delasquez in florida and commander james lin in china the man from the state department came alive right can i pass this along to their embassies just the fact that they may be broadcasting to the scarecrows yes make them an offer if they bring the subjects here well have the bugs taken out if not they should at least take maximum precautions to keep either of them from knowing anything that might be useful to the scarecrows the man from state made a note and then looked up one other thing your agent in ukraine has caused us a bit of trouble by i know what our agent in ukraine did pell said irritably cant we just apologize we already have of course they may want more more what the man from state looked ill at ease well theyve suggested informally that we return him and the woman to kiev for possible trial hilda caught her breath but before she could speak pell answered for her not a chance well said the man from state we may want to keep that option open you know theres all this trouble from the little countries in the un theyre even talking about conducting hearings in the general assembly since when do we give a damn what they do in the un hilda demanded but the deputy director shook his head since we want them to support an exclusively american flight to starlab he said hes right lets keep our options open turning her own agent over to some hanging judge in kiev was not an option brigadier hilda morrisey intended to keep open if dannerman had screwed up he would get his lumps but those lumps would be delivered by hilda herself not by some damn ukrainian what she needed to do was to talk to him herself before anyone else did which meant she would have to arrange to see him first she needed to find out when and where he would be arriving and the place to do that was in her office when she got there she found lieutenant colonel makalanos waiting and merla tepp sitting at a desk in the anteroom about those people from kiev hilda began and tepp nodded yes maam i checked theyll be arriving in new york in two hours she said i assumed you would want to interview agent dannerman so ive booked you a place on the courier flight at hours hmm hilda said eyeing her apart from her difficulties with the extraterrestrials the woman wasnt bad at her job which reminded her to ask the question that had been on her mind did you report what happened last night yes maam as required by regulations iahi mentioned that the reason you and i were there was that we were looking into the question of electronic security leaks was that a little presumptuous but it wasnt a bad way to handle the present problem so hilda just said fine get me a car to the courier plane and send colonel makalanos in a doctor showed up uninvited to check her over again and she allowed him to do it while she talked to the colonel dopeys all right he reassured her pulling a sheaf of papers out of his bag when that message from space came in i didnt know if youd want dopey to know about it so i told the people at smolley to keep it under their hats until they got further orders from you well she hadnt lost her touch at picking good staff she didnt comment only asked what have you got there more of the docs drawings according to dopey hes now given us pictures of everything on starlab she nodded give them to tepp tell her to make one copy for me and pass the others on to the deputy director ill look them over on the plane and she rose to shake his hand as he got up to leave priam makalanos had a nice firm grip and a nice male aroma whats more he was damn good at his job as she turned to collect her messages she reflected what a pity it was that he wasnt eligible for anything more personal a fathers rights everyone is familiar with the highhanded actions of the americans in the case of commander j p lin of the peoples republic of china and his solicitude for the welfare of his unborn child or children the delegate of the mongolian peoples republic should support the demand of the peoples republic for the custody of this infant or infants as well as the prcs rights and our own to share in whatever benefits these space persons may bring steppes times ulaanbaatar mpr but the first message on her screen was a note from the maryland police and it took her mind off makalanos they had interrogated the survivor of the two who had attacked her apparently they had been told that she had been carrying big bucks in cash of all things why because she was planning to run off with somebody who had told them this crock of crap the vindictive wife of the man she was supposed to be planning to run off with but the only description they had of this woman was that she was kind of elderly and pleasantfaced and how many thousand women like that were there in the district hilda scowled at the screen was it remotely possible she wondered that maybe wilburs exwife had suddenly taken an interest in who her former husband was seeing and decided to do something about it no not possible at all the whole thing was nonsense there was no exwife only somebody who had wanted to get hilda herself attacked or maimed very possibly somebody she had put away sometime in the long course of her work for the bureau so who was this individual who had gone to so much trouble to get her attacked hilda didnt know she didnt care either she only cared that regretfully she would have to be somewhat more cautious next time she went to a singles bar chapter twentythree all the way from vienna across the atlantic pat adcock was glued to the planes passenger screen trying to understand just what the message from space meant she didnt get much satisfaction from wherever on earth the broadcasts came they were all the same hysteria everyone startled and frightened everyone demanding reassurance and action but there wasnt much of either to be had news of any kind from the scarecrows could not be good news she was glad when the aircraft was settling down toward the airport in new york city and she could get back to the complications of her own personal life which wasnt all that much better the last thing pat wanted was to be back in the clutches of the national bureau of investigation but she wasnt given the choice there they were three of them two of the men had stunsticks in their hands the other standing by their waiting van was an officer with a carbine slung over his shoulder and that was not counting the two agents who had accompanied them across the atlantic now hustling them toward the exit their jet hadnt gone to one of the passenger terminals it had rolled to a stop on a bypass far from the public parts of the airport and there werent even any steps for them to get down to the ground on instead someone had brought up one of the extensible gadgets ground crews used to lift the racks of packaged meals to the stewards galley accordion struts raising a wobbly platform up to the aircraft door go said one of the guards behind them and pat dannerman and rosaleen artzybachova stepped cautiously out onto the shuddery flat it was cold and wet outside though nothing like the chill of ukraine and the interior of the van that was waiting for them was overheated sit down please the officer said the please contrasting with the hostile tone of his voice that was all he said when pat asked where he was taking them he didnt reply she looked at dannerman for support but he was tugging absently at his false beard his expression weary but resigned rosaleen artzybachova who had slept placidly through most of the flight patted her arm theyre policemen she explained it is their nature pay no attention you did nothing wrong that was true enough in pats own opinion but whether the police were seeing it that way was an unresolved question the van stopped in front of a doorway marked airport security which did not seem like a good sign as they were getting out another car raced up and parked a few meters away pat recognized the woman who got out of it hilda morrisey the bureau agent who was dannermans boss she was looking almost as tired as pat herself was and the dress she was wearing seemed to have been borrowed for the way it failed to fit her morrisey took charge she shepherded the three of them into a conference room vacated for her by the airport security people and sat them down the ukrainian government she said looking at rosaleen artzybachova is raising hell about all this so i have to ask you a formal question do you want to go back to kiev dr artzybachova rosaleen shrugged not particularly but id like to get out of this room am i under arrest hilda shook her head of course not once you are debriefed youre free to go anywhere you like you too dr adcock dannerman spoke up and me hilda gave him a chilly look you know better than that dannerman the deputy director wants to talk to you himself well dannerman said in a placating tone i kind of thought he would but theres someone id like to see here in new york so how about if i come down tomorrow not tomorrow youll go to arlington with me on the return flight why dannerman asked reasonably i did my mission heres dr artzybachova where the ukrainian terrorists cant get at her i think im entitled no today thats an order but hilda dannerman began his tone no longer reasonable but rosaleen interrupted him she was smiling speaking of orders i have a question do you know what i think i think that the reporters will be after pat and me to ask questions would you like to give me an idea of what we ought to tell them hilda transferred her chill gaze to rosaleen tell them nothing at all but i dont think that would be possible rosaleen said reasonably they already know i was ah rescuedi do not use the word kidnapped as i believe my government does so tell me what i should say about dans orders should i say that you instructed him to save my life or should i mentionas my friends told methat that was only a secondary option and in fact you authorized him to kill me to keep me from giving information to those foolish children artzybachova hilda said harshly youre screwing around in places where you can get punished punished but why do you speak of punishment when we are all friends here friends do not say things that can cause their friends embarrassment just she added as friends would not deny a friend a harmless few hours on his own would they hilda eyed her for a long cold moment then she spoke to dannerman first thing tomorrow morning in my office or your ass is chopped meat now lets start talking about just what happened in ukraine chapter twentyfour pat didnt mind the joyous clamor with which pat five and patrice welcomed rosaleen well didnt really mind it after all the three of them had shared a whole harrowing existence as captives of the scarecrows that she herself had missed she didnt even mind that patrice hospitably insisted that rosaleen come and live with them theres plenty of room now that pat one isnt here and im afraid the place where you used to live must be long gone by now that was the first pat heard that pat one had been drafted to camp smolley to keep dopey company along with her own personal dannerman there wasnt really what you would call plenty of room either in fact pat gave up her own little bedroom to rosaleen old bones needed a real bed and so pat found that she would be sharing a bed with patrice that wasnt the end of the housing problem there also were the guards when this brigadier morrissey said they would be set free she hadnt mentioned that they would have a bureau agent keeping them company three shifts of agents for each of the pats and for rosaleen as well night and day the agents did their best to stay out of the way slept each night on futons in the dining room but there were so many of them on the other hand pat five said looking at the bright side now we dont have to pay a personal bodyguard anymore do we besides patrice added theyre pretty good about lending a hand for the scut work in the observatory and we can use all the help we can get pat blinked at her for what for the search for the scarecrow ship of course but pat said reasonably now they know where it is dont they i mean they got a line on it from the transmission so thats not our job anymore the need is real telescopes and we dont have any patrice looked at pat five then shook her head oh you dont know do you theres nothing there the scarecrows mustve used some kind of relay to send their message maybe a little drone too small to be picked up the ship itself is somewhere else so were back to square one so like every other observatory in the world the dannerman was officially commandeered for the scarecrow hunt the whole staff was put to work searching old plates every plate every telescope in the world had taken ever since that first observation of the cometlike object that was surely no comet but the ship that had brought the scarecrows to earths solar system not all of the staff was happy about the new assignments gwen morisaki didnt want to be taken off her cepheid count christo papathanassiou was he said on the very point of a breakthrough in his quanta approach to cosmology and he absolutely must have computer time now pete schneyman was worse he was already glum about pat coming backabout so many pats coming backand reducing him once more to secondincommand which was probably why he was so irritable when he complained that checking stock images for some serendipitous observation of possible cometlike objects was the kind of thing you turned over to a machine or if you didnt want to waste valuable machine time on it then to some twoforanickel postdoc the only one who didnt seem to mind was their planetary astronomer harry chesweiler the solar system was his turf anyway his only request was that he be allowed to confine his own searching to the plane of the ecliptic where he might get some useful data for his own studies even janice dupage the receptionist was drawing lines in the sand she was willing to do what the pats told her to especially because it was what the government wanted but she warned that it better not last longer than a week or so because her vacation was coming up and she wasnt going to miss out on her cruise to the amazon and rio de janeiro not to mention that it didnt make any sense to treat her like some irreplaceable astronomical expert when geez dr adcock she wasnt really any kind of a real scientist anyway was she to all of them the pats turned a deaf ear there would be no exceptions everybody and every computer was to be totally immersed in the hunt for the scarecrow scout ship they even impressed into service the bureau agents because even an untrained cop could lend a hand now and then in principle the hunt was simple enough you looked at a recent picture of a section of the skyrecent being defined as anything in the past couple of years since the scarecrow scout had dropped its probe off to leech onto starlab you compared it with an older frame of the same area and what you looked for was to see if there was a dot in the new frame that hadnt been there before there was nothing to it notes and comment since the time of the babylonians at least probably since the days of the neanderthals human beings have scanned the night skies for points of light unaccountably moving among the fixed stars the first of the wanderersthey were called planeten in greekwere the nakedeye planets from mercury to saturn as well as the brightest hairy stars or comets with the invention of the telescope the number of wanderers multiplied beyond counting new planets from uranus to pluto the myriad smaller rocks of the asteroid belt comets by the thousand that never reached nakedeye brightness the tally of bits and pieces of rock and snow that swing though space as part of the suns gravitational domain grew so huge that professional astronomers hardly bothered to count them anymore much less give them names until it became a matter of urgency to find the one faint dot among the anonymous millions that was neither asteroid nor comet but something quite different and far more worrying the new yorker except that there were some tens of millions of images that needed to be pulled up out of the worlds astronomical archives and examined except that there were thousands and thousands of those little dots to be considered since the space around earths sun was crawling with comets and asteroids and bits of cosmic debris of every sort that were not the scarecrow scout ship except that most of the plates had no precise equivalent and one had to be reconstructed the computers did the bulk of the work they were quite good at taking one image of a quarterdegree square section of say the constellation virgo and manipulating it to an exact match with another plate that included most but not all of the same stars the computers were also quite able to identify a point of light in one that didnt exist in the other the computers were even then able to sort through the infrared and radio images of the same area if any existed to see if there were spectrograms or other data that could identify its composition well enough to reject it as normal or flag it for further investigation but then it took a human being to decide about that identification or to order new observations by some available telescope to clarify the point and to try to figure out an orbit all this effort was bearing fruitof a sort previously unidentified comets were being discovered every few minutes so were new asteroids if you could call some of those pebbly carsized things real asteroids but the scarecrow scout ship remained elusive rat adcock did her best to wake early in the morning the advantage of that was that you got the chance to jump right into the shower without waiting in line time was when one real bathroom and a closetsized half bath for guests seemed perfectly adequate in the apartment but that was before the new pats and the ukrainian visitor had come to share it on the third morning of the regime she missed her turn rosaleen had wakened earlier still and was first in the showerand the old lady did like to take long long showers while pat five had already preempted the half bath and showed no sign of coming out of it either grumpily pat joined patrice in the kitchen putting together coffee and some sort of breakfast patrice inclined her head toward the half bath where pat five remained closeted morning sickness again i guess she said poor baby yeah poor baby pat said pouring herself a cup of coffee and taking it into the living room to drink in solitude but that was denied her too because there was a knock on the door it was the bureau guard who had remained outside all night long and he was letting in a pair of uniformed people pat couldnt identify theyre from the united nations they claim they have official business with all of you he said but keeping one hand on his gun anyway the taller of the two pulled out a sheaf of blue folders subpoenas from the united nations he said pat giggled we already have them she informed the man but he shook his head not these theres going to be a special committeeofthewhole session of the general assembly to look into the starlab mission and youre all ordered to testify patrice looked incredulous all of us all of you and about twenty others the un man said theyre even subpoenaing the space people so brace yourselves for a long day chapter twentyfive hilda did her best to argue so did the deputy director but the director herself was adamant forget the legal crap she ordered it doesnt matter if they arent human beings it doesnt matter if you think you can get a tame judge to void the subpoenas the general assembly wants those freaks there to testify so they will or the one that talks will anyway we dont want to piss the un off any more than they already are but hilda began and didnt finish the director firmly overruled her thats what the president says and thats what were going to do outside hilda complained to marcus pell this screws everything up weve been keeping the ets closed up and ignorant dopey doesnt even know anything about the scarecrow message yet so how are we going to keep it that way if hes up in new york and the damn general assembly people start asking him questions you cant the deputy director said flatly and held up a hand to preempt argument go get the damn things and take them up there ill order a plane for you get she got seething they had gone to a lot of trouble to isolate dopey and the docs there had been plenty of argument about that too that doctor from walter reed marsha evergood had been bitter in opposition to hildas decree she wanted the medical doc to keep up with his faith healing or laying on of hands or whatever it was that he did and wasnt content that she was to be allowed to bring a few of the transportable cases to camp smolley for his ministrations but hilda had the authority and what she said was what happened the technical doc kept on pouring out his meticulous scale drawings and dopey continued to complain and everything was going fine until now colonel makalanos wasnt pleased either but he didnt have the rank to complain yes brigadier he said i can get them ready in ten minutes but that means yes she said that means were going to have to tell dopey some of the things weve kept from him ill do that now you get the van ready although the bureau had provided hilda morrisey with a plane to get her parade of freaks up to the un hearings it wasnt one of the bureaus deluxe jets it was a damn courier aircraft it had few amenities not even coffee and it wasnt big enough for the sixteen of them the problem wasnt the human passengershilda herself pat one and her semi attached dannerman along with colonel makalanos and hildas new aide merla tepp it was the aliens dopey and the two docsand the eight count em eight guards the bureau had deemed necessary to keep them in order and the aircraft really stank because just after takeoff one of the docs had had to move his bowels the creature wouldnt fit in the tiny airplane toilets so he had blandly relieved himself on the box of shredded paper included for his use hilda averted her gaze she wondered absently where the shredded paper had come from some bureau big shot somewhere who was addicted to making hard copies of things he shouldnt and was it possible that those unnecessary documents or something like them had fallen into the wrong hands so that half the crazies in the world seemed to be able to find out everything that was going on in the bureau the ukrainians had known about dannermans mission most of the wilder religious groups seemed to have detailed information about the whereabouts of the aliensthere had been a knot of men and women and even little children all carrying the usual placards and shouting the usual demands where they boarded the courier plane which no one should have known and the pilot had warned her that there were more of the same waiting for them in new york bureau security had definitely gone to hell but hilda decided the notion that someone was smuggling hard copies of bureau plans out of the headquarters wouldnt really fly the logistics were too tough there had to be another explanation she turned around to peer at dopey the little turkey had taken the news that he was summoned to appear before the united nations with equanimityit is about time brigadier morrisey that i had the opportunity to speak to the people of your world entirely not just one department of one of your nations and then when she told him the other bit of news he took it without surprise that is good to hear yes but who knows when the beloved leaders can get here in person and meanwhile there is the problem of our food what had crossed her mind at the time was that maybe the security leak had a different explanation maybe this damn freak had been in communication with the scarecrows all along but that didnt make sense she couldnt believe that dopey had somehow listened in on every conversation in the bureau and passed them on to the scarecrows who in turn had relayed them to all earths terrorist nut groups and anyway he certainly had not known where they would meet this plane no the leak couldnt come from dopey it was almost as if oh shit hilda said out loud causing dannerman to look up from pat ones head as it was nestling cozily on his shoulder is something wrong he asked no yes stay out of it she ordered and crooked a finger to colonel makalanos when he had left his charges to come up beside her she pulled his head down and whispered i just had a bad thought it may be possible that some bureau personnel have bugs in their heads go up and use the pilots radio secure channel i want every son of a bitch in arlington xrayed and i want it right away he didnt answer only nodded and headed for the pilots cubicle but she thought dismally even if that were the explanation her idea might not solve the problem it wasnt just the headquarters staff that needed to be checked for some damn scarecrow thing it was everybody it could be someone on this plane it could bethat was the worst thoughtit could be hilda herself who had somehow been bugged and as with the dannerman and the pats she would never know it had happened when the vtol landed it was at a helipad along the east river then they were all hustled into two armored vanshappily enough in two shifts with the two docs and their guards filling one of the vans by themselves so that hilda was spared their aroma for a while they headed north to the un building at high speed with four motorbike outriders to clear the way and a halftrack chewing up first avenues already potholed pavement behind them along the way they passed a dozen knots of protesters of one kind or another most of them apparently religious damn them makalano remarked to hilda what do you suppose they want hilda nodded to her aide busily making notes about the protesters as they drove youre our expert tepp merla tepp looked up ive identified three groups so far the inerrantsthat was my own old bunchand the radical southern methodists are two of them plus the christian league against blasphemy they think the aliens are the antichrist or at least agents of the devil and they want them to be fired back into space right away but theres another bunch too all i know about them is what i see on their posters but they look like charismatics to me they want to get rid of the aliens too oh no quite the contrary if i understand their posters they think theyre angels direct from god all they want is to be allowed to worship them makalanos laughed out loud i know how we can straighten them out on that just let them get close enough to get a good smell chapter twentysix traffic was unbelievable dannermans taxi inchwormed along fortysixth street lunging forward a meter or two and then stopping dead with the driver angrily slapping the wheel and muttering obscenities to himself when at last they reached second avenue there was a solid line of cops to keep everybody from entering the last block streets closed the nearest one bawled waving her stunstick move it on dannerman had to walk the rest of the way at the united nations plaza there wasnt any traffic moving at all not vehicular at least the whole street in front of the un building was choked with thousands of human beings chanting shouting milling around in defiance of the police squadrons trying to move them along and when he had zigzagged his way through the pack he found a long line waiting at the gate to the un complex most of them appeared to be wouldbe spectators hoping to get in for the show most of them werent succeeding tolerantly dannerman took his place at the end of it he was in no particular hurry and a few thousand brawling religious fanatics werent going to spoil his day dannerman considered that his world was definitely improving itself he had accomplished his mission in ukraine without bloodshed he no longer had a guard tailing him every moment and then there was anita berman who had been the biggest improvement of all anita had always been a sweet and forgiving woman with plenty to forgive any number of broken dates and long absences when he could not tell her what was going on because it was bureau business now that she knew he was a bureau agent all the lapses were explained no better than just explained anita was thrilled she had been as swept up in the scarecrow turmoil as anyone else on earth and here he was her lover astonishingly at the very heart of it i was always pretty crazy about you dan she had whispered in his ear the night before but wow now its really special he was grinning reminiscently to himself when someone tapped his shoulder it was a cop pointing at the beginning of the line there a woman inside the gate was beckoning peremptorily to dannerman he recognized her as senator alicia piombero and she was gesturing for him to come in even at the un a united states senator could smooth all ways when he had run the gauntlet of catcalls from the waiting line and was at the gate she looked him over and said youre dannerman right you were summoned to appear at this thing and when he nodded thats what i told the guard just show him the summons and hell let you in the guard did as they walked toward the actual doorway he thanked the woman and she said youre welcome maybe we can do each other a favor whats that he asked but she shook her head pointing at the other guard post just inside the door when they had finished with the metal detectors and the patdowns and the sniffers she took him aside listen she said i only have a minute because i have to get up to the security council but youve been having trouble collecting your pay havent you i mean because now there are two of you it was a sore point the damn payroll people are taking forever to figure out what to do yes he said well representative collertoni dont know if you know her shes willing to get a special members bill through to pay both you dannermans in full youre entitled after all and that would cut right through the red tape dannerman perked up then his guard went up that would be good he said cautiously waiting for it glad to do it dannerman but you can do something for me too if you want to you know marcus is a little annoyed with me mr l koga whatever may or may not be going on in the security council at this time it is our undoubted duty to learn the facts in this matter to the satisfaction of each and every delegate not just those who represent the socalled great powers so that we may take appropriate action mr v puunamunda will the gentleman from kenya please yield mr l koga i will yield to the gentleman from the marshall islands for thirty seconds mr v puunamunda i thank the gentleman i wish only to call to the attention of this body that our islands may be endangered owing to the severe tropical storms of recent years but they are still voting members of this general assembly and we too should be allowed to participate in the questioning of the witnesses proceedings of the general assembly i know about senator wintczaks stories that he thinks came from you yes she clearly didnt want to discuss the stories she just said so hes doing a lot of stuff that im not kept informed on i cant let that happen you can understand that we arent going to go back to those old cia days with you spooks going off on all sorts of tearass mystery missions and the senate kept fat dumb and ignorant no maam dannerman said because she seemed to expect it so we can do each other some good if you could just keep me posted on whats happening that isnt talked about in the team meetings dannerman did his best not to laugh the woman wanted him to spy on the spymaster im not asking you for anything i dont have a right to know she went on persuasively give me a call when you can and ill get susie collerton started on the bill right now ive got to get up to the council that made him frown youre going to the security council but i thought it was the general assembly that was meeting she looked at him with faint pity thats where the circus is the council is where the work will be done think about it well talk later once inside the building a uniformed woman in a blue un beret escorted dannerman to a waiting room dannerman still mulling over his conversation with the senator paid little attention to where they were going until she stopped at a doorway saluted smartly and said with an accent dannerman couldnt identify in here please until you are called the place was marked visitors lounge on the door in all five of the official languages of the un but the only visitors in it that day were the ones with subpoenas from the general assembly some of them were there already dannerman saw rosaleen artzbachova and pat adcock sitting near the door and at the far end of the large room and not sitting at all four people in the uniform of the peoples republic of china dannerman recognized one of themno dannerman corrected himself he recognized two of them and they both were the pilot who had taken them to starlab in the first place commander james pengtsu lin he nodded toward the lins but standing stonyfaced and silent they didnt meet his eye he shrugged and turned to the others morning he said you look like youre all recovered from our trip rosaleen corrected him this one wasnt in ukraine shes patrice pats in the ladies with pat five but yes were fully recovered how did things go in arlington oh he said recollecting himself no problem the dd ate me out a little but then they sent me right home because they had other things on their minds they did have orders for me so youll be seeing a lot of me for a while theyve put me in charge of your guard details at the observatory the door opened again when dannerman turned he saw the two pats returned from the washroom but they didnt enter right away they were peering curiously down the hall and so was their escort dannerman had no trouble recognizing which was pat five in just the few days since he had seen her last she seemed to have become much more pregnant she was definitely heavier than the pat beside her and a lot of the gained weight appeared to be in her face which looked almost bloated dannerman had had very little experience of pregnant women but he remembered hearing that they were supposed to be at their prettiest when pregnant it hadnt worked that way for pat five the guard in the blue beret spoke to them and they hastily got out of the way to make room for the next arrivals of which there were a lot first came hilda morrisey and her new aide along with a uniformed bureau lieutenant colonel dannerman didnt recognize then a couple of bureau guards curiously lugging large flat boxes of tornup paper then there was another clutch of guards surrounding the aliens the two huge pale docs one of them carrying the little turkey thing dopey finally the other dannerman and his pat one strolled in keeping their distance from the space freaks and suddenly the large room didnt seem very large anymore hilda morrisey glanced around then nodded to the lieutenant colonel who began issuing orders the two guards with the paper boxes set them down near a window while the others shepherded the aliens to the same area dopey looking on interestedly but silent the chinese officers looked up first startled and uneasy as they found themselves in the presence of the weird beings from space then in revulsion as they caught the scent of them the senior officer spoke sharply they began to move farther away but the two jimmy lins didnt follow they were speaking agitatedly to each other then one of them hurried across the room to pat five wearing a broad and suspiciously fake smile how nice to see you my dear he cried and my unborn child how is he doing pat five gave him nothing but a hostile look but patrice answered for her he isnt yours hes ours and he isnt him hes them three of them shes having triplets triplets how very wonderful oh cut it out patrice said in disgust really jimmy you dont want these kids do you he glanced over his shoulder at the prc officers certainly i want my children and i want them brought up in their homeland the senior prc officer snapped a command as patrice was saying come off it jimmy he looked at her then turned to obey his keepers order but as he left he whispered i cant hilda morrisey standing by the door watched curiously for a moment then turned and rapped on the door when the un guard opened they spoke briefly then hilda conferred for a moment with her lieutenant colonel before waving dan over i dont think youve met dan this is priam makalanos whos helping me with the freaks priam dan dannerman youll take orders from colonel makalanos while im up at the security council chamber dan she finished and rapped again on the door warily dannerman shook the lieutenant colonels hand expecting but wincing from the punishing grip what orders are those colonel he asked none i hope these guys arent giving us any trouble now for a change he was gesturing at the aliens they not only werent causing trouble they werent doing anything at all the two docs stood silent and impassive while dopey curled in the arm of one of them appeared to be asleep his great fantail overspreading his body dannerman had expected that as soon as they arrived theyd be conducted into the general assembly auditorium but that wasnt the way it was colonel makalanos explained to him that the reason hilda had left was that some sort of procedural fight was going on the security council was meeting independently of the general assembly in its own wing of the building and a fierce battle was going on in the general assembly itself over who was to be summoned before them for questioning and who was to be allowed to ask the questions meanwhile they waited dannerman restlessly prowled the lounge taking note of the pictures on the wall the little barlike cubicle which contained a coffee machine the rack of ancient magazines he became aware of the eyes of the other dannerman on him and gave his twin a guardedly friendly helloanother personal problem that he couldnt see a good way of dealing with the other dannerman returned it in the same tone he was spared the necessity of making conversation when two men in the uniforms of the free state of florida entered one of them was general martin delasquez who had been one of the pilots pat adcock persuaded to fly them to starlab in the first place rosaleen caught sight of general delasquez coming in and hurried over to him martin she cried affectionately i thought you were dead its so wonderful to see you again and then when the general gave her a frosty look her expression clouded oh hell youre the other one arent you shaking her head she went over to sit before a low table and began tearing up bits of paper anyone for a game of chess she asked when at last they were brought into the general assembly hall dannerman blinked at the size of the audience dannerman had had the experience of being debriefed or made to testify often enough before at least the bureaus interrogations had been more or less private even in the pit of pain there had seldom been more than a few dozen watchers but this was on a whole other scale the general assembly hall was packed all nations fully represented in their individual stations and the visitors gallery solidly filled as well there were easily two thousand people in the auditorium muttering and whispering to each other as the thirteen witnesses trudged to the raised dais and took their seats on spindlylegged gilt chairs dannerman counted heads there were four patrice adcocks two dan dannermans two jimmy lins one each of rosaleen artzybachova martin delasquez and dopey now alert and looking curiously around the room that wasnt even counting the guards in dress uniform and riot guns standing behind each chair to protect them the guards wore un blue helmets but their uniforms were of the us marines and then to complete the roster the pair of docs their mossbearded faces impassive their half dozen arms moving placidly those things werent real witnesses of course they couldnt be in any practical sense since they never spoke nor also of course were they seated on the frail gilt chairs they werent seated at all they stood remote and still at one end of the row of witnesses and each one of the docs had not one but three marine guards standing tensely over it dannerman did not think the marines were there to protect the docs they werent watching the audience at all they were all precisely focused on the immense multiarmed creatures from space and that was the way their weapons were pointing still dannerman thought maybe the docs did need protection after all the word was that some of the demonstrators had briefly broken through the massed police battalions around the un building complex before reinforcements managed to get to that point to drive them back he had seen half a dozen people turned away as they failed the screening for unchecked weapons whether the weapons were on their persons from absentmindedness or malicious intent wasnt stated it didnt matter either way those people would be watching the televised proceedings if at all from their cells in one of new yorks city jails the delegates to the general assembly were still earnestly wranglingin several languages few of which dannerman understood though dopey with his total command of nearly all earthly tongues was alertly following it all but then the presiding delegate gaveled everyone to silence gentlemen and ladies he saidin englishlet us begin the questioning ask the witness known as dopey to take the stand when the little alien hopped onto the witness stand two thousand people sighed in unison the interrogator rapped for order looking pleased as he motioned to the clerk to swear the witness in federal reserve inflation bulletin the morning recommended price adjustment for inflation is set at federal reserve chairman walter c boettger declined to set an annualized rate stating this unprecedented increase in the rate of inflation is a purely temporary phenomenon which cannot be tolerated if it continues a third increase in interest rates must be considered but i have confidence that the good sense of the american people will assert itself when the clerk approached with the bible he got a curious look from dopey the look got curiouser as the clerk rattled off his formula please put your hand on the bible do you promise to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god i beg your pardon dopey said which god are you referring to so naturally there was another ten minutes of offmike whispering before one of the interrogators aides had the intelligence to have his principal ask dopey just what it was he did believe in dopey considered that for a moment then said doubtfully that one could say yes he believed in the beloved leaders then it took another five minutes before he was allowed to swear himself in in their name without the bible and then the interrogator made the mistake of courteously asking him if he were being well cared for when she managed to turn off dopeys lengthy and even more than usually repetitious reply things went better yes he had occupied starlab for the purpose of eavesdropping on earth for the beloved leaders and the interrogator asked what was the information to be used for was mr dopey preparing the way for an invasion mr dopey took offense invasion certainly not they merely wished to protect you from the tyrannical rule of the horchnot only now but in the eternity of the eschaton to come ah the eschaton the interrogator repeated smiling would you tell us please about this eschaton of yours dopey would he did he kept on doing so until a restive delegate on a point of order reminded the presiding officer that after all what they were here to do was to discuss the benefits the world might hope to gain from these extraterrestrials and their technology not some philosophical question of an afterlife which of course produced another freeforall dannerman wasnt listening he was watching one of the docs who was showing signs of being restive the creature wasnt going to hold out forever dannerman thought he didnt the inevitable happened a titter and gasp from the audience turned everyones eyes to the doc who had blandly relieved himself with his paper boxes still left in the lounge room startled then amusedand a little belatedlythe president declared a recess and all the witnesses trooped back to their holding room to dannermans surprise he saw the deputy director just leaving the room as they arrived hilda morrisey was inside looking strangely thoughtful is something wrong dannerman asked she considered the question wrong no the security council has taken a vote though so what you guys were doing in the ga doesnt matter much anymore theyve okayed the eurospace launch only its a un thing now and one american and one chinese is going along so ill be seeing you people at your observatory why pat demanded suddenly suspicious why so you can give me a crash course on what starlab is like see im going to be the american chapter twentyseven while pat was trying to get dressed for work the next morning the atmosphere in the apartment was grouchy patrice was complaining about the wasted hours at the un and pat five was grousing about well everything she hadnt slept well she didnt feel well she wished the damn kids would get themselves born and get it over with and she added the smell of the damn bowl of chili rosaleen was placidly spooning into herself in the kitchen was making her physically ill rosaleen was apologetic im afraid i got a taste for the stuff while we were captives do you know there isnt a decent bowl of chili to be had anywhere in ukraine i wont do it again oh its not just that pat five said cross but repentant it was the smell of the docs yesterday that started me off probably or just being so damn pregnant and miserable she looked it too pat and patrice exchanged glances anyway i think im going to stay home today if its all right with everybody ill stay with you for a while patrice decided you two go on ahead i can work from my screen here on the way downtown pat and rosaleen took a cabpaid for by their bureau guards because they didnt want to risk their charges in the subway for that much pat was grateful money was an increasingly urgent problem with four pat adcocks to share what really hadnt been quite enough capital for one something was going to have to be done about that then as they arrived at the midtown office building that housed the dannerman astrophysical observatory she saw dan dannerman strolling toward them arm in arm with a tall redheaded woman and inspiration struck abruptly pat knew what that something might be suddenly more cheerful she sent rosaleen up ahead of her and waited for them at the door dannerman saw her nodded amiably and paused to whisper to the woman she giggled kissed him waved to pat and turned away dannerman joined pat am i late again boss lady he asked cheerfully full of her new idea she shrugged the remark off dan you know a lot of lawyers dont you his expression sobered have you got a problem pat you bet i have a lot of them but the one im thinking about is money starlab belongs to us well to the observatory but thats close enough we should have some claim to whatever the un flight finds there shouldnt we so i need to talk to a lawyer i dont want to use dixler right dannerman said immediately they both knew the old family lawyer who had handled uncle cubbys estate and the observatorys lawyer is real good on leases and employment contracts but i think i need somebody with a little more shark blood in his veins for this dannerman pondered for a moment let me see what i can do he said at last ill make a couple of calls upstairs brigadier hilda morrisey was already closeted with rosaleen artzybachova studying the blueprints of the starlab orbiter she wasnt in sight but her mere presence had made a change in the climate of the observatory the bureau agents were sitting up straighter and moving faster and they had infected everyone else pete schneyman was demanding pats attention to the previous days harvest of observations janice dupage sulky because she had had to cancel out on the vacation cruise she had planned was snapping at dan dannerman for preempting a corner of the waiting room as his command post even mild old christo papathanassiou waylaid pat on her way in bristling i do not protest sharing my office with the policewoman merla tepp i understand the urgency of the situation but must she use my terminal so very much of the time by the time pat had run that gauntlet she was glad to retire to her own office and close the door in a physical sense the only thing that had changed in pat adcocks office was the pictures on her wall in the old days before the scarecrows and the horch what the wall pictures usually displayed was the familiar horse head nebula or saturns rings or even the looming shape of starlab she kept such pictures on the wall because they were pretty to look at and even for a more practical reason they were a reminder of the glamour of astronomy when prospective donors visited the observatory the pictures helped get them in the right mood to endow some particular search or even to kick in with a handsome gift or legacy that would help pay the observatorys bills those bills still had to be paid no matter what figuring out how to do it was still part of the directors jobthe boring part but what could you do she settled down to it but as she worked over the numbers on her desk screen she couldnt help looking up from time to time at the wall display the pretty pictures were gone what the wall showed now was all alphanumeric the constantly changing always growing list of new discoveries from the worlds telescopes each time a new dot was discoveredthey were coming less than a minute apart nowits coordinates flashed on the screen as one of the great telescopes accepted the task of checking it out the name of the instrument appeared when the same dot was found nearby in that instruments search the coordinates changed color if there was a third sighting the computers took over and then with luck the first approximation of its orbital elements were displayed in their turn then the object went on the waiting list for instruments operating in other frequencies gamma rays infrared ultraviolet radio telescopeseven the ancient pair of orbital xray telescopes that were still sometimes creakily operational what all those instruments were looking for was the chemical and physical composition of that point of light the ones that showed a coma of gases however tenuous were dropped from the screen they were nothing but ordinary comets their elements went into the cometary databank for any future astronomer who might take an interest but they were of no importance in the present search and for that matter dawdling over the search wasnt getting the bills paid she gritted her teeth and worked doggedly away until hunger reminded her she hadnt had any breakfast on her way to an early lunch dannerman stopped her he looked amused i think ive got a lawyer for you he said hes a shark all right he worked for the carpezziosthey were big druggers i was working on them before uh before you decided to come and spy on us pat said helpfully well yes the only thing is hes expensive first thing he said was that he wanted a fiftythousandcurrentdollar retainer before hed even talk to you i havent got fifty thousand pat began but dannerman was shaking his head wait a minute when i told him what it was all about he said hed waive the retainer only he wanted half of whatever he collected for you pat was scandalized that might be millions more than that so we went round and round for a while and he finally came down to twentyfive percent youre not going to do any better pat im not she thought for a moment then sighed hes really good she asked hes really bad he got the carpezzios off with two years in a countryclub jail when i figured theyd be away for life and hes handled big suits against the government before anyway hell be here this afternoon at the elevator rosaleen artzybachova came hurrying out of her office take me along she pleaded i have to get away from that truly exhausting woman for a while in the elevator rosaleen described her morning with the bureau brigadier hilda morrisey had all but sucked rosaleens brains out to get the data she wanted which amounted to a complete plan of the starlab orbiter as it had been abandoned with every bit of equipment marked and identified and then the whole thing compared with the sketches the instrumentdoc had been ceaselessly turning out at camp smolley i left her transmitting the plans to the doc back at the biowar plant so he could mark the positions of all the beloved leaders materialoh sorry i mean the scarecrow material of course its just that we called them beloved leaders for so long i got in the habit but pat do you have any idea how much stuff is there god knows what it will do to our lives when we get it sorted out if indeed we ever can do that its likeits like giving some renaissance genius like leonardo da vinci a brandnew pocket screen to play with or a fusion bomb or like all of current technology all at once to see what he could make of it and were not leonardos in the restaurant pat toyed with her caesar salad while the old lady devoured a huge platter of fajitas washing it down with a bottle of mexican beer talking the whole time it had been an active morning for rosaleen with brigadier morrisey setting an unflagging paceshes trying to get it all in today because shes leaving for the eurospace base at kourou tomorrow morning and i dont think shed had any sleep last night either she chewed in faintly envious silence for a moment makes me wish i was fifty again but those labors had been productive from the docs sketches they had identified four separate power generators of different typesthough without a clue as to how any of them workedplus the gadget that transported people across galactic distances faster than lightplus several dozen other bits of equipment which did god knew what and god knew how pat glanced at their bureau guard alertly nursing a cup of coffee two tables away and wondered if she would try to stop rosaleens chatter if she knew what the woman was saying in this very public place but of course there wasnt any real hope of secrecy anymore anyway once the un mission came back with whatever samples of scarecrow technology they could carry the whole world would be looking on and it would all be common property but not if she and this lawyer could prevent it come on she said signaling for the check lets get back to work as soon as she was at her desk she turned on the screen and instituted a search for all the mornings transmissions from rosaleen artzybachovas terminal most of what she found was gibberishthe damn woman had encoded all the traffic to camp smolleybut among the remaining messages there were the twenty or thirty of the docs admirably precise sketches that could be salvaged what the sketches might represent pat could not say but they certainly looked potentially valuable when the lawyer arrived she had a display of them ready for him he glanced at it then frowned and said turn off that machine please lets just talk for a bit his name was t lawrence hecksher and he didnt look like pats idea of a mob mouthpiece hecksher didnt look like a hotshot jurybefuddling lawyer from some video serial either what he looked like more than anything else was somebodys grandfatherwhite muttonchop whiskers twinkly skyblue eyes under feather white eyebrows apple red cheeks he would have made a fine departmentstore santa claus pat thought if his talents hadnt been more in demand for helping tax evaders and mob assassins stay out jail he acted grandfatherly too when he had settled himself across from the desk the first thing he said was if you have recording systems going my dear please turn them off he had no recorders of his own either as pat began to describe what she hoped he could do for her he made notes with a pen on paper why cant we use the screens pat asked suspiciously he waggled his head at her records we dont have cant be subpoenaed i dont want to have anything on the record that can be construed as any sort of admission or anything that represents privileged information we arent supposed to have thats why i didnt want to look at your screen dont forget this is not a small matter in order to protect your interests we will need to prevail against some of the best lawyers in the world all over the world pat gave him a dismayed look but he smiled reassuringly dont worry i have dealt with government attorneys for many years ill eat them alive and ill get all the information we need in disclosures but ill do it legally now the first thing im going to want from you is documents and so documents he got documents documents and more documents by the time t lawrence hecksher left the office he had the registry numbers of every document that could have any bearing on the case uncle cubbys will and the probate records the instrument creating the trust for the t cuthbert dannerman astrophysical observatory the records of the building of starlab and all the disbursements made from uncle cubbys estate to pay for it pats own contract of employment to show that she had authority to institute a suit on the observatorys behalfwell need all your ah sisters to sign the complaint as well of course when pat suggested that most of this could be obtained with less trouble from dixler the lawyer for uncle cubbys estate or from the observatorys own attorney he gave her a forgiving smile i dont think well trouble them my dear i find i work best when i dont involve any other attorneys if i can help it ill have the complaints and summonses ready to sign and serve by tomorrow morning serve on whom why on everybody dr adcock the president of the united states the secretary general of the united nations the director of the national bureau of intelligencethats because they have custody of the aliens for that matter on the aliens themselves but ill have to do a little research on that trial my dear dr adcock there wont be any trial all we want is money and theyll throw that at us to get rid of us what you have to do is decide how much you want im thinking of lets see giving them a quit claim for whatever the cost of manufacturing outfitting and launching starlab was when it was built adjusted for inflation with interest and perhaps a one hundred percent penalty yes quite a large sum i think but we can discuss all those details later good afternoon when he was gone pat spent a few dizzying minutes calculating just how many hundreds of millions of inflationadjusted dollars all that might come to it would definitely be a lot it was certainly enough to relieve all four pats from financial worries forever and for pat fives unborn triplets and all their descendants as well she leaned back studying the numbers on the wall to take her mind off these giddy visions of prosperity a flash of color showed that another object had been identified and an orbit plotted but the flashing red showed that this one was special the funny thing about it was that it seemed to be heading in the general direction of the earth that explained the flashing signal it also caused pat a moments shock but when she checked its orbital elements she relaxed a bit its trajectory seemed to bring it within a couple hundred thousand kilometers of the planet but that was not particularly worrisome every few years an object was detected at ranges like that some of them coming closer than earths moon it would bear watching of course but her phone rang annoyed pat touched the screen control what is it she demanded expecting to see janice dupage with some new urgency to make demands on her time but the face wasnt janices it was her own facewell patrices face at leastand she looked scared pat its pat five shes hemorrhaging ive got the medics here and theyre taking her to the hospital youd better come chapter twentyeight hilda morrisey got a few hours sleep on the plane to guyana needing it the night with wilbur carmichael had been really pleasant but it might have been a mistake was she getting too fond of the man should she have promised to see him again as soon as she got back it had certainly cost her sleep that she could have used but it was a mistake she would have been glad to repeat because wilbur had been fine she woke at dawn just as the aircraft was circling the town of kourou all she could see from the air was the giant new holiday inn between the lights of the pizza hut and the allnight casino but with the dark solid green of the jungle just outside the town limits the plane swooped out to sea to come in for a landing from the east and there a kilometer or so from the town itself was the starkly floodlighted launch area ancient gantries still standing in spite of rust and time the liquid fuel plants steaming away the hideous barracks blocks where most of the bases personnel lived when she got out of the aircraft the heat hit her kourou was hot and wet and there were bugs the zappers electrocuted a few thousand of them every hour but there were always thousands more coming up out of the rain forest thirsty for hilda morriseys blood it was not it seemed going to be a comfortable assignment hilda wondered if it was going to be a safe one she had never signed on to be an astronaut it wasnt just that people got killed in space she had long come to terms with the possibility of early death because in hildas line of work people got killed from time to time just about everywhere shed ever been the hard part was the thought that in a few days she would be climbing into that ancient and uglylooking luftburan space vehicle that was squatting on its hardstand at die end of the runway and then she would be departing in it from the planet she belonged on when was the last time the damn europeans had fired one of the things would it still work her skin crawled in ways she had never experienced before as she thought about all the questions on the other hand kourou had one very great advantage for hilda morrisey it wasnt the bureaus hated arlington madhouse here in kourou she was the senior american officer present at least until the deputy director got there for the actual launch so she had no boss at all she certainly didnt take orders from colonel duvalieralthough in spite of the fact that she clearly outranked him he did his best to give them if hilda put up with the colonel at all it wasnt because he was chief pilot and commander of the expedition to starlab he had something more interesting going for him he was not only a wellbuilt man but a frenchman and something in hildas brain was telling her that satisfactory though wilbur was it was about time to change her luck although hildas few experiments with french males had not been very encouraging there was that old rumor that they were the ultimate in lovers well sure they went to a lot of trouble to foster the rumor themselves but still as a matter of fact it was apparent that the personnel roster at kourou was heavily weighted with rather goodlooking men not only that but men who were either single orjust as goodmarried to someone who was thousands of kilometers away there were the belgian bulgarian and danish astronauts for instance they werent in a very good mood because theyd been bounced from the launch to make room for hilda the chinese commander lin and most of all that great silent smelly creature the doc hilda sympathized with the rejects they might well need a little consolation and if things happened to go that way hilda had an open mind about supplying it for them she had plenty of time to think about such matters because the preflight training she was supposed to be going through was a clear waste of time they were not going to have to wear spacesuits she wasnt going to be allowed anywhere near the controls of the giant luftburan spaceship that would carry them into orbit all hilda was really going to have to do was make sure american interests were protected when at last they did dock with starlab and when it came to the protection of american interests brigadier hilda morrisey had received all the training she needed long before hildas first day was spent listening to briefings she didnt really care about the launch controller a dour welshman who hated kourous jungly heat kept talking about launch windows and trip times pointless in hildas view starlab sailed around the earth in its low earth orbit every eightyeight minutes it hugged earths equator and so the windows that were best for rendezvousing with it allowing for the earths own rotation occurred just about every eightyeight minutes as well when that boring lecture was done the portuguese who was their combat instructor went over and over the weaponry they were to take along against the outside chance that some scarecrow troops had somehow managed to sneak back in but what had some portuguese to tell brigadier hilda morrisey of the national bureau of investigation about weaponry more interesting were her colleagues it was the first time the entire crew of the luftburan had been in one place hilda looked around and chose to sit between the two most interesting of them one was jimmy linthe formerly captive jimmy lin along because he had firsthand knowledge of what the scarecrow materiel on starlab looked like the other was the floridian general delasquez along because he knew it from its unaltered state both had been recently debugged for the purpose of the launch but if hilda had hoped for any interesting tidbits from either of them she was disappointed when she tried to strike up a conversation with the chinese astronaut he shot an agonized glance at his prc guard standing stiffly at the back of the room and shrank away the floridian merely ignored her stop the space flight save our planet save our country every launch produces tons of hydrochloric acid which destroys living things we the people of guyana well remember the effects of the poisonous ariane rocket which killed or damaged plants and animals as far as ten kilometers from kourou we will not tolerate a resumption of these deadly launches our priceless natural resources must be protected this project must be abandoned pou dagouti besides themselves and of course the docstolidly waiting in his little holding cage on the outskirts of the base and not invited to the briefingsthere were four others the two germans the female french lieutenant whose main duty was to be to remain in the shuttle in case of disaster and colonel duvalier who listened irritably to the briefings grumpy because he knew it all and because the briefings were being given in english it took the portuguese weapons man nearly half an hour to explain why the handguns they would be issued were to carry a reduced chargebecause there is much danger of ricochet if firedwhile the carbines would be loaded with armorpenetrating rounds in case of dire necessity judging by the expressions on her crewmates faces none of them was learning anything more than hilda herself she cast a sidelong glance at general delasquez who appeared unaware of her existence and another at commander lin on her right hilda was not unaware of lins reputation according to gossip of the pats he had harped incessantly on the sexual wisdom of his great ancient ancestor some twothousandyearold sage named pengtsu though none of them would admit to having experienced any of lins expertise for themselves there might be an additional possibility there she thought and allowed her forearm to slip onto his side of the armrest between them that produced nothing but a sudden jerk away from her the mans attention doggedly fixed on the speaker she sighed and did her best to pay attention to the lecture on the sheath knife and crowbar all things ended in time even this lecture when they got up to go hildas fleeting notion of trying to get lin aside for a little chat evaporated when the chinese officer whisked him firmly away evidently commander lin was not in the good graces of his government her second choice was general delasquez but the chance of that diminished when hilda saw that her aide was waiting for her outside the briefing room tepp saluted smartly three messages from headquarters maam first colonel makalanos reports that the xray screening is complete and no bugs were found second agent dannerman thought you might want to know that dr adcockthe pregnant one maamis having some sort of emergency shes in the hospital but they give her condition as fair not critical third vice deputy fennell advises that the deputy director is making arrangements to come here in person as soon as your mission is on its way back from the orbiter to oversee the distribution of the spoils of course hilda thought thank you hows our doc tepps expression didnt change but there was a touch of strain in her voice apparently doing just fine maam do you want me to look in on him no hilda decided no reason to push the woman to do something she hated ive got time before lunch to do it myself what id like you to do is make friends among the permanentparty junior officers here see what sort of gossip you can pick up and meet me again after the afternoon briefing maam merla tepp acknowledged as she saluted she looked relieved as hilda turned toward the docs pen she wondered if she were being too indulgent not really she thought for now at least tepp could be more useful functioning as an extra ear than making herself sick in the presence of the space freak whether that meant she might need to be replaced sometime in the future was another question maybe not hilda thought maybe things would go so well on the mission to starlab that they might once and for all be relieved of the burden of caring for the aliens she glanced up at the tall rusting shape of an old ariane rocket memento of kourous early pioneering days and then caught sight of the man who was studying it general martin delasquez sometimes your luck was good hilda thought and turned to join him how did you like the briefing general she asked chattily he gave her an unwelcoming look it was certainly a complete waste of time for me i was stationed here at kourou for months and there is nothing they can tell me that they havent already told many times she gave him an apologetic chuckle our fault im afraid they want to make sure we new guys get all the dope i know being stuck with us is an inconvenience but i hope you wont hold it against me personally general since you have actually been on starlab and i havent i was hoping you could tell me something about what to expect when we get there and how could i do that when those creatures tampered with my memory he demanded it seemed like a good time to offer sympathy that must be awful for you she said he glared at her then shrugged what i remember is an abandoned astronomical observatory there was no gravity so it was difficult to move about and the air smelled stalebecause i thought it had been unused for so long but perhaps it was the natural aroma of these creatures from space but i didnt see any sign of them havent you seen the doc he looked at her with what might have been amusementat last a human sign this one no i did see quite a bit of itsbrother when it removed that device from my brain but i was not in a position to study it carefully well general she said sunnily im on my way there now it isnt time for lunch yet so you have the opportunity if you want it would you care to look in on the damn thing hildas interest in the floridian was not particularly sexual she certainly did not exclude that possibility however general delasquez represented a force in the world with which she had little personal experience that is the kind of semi patriotism which marked the people of the breakaway state of florida adamant on running their own state as though it were a sovereign nation yet unwilling to or perhaps too sensible to provoke the military retaliation that would come with any attempt at outright secession the floridians were not ignorant of history and they were well aware of the outcome of the war between the states outside the docs shed an armed guard was crouched over a news screen but he was alert enough to forbid them to enter whats so interesting hilda asked the man in a friendly way he shrugged theres an object coming pretty close to the earth for a while they thought it might hit but its going to miss us by about fifty thousand klicks then more obligingly i cant let you go in but you can look at the damn beast through the door if you want to it wont disturb him the doc looked as though nothing at all would disturb him as a matter of fact the creature was standing motionless halfturned away from them not bothering to look around to see who had come to look at him delasquez looked at the doc in silence for a moment then said wonderingly excuse me but is this the one that made the pictures of the interior of starlab the very one it doesnt look capable of that kind of work i know hilda agreed the story is that they come from a very high type of civilization but the scarecrows conquered them and planted some sort of controls in their brains it doesnt affect their intelligence but now they cant make any decisions on their own especially to rebel against the scarecrows he gave her a sardonic look how useful that would be for your country for dealing with people like myself oh but we would never do anything like that general hilda protestedas a matter of form knowing that that wasnt true knowing that the general was well aware it wasnt of course not he agreed as duplicitous as herself shall we go to lunch now brigadier ive seen all i need and the creature does smell unpleasant of course hilda said cozily slipping her arm into his as they turned away thinking about how the general was going to feel when they were stuck in the confined space of the luftburan with the doc you know she said ive always thought of florida as a good experiment in cooperation you have all the advantages of being part of the united states but the freedom to follow your own principles he looked at her in amusement but without removing her arm yes that is true i wonder though how well the experiment would work if we floridians did not have our own national guard and air force brigadier morrisey would have preferred a quiet table for two but there werent any tables like that in the kourou officers mess they wound up at a table for six sharing it with colonel duvalier and some people on the launch controllers staff they seemed to be old friends of general delasquez though there was something in their gently mocking tone that hilda did not quite understand then colonel duvalier explained when our friend martin was here before it was under something of a cloud brigadier we borrowed him from the floridians to brief us on what we could expect when we visited your starlab since he had been there himself of course then we discovered that there was not much truth in what he told us delasquez said stiffly i told you what i thought was so i did not know that my mind had been tampered with but of a certainty the colonel agreed we did not know that you were transmitting information to our enemies either we did not even know that we had enemies or else we would have put you in a cage like the one this malodorous doc we are taking with us is in dr artzybachova says the only way to be sure the docs arent transmitting information is to make sure they dont get any hilda put in of course that policy got blown when they were at the un general delasquez sniffed dr artzybachova he said in a dismissing tone you dont like her i have no opinion at all about the woman i saw her briefly on the launch and then she died that one died right hilda said nodding but the one thats here now she says youthe other youand she were great friends as captives of the scarecrows delasquez looked uneasy i have thought about that he admitted but since that other copy of myself is not here i am not bound by any relationships he may have assumed she is a type of woman i do not care for what type is that hilda asked he shrugged without answering but she didnt really need an answer she had already diagnosed general delasquezs own type authoritarian male which meant sexist pig it was a type that she had always enjoyed encountering on official business or in the boudoir the woman from the controllers staff diplomatically changed the subject so brigadier morrisey are you ready to explore outer space interoffice memo the eurospace rocket classified the luftburan was built from a german design with german money but using russian facilities and labor the french didnt like the name they wanted to call it the ariane but when that was turned down they settled for naming a french astronaut as chief pilot of course hilda said politely enough in fact i wish it would happen how long are we going to have to wait here thats not my decision the luftburan is nearly fueled and all the supplies are already stowed as soon as the crew is ready we can go im ready now hilda declared digging into the fish course that one of the waiters had placed before her she didnt recognize the fish there were two of them quite tiny but delicious evidently colonel duvalier had made his wishes known to the kitchen staff they had reached the cheese course when carryphones began beeping all over the mess hall what is happening delasquez asked irritably the woman from the controllers staff was already answering hers and when she turned to look at them her face was pale that object that was approaching earth it is a spacecraft it has been observed to make a burn and its new course will impact the earth the cheese boards sat abandoned on every table rounds of perfect camembert slabs of bleu and brie there was no one left in the room to eat them everyone had flown to the briefing room where colonel duvalier had a phone to his ear and an eye on the wall screen hilda stared at the pictures after all the searching not one of earths giant telescopes had had its instruments bearing on the incoming object that was left to the smaller ones and so they had been the ones that were dazzled when the object emitted a stream of fire beside her martin delasquez muttered something in spanish but when she asked he said it in english for her benefit it is a braking burn he said they are preparing for reentry but what is it someone asked no one tried to answer everyone was thinking the same thoughts though for they had all heard the stories the captives brought back of scarecrow vengeance that dropped kttype asteroids on the planets of their enemies wiping them out as thoroughly as the sixtyfivemillionyearold impact not far from where they were standing had wiped out the dinosaurs hilda could not help a small shudder then someone cried look at the other screen it was displaying a series of numbersorbital elements hilda supposed though the digits meant nothing to her then the screen provided a graphic a globe of the earth with a great oval of pink light overspreading a westtoeast area from baja california almost to the african coast that is its landing footprint delasquez said tautly when it makes final course corrections it can strike anywhere in that area if you notice we are inside it here in kourou everyone in the room had noticed that colonel duvalier was gabbling with the controllers then grimfaced he seized the microphone it is my belief he said his voice taut and his accent thickening that these scarecrows are aiming this missile directly at us in order to keep us from accomplishing our launch to the starlab orbiter i do not intend to let them do that our next launch window is in eighteen minutes we cant make that one but we can make the one after that i order refueling topped off and the alien creature to be brought aboard it is now a little after thirteen hundred hours local time the remainder of the crew will board the spacecraft by fourteen ten for possible liftoff at fourteen fiftyseven chapter twentynine even a bureau agent was entitled to an afternoon off now and then once dannerman had supervised the changing of shifts for the guards at the observatory and the apartment and the other guard at the hospital where poor pat five was flat on her back in the obgyn wing he was free for personal business which of course was anita berman he met her for a pleasant if inexpensive lunch not far from his room in rita gammidges condo and when he suggested they go up to his place afterward she was not surprised the landlady popped out of her own room to see who was coming into her condo in the middle of the day but when she saw anita she smiled and closed the door then dannerman and anita did what they had come there to do and that went well too then satisfied they lay spooned in the bed dannermans arm over her his face in the sweet red hair at the nape of her neck he was quite content when she spoke he didnt hear her at first she spoke so softly i said she repeated what happens next oh he said he stretched yawned and tried to collect his thoughts well i guess i kind of get back to my life im still waiting for the damn payroll people to clear my status now that there are two of me the big problem is but it wasnt dannermans file and pension account she wanted to talk about she said that isnt what i meant i meant what happens next with us oh he said again suddenly thoughtful he readjusted his mind he had been asked that what about us question more than once before by more than one other young woman when you decoded it it usually turned out to mean are we going to get married all the other times he had been asked that question the answer had been pretty much out of his control often enough because the woman who asked it happened to be a suspect in his ongoing mission but now she wasnt waiting for his answer she had something else on her mind listen she said tentatively theres something i didnt tell you oh hell he thought because he could decode that one too it meant a lot of things and one of them might be that another man had suddenly appeared in her life but not this time dan she said have you ever thought of leaving the bureau he propped himself up to look at her honestly puzzled and do what well i always had the idea that you really wanted to be an actor am i wrong that came right out of left field be an actor hed certainly thought about it especially while he was taking all those drama courses in college it had been a sort of dreamtime thought the way hed also now and then thought about how nice it would be to win the olympic decathlon or run for president it was a daydream and not at all realistic no that wasnt true anymore it hadnt been realistic before because of his job the bureau wouldnt let him go public as an actor by definition actors were there to be seen while a bureau agents chief asset was his invisibility uncle cubby financed dan dannermans education right through graduate school whence he emerged with a doctorate in theater artsjust in time to be called up for active duty from the police reserve officers training corps he had illadvisedly joined as an undergraduate working for the bureau didnt end his interest in theater it just made it hard to do anything about it until he was assigned to a drug case in new york city and found the offoffoff broadway theater aristophanes two and the girl named anita herman who acted in it but he wasnt invisible anymore that had been taken care of by the scarecrows if i quit he said thoughtfully id be able to collect all my back pay i guess id have to split with the other guy but there should be enough there to live on maybe what are you talking about well they dont pay much at theater aristophanes two oh dan who said anything about theater aristophanes two do you know who ron zigler is the producer yes the producer he came backstage at the theater the other night and he wanted to talk to me did you ever hear of star trek star trek dannerman tracked down an old memory oh sure back inwhat was it the s uncle cubby was a trekkie when he was a kid thats what got him into the astronomy business anita frowned trekkie whats that never mind the thing is zigler wants to do a remake of star trek hes got a script with the scarecrows in it and everything and hes casting the thing is she said clearing her throat ziglers been trying to get in touch with you either of you but the bureau wont pass his messages on he wants you for captain kirk thats the lead part in case you didnt know dannerman stared at her she stood up beginning to dress he said thered be a part in it for me too if he could get you for the kirk role she finished sounding embarrassed and defensive but thats my problem not yours think about it will you now which way is that bathroom of yours when anita was gone dannerman pulled his own clothes on thinking too much was happening never mind the fact that there were two of him never mind the scarecrows never mind any of those great events that were screwing up the lives of everybody in the world the things that were happening in his own personal world were already more than he knew how to handle acting a starring partand with one of broadways most famous producers and what about anita berman herself what a chance this was for her if only hed agree to do the thing that any wouldbe actor in the world would kill to do when the hammering began at his door dannerman was deep in fantasies of stardom married life with anita the stage the life of a lunt and fontanne fame riches here i come anita he called reaching for the doorknob it wasnt anita though he saw her standing farther down the hall looking like a woman in a state of shock the one doing the hammering was his landlady and she looked terrified dan she cried turn on your screen those space people are shooting rockets at us chapter thirty back in new york pat dithered for some time before reluctantly leaving patrice in sole charge at the observatory that was where all the excitement was but sisterly duty was compelling at the hospital entrance pat didnt have to go through the weapons search the bureau guard spoke to the hospital security man at the door who listened then reluctantly waved them through he didnt even make the bureau guard check her weapon though pats own little derringer was taken away pat five was in a private roomreally a suiteand paid for the funny thing was by the government of the peoples republic of china on behalf of the triplets putative father pat fives own guard was sitting on a straightbacked chair outside the door alerted to their coming she clapped her hands and the door opened pat didnt see her semisister at first because pat fives bed had pullup sides to keep her from falling out and they were hung with sheets to keep out drafts pat had to step right up to the bed and look down in order to show pat five the flowers shed brought how are you doing she asked pat five opened her eyes to peer up at her she looked like hell her face was blotchier than ever and her auburn hair was sweated into clumps she was not going to be able to take advantage of the comfortable sitting room next door with its picturewindow view of the city or even the fully equipped bathroom that came with the suite one of her arms was strapped down because of the ivs that were taped in place pulse monitors were mounted on her throat and a respiration microphone on her right side from under the light blanket that covered the lower half of her body inconspicuous tubes led to plastic waste bags showing that she was still catheterized how am i doing she asked im doing lousy do you know they want me to stay flat on my back for the next six weeks ah honey pat clucked the words werent meant to convey information it was only what you said when you had nothing better to offer she thought of reminding pat that this was all for the benefit of her unborn babies but the last time shed tried that pat had talked fretfully of the attractions of a midterm abortion anyway pat said brightly ive got some news mr hecksher served all the papers and he has an appointment to talk to the people at the un this afternoon he has a new paper for you to sign something for the chinese government to say that you are accepting their financial assistance ex gratia whatever that is but without admitting any claim to the children can you actually sign legibly no but the nurses help me so just leave it whats this about an object approaching the earth is it the goddam beloved leaders pats strictest order from the doctors was not to excite the patient so she said reassuringly people say it might be but its not coming anywhere near the earth i dont trust the bastards pat five said glumly well no one does pat cast around for a more cheerful subject you wouldnt believe the getwell messages that have been coming for you from people all over the world everybody weve ever known even our exhusbandsand relatives we havent heard from for years sure they think we might be coming into a lot of money oh not all of them pat protested there are a lot of people that just like youus andwait a minute it was her carryphone she frowned as she answered it she wasnt supposed to be called on the private line except in emergency it was patrice on the line she said pat get your ass back here dont say anything to pat fivebut the damn thing has changed course and it looks like its going to impact the earth when pat adcock got back to the observatory she saw the whole thing from that first chancecaught burn on because the news channels kept rerunning every sighting at twentyfive earth radii the objectno damn it pat said fretfully to herself call it a spacecraft because there wasnt any more doubt that that was what it wasthe spacecraft produced another great display of fireworks when the burn was over and they calculated the new orbita stretchedout ellipse with the spacecraft now on the descending legthere wasnt any doubt it was definitely going to impact the earth right on top of us patrice groaned as she inspected the oval of the expected footprint swallowing up half of the western atlantic and a lot of the bulge of south america they know were all here and theyre after us if its big enough rosaleen offered it doesnt much matter where it hits remember how the scarecrows offed their enemies by dumping asteroids on them but it wasnt that big pat was sure of that much what it was was another question entirely supernuclear bomb bioweapons patrice thinking along the same lines said tightly i wonder if the governments going to try to evacuate the eastern seaboard but if they did where would they evacuate the people to and how could they move a hundred million men and women out of the way when they werent sure just where the way was the earth is a sitting duck for all the floating bird shot that orbits the sun thousands of meteorites strike its outer atmosphere every day most of them so tiny that they burn up quickly and are not even noticed by earths people once in a while a slightly larger oneperhaps the size of a grain of sandburns brightly enough to be seen as a shooting star more rarely one is large enough to reach the ground as a hot lump of pitted rock very seldom does one make a crater and only a few times in a million years will one be large enough to do serious damage but never before has one been seen to change its course by a rocket burn to make sure of hitting its target newsweek the big telescopes were no use now the thing was too close and moving too fast for them but telescopes werent necessary every news camera on earth was scanning the skies for there wasnt any other news that mattered at that moment the lucky ones zoomed in on the scarecrow spacecraft and for a few minutes each was able to hold itsometimes long enough to catch it as the thing plooped out a minor coursecorrection jet on the dozen screens in the observatorys conference room there were sometimes as many as eight or nine different shots of the spacecraft flickering in and out as the harried operators in the network control rooms tried to keep abreast of the rapidly changing feeds then abruptly one screen switched to a wholly different scene eurospaces luftburan caught in its liftoff from kourou hell dannerman snapped theyve launched ahead of schedule why would they do that no one answered they were all too full of questions of their own and then the spacecraft made a final burn and turned into a sunbright meteor as it entered earths atmosphere plunging down its going to miss us patrice breathed its going to miss the land entirely pat corrected as the footprint on one of the screens wobbled shrank finally turned into a point in the ocean then all the groundbased scenes blacked out at once and one by one each screen came on again all of them showing a single picture it came from a trafficspotter plane belonging to a puerto rican tv station urgently redirected by its control room as the scarecrow ships splashdown became predictable the pilot was quick and the cameraman was good they caught the fireball of the descending spacecraft from a distance even saw the immense splash and clouds of steam when it struck the pilot had piled on the coal and they were closing in on it before the steam had dissipated while patand everyone else in the worldheld their breath awaiting the explosion it didnt come when at last the steam blew away a metal object the size and shape of an old naval torpedo was floating placidly in the ocean swell and it wasnt exploding at all within half an hour there were a dozen other planes circling above the floating scarecrow ship within an hour the first surface vessels began to arrive there wasnt much to see but no one in the dannerman observatory turned away from the screens the ships were an oddly assorted lot fishing vessels fast cigarette speedboats even a cruise ship that happened to be nearby and altered course to give its passengers an unanticipated thrill when a navy tug approached flank speed ahead a mustache of white foam curling away from its bow the first thing it did was to put an officer on the loudhailers and warn everybody else away then it slowly approached the floating hulk circled it suspiciously a time or two then stopped a moment later a pair of frogmen went over the side then the tempo of events slowed down to a crawl one of the frogmen paddled over to the floating object and gingerly touched it with some sort of metallic probe while the other trod water a few meters away they jabbered to each other then one of them waved to the tug a moment later deckhands flopped an inflatable raft overboard and a couple of others climbed down a rope ladder to get into it nothing happened for a moment then some sort of metallicgleaming equipment was lowered into the raft and its crew began to row it toward the scarecrow object theyre being pretty damn cautious pat grumbled rosaleen gave her an amused look wouldnt you be she asked and yes pat admitted to herself she would they still didnt know whether the thing was a bomb or not or whether it might suddenly give anyone nearby one of those devastating electrical shocks or even whether it might pop open and a horde of scarecrows come charging out weapons blasting but nothing like that happened nothing much was happening at all except that the sailors in the raft were gingerly touching the scarecrow object with probes frowning over their instrument readings talking on their headsets to the command personnel on the tug about what they found who in turn were no doubt talking to higher authority somewhere ashore at every step while someone decided what to do next pat grinned to herself it was actually getting pretty boring but neither she nor anyone else in the observatory could tear herself away from the dozen identical displays on the screens until the display on some of them changed a human face appeared looking agitated a transmission has been received it began to say and then it froze whatever it was saying was no longer heard as the audio portion of that transmission was replaced by the very transmission it had announced how the object was found the scarecrow missile happened to be in earths daylight skies when it emitted the burn that changed its course it was almost directly overhead as seen from the islands of hawaii where a bbc crew was interviewing a group of astronomers at the canadafrancehawaii dome a script girl glancing up at the sky saw the flare when she yelped in surprise the bbc cameraman caught the object in his finder and that was how the world first saw it within ten minutes every telescope in the world that could bear on the object was searching for it cerro toledo was the first to locate it once the burn was over it was moving very rapidly but the chileans were able to hold it long enough to project a track moving east by northeast using the chilean data telescopes in the little observatory in the hills over rio de janeiro picked it up and refined the orbit before it vanished over the atlantic twenty minutes later telescopes in the azores and moments later on the european continent had it and since then it has been under constant watch sky telescope do not be afraid a mellow reassuring voice said our intentions are friendly the lander you are approaching is not dangerous it simply carried a cargo of food to supply the needs of our loyal associates presently on your planet as you see the beloved leaders care for those who cooperate with them we will care for you too if you wish it and most of all we will help you defend yourselves against the forces of the evil horch we suggest that you examine our lander and its contents to reassure yourself we mean no harm and when you have had an opportunity to do so we will speak to you again just food pat said incredulously they scare the pee out of us just to give dopey some food hold it dannerman said listening because the voice was going onnot quite as mellow now almost sounding agitated but we must warn you against your foolish attempt to visit your starlab the mechanisms it contains are highly dangerous recall your spacecraft at once do not enter the starlab the consequences will be very grave chapter thirtyone long before starlab was in sight the word had come over the luftburans radio that the missile was a dud that did not appear to make colonel duvalier feel any safer when they came within docking range of starlab he brought the old rocket to relative rest for half an hour while he studied the exterior of the orbiter centimeter by centimeter the french female astronaut had unbuckled herself and swum up to confer with himendlessly in french and pitched too low for anyone else to hear she was the only one allowed freedom of movement everybody else was ordered to remain strapped in their seats in case the colonel decided to get out of there in a hurry hilda did her best to be patient though little twinges in her belly reminded her that a lot of people got spacesick in this kind of microgravity even without the odor of the doc that filled the vessel then the colonel reached a decision check your weapons everybody he ordered i am going to dock that was a little better though the odd slipperyslidey motion of the luftburan as duvalier twitched it to mate with the starlab port caused hilda to swallow nervously but then he announced the docking secured everyone unstrapped and took their places by the door well almost everyone the great pale alien remained lashed to the cradle that had been built for him of course and one of the germans remained by him to release him when colonel duvalier gave the order which the colonel was taking his time about doing he was obviously mulling something over in his mindperhaps trying to find the proper historic words to speak before ordering his crew to enter hilda thought sourly but what he said at last was you all know your orders i will be the first person to board starlab you will then follow in the order assigned except for capitaine des esseintes she will remain in the luftburan in constant radio contact with those of us in the boarding party this will be done as a precaution if anything goes wrong she will undock at once until the problem is cleared up and if the problem werent cleared up hilda tried to imagine what it would be like if the frenchwoman took it into her head to decide they had all been taken over by the scarecrows and then pulled the luftburan away for a return to earth it was not an attractive prospect if it were a false alarm they would all be marooned there for an indefinite period and if it werent a false alarm no hilda didnt want to think about that at all the colonel was speaking to his controllers on earth presumably to announce that he was ready for his historic task but he suddenly frowned and lost his composure he spat rapidfire french into the microphone too fast for hilda to follow listened again then looked up there has been a development there is a message from these scarecrows and they warn that we must not enter starlab this is this causes then he shook his head and was silent he was the only one silent everybody else was shouting at once warning of what what do they meaneveryone but hilda she had a different concern it wasnt so much what the scarecrows had said as the fact that they had said anything about entering starlab at all for that meant that they werent thousands of lightyears away they were close enough to see what was going on and that meant that was another thing hilda didnt want to think about another hour went by while everyone jabbered to everyone else with many more exchanges between colonel duvalier and the ground controllers then the colonel shrugged and pulled the lock door open with a crash allons he said hollowly and the troops stormed the citadel in hilda morriseys eighteen years with the bureau she had stormed into enemy territory often enough guns blazing people getting killed this wasnt like that for one thing rushing a target when your feet were firmly on the ground and things dropped to the floor when you let go of them was one thing this microgravity business was something else entirely they didnt storm the starlab they damn well floated in through the lock one after another as easy a collection of big slow targets as ever graced any churchcarnival shooting gallery if there had been actual enemies inside they would have had no problem picking the invaders off one at a time as they floundered and soared well there werent any waiting sharpshooters there was nobody in sight at all hilda caught a confused glimpse of rows and clusters of odd colors and bizarre objects looking like some mad interior decorators goingoutofbusiness sale but then martin delasquez thumped into her from behind propelling her into one of colonel duvalier s flying feet and all her attention was taken up with the job of trying to grab on to something solid her interior ear canals were complaining about it too her queasiness got worse to the point where she seriously thought she was going to toss her cookies right into the lap of the chinese guy lin and it was not helped by the smell of the place something like spice something like decay a lot like a nastily rasping kind of chemical smoke the chemical part at least had an explanation its the transporter jimmy lin gasped hauling himself up martin delasquezs leg to clutch a wall bracket dannerman shot it up to keep the scarecrows from following us outside of that the place is just the way we left it federal reserve inflation bulletin the morning recommended price adjustment for inflation is set at acting federal reserve chairman l dwight german replacing the late walter c boettger issued a prepared statement demanding that all banks immediately adhere to the recent eighth increase in interest rates dr boettgers suicide should be a warning to us all he said in the statement if we do not pull together we can expect financial anarchy which will cause great harm to our democratic institutions in this time of public unrest maybe so hilda thought but she hadnt forgotten what had happened when this same jimmy lin and the others made their first landing on starlab it had looked innocent enough then too and then without any foreplay theyd found themselves captives of the scarecrows the colonel evidently had the same thoughts he ordered a thorough search of the orbiter and so the landing party dragged itself through the corridors of the orbiter looking forlooking for what exactly hilda asked herself god knew there was a lot to see for the satellite was full of inexplicable machines and gadgets the things came in all colors and textures some looked like lime jello some were silverbright there was one huge coppercolored thing like a huge metal sixsided pillar that seemed to be emitting a sullen heat some of the objects clicked and whispered to themselves some glowed some were silent and dark and what any of them were for hilda could not guess still it could have been worse the one thing that they feared to find was not there no living creature no docs or dopeys nor anything else out of the scarecrows menagerie of oddities and when colonel duvalier was quite sure of that he got on the radio and commanded bring the beast in and the expedition began to earn its pay it that point most of the people aboard starlab became extraneous which meant that they were free to follow their private agendas whatever those were general delasquez pulled out a camera and without a word to anyone else methodically began to photograph everything in sight hilda herself retraced her steps around the starlab looking for those particlebeam weapons the scarecrow troops were supposed to have there werent any visible the chinese astronaut commander lin had a priority project of his own he had stationed himself by the charred wreck of the machine that had brought them there with his weapon still in his hand when hilda came near he pointed the gun at her face back off nobody comes near this thing he announced im not taking any chances on letting it get fixed hilda looked at him curiously how would i know how to fix it i dont know he admitted and i dont care maybe the scarecrows have some way of making you do itsame as they made us forget all this stuff then they could just as well do it to you lin she pointed out he scowled stay away and keep the doc away from here i swear if he tries to touch this thing ill blow his damn head off the doc showed no such intention he too had his own program as soon as he was inside the starlab he headed down one of the corridors at high speedstartling hilda the creature was making faint mewing sounds the first she had ever heard from him clearly he was practiced at getting around in the microgravity environment equally clearly he knew just where he wanted to go which wasnt where the colonel wanted him halt colonel duvalier commanded flailing after him with his gun drawn the alien paid no attention he didnt stop until he reached a greenglowing panel he clutched it for support with one huge arm reached out with a smaller one to touch on its surface the panel sprang open revealing a cubicle filled with racks of what looked like plant matter and smelled faintly peppery mewing in excitement the doc pulled out a clutch of the stuff and thrust it into his great mouth general delasquez was amused the creature is hungry of course he reminded the colonel the colonel was not amused at all he took a moment to scowl blackly at delasquez then returned to muttering angrily at the doc in a mixture of english and french if the doc understood either he showed no sign he chewed energetically cramming new fistfuls of the stuff into his mouth before the last batch was quite processed he was a messy eater too for little sprigs of greenery fell off the clumps he was shoving in some clung to the froth of white around his mouth he seemed to be more than merely hungry hilda had never thought she could detect any emotion on the face of either of the docs but now there were signs that had to be some kind of strain he was actually sweating and the great eyes were darting about as though in distress then he pulled a couple of additional clumps of food from the locker and clutching them in two of his extra arms abruptly gathered his stubby legs under him and kicked himself down the hall for a dozen meters colonel duvalier was taken by surprise he barely got out of the docs way in time then clumsily followed after wait he ordered come back the doc paid no attention munching as he went he paused in front of a bluegreen mirror whatever he did hilda could not quite see but the mirror vanished and where it had been was a sort of tool rack the doc selected a couple of items then still ignoring colonel duvalier hurried agitatedly back along the corridor until it came to a luminous golden hemisphere the mewing noises were louder now they sounded distressed agitatedly the doc slid one of the tools under the edge of the dome the glow winked out the dome retracted silently and a jumble of incomprehensible alien objects appeared behind it alarm bells went off in hildas mind were these things weapons duvalier was having the same thoughts because he was flailing around trying to get his body in position to aim his gun at the doc if the doc knew he was in danger he showed no sign all his attention was concentrated on his task he thumbed through the gadgets agitatedly large arms holding him in place smaller ones sorting feverishly through the array until he found a length of what looked like woven cloth of gold hurriedly he wrapped it around his head as though in pain colonel duvalier slowly lowered his gun and began talking on his radio to the luftburan watching suspiciously as the doc relaxed the eyes closed the expression on the broad pale face turned peaceful he hung there in silence for a moment then opened his eyes turned to colonel duvalier and touched him on the shoulder was it meant as a pat of reassurance the doc tugged at the shawl over his head awkwardly twisting the ends of it to secure them under his chin then he found another square of the brassy fabric tucked it under one of his smaller arms and stepped back joining the hundredmilehigh club private eyes gaze is on the luftburan thats on its way to the starlab orbiter who have we got here theres the american spook hilda morrisey who has never explained what she was doing in a makeout bar not long ago theres the chinese james lin with his little ancestral book of positions and procedureswill he be adding new chapters in zerog there are the two french pilots ii and elle and you know the french not to mention the big zombie from space sounds like a firstrate rave to us private eye london he gestured encouragingly at the collection of objects and pantomimed carrying them into the luftburan hilda began to breathe again whatever had been on the creatures mind it seemed he was now finally ready to go to work the doc looked consideringly at a brightly gleaming trapezoid and a pale blue rhombus but finally began to dissect a purplish pyramid when he had loosened it from its attachment to the wall he gestured to the colonel to take it away and immediately began doing the same to a grapefruitsized blister of orange nearby colonel duvalier whispered to himself in words that might have been french or may have been english but were certainly profane then he turned to the others the beast is at last doing as he was ordered he said we can start loading these things into the spacecraft although the machineries of the scarecrows weighed nothing at all in the orbiting starlab they still had mass it was sweaty work to try to maneuver them down the narrow corridors of the satellite and through the portcareful not to smash them into the walls the other machines the fixtures of the luftburan that kind of grunt labor was primarily reserved to the humans aboard the doc was the specialist now fully occupied in dismantling bits of machinery pausing only to collect another fistful of the aromatic food it wasnt light labor either hilda had not done this much physical work in a long time in her normal existence that sort of thing was what she directed others to do even after the machines were inside the lander the work wasnt over the things had to be stowed with carewith very great care hilda thought imagining one of those bulky objects breaking loose in the shuddery violence of reentry and crashing down on her unprotected head the exertion and the wellused air inside starlab were having their effect on her too she wasnt at the point of throwing up quite but the queasiness did not go away and at last she was forced to make her way to the ancient microgravity toilet the training she had received at kourou was not adequate to her present needs it took her forever to close the lid on her wastes and then manage the stiff levers that noisily disposed of it and when she came out the doc had declared a halt he was demonstrating to colonel duvalier that the other machines of any interest were simply too big to fit through the docking port the colonel surrendered he ordered everyone inside and grouchily sealed the ports while the french female astronaut checked the stowage of the goods the colonel himself strapped down the unprotesting doc who still had the one scrap of metal cloth bound oddly around his head the other clutched firmly in one minor arm hilda busy with her own seat fastenings was paying little attention until a yelp from the colonel made her turn swiftly but general delasquez was laughing you should not attempt to take that thing away from him he said naturally he resisted colonel duvalier sucked his wrist where the doc had thrust him awaynot violently but enough to hurt we will see he snarled if the creature continues to resist when we are back at kourou but he left the doc alone and pulled himself back to the control deck a moment later he called check your restraints are we all secured when the crew one by one reported themselves strapped in he said crisply disengage the copilot touched something there was a gentle lurch the nausea that hilda had quelled came back she inhaled deeply and managed to repress it once again bracing herself for the thrust that would start them back to earth it didnt come they werent moving except to drift slowly away from starlab craning her neck hilda saw that the colonel was speaking into a microphone while the copilot was scanning the interior of the luftburan with a handheld camera he was speaking softly and in french hilda could catch only a few words but it sounded as though he was complaining about the doc and demanding armed guards to meet them on landing stupid she thought but then something new caught hildas attention she wrinkled her nose and craned her neck to look back at the doc all that food had had its inevitable result the doc had relieved himself again and the stench was one thing too many for hilda morrisey to bear she barely got die spacesick bag to her face before everything came up at once chapter thirtytwo when the new orders came in over the command channel lieutenant colonel priam makalanos saw no particular problem immediately on offloading the object will be airlifted to camp smolley for study and biological analysis if suitable limited amounts of the contents may be included in rations for the extraterrestrials curiously it was signed ds fennell vice deputy director rather than by the deputy director himself but that was only a small puzzle that undoubtedly would be clarified in time makalanos glanced up at the wall screen which for some time had been displaying the object in question the thing from space was lashed to the deck of a navy tug steaming toward hampton roads two destroyers three coast guard corvettes and half a dozen smaller vessels were patrolling the perimeter around the tug keeping the ships of other nationals away from what after all was something that had been found in american territorial waters makalanos grinned at the thought of all the indignant diplomatic protests that would be storming on the american state department over this episode but that wasnt his problem all makalanos had to do was to get camp smelly ready to receive the cargo actually he thought dr ben jayya and his old biowar staff would be glad for something to do that was more along their lines of expertises but while he was alerting the laboratory chiefs a breathless corporal rapped on his office door theres some kind of trouble with the turkey sir he panted dr adcock thinks you ought to come even before makalanos got to the isolation room he could hear dopeys excited yammering pat one was waiting for him at the door hes been like this she managed to get out before the little creature turned to him great fan almost glowing with passion lieutenant colonel makalanos what have you done with my bearer is he dead makalanos glanced at pat one for help but she only shook her head worriedly he tried his best he said trying to be placating if you mean the one at walter reed i do not mean the one at walter reed i mean the one i agreed to let you take to your starlab for the purpose of obtaining food which it appears we no longer need and devices for your study which i now believe i should never have permitted what have you allowed to happen to him puzzled makalanos did his best as far as i know nothing has happened to him as far as you know dopey sneered which is pretty far actually makalanos said levelly but its always possible something has happened i dont know about if youll try to calm down ill go to my office and check turning he gave dannerman a curt nod you come with me in his office he turned on the agent all right what happened dannerman shook his head beats the hell out of me colonel we told him about his food package comingyour order colonel i know what my order was what did he do he seemed pleased thats all pleased not surprised just pleased then he complained for a while about the food hes been getting as usual and then all of a sudden he went ape he said wed killed his bearer makalanos scowled just like that just like that there wasnt any warning just one minute he was pissing and moaning as usual then all of a sudden he was having fits i tried to tell him that killing the doc was the last thing we wanted to do because we needed him but he wasnt listening shaking all over screeching as close to hysterical as ive ever seen him we couldnt calm him down even though we kept telling him the doc was all right he paused there and then asked he is all right isnt he was the creature all right the obvious way to find out was to query headquarters what was wrong with that was that makalanos felt a little foolish about asking that sort of question on nothing more substantial than the unsubstantiated conjectureor hunch or suspicionof the bizarre little beast from space colonel makalanos didnt like to feel foolish he liked it even less when the bureau duty officer assured him that of course the doc was all right the starlab party was busily loading scarecrow materiel into the luftburan at that very moment anyway she added when theyre through therell be a report so why dont you just watch your news screen nettled makalanos sent dannerman back to give dopey the word and do his best to keep him quiet then he considered what he should do next was it worth reporting dopeys hysterics to the deputy director it probably was he thoughtbut when he tried to get through he found the dd was not taking callswas getting ready to head for kourou himself to be there when the luftburan landed with its cargo he swore to himself colonel makalanos was as good at following orders as at giving them but what orders was he to give to deal with dopey and who was to tell him what to do with brigadier morrisey off somewhere in orbit and the deputy director too busy even to answer his phone d s fennell that was who the one who had signed his latest orders makalanos put in a call to her on the coded line and found her impatient harried annoyed at being botheredbut willing to talk she listened briefly then shook her head did you tell him the bundles for beasties were on the way and that didnt cheer him up well just do the best you can priam i wish i knew more of what was going on he complained dont we all but whats to tell there was a chinese submarine shadowing the tug with the capsule but be warned them off from territorial waters and now theyre headed south to kourou i guess and there were a couple of mexican frigates that got too close and had to be chased awayand naturally a lot of diplomatic complaints but screw them so everythings under control i hope now can i get back to dealing with all this crap please i guess makalanos said reluctantly daisy what are you doing with this starlab stuff i thought you were assigned to head up all the rest of the bureaus business unwarranted exclusion of peaceful shipping federal officials in the costa rican naval department have announced that costa rican fishing and pleasure vessels have been driven out of international waters in the vicinity of the recent landing of the spacecraft from the scarecrows our ambassador in washington has asked for an appointment with the american state department in order to file a protest against this highhanded act tico times san juan costa rica she gave him a wry look what other business havent you been paying attention there isnt any it looks like all the subversives are pulling their heads in right now this scarecrow stuff is about the only action around agent dannerman knocked and came in while makalanos was channelsurfing the civilian news dopey wants to talk to you so pats going to bring him along he reported talk about what makalanos asked glancing away from a latebreaking story about the english prime ministers hurried visit to cardiff in wales about this idea he has that somethings happened to his doc hes quieted down some so it ought to be all right he was looking past makalanos at the news screen i guess thats part of this welsh thing he offered and when makalanos looked perplexed he added it was scuttlebutt going around in arlington the way i heard it the welsh nationalists were negotiating with mi for a truce and this dawid ap llewellyn guy he was supposed to be surrendering to the police in brownsville i hadnt heard makalanos admitted its getting to be an epidemic the ukrainians the tamils in sri lanka the shining path in where is it peru even the cambodian rebels and the irish i havent heard anything like that about our own nut groups but all over the world there are these revolutionaries packing it in makes you wonderah there he is dopey had waddled in pat one right behind him as they were talking the little alien seemed subduedworried makalanos thought although he had not learned how to read dopeys feelings from any expression on the cat face or hues of the great fantail as pat one lifted him onto a chair and began to work the controls of the screen dopey commented it is a common thing makalanos looked at him what is this submerging of differences many affiliated races have behaved so in that time of fear and confusion before they came to accept the beloved leaders or didnt dannerman said sharply oh yes agent dannerman that is true some did not with inevitably tragic results the thought seemed to cheer him up he added politely one hopes your species will not necessitate extreme measures but your actions must not give provocation it is my bearer i am concerned with from her position crouched beside the screen pat one interrupted fight later guys ive got something the news screen she had been working over now showed the face of colonel hugues duvalier clutching a bracket to keep himself from floating around and proudly informing the world that he colonel duvalier had successfully completed his mission and they were preparing to return to the kourou base as soon as they were in position for the reentry then the camera panned around the ship makalanos saw hildas face peering into the camera and the german astronauts and the baffling bits and pieces of alien technology and the giant silent figure of the doc curiously wearing a sort of metal babushka but obviously alive and well there was a startled shriek from dopey makalanos turned to him whats the matter he isnt dead is he hes all right the little alien seemed stunned he mewed to himself for a moment seeming at a loss for words then he said he is not at all all right lieutenant colonel makalanos it is worse than i feared something must be done at once pat one perched on the arm of dopeys chair tried to soothe him take it easy will you look theyll be back soon then you can see him yourself so if youre worried i am worried dr adcock i am extremely worried cant you see the bearer has cut himself off from contact it is an extremely dangerous situation andandand there is no alternative he must be destroyed please order him shot at once chapter thirtythree back on the ground hilda morrisey discovered that kourou had changed while she and her shipmates were looting the old starlab the population of the eurospace complex had exploded planes were landing every hour bringing in more and more people the planes werent just any old commercial jobs either these were official government aircraft from forty or fifty different governments and every one of them was packed with lawyers and high officials and whatever that government could scare up in the way of scientists and engineers to squabble over the loot as it came off the luftburan that wasnt hildas worry she had done everything she was supposed to do on the orbiterhad prevented any of the others from pocketing any odd little bits of alien technology had kept a sharp eye for dirty tricks she had done her job and now all she wanted was a bath and some clean clothes and a fast plane back to arlington but marcus pell turned out to have other ideas for her the deputy directors plane had deposited him and fifteen others on kourous landing strip before the luftburan touched down it seemed to hilda that he had brought enough manpower with him to do everything that still needed to be done but pell didnt agree youre one of our best agents hilda he told her benignly youve had a chance to get to know some of these people you can talk to them so talk circulate find out whatever you can leave the bargaining to us rest you can rest later he paused his nose wrinkling youd better clean your teeth first though o brigadier morrisey did clean her teethagain and rinsed her mouth four or five more times too until she was certain that her breath no longer showed any trace of her unfortunate spacesickness then she bathed the rest of her as well that however she was not able to do in the little room the base housing officer had assigned her during training because that was now occupied by a pair of highranking diplomats from sierra leone at that point merla tepp earned her pay she had made friends among members of the spaceports permanent party while her brigadier was away and had been able to borrow a key to their barracks which had showers cleaner so where do i sleep hilda asked her aide putting on a little of tepps makeup before a mirror in the washroom tepp seemed preoccupied with something sleep she repeated oh sleep on the deputy directors plane ive staked out a couch in the lounge for you ill have to sleep on the floor right next to it if you dont mind no surprise there kourou had run out of facilities for the influx now the luftburans longest landing strip having served its main purpose when the spacecraft came down was packed nose to tail with aircraft that had been kept on as emergency housing the argentinians were the best off tepp explained they didnt need an aircraft to sleep in they had the luxury of a battle cruiser steaming in circles offshore with their people helicoptering back and forth other countries had ships on their way to join the bedroom fleet some of the more important newcomers had rooms or even suites in the hotels of the old town of kourou itself a few kilometers down the coast they commuted most of the influx were less fortunate they were doubling and tripling up in rooms that didnt have airconditioning against the steamy equatorial heat and might not even have windows because they hadnt ever been intended for sleeping in the first place it was nearly dark now the sun gone over the hills to the west with a sliver of a moon following its descent out over the ocean there were quick illuminations of lightning though too far away for the thunder to be heard over the spaceport itself there were patches of stars they were obscured by the lights beating down on the little mounds of goods removed from the lander but hilda made out the familiar outline of orion queerly lying on his side because of their latitude there was a constant bzztbzzt of insects frying themselves on the electrified mesh over the lights even so people were slapping at bugs on their necks and arms that didnt stop any of them from doing what they were here to do the bickering was intense and marcus pell was in the thick of it backing up the presidents personal representative starlab was american property the presidents man was announcing and so everything on it was american property as well nonsense said everyone else the goods were treasure trove belonging to whoever found them and besides the united nations had declared them the common property of all of course there was no real chance that the landers cargo was going to be delivered to the un building it would be divided among the worlds powers the bickering here was over how many pieces it would be divided into and who would get the pieces hilda eavesdropped on a group of germans and poles arguing about whether the slavic countries of europe were entitled to any consideration at all but really ought to consider themselves part of eurospacewe have had enough experience of being part of your space one of the poles was saying in german rudimentary enough for hilda to follow a few minutes later some australians and new zealanders were complaining that the damn pommies still thought they were a major power for gods sake she wandered past the canadian delegation speaking urgently among themselves until they caught a glimpse of her uniform then they became freezingly silentstill no doubt pissed off because their country hadnt got anything out of letting the us use their landing strip in the first place then she caught a glimpse of merla tepp standing by herself and gazing somberly at something hilda couldnt quite see when she got closer she saw that it was the doc placidly silent and still wearing his incongruous metallic oldlady head shawl with another like it held in one of its lesser armsstolid and stunned brother to the ox some old words came to hildas mind if the doc was at all aware of the ferocious arguments going on all around he gave no sign tepp held half a sandwich in one hand and that reminded hilda that her recently emptied stomach was ready for refilling whered you get it tepp she demanded tepp blinked at her then came back to alertness theres a chow line giving them out maam but its only this kind of thing youre entitled to get a decent meal in the deputy directors aircraft i dont want a decent meal i want one of those wheres this chow line right outside the general mess but youve got to queue up for a moment hilda considered requisitioning teppss remaining half sandwich away from her but decided against itnot out of any particular consideration for tepp but because a chow line was as good a place as any to listen in on talk the trouble with doing that was that some of the people at the end of the line were talking to each other in japanese others in what seemed to be pakistani hilda wished for the presence of that ugly but gifted little turkey dopey as a translator then caught sight of jimmy lin and his two minders coming along to join the line here she called waving ive saved you a place that got them all dirty looks from the pakistanis just behind her but they didnt push it any farther than that the minders paid no attention since there was an irritatedsounding discussion going on between themin chinese they werent paying much attention to their charge either and after one searching glance none at all to hilda morrisey lowvoiced and with one eye on the minders hilda asked lin cordially hows it going lin looked weary and tired how would i know all i know is i want to go home youll feel better after you get something to eat eat this slop christ morrisey i used to feed my gardener better than this we were supposed to have our own meals on a submarine and sleep there too but the damn thing never showed up that was interesting what submarine are you talking about she asked keeping her voice idly conversational but that was more than the minders were willing to put up with one of them broke off their discussion to say something sharp to lin who hung his head he says i shouldnt be talking to you so leave me alone he told hilda and that was die end of conversation on the chow line it was pretty nearly the end of arguing too everything that could profitably be said in kourou had been said already the next step depended on what happened at the united nations and only god knew when there would be any decisions there gossip said the general assembly was pulling an allnighter most of the people in kourou were drifting away toward whatever beds they had been able to find and hilda she abruptly realized was bonetired the deputy directors airplane was performing a function it had never been designed for it was meant as luxury transportation for a privileged few not as a boardinghouse the overextended galley stewards did their best they managed to provide a hot meal for everybody but it was a long way from epicurean sleeping on the plane was no pleasure either there just werent enough blankets to go around hildas rank earned her one for her very own though it wasnt much of a blanket the thing had started life as a lap robe and covered very little of hilda herself merla tepp didnt have that much rank on the floor beside hildas couch she made do with somebodys abandoned trench coat thrown over her it didnt keep tepp awake though it didnt even keep her from snoring at first hilda almost enjoyed the sound which was associated in her mind with enjoyable nights of male bedmates but it quickly got stale tepp wasnt male they hadnt been making love the noise was only noise after all and it was keeping her awake she reached over to poke tepp the woman muttered something incomprehensible without waking then turned over on her side the snoring stopped hilda however did not go immediately to sleep too much had been happening her mind was racing with the memories of her first venture into space and the way her familiar world was being remade without her consent by these bizarre creatures from other worlds now that they had actual samples of extraterrestrial machines and the expertise of the doc to dissect them the reverse engineering could start and what then it was one thing to contemplate the possible uses of adding scarecrow technology to the bureaus already formidable capacities that could be very fine capturing and bugging terrorists and dopers and turning them loose to be unwitting spies new weapons instant transportation anywhere by means of these portals why the bureau would have more power than any organization before in the worlds history except that the damn un had forced itself into the act and those same abilities would be given to their enemies that thought made her scowl up at the dimly lit ceiling there had to be some way of keeping a competitive advantage for the bureau well and for the rest of the united states too but the important thing was to keep the nbi several steps ahead of everybody else in the world was old man krieg the un american delegate skillful enough to make that happen probably not probably the bureau would have to protect itself as it always had a new sound from merla tepp made her turn her head and look down it wasnt a snore this time it was more like a sob astonished she saw that tepps face was damp with tears now what was that all about was tepp too worrying about the future but then tepp turned restlessly still asleep and the snoring started again that was insupportable hilda was confident there was no way she could ever get to sleep with that racket going on half a meter from her ears but then she did what woke her was the deputy directors voice snapping through the aircrafts pa system wake up and get going everybody the un has agreed upon a plan and distribution of the items will start in thirty minutes for an old hand like hilda thirty minutes was all the time in the world she was down the wheeled steps of the plane in less than twenty and she had even managed to browbeat the sleepy stewards into coffee and a couple of sweet rolls of course that meant she was still wearing the sleptin clothes of the day before and she hadnt even attempted a turn at the aircrafts inadequate showers but she was awake and ready it was still dark in kourou though there was a faint early glow on the eastern horizon and it was not yet unbearably hot the uns decision had been to divide the objects from starlab into four packets one would go to the united states on behalf of the whole western hemisphere one to china for the mainland asian powers one to the europeans one to australia to be shared with japan new zealand the island nations of the south pacific and the countries of indochina possession did not however confer ownership so the uns edict said firmly research would be done under multinational supervision with the resulting data to be made public as soon as obtained it was a tribute to die histrionic abilities of the experts and diplomats on the scene that not one of them was laughing out loud data to be made public hilda had no doubt that when the bureaus technicians produced data the part that would be made public would be strictly limited and the most valuable data would stay within the bureau forever the best part was that the un resolution clearly said the doc was to be in charge of any real investigation and hilda thought comfortably she knew who was in charge of the doc she made her way to where he was being peacefully led out from the shelter in which he had spent the night by his armed guards had anyone bothered to tell him what he was supposed to be doing that did not seem likely the creature did not even seem curious as under everyones watchful eyes the lucky nationals began removing the bits they had been awarded he simply stood immobile in rest mode still wearing the one coppery babushka with the other still held firmly in his lowestleft hand united nations security council resolution under the powers vested in the security council by the charter of the united nations as amended the secretary general is ordered to execute the following instructions the artifacts of alien origin are to be divided into four parts in a manner to be chosen by the secretary general each part to be deposited in an appropriate research facility in one of the four specified regions of the world all investigations into the nature and functions of these artifacts are to be conducted in the presence of a representative of the united nations and of each of the nations party to said region investigations are to be limited to noninvasive procedures until further notice it is contemplated that the individual identified as doc is to be present when any dismantling is undertaken provided the individual is physically able to undertake supervision of said artifacts by order of the security council but that caused a minor fracas as one of the indians announced that the extra babushka was definite scarecrow technology and as no one else had claimed it it should be awarded to china for india to share colonel duvalier laughed at that you want to try to take it away from him he sneered of course it must be taken from him the indian replied indignantly and when no one volunteered for the job she reached for it herself well hilda could have told the woman that that was a mistake but by the time hilda opened her mouth to warn her it was too late the docs eyes sprang open one of his great upper limbs pushed the indian delegate out of the way not violently but not gently either the woman went flying the doc didnt look after her he turned and plodded away in the direction of the parked american aircraft his armed guards raised their weapons in bafflement but someone shouted for christs sake dont shoot the thing the doc paid no attention to that threat either simply strode along with the one metal scarf on his head and the other still clutched in one arm so the deputy director said pleasantly to no one in particular i guess that settles that it did of coursethough of course everyone around began arguing vociferously hilda didnt wait to take part in the renewed bickering she hurried after the doc now stolidly climbing the steps into the deputy directors jet by the time she got inside the doc was in the lounge and he was no longer in standby mode he had commandeered some of the aircrafts monogrammed notepaper and was busily filling pages of it with his meticulous drawings the crew was passing them around interestedly until one of them caught sight of hilda with the deputy director behind her then they passed them over to higher authority hilda puzzled over them the first sketch showed the two docs together both wearing shawls over their heads the second one showed both docs in what was recognizably a hospital room one of them doing something surgical to the head of the other a human woman actually a quite good likeness of dr marsha evergood was standing by and in the last drawing the former surgeon doc was himself being operated on and dr evergood was doing the surgery the deputy director looked up at hilda i think he said judiciously that hes trying to tell us he wants to go back to walter reed hospital well yes she said suddenly thoughtful but whats this one here she was pointing to a drawing that showed a human being next to a very peculiar creature it wasnt a scarecrow nor was it any of the seven ugly space dwarfs it looked a little bit like some ancient dinosaur one of the longnecked longtailed ones that they called apatosaurus but it was standing on two legs and its rubbery neck was hovering menacingly over the human yes well marcus pell said sounding unhappy i was wondering about that myself the man looks kind of like dan dannerman doesnt he he does and that other thingcould it one of those things dopey calls a horch chapter thirtyfour all the way down on the early flight to arlington dannerman was pondering the question should he tell hilda morrisey that he and anita berman were getting married or maybe he should just lay the ultimatum on her either she got his back pay for him so he could have some kind of decent life or he quit the bureau well she wasnt at the headquarters she was off at walter reed hospital and when he tracked her down there she was standing on the loading dock giving urgent orders to a flock of seriouslooking junior agents and she wasnt interested in his problems resign bullshit danno state of emergency nobodys quitting i tried the same thing myself but as long as youre here you might as well be useful so five minutes later dannerman borrowed stunstick in hand was marching with five others down a hospital corridor toward the doc whom according to hildas orders he was supposed to restrain although the creature was facing them he didnt seem aware of their presence he was simply standing there pale ugly and immense in that nexttodead trance state the things assumed when they had no orders but damn it the creature was big the stunstick wasnt much comfort to dannerman he would have preferred a riot gun but they werent supposed to hurt the doc only tackle him if he gave any resistance even the stunsticks were to be used only as a last resort because hilda had warned them that they didnt know enough about a docs metabolism to know if the damn thing might kill him dannerman hadnt been that close to a doc since the flight home from calgary he had almost forgotten the spicysour stink of the thing or how preposterous he looked with his foamy beard and six illassorted arms the topmost right arm was the one hilda had assigned for dannerman to deal with and naturally it was one of the big muscular ones he was just trying to figure out where to grab it when the other doc appeared moving quickly and silently toward his twin from behind he wore that dumblooking metalmesh babushka dannerman had seen on tv and he wasnt alone just behind him were hilda and half a dozen more of the bureau guards all trying to be as quiet as they could not quiet enough or maybe it was that the immobile doc had caught the scent of his fellow at the last moment but just as the one with the babushka was reaching out to wrap another length of the material around the targets head the creature sprang into action and then it got noisy it didnt matter where dannerman tried to grab that gorillastrong upper arm either he didnt get the chance as he was reaching out for it the flailing arm caught him and slammed him straight across the corridor and into a wall linguistics team report nbi eyes only the task of providing a translation methodology for the language employed by the docs is without precedent in our discipline there are of course no loan words or cognates nor any evident grammatical morphology relevant to any earthly language or dialect lacking linguistic markers our present line of investigation relies on attempts to identify the words by analyzing such traits as time depth and sound diversity and to categorize them in the buhlerian threemodality functional model so far however none have been identified a dozen human beings turned out to be no match at all for a fighting doc but the one with the babushka was another matter he had one of those great arms around the throat of his twin from behind and all of the other arms frantically trying to stretch the metal mesh around his head it didnt happen right away because the captive doc was doing everything he could to avoid it but when the shawl was in place everything stopped the attacking doc mewed a sharp highpitched cats yowl to the other who abruptly let go of the unfortunate guard who had managed to grab him he stood up shedding guards mewing back excitedly to the other adjusting the shawl for himself that seemed to be it and wonderfully no one appeared to be seriously hurt let him go hilda gasped triumphant that does it is everybody all right fine now we get them down to the operating room the operating room didnt look like an operating room anymore all the usual equipment had been pushed out of the way and something that looked like a torture rack had been constructed on the floorten huge metal manacles of varying sizes bolted to the cement looking capable of holding an elephant whether they were capable of holding a doc was another question and the two of them yowling those highpitched feline sounds at each other were testing them with all their strength as dannerman and the others took their gallery seats hilda was jubilantly explaining what was going on see as long as theyve got those things on their heads theyre out of dopeys control but theyve still got some kind of bugs inside them so what we do now is we operate only in order to get them they might have to remove the shields and then well then see for yourself she pointed proudly at what was going on in the operating room before them one of the docs was lying down while the other fixed the clamps around arms legs neck so now were going to do it hilda finished with satisfaction and then looked at dannerman in a different way come here a minute while theyre getting organized she said and when they had moved out of anybody elses earshot listen are there any more of you dannermans around he looked startled jeez i hope not why are you asking she sighed i dont really know its just that that other docs been drawing pictures again and one of them showed one of you guys along with what looked like a horch any idea what that means with a horch no i never saw any of those she looked pensive for a moment then she shrugged and added in a friendlier tone oh and by the way danno congratulations can i be your best man chapter thirtyfive pat adcock could have counted on the fingers of her two hands the number of times shed visited anyone in a hospital if you left out the visits to pat five she probably could have done it on her thumbs it was not one of her favorite ways of spending an hour pat five didnt make it any more appealing either she was thoroughly sick of her incarceration and she let everybody know it i want some water she informed pat at once youll have to hold it for me im not supposed to lift anything pat did as requested holding the bottle with the flexible straw while pat five sipped then thirst quenched she spent five minutes explaining how she felt which was weak and bored and wishing the whole damn business was over then she wanted to know how things were going at the observatory which was a gratifying change of subject so pat told her how hard it was to track the actual scarecrow ship and how rosaleen seemed healthier and stronger than ever thanks it seemed to whatever the medical doc had done to her metabolism back when they were in the scarecrow captivity and how the two docs seemed to have liberated themselves from scarecrow control and were now helping with the reverse engineering of the things from starlab yes theyre very good at taking things apart pat five said bitterly pat saidhumbly because she hadnt experienced what that taking apart was like for herselfwell its not all their fault they were under scarecrow control now theyre not i suppose so pat five said unconvinced and then there didnt seem to be anything else to talk about when pat finally got out of the sickroom there was still one other chore to take care of she tracked pat fives doctor down as she stood at the nurses desk chatting with somebody who seemed to be a dietician when pat asked after pat fives condition the doctor said why dont you come into my office she was a slim orientallooking woman perhaps bengali but she spoke without an accent her office looked like a smaller less expensive version of pats own instead of astronomical pictures the doctors wall screen was running looped views of some kind of surgerystartlingly not human surgery the doctor noticed where pat was looking and slightly embarrassed flipped the screen off it is the removal of the instrument from the doc she apologized not my specialty of course but it is simply interesting to see that much of alien anatomy even if only around the neck and skull would you like some tea no then she got down to business as to yourah sister she said for lack of a better word her condition is somewhat improved the fetal heartbeats are good but we may have to deliver early it seems she evidently had some pretty roughandready surgery before she became pregnant as well as malnutrition and a bad time in general early in the pregnancy that she did said pat one yes its a great pity shes a little older than we usually see for a primapara but if shed had decent food and care she could have a dozen babies without any trouble shes built for it her expression was resentful as though she were angry at pat five for not having taken better care of herself well as it is there are some problems we may have to do a csection when it comes to that but the babies will be better off the longer the pregnancy continues in any case the prognosis is reasonably good but were watching her carefully did you have any specific questions and when pat couldnt think of any the doctor looked embarrassed again she pulled a copy of pat fives chart out of her desk and displayed it hesitantly on the margins were two signatures both in pats own hand dr pat adcock and dr pat adcock if you wouldnt mindjust for a souvenirdo you think i could have your autograph as well in the taxi on the way back to the observatory her guard mercifully quiet beside her pat meditated on her sudden vicarious fame was it going to last how would it affect her lifewould she ever be able to have dates again like any normal human being for that matter shouldnt she be getting out more now andbig questionwhat was that the doctor had said about having been built to deliver a dozen babies and if that was true for pat five after all the things the scarecrows had done to her how about pat herself who shared the identical physiology it was a queer scaryattractive thought it made something inside her twitch and she was glad when the cab ride was over and she had to attend to current reality at the observatorys reception desk janice dupage was talking to a woman who looked vaguely familiar and turned out to be maureen capobianco the cruise companion janice hadnt had the cruise however hadnt been a total success capobianco told her theyd had some sort of accident as the ship approached rio de janeiroengine trouble of some kind theyd lain dead in the water for most of one night with the antiroll pumps that shifted ballast around not working and the ship heaving uncomfortably in the atlantic swell and everybody getting seasick they finally limped into rio twelve hours late so we had a day in rio maureen told her but then they canceled the rest of the cruise and flew us home and theyre all getting some kind of a refund janice said bitterly but i got stuck for the whole thing and i didnt even get to go pat is it all right if i go out to lunch a little early whether it was all right or not pat felt she had to say it was having made janice miss her cruise because of the emergency once in her own office it didnt take long to find that that emergency search for the scarecrow scout ship had still produced nothing on the other hand it had pretty well ruled out any new spacecraft heading in toward earth at any immediately worrisome distance too she flipped on the news screen to see if anything else was happening but the only fresh items that came up had mostly to do with things like the thousands of religious fanatics at that moment demonstrating before the white house demanding that the president do somethingwhich particular something they wanted done varying from group to group who were as usual fighting among themselves she was checking the latest summaries from the scarecrow search site when belatedly she remembered to make an announcement in everybodys mail about pat fives condition a moment later rosaleen peered in but shes all right she asked hope so whatve you got there the old lady was carrying a hardcopy printout nothing useful she said ive been going over whats been published about the artifacts from starlab the people at camp smolley have started disassembling the green object disassembling but i thought they werent supposed to do that yet yes of course rosaleen said impatiently you thought they would wait until observers could be present or some such thing you have always been quite naive dear pat in any case im damned if i can figure out what that thing is supposed to be doing much less how it does it id love to get my hands on it talk to dan maybe he can arrange it pat suggested youre one of the best instrument people in the world im one of the best instrument people in the world who unfortunately also happens to be a ukrainian national rosaleen pointed out you could at least ask rosaleen grunted maybe listen ive been thinking about how that transporter works pat looked puzzled i thought we knew that it doesnt transmit anything material only a kind of blueprint of whatevers involved people machines whatever and then the thing gets constructed at the receiver technology analysis nbi agency eyes only subject tachyon transfer the socalled matter transporter which is used for communications and travel at speeds faster than light does not transport any matter the device analyzes whatever is to be transported and transmits a sort of blueprint by means of the radiation called tachyons by some american scientists there at the receiving station an exact copy is made even living creatures may be transported in this way there are two unanswered questions about this device how is the object or person to be transmitted analyzed and encoded what is the copy made from it was at first conjectured that the receiver took all the necessary elements from its surroundings and used them to construct the copy but that does not seem to be the case according to statements of the human and extraterrestrial witnesses there does not appear to be any depletion of matter in the vicinity of the receiver no matter how much mass is transmitted right out of what what do you mean out of what i mean rosaleen said patiently suppose you want to transmit a human being the raw materials in the human body are carbon nitrogen oxygen hydrogen calcium and about fifty other elements what if some of those elements dont exist at the receiving station urn pat said seeing the difficulty right so i was talking to pete schneyman about it do you know what a virtual particle is sure well pat qualified sort of yes well i dont remember that quantum stuff all that well either and its been a lot longer for me than for you so i asked pete and he began talking about the big bang first there was nothing then particles began to be generated spontaneously i do know about the big bang pat said of course you do but that spontaneous generation of particles goes on all the time only they dont last they appear and disappear in tiny fractions of picoseconds but sometimes they dont sometimes they last for a long timelike our universe pat frowned trying to remember those longago graduateschool classes you think thats how the scarecrows do it making things out of virtual particles pete does well at least he thinks thats possibly how they do it but the virtual particles always come in pairs particles and antiparticles and they annihilate each other what would they do with the antiparticles rosaleen sighed yes she admitted pete said that was where the problem was but pati wish i could be there and help them figure it all out um pat said just as the phone rang she pushed the phone button all right what is it but what it was was a woman in a nurses uniform for one scary second pat thought it was the hospital she had just left with something terribly wrong with pat five but it wasnt different nurse different hospital and the person she was calling about was janice dupage who had got herself in the way of a driveby shooters car janice has been shot pax asked uncomprehending no no she was hit by the car it was being chased by police and it seems to have run onto the sidewalk where she was walking the nurse was peering in bewilderment into her own screen no doubt catching sight of pat one in the background and realizing for the first time who she was talking to she asked us to call is she the nurse shook her head shell be all right shes got let me see a fractured right tibia and a good many lacerations and abrasions she had head injuries but the skull is intact and it seems to be only a minor concussion but the woman she was withthe nurse consulted her screenmaureen capobianco that is shes still in surgery im afraid the prognosis for her isnt as good chapter thirtysix by the time the docs were successfully debuggedand by the longer time it took for dr marsha evergood to be convinced that they were fit to travelit was too late for dannerman to catch the night courier flight home when he called anita berman to tell her hed be late the tracker found her waiting for him at the observatory she sounded excited she didnt complain when he told her his resignation hadnt been accepted no i guess it wouldnt be would it weve been watching the newsi even caught a glimpse of you hon i think anyway i talked to zigler again and hes got a new idea hes thinking about doing your life story dannerman grunted in surprise my life story and with you and me playing our own parts if the bureau will let you and the pats too which reminds me patrice wants to talk to you what patrice wanted to talk about was some papers she needed to get pat one to sign and as long as he was staying over would he mind picking them up from the morning courier plane and taking them out to camp smelly just as a favor from one movie star to another she coaxed and dannerman was too dazzled to refuse he was still dazzled when he woke the next morning but the place where he woke was in one of the vip suites in the deepdown headquarters of the national bureau of investigation where he had cadged a room from the duty officer a quick breakfast in the canteen sobered him up having his life story made into a major production was an intoxicating fantasy now he faced reality the bureau would never allow it and besides well something seemed to have changed between anita berman and himself he couldnt blame the woman for wanting to be a star even if it was happening only because she was riding on someone elses coattails namely his it didnt mean that she didnt love him he told himself certainly shed put up with any number of broken dates and unexplained advances when there was no advantage at all in it for her except her affection for dan dannerman but she did seem to be pushing pretty hard for this he put it out of his mind and headed for breakfast where he discovered his luck wasnt all the way out in the canteen he found an old acquaintance sherry walton once his contact person when he was with the scuzzhawks over their basically flavorless miso soup and their limp toast dannerman got a chance to catch up on some of the bureau gossip a chinese submarine had gone lost after being driven off from the scarecrow landing area and though it had been found again the chinese had shot most of its officers activity among the worlds terrorist bands seemed to have dwindled to a tenyear low the deputy director was pressuring the president to denounce the united nations agreement about sharing the scarecrow technology and the bureaus more sporting staffers were getting up a pool on when the next scarecrow missile would arrivea less benign one crap dannerman said positively if they were going to bomb us they would have done it already maybe they didnt have time walton offered pouring herself another cup of weak coffee of course they had time they sent the food capsule and the message with it ahha she said nodding the message i was talking to some of the experts about that did you notice the second part seemed sort of improvised like theyd already sent the capsule and timed the message to arrive when it did and then they found out we were getting ready to board the starlab they could be a really long way away you know they cant use that instanttransport gadget of theirs without a terminal so they probably have to use rockets and what if theyve already fired off a rocket and it just hasnt had time to get here yet a space future for india when india signed part three of the nonproliferation treaty it carried out all of its obligations including scrapping all of its missiles and bases and like most nations around the world abandoning its fledgling space program it now seems that was an error as recent developments have shown the conquest of space is now urgent the nations which have retained some sort of rudimentary space capabilitythe europeans the americans the chineseare now confronted with unparalleled economic opportunities and very possibly grave military responsibilities as the second most populous nation on earth we should join them forthwith hindustan times new delhi there was something new at camp smolley the bureau guards were still in place so were the rainsoaked protesters across the road but now there was also a company of bluehelmeted united nations troops fully armed deployed all around the perimeter and a detachment of the same at the checkpoints they were thorough after they put dannerman through the electronic search and stripped him of his weapons all his weapons they had just begun two of them opened the little satchel of documents dannerman had picked up from the courier flight talking to each other in spanishthese particular un troops were chileans it seemed they turned every page one turning while the other held a lamp that pulsed blue green white orangelooking for some suspicious kind of fluorescence dannerman supposedbefore they gave them back to him and let him proceed two more guards one bureau and the other un convoyed him to an office and took their posts outside the door pat one was waiting impatiently inside she wore a quarantine gown and quarantine gloves and there was a transparent visor hanging loose under her chin she looked tired all this damn paper she complained when dannerman handed her the packet couldnt you get us a lawyer that had ever heard about electronics i got you a lawyer whos going to make you rich dannerman pointed out and while she was signing he looked around half a dozen wall screens were displaying interesting thingsa news screen by the door next to it one that showed one of the docs disassembling a scarecrow gadget while half a dozen experts stood by a third screen that showed the other doc mewing and gesturing as he drew pictures for another group of experts pat one looked up those guys are mostly linguists she said we cant talk to the son of a bitch you know theyre trying to figure out what they call the deep structure of his language but all he wants to do is draw pictures cant they get dopey to help hes supposed to be a real hotshot with languages pat one shook her head he wont help us hes not even eating hes so shook up he wont even tell us what that thing is theyre taking apart he just says the beloved leaders are going to punish us all for this dannerman thought uneasily of his breakfast conversation with sherry walton did he say how not him maybe the docs trying to tell us something about that only we cant figure out what maybe she thought for a moment then shrugged i dont know if im supposed to let you see this stuff but what the hell youre a spook yourself arent you wait a minute this is priam makalanoss office and i dont know all the systems but here she finished playing with the controls on makalanoss desk and the pictures on the wall screens changed they were drawings done in the docs neat draftsmanship the first one showed the un building in new york then beijings forbidden city the arc detriomphe in paris indias taj mahalone after another the most celebrated sights on earth and in all of them there was something that didnt belong there scarecrows walking around the pictures werent photographs but they were neat and unmistakable drawings of the pumpkinheaded creatures they were showing scarecrows present in all the major cities of earth dannerman frowned at the pictures and shook his head it beats me he said it cant mean what it looks like if there were that many scarecrows here we would have seen some trace of them wouldnt we it beats me too pat one said somberly but im sure of one thing it isnt good chapter thirtyseven lawyer hecksher got to pat adcocks office before dannerman got there with the signed papers but he didnt seem to mind waiting he sat in a corner carefully rereading his papers and making cryptic pencilonpad notes for himself paying no attention to pat or his surroundings as she went on with her work it wasnt a long wait dannerman had made a quick trip from the airport and as pat went out to meet him she found him standing at the reception desk his anita berman on his arm chatting with janice dupage who was standing uncomfortably on her crutches pat frowned she hadnt expected to see janice there then she remembered why i thought you were going to your friends funeral janice looked putupon its been postponed dont ask me why some damn kind of red tape too bad pat said absently taking the clutch of documents from dannerman and leaving him there mr hecksher took the papers from her courteously and spent a good five minutes checking them over then he gave her a cheerful smile looks all right signed in all the right places now if youll excuse me ill start getting them served does that mean somebody will have to fly to china and all china no well serve that one on their ambassador here thats what ambassadors are for but i think wed better serve the europeans in personoh i see whats on your mind he added beaming at her youre worried about the costs dont worry itll all be on the bill when we settle and if we dont settle pat asked he looked surprised but we will did you read the texts you signed part of the court submission is a request for an estoppal ordering them to make no changes in the artifacts already on hand because of the risk of damaging the observatorys property pat frowned theyre not going to do that are they exactly my dear theyre going to want this little problem to go away and the easiest way to do it is to throw money at us oh i think well have an offer to settle within a week the only question is how much were willing to take we should discuss that of course i was originally thinking of a hundred million dollars adjusted for current inflation with an additional royalty on all commercial devices based on the discovered technology but he paused listening whats that pat had heard it too raised voices from outside she went to the door and looked out pete schneyman was standing there looking thunderstruck were invaded he announced its the feds theyve taken janice away and now they want to question all of us ls soon as lawyer hecksher saw what was going on he patted the nearest pat on the shoulder and said benevolently ill take care of this but he didnt he went away with the agent in charge and didnt come back there were at least a dozen new bureau agents tough ones they were full of questions though what they were questioning everybody about exactly they would not say the first thing they did was to shuttle everybody in the observatory up to its top floor with bureau agents making sure they stayed there phones rang unanswered computer screens beeped impatiently for inputs that didnt come the observatory staff milled in the topfloor file rooms and hallways while they were taken half a dozen at a time down to the middle floor for interviews when it came pats turn she was conducted to her own office where a middleaged woman had preempted her desk now that was too much scowling she asserted herself i protest this unwarranted yes yes the agent said without patience have a seat what i want to know is what janice dupage has been doing in the last three weeks what happened three weeks ago pat demanded thats when the three weeks im asking about began just answer the questions ms adcock have you noticed anything unusual about the subjects behavior in that period pat thought you mean outside of getting run over by a car yes not really of course she was in the hospital for some of that time and i was away sometimes too what do you mean by unusual anyway by unusual i mean anything that isnt usual the agent explained start with tuesday the twentyfourth oh right pat said enlightenment coming that was the day that scarecrow spacecraft scared us all half to death that day yes well and so it went day by day the questions were thorough but pat was pretty sure that the agent wasnt getting anything usefulwasnt getting anything from her that she hadnt already heard from the previous interviewees when she was released she was told she could go home she didnt though she went down to the lower floor where the people the agents had finished with were congregating in the conference room then dannerman came in looking worried i came as soon as i got your call he told pat one and i talked to jilly hohmanshes the agent in charge here so whats it all about pat one demanded he looked even more worried its that friend of janices they did a routine autopsy on her and they found a bug a bug in janices friend butbut she was never out in space said pat and dannerman nodded somberly thats the problem he said she never was chapter thirtyeight the news about the bug in the cruise passengers head caught hilda morrisey on the wing she was halfway to arlington for a moment she thought of pulling rank ordering the pilot to take her back to the scene of this unwelcome new glitch in new york reason prevailed the new york bureau people were dealing with it and most of them had recently been her own people she could leave that to them anyway she could get a better picture at headquarters the picture refused to come clear when all the questioning was done nobody at the dannerman astrophysical observatory had any useful information about the late maureen capobianco neither did any of her friends and family once the bureau had tracked them down nor did the x rays find a bug in any of them it wasnt until they got a passenger list from the operators of her cruise ship that the bureau struck pay dirt that was a break a checker recognized two of the names on the list as his own neighbors when the bureaus people descended on them they were startled but cooperative and the x rays told the story they too were bugged both of them so when they were tracked down were the members of a bridge club from baltimore who had treated themselves to the cruise all twentysix of them so was a barman from the cruise ship furloughed to his mothers home in the district itself so was every last one they could find of the ships passengers and crew members that wasnt all hilda morrisey got the news first and brought it to the deputy director there were these six ecuadorians from a fishing boat that had been near the splash site they had it too shit marcus pell said dismally its an epidemic we should have anticipated this hilda its what the doc was trying to tell us with those pictures i guess we thought he meant actual scarecrows were coming i guess we did he sighed all right take off for camp smelly hilda see if you can get anything out of that damn dopey she stood up to go then turned pell had not seemed all that surprised to hear about the ecuadorians is there anything else he hesitated then shrugged keep it under your hat but yes we got a report from an asset in vietnam the chinese are rounding up the whole crew of that submarine that went missing the one where they executed the captain and the engineering officer he grimaced you know how they execute criminals one bullet in the back of the neckso the organs wont be spoiled for transplant well the shot hit a bug jesus a thought struck her i thought we had our own asset in the chinese navy how come we had to get this from the viets they shot our asset too in the back of brigadier hilda morriseys mind she had been thinking of this as a good time for another recreational eveninga long soak a light meal the new dress with the skirt slits that made the best of her still very good legs the address of a new bar that was highly recommended for goodlooking men it wasnt much to ask she was fully entitled to it because for gods sake she was human but here she was at camp smolley again and what was in the back of brigadier morriseys mind stayed where it was the camp was in an uproar daisy fennell was there giving colonel makalanos a hard time for imagined failings at getting more information out of the docs all three of the freaks were back at the biowar station and security precautions were doubled there was an armed guard at the door of the interrogation room where the two docs were vociferously mewing at dopey whatever they were saying they seemed to think it was urgent but the little turkey was adamantly refusing to respond his cat eyes squeezed shut his little paws thrust firmly into that coppery belly bag in a corner of the room dannerman was having an agitated lowvoiced conversation with a woman it wasnt until hilda recognized the woman as anita herman that she knew which dannerman it was the linguistics team was on hand doing their best to get a clue as to the docs language but if they were making any progress at all hilda couldnt see how it didnt seem that way to her her first target was dannerman as she approached anita berman was in the process of jumping up and delivering a final scathing remark i dont care about the money i dont care about the part what i care about is getting you out of this crazy life youre leading she flounced away leaving dannerman peering after her the funny thing was he was actually looking pleased whats that all about hilda asked he shook his head something i was worried about thats all listen is it true about all these bugs being found damn straight its true but that isnt what i wanted to ask you have you had a chance to talk to dopey about that drawing the doc made the fond smile evaporated from his face uh yes he said reluctantly he saidwell he didnt say anything for sure only maybe damn you maybe what he swallowed he said he didnt know anything really but after all the horch captured everything the scarecrows had on that planet including the transit machinethe one that made copies of us so if they wanted more copies of me or anything else there wouldnt be anything in the world that could stop them there was a goddam limit hilda morrisey told herself to the number of things she should have to worry about at one time how many crazinesses were going to be thrown at her she sat down trying to collect her thoughts merla tepp appeared from nowhere silently bearing a cup of coffee and when hilda looked at the womans face there was one more annoyance staring at her the woman had the expression of someone more putupon than was bearableeven more putupon than hilda herself though perhaps for different reasons hilda put her aides problems out of her mind and concentrated on what was going on hilda morrisey had presided at plenty of interrogations in her career but never one like this this time the subjects were doing their best to spill every last thing they knew in fact they were doing it nonstop their mewing voices sometimes plaintive sometimes yowling mad but what they were carrying on about no one could say it was the translator who was the problem dopey was not cooperating occasionally he mewed irritably back at the docs mostly he merely sat huddled silently on his perch eyes closed in suffering tail plume dull and dejected from where the observers sat on the other side of the oneway glass they could see patrice in the interrogation room with the subjects where she had been for the last hour she was expostulating with dopey but he was ignoring her as well patrice sighed and came out i need a break she said looking at the linguistics team as they hovered over their frequency analyzers and screens you guys getting anything she asked the head of the team shook her head cant tewell hilda thought theirs was a pretty forlorn hope to begin with a language was not like a cipher and all the computers in the world were not likely to solve the translation problem while infuriatingly the finest translation system the world had ever known was sulking on his perch not a dozen meters away and refusing to help if we could just get a few sentences that were in both languages to match up we might make a start the woman said pensively like the rosetta stone you know damn the rosetta stone and damn that goddam freak daisy fennell said dont we have any way to make the little bastard cooperate patrice adcock looked almost amused what would you suggest threaten his life maybe but he isnt worrying about dying he thinks hed get brownie points with the scarecrows if he died doing something in their servicelike refusing to translate for the docs technology analysis nbi agency eyes only subject virtual energy and tachyon transport according to quantum theory there is no such thing as a vacuum anywhere in the universe everywhereat the heart of a star on a planet like the earth even in the great voids between clusters of galaxiesevery volume of space however tiny is constantly seething with a boil of virtual subatomic particles particles which appear spontaneously interact with others are mutually destroyed by canceling each others charges out and disappearso rapidly that they are impossible to detect buttheory suggeststhey dont always disappear in fact the birth of the universe in the big bang can be best understood as a sudden explosion of such particles which somehow are not annihilated but survive and increase and indeed become everything we see in the vast universe around us is it possible to reproduce this process artificially if so can the generated particles be the ones needed to create particular atoms and if this is also so can this be the way the scarecrows tachyon transporter builds the raw materials to make its copies who said anything about dying he can feel pain cant he oh no patrice said shaking her head put that idea right out of your mind ive told you hes too fragile for us to beat it out of him you know we actually killed a dopey back when we were captives didnt take much either martin delasquez fell on him and he died she thought for a moment then added that time it seemed not to have mattered particularly because another dopey popped up right away but now hilda knew the answer to that now they had only the one dopey with no magical mystery transporter box to create another if they wasted this one hilda appreciated the difficulties of the situation she appreciated too the fact that vice deputy director daisy fennell was here to carry the can that was a break if anyone was going to be associated with a failed enterprise she didnt want it to be herself she became aware that her aide was clutching the back of her chair what is it tepp the woman looked even more haggard than usual her face strained her demeanor peculiarin fact hilda thought tepp had been acting even more than ordinarily strange ever since they got there nothing maam she said thickly hilda glared at her nothing my ass are you going to puke again tepp seemed frightened oh no maam i dont think so but that smell hilda sighed resigned the time had come she said crisply youre relieved get out of here go back to arlington for reassignment maam go hilda ordered and turned her back on her former aide not for long when she heard a pathetic throatclearing from behind her she turned back now angry you still here tepp held her ground yes maam im going maam but theres one thing for christs sake what now its my aunt i promised id come and see her tonight and i didnt get a chance to call her before we left the headquarters shes sick if i could just have permission to use a phone for a minute hilda shrugged it wasnt exactly giving permission but it wasnt a flat rejection either as tepp hurriedly left the little viewing room hilda didnt even look after her merla tepp was now a dead issue she turned to patrice adcock didnt dopey say anything at all when you told him about all the bugs he was delighted to hear about it patrice said sourly he asked me half a dozen times if we were sure it was the same kind of bug i had the docs were doing their best to ask him what was going on he mewed something at them but then he paid no attention to them at all then he said to me youll see and went back to not talking i took that as a threat i think wait a minute makalanos said suddenly he turned to the linguistics crew did you get that see if you can check what he said to the docs right then the first thing after dr adcock told him about the bug hey said the linguist coming alive good point it might help and indeed it might have but not right then that was when the interrogation came to an abrupt halt and it was merla tepp who halted it chapter thirtynine outside the zoo cage merla tepp took a deep breath forcing herself to be calm she wasnt surprised at what had happened the brigadier had been on the point of firing her often enough before but she couldnt help wishing it had happened just a little later she was going to miss the job she would even miss hilda morrisey herself a wicked woman certainly but in some ways an admirable one there was no use thinking that way she knew what she had to do she turned her back on the armed guard who had been looking at her with some concern and marched to the office of lieutenant colonel makalanos his assistant transmitting copies of the docs latest drawings to headquarters looked up in surprise out merla ordered i have to make a secure call the man got up to leave looking baffled but obedient and merla sat before his screen when she had terminated the assistants transmission she sat for a moment moving her lips in silent prayer then she dialed the number in roanoke virginia and spoke to the placid grayhaired lady whose face appeared on the screen aunt billie im really upset brigadier morrisey has fired me as her aide and i dont know what to do the woman looked concerned though not particularly surprised she tsktsked sympathetically thats too bad dear i know how you must feel is there any chance that shell change her mind i dont think so what a pity the woman said vaguely she paused shaking her head in regret then she came to a decision she said im sorry if i sound a little upset its one of my bad days you see the left knee and both elbows againim afraid ill have to have the surgery very soon now tepp caught her breath the knee and the two elbows when oh very soon as soon as possible in fact i wish it werent necessary but theres no sense in putting it off any longer is there she was silent for a moment then briskly im afraid i must go now dear ill pray for you tepp terminated the connection and sat for a moment breathing deeply then she stood up and left the office thanks she said to the assistant and headed back for the cage the outside guard had gone back to his daydreaming but he woke up quickly when tepp ordered give me your weapon do what but i cant its brigadier morriseys order she said taking it from him and checking the safety here you can ask her yourself and she pushed the door open inside hilda morrisey turned to glare at her now what the hell do you want tepp she demanded and then saw the gun the guard suddenly alert reached for the weapon merla tepp was faster than he was she stepped back and put a quick round into his right thigh the man screeched like an owl and collapsed as she set the weapon to full automatic and sobbing aloud at last sprayed hilda and those devilinspired alien monsters from hell she got off half a hundred rounds before she realized that lieutenant colonel makalanos had a gun of his own and he had drawn it too late she turned toward him when his first shot hit her right in the breastbone it was like being struck with a leaden baseball bat and that was the last merla tepp knew of anything at all in this life chapter forty for daisy fennell it was the worst night of her long career with the bureau and it went on forever dr ben jayya dithered uselessly over the casualties protesting that he was a research md not a caregiver but someone had already called the paramedics they were there in five minutes three cars of them screeching past the startled un guards with their siren going it took them a lot longer than that though to figure out what to do once they got there the leg of the wounded guard was all in a days work for them so was the lobe of dannermans ear which he had nearly lost to tepps spray of fire for hilda morrisey the big problem was stopping the bleeding from her throat and getting her into one of the ambulances on the very faint chance that she would still be alive when she got to the emergency room and there was nothing at all to be done for either tepp herself or for the one of the docs who now lay doubledover on the floor and exuding great amounts of a pinkish fluid beyond doubt well and truly dead it was the other two extraterrestrials that were the problem tepps shot had caught dopey in his great colorful fantail and though he was complaining bitterly about the agony he was suffering he had allowed camp smolleys medics to dress the wound as best they could the surviving doc was another matter he had taken three of tepps rounds two were in his left major arm and though whatever he had for a tibia had been shattered those wounds didnt seem immediately lifethreatening it was the one that had struck his chest that worried the medics the bullet was still in there and he was mewing softly in pain as he lay flat on his back on the floor with pat adcockpat onecomfortingly holding one of his lesser paws the head medic looked up from where he was bent over the golems torso his face grayish that bullet has to come out he informed daisy fennell do you authorize us to do it fennell hesitated wishing she could buck that question to somebody higher up like the deputy director she couldnt she temporized do you know what youre doing pat adcock spoke up of course they dont know what theyre doing she said scornfully why dont you get that walter reed doctor out here shes the only one who knows anything at all about doc anatomy dr evergood but all she did was take a bug out do you have any better ideas and of course she didnt when they got dr marsha evergood she looked tousled and sleepy and pretty damn mad have you stopped the bleeding she demanded applied broadspectrum antibiotics all right then get him over to walter reed right away ill meet you there we thought maybe you might want to come out here daisy offered aware she was sounding uncharacteristically humble think that one over again lady bring the dead one along too ill use the cadaver for a quick anatomy course now no matter how much daisy fennell tried to hurry him along dr ben jayya was being a pain in the ass no laboratory specimen he was insisting firmly should ever be transported anywhere until it was stabilized preferably by soaking it in formaldehyde first fennell overfirmed him shut up she said and turned her back on the biologist to beckon to colonel makalanos get some ice she ordered pack him up and lets get the two of them the hell out of here the trouble with that was that the medevac chopper was barely able to cope with the weight of the two extraterrestrials one in his plastic body bag filled with ice cubes the other with the head medic standing by with spare compresses if needed on the way daisy and the dopey had to wait for another helicopter to be summoned reverend portman denies responsibility at the headquarters of the christian league against blasphemy their spokesman the reverend alec portman declined to be interviewed but issued this prepared statement we deplore the actions at camp smolley if it is true as has been alleged that the woman who committed these vile crimes was associated with some members of our organization she has done our cause no good it is our belief that these alleged creatures from space are indeed evil and may be incarnations of the devil however we are nonviolent we accept no responsibility for these alleged acts if these creatures had been returned to the hell they came from as has been in our prayers ever since they arrived none of this need have happened the new york times when she finally got to walter reed the two docs lay side by side in the operating room evergood had already slashed the corpses torso open and an assistant was severing ribswhat looked like ribs anywaywith a power bone saw it was more than daisy fennell wanted to endure she fled in the nearest ladies room she locked herself in a cubicle and sat she was breathing hard and most of her thoughts were not about the surgery going on a few dozen meters away the subject uppermost in vice deputy fennells mind was her career and whether she was still going to have one by this time the next day of course the whole damn screwup was hilda morriseys fault hilda was the one who had taken this merla tepp on as her aide and thus given the woman access to biowar but hilda was not in a condition to be put on trial at least for now and neither was the tepp woman permanently that wasnt fennells doing she wasnt the one who shot tepp dead but she was the senior officer present and so she knew who the responsibility would belong to she shuddered it was bad but it would get a lot worse if the deputy director arrived and caught her screwing off in the crapper she stood up marched to the washstand splashed water on her face looked at herself in the mirror shuddered again and resolutely went back to the operating room to her surprise she was allowed inside but not before one of the other doctors stopped her with orders to scrub up and put on a surgical mask when daisy protested he snapped right the docs didnt bother with asepsis but were going to do it dr evergoods way use that washstand and plenty of soap the docs hadnt bothered with anesthesia either and there wasnt anything dr evergood could do about that she didnt dare try putting her patient out or even numbing the immediate vicinity of the wound the patient seemed to accept that the mewing stopped he lay immobile eyes closed and the only sign that he might be feeling pain was the trembling of his lesser arms while evergood cautiously widened the entrance wound and probed for the bullet it took her a while to navigate through the unfamiliar architecture of the docs muscles and blood vessels but when she finally extracted the round she breathed a sigh of relief she doused the whole area with broadspectrum antibiotics and stood up wearily regarding her patient who opened his eyes and gazed at her for a moment then turned to pat one miming writing something with his lesser arms he wants to draw some more pictures pat guessed can i let him evergood shrugged why not make sure you give him clean paper and a clean pen and dont let him touch the dressing fennell lets go talk daisy fennell was glad enough to get out of there she hadnt been willing to leave while the operation was going on but the smell of the doc was getting to her they found the deputy director outside snapping orders to his portable screen in colonel makalanoss office but he switched it off when he saw them evergood got right to the point the bullet s out ive stopped the bleeding and now we have to watch for infection im hoping there wont be any if there are any disease organisms around theyre probably terrestrial ones and the antibiotics should deal with them of course well have to do something about that arm thanks he said and remembered to add a fine job dr evergood it was a dismissal and the surgeon took it that way then he turned to daisy fennell jesus daisy he remarked you let things go pretty sour didnt you tepp dead morrisey close to it the dopey and one of the docs woundedand we cant get the other one to care for them because hes dead too well lets get the facts well have to have a court of inquiry but for now start talking chapter fortyone the bodies had been removed and the blood mopped upcarefully sponged up with sterile plastic pads actually at least the thin pink stuff that had come out of the docs because dr ben jayya demanded every atom of it for his endless lab work dan dannerman on his second wakeup pill finally got a chance to reassure anita herman when she saw his bandaged head she gasped in shock he did his best to reassure her no no im fine its nothing just my car and had to explain that it was just a little piece that was missing reattach it well the bureau surgeon had talked about that when he got there he admitted except that by then they couldnt find enough of it to bother with which produced another yelp of horror honestly it doesnt even hurt he said and tried to change the subject have you talked to the people at the observatory how are things things at the observatory were crazy rosaleen artzybachova was upset did dannerman know that the doc that got killed was the one that had saved her life and was he sure that patrice and pat one were all right and whenpleadinglywere they going to get out of this lousy place as soon as i can he promised maybe tomorrow i dont know theres doing to be a court of inquiry and they want me to stick around for that trouble no im not in trouble nobody thinks tin to blame its daisy fennell thats in trouble here but i have to testify he cast about for something more cheerful to say and found it he grinned at her listen one good thing you wanted to know how you could tell us apart that wont be a problem anymore im lopear dannerman now she was silent for a moment thinking about that then she sighed all right hon tell me one thing i lave they found out why she did it that was what the whole bureau was working on at that moment and their investigation had begun to bear fruit tepps phone call was easily traced and since it had been made from a bureau secure phone it had been recorded the receiving party was mrs willa tepp borglund widow lady living by herself in a little house near roanoke virginia and when the recording was played the conversation was brief and agitated the actual words between tepp and her aunt billie were trivial enough but the tones were not there was an undercurrent of strain and excitement that didnt match the words actually spoken well it was obvious enough to daisy fennell they were talking in code and the old lady had given her niece the order obvious enoughbut too late to be much use when the bureau raided the house of mrs willa tepp borglund they found an armory of weapons and an ironhaired ironwilled old lady who spoke not to them but to her god praying in whispers every waking moment they checked her phones of course and found calls to places all over the country bureau agents in wichita and brooklyn and st petersburg and spokane were pulled away from their smugglers and tax evaders and assembled into raiding partiestwo dozen of them in all it was a massive effort typical of the wonders the bureau could accomplish when it put its collective mind to a task of course it too came a little late when dannerman got to see the deputy director pell flicked his screen on and fiddled with the pad until it displayed a picture of a darkskinned man in a fringed leather jacket stubbornly silent while he was being questioned by bureau agents i thought youd like to see he said grimly this guy is one of willa borglunds phone chums runs a souvenir shop in navajo country according to his phone records he has been making calls to a chinese trade commission member at his home faxes mostly and theyre all naturally encoded but what it looks like to me he said sounding somber is that the damn nuts are all in touch with each other the keys to deciding whether the universe would ever slow down and recollapse were the hubble constantthe rate at which the universe was presently expandingand the associated value called qzero or the rate at which that expansion was slowing down the best way to measure the hubble constant was by studying the most distant observable type la supernovae which like the cepheids formerly studied in the same way could all be assumed to have the same intrinsic brightness so the dimmer they seemed the farther they were the big advantage the supernovae had over the cepheids was that they were about a million times as bright which meant they could be seen and measured about a million times as far away and once you used that fact to estimate their intrinsic brightness and thus their distance and contrasted that distance with what should be their distance as indicated by the redshift of their light why then you could tell what the qzero function said about whether the universes expansion was slowing down there were other things you could measure as well but they all seemed to give the same answer the universe was not going to recollapse at all so what was it that the horch and the scarecrows knew that earthly astronomers hadnt even guessed so there really was a leak in the bureau fennell breathed right and her name was merla tepp if it was true that merla tepp was b tatting out bureau secrets to half the world it explained a lotthe way the ukrainian nut cult knew exactly what the plans were for rosaleen artzybachova for instance the way the protesters always knew where to go but it also meant that almost everything the bureau had done since merla tepp arrived for duty or at least everything that hilda morrissey might have known about and let her aide in on was now compromised and that meant that meant some long hard weeks or months of cleanup and damage control all of the bureaus encryption programs would have to be changed every field operation would have to doublecheck personnel and contacts to see how far the leak had spread some good hard administrative work was called forthe very thing that vice deputy director daisy fennell was good at as she went looking for marcus pell she was planning in her mind the series of orders and directives that would have to go out this minute the deputy director didnt seem to want to hear he was leaning over an assortment of scraps of paper littering colonel makalanoss desk adcock and dannerman by his side even dopey was in the room waddling triumphantly around with the great bandage on his tail hardly hiding its blazing colors pell raised a hand to cut off what daisy fennell had to say look at this he said heavily there were a dozen of the sheets of paper arranged in some sort of order the first showed a recognizable drawing of the food ship the second showed the ship again but this time it was attached to a larger metal capsule the third showed the capsule detaching itself underwater while the food container floated on the surface the fourth showed that larger capsule with five or six others just like it all around it the fifth showed one of the larger capsules drawn tiny in one corner with a balloon encircling a host of aliensa dopey several docs but three or four other species fennell had never seen before she looked up puzzled i thought there should have been more to that food ship dannerman was grumbling while pat adcock explained those other creatures are other races that work for the scarecrows the ones that look a little bit like bashful i think theyre warriors warriors fennell rocked back on her heels regarding the deputy director does all this mean what i think it means what i think it means pell said heavily is that some of their terminals came to earth along with the food and now theyre making more of themunderwater where were going to have a hard time finding them he shook his head we didnt understand those other drawings he made for us did we he wasnt thinking about the bugs in those people from the ships he was trying to tell us that the scarecrows had their people on earth already all around us
