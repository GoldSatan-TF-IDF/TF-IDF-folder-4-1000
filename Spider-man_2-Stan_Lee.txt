her makeup in the dressing room at the theatre she looked at herself in the mirror will he come she thought a mans face appeared at the dressing room door five minutes five minutes he called then he was gone peter was on his bike and he was nearly at the theatre suddenly a big car drove up behind him very fast jump up his spider sense told him peter jumped high above the car his bike fell under the car and broke into pieces a moment later he was standing safely on his feet again how did you do that asked a boy at the side of the road i do a lot of exercise peter said and i eat my green vegetables my mother always says that said the boy i just never believed her the big car was driving very fast up the road now a gunman was shooting out of the back of the car at the police why cant i have just one night off thought peter suddenly two police cars crashed into each other one of the cars flew up high above some people they cried out as the car fell towards them but then it stopped still it didnt hit the people everyone looked at the car above them something was holding the car there its a web said a woman suddenly something blue and red swung over their heads go spidey go the woman shouted the men in the big car saw him they both started shooting at spiderman peter was really angry he wanted to be at the theatre he jumped onto the back of the car he shot webbing at the two men then pulled them out of the car next he pulled the webbing over a street light and the men were hanging high above the road peter jumped into the drivers seat and drove the car to the theatre mj wasnt having a good night she wasnt thinking about the play she was thinking about one of the best seats in the theatre peters seat it was empty peter walked into the theatre and pulled his ticket from his pocket he showed it to the man at the door sorry said the man he pointed to a sign you cant go in when the doors are closed he explained peter crossed the road and waited opposite the theatre mj came out after the play she looked up and down the street no peter could you sign here please said a goodlooking young man what are you doing here smiled mj it was john mjs new boyfriend he put his arms around her and they kissed a police car drove by fast then another and another are you hungry john asked yes smiled mj very one the other side of the road peter watched sadly as mj and john hurried away then he remembered the police cars why do i always have to rescue people from fires and criminals he thought i only wanted one evening at the theatre he changed his clothes in a small street he ran up the side of a building and jumped onto the roof for the first time ever he didnt want to do it but he was spider man he had to do it soon he was swinging from building to building towards the police cars he brought his arm around to shoot a line of webbingbut nothing happened spiderman was high above the street with no webbing aaaagh he cried as he crashed down onto a building below he stood up slowly and looked down then he looked at his hands and tried to shoot some webbing nothing whats happening to me he thought five minutes later he was in a lift a man with a dog got in cool spidey clothes the man said thanks said peter all through dr connors class peter thought about mj after the class he phoned her from the university there was no answer so he left a message hi

welcome everyone said otto you are the first people ever to see fusion energy its safe and we can make it again and again its cheap too cheap electricity for everyone otto moved across the room towards four big metal arms ooooooh everyone said as otto fitted the arms onto his back its not possible to control the fusion reaction with my hands so i use these metal ones i control them with my brain he explained dr octavius asked one of the visitors is there a danger the arms can control you good question said otto my brain is safe because of this microchip at the back of my head he turned and showed them i control the arms he said they dont control me otto walked to the back of the room blue lights went on and there was ottos fusion reactor the metal arms moved they lifted up a very small piece of tritium there are less than twelve kilos of tritium in the world he explained i want to thank harry osborn and oscorp for giving me this tritium happy to pay the bills otto called harry otto turned to smile at his wife rosie this was his big moment he started the reaction the tritium started to go round very fast suddenly it changed into a small ball of fire it started to grow the light was very strong the visitors couldnt believe it the energy of the sun was in the room in front of them otto used the metal arms to control the reaction lines of fire shot from the fireball the arms stopped each one and pushed it back to the centre the arms moved faster and faster and the light became stronger and stronger but then something happened the reactor started to pull some of the metal things in the room into its centre lines of fire shot everywhere otto was losing control people shouted and tried to escape harrys face was white he turned towards peter but peter wasnt there turn it off shouted harry turn it off wait shouted otto i can control it a big metal cupboard was flying towards harry but suddenly spiderman appeared he caught harry and pulled him away from danger for a moment spiderman and harry were face to face but harry still hated spiderman this doesnt change anything harry said but spiderman didnt have time to talk he ran around the walls to the reactor he tried to pull the cables out of the wall what are you doing shouted otto im trying to stop the reaction answered spiderman one of ottos metal arms hit spiderman but at that moment the big windows in the room broke into a thousand and pieces metal and glass flew fast towards otto and rosie the metal arms moved in front of ottos body he was safe but rosie fell to the floor rosie shouted otto then a line of fire from the reactor hit otto in the back he fell to the floor smoke came out of the microchip spiderman pulled and pulled finally the cables came out of the wall the reactor stopped the lights went out everything went quiet ottos body showed signs of life they took him to hospital but it was too late for rosie harry stood in the street outside his car was waiting but he didnt get in ive lost everything he said ive nothing except spiderman but he saved your life said one of the oscorp men he made me look stupid today hell pay for this harry got in his car and left chapter six doc ock otto was on a big table in the hospital theatre the doctors were ready ok said dr isaacs we need to take off these metal arms he moved towards the first metal arm with a knife but then he stopped the arm was looking at him then suddenly the arm hit dr isaacs very hard he flew across the room and crashed through a window then the arms turned to the other doctors and killed them too otto woke up and looked around he was in a hospital theatre and then he saw bodies blood and glass everywhere no cried all this was his fault the arms were killers and he couldnt stop them otto tried to stand the arms helped him two of the arms became legs they walked out of the hospital and into the road a taxi was going to crash into them but the arms hit the taxi and it turned over they went down to the hudson river there they found an empty old building above the water the arms had some dark plans this was a great place to make them real everyones talking about it cried jonah jameson in his office at the daily bugle a crazy scientist with four metal arms what do we call him he shouted dr octopus said one of his men dr octopus doc ock i love it betty brandt brought peter into the office

otto was sitting all alone my rosies dead he said my dream is dead he looked down sadly at the water something is talking in my brain he thought he put his hand to the back of his head the microchip was gone peter was right otto said i couldnt control the reaction but then the voice in his brain got louder it was working it said we can build the reactor again yes said otto well build again we need money we will take money its a crime not to finish our work the arms were taking control of his brain now the energy of the sun in my hands cried otto nothing will stand in our way nothing no

spider sense woke up doc ock arrived at the bank he was wearing a big coat and dark glasses he wanted money too but he wasnt going to ask for it the long arms came out of his coat they pulled off a big metal door at the back of the bank they threw the door across the bank towards peter and aunt may peter ran to change his clothes dont leave me called aunt may spiderman ran around the walls behind doc ock the arms threw bags of money at him peter tried to shoot some webbing but nothing happened a bag of money hit peter and he fell to the floor the metal arms lifted him up two metal hands pushed down on his head now peter was angry he shot webbing to the right and left he pulled two heavy desks fast towards ock doc ock and a desk crashed through the bank window people on the street outside cried out at that moment two police cars arrived the police jumped out and pointed their guns at ock a metal arm moved towards a crowd of people and took a woman in its hand it was aunt may she had an umbrella in her hand and she hit ock with it dont follow me ock shouted and he ran up the side of a high building the police couldnt shoot at ock because he had aunt may in his arms spider man was waiting near the top of the building give her to me he said at first ock lifted aunt may up to spiderman but then he opened his metal hand now aunt may was falling fast in a moment spiderman shot webbing at aunt may and stopped her fall ock hit spiderman and aunt may swung back up she hung onto the building with her umbrella ock and spiderman fought up and down the building ock threw spiderman through a window of a building across the street peter shot webbing at both sides of the window he pulled back on the webbing and fired himself across to ock and aunt may ock held aunt may behind his back a long knife came out of one of the arms suddenly aunt may swung her umbrella into ocks face his dark glasses broke and he cried out he dropped aunt may again but spiderman shot two lines of webbing down to aunt may and quickly caught her he swung down to the street and put her down very carefully aunt may wasnt in danger now so the police started to shoot at ock but ock went

they were still alive then they heard a loud noise thump and then again thump in the street outside people were running and crying out then doc ock appeared in front of them peter parker he smiled and the girlfriend what do you want asked peter suddenly a metal arm moved forward and lifted peter up i want your friend spiderman said ock tell him to meet me at the westside tower at three oclock but i

clothes were gone and in their place was a web a very big web and a message from spiderman spiderman was a criminal shouted jameson chapter ten the el train peter put on his spiderman clothes they felt right he wasnt thinking about his problems now he was only thinking about mj and now there was no problem with his webbing he jumped off the roof of the daily bugle and swung through manhattan spiderman was back he swung through the tall buildings until he arrived at the westside tower it was three oclock and doc ock was waiting for him where is she called spiderman shell be fine said ock lets talk a metal arm swung at spiderman from the right another swung from the left spiderman was falling fast he shot some webbing onto the tower then he shot some webbing at ock and pulled hard ock and spiderman fell together right onto the top of an el train spiderman and doc ock fought each other on top of the train ock broke the train windows and took two people with his metal arms he threw the people down to the street below spiderman quickly made webs and caught the people then ock moved to the front of the train smash one of his metal arms broke the front window of the train and the driver cried out then the arm broke the train controls now the train was going faster and faster it was going to crash spiderman had to save the passengers and ock knew this he smiled at spiderman and jumped off the train spiderman used his spider sense to look ahead the end of the line was very near and it was high above the water he shot webbing onto a building on one side and a building on the other side but the webbing just pulled off bits from both buildings then spiderman shot webbing onto every building he held all the lines of webbing in his hands his body was ready to break the train reached the end of the lineand stopped just in time the passengers pulled spiderman into the train they lifted him above their heads very carefully they put him on the floor then slowly peter opened his eyes he saw lots of faces looking down at him faces of men women and children and spiderman was their hero slowly spiderman stood up but just then doc ock appeared he pushed spiderman to the floor and this time spiderman couldnt get up it was a stormy night and harry was drinking in his fathers old room suddenly he turned around and doc ock was standing there with spiderman in his arms ock dropped spiderman onto a sofa and the tritium he asked harry unlocked a secret cupboard a long metal arm pushed harry away and took out the tritium then ock disappeared quickly into the storm harry moved slowly towards spiderman he took a knife from his fathers desk his face was white and angry he lifted the knife above spiderman first lets see your face he said i can look into your eyes as you die in the light from the storm harry looked at the true face of spiderman he stood back and dropped the knife peter no it cant be peter looked into harrys eyes he got up quickly harry he said where is she peter was only interested in one thing hes got mj no harry couldnt believe it he only wanted the tritium tritium shouted peter hes building the reactor again when that happens shell die and half of new york will die too peter you killed my father there are bigger things happening right now said peter harry please i have to stop him chapter eleven the fireball in the building on the river metal cables held mj to the wall youve got everything you need she shouted at doc ock now let me go i cant let you go youll call the police ock started a fusion reaction a small ball of fire appeared in the centre of the reactor it started to grow high above mj someone climbed quietly into the building surprise called a soft voice mj looked up it was spiderman suddenly a metal arm swung towards spiderman and he jumped to the floor stop the reactor ock said spiderman youre going in hurt a lot more people this time he tried to jump over ock to the reactors cables but two metal arms threw him through the roof and out of the building moments later spiderman swung back in he hit ock hard with both feet they both went down through the floor into the water the ball of fire was bigger now it started pulling metal into its centre it pulled the metal cables around mj she screamed as her body flew towards the fireball spiderman shot webbing at her and pulled her back from danger run he shouted to mj a metal arm lifted spiderman up and threw him to the floor ock then lifted him up by the foot a knife came out of one of the metal arms ock was going to kill spiderman spiderman shot webbing around the reactor cables and pulled as the cables touched one of the metal arms the energy from the fireball went into ock he flew back and crashed onto the floor at last spiderman pulled the cables out of the wall he looked at the reactor it was still going it didnt need the cables any more it was getting bigger and bigger doctor octavius called spiderman peter tried to think he showed his real face to otto peter parker smiled otto brilliant but lazy we must stop the reactor peter said i cant stop it said otto sadly i wont stop it you once told me we must use science for the good of the world these arms have changed you said peter dont listen to them peter was right otto knew that fusion was his dream but he was ready to leave his dream now listen to me now otto shouted at the arms listen to me at last he could control the metal arms now how do i stop the reactor asked peter tell me we cant stop it said otto butmaybethe river drop it in the river peter turned to the reactor but a metal arm caught him ill do it otto said peter turned to mj she almost cried when she saw the true face of spiderman it was peter now she understood everything suddenly there was a terrible noise above them a wall was falling towards mj she cried out and spiderman was there he stopped the wall with his back hi said peter this is really heavy peter was strong but he couldnt hold the wall much longer mj if we die he started to say you do love me mj finished his sentence for him i do peter gave one great push and threw the wall back then he jumped up with mj in his arms and they swung out of the building down below on the river otto stood alone with the reactor i wont die a bad man otto said to himself then the arms and the reactor fell deep into the river it was over peter and mj were in a spider web high above the river i think i always knew said mj then you know we cant be together people will always want to kill me if youre with spiderman youre always in danger i will always be spiderman you and i can never be together mj looked sadly into peters eyes then he gave her a line of webbing and he moved her slowly down to a boat below john jameson was there he ran up to mj and took her in his arms but mj was still looking at spiderman high above them epilogue mjs big day mj was wearing a long white dress it was her big day john and the jamesons were waiting in the church the music started and everyone turned to see mj but it wasnt mj it was her friend she walked up to john and gave him a message he read it and looked at his guests what could he do mj didnt want
